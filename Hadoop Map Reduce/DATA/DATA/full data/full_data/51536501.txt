51536501	cressy   by bret harte     cressy     chapter i   as the master of the indian spring school emerged from the pine woods into the little clearing before the schoolhouse he stopped whistling put his hat less jauntily on his head threw away some wild flowers he had gathered on his way and otherwise assumed the severe demeanor of his profession and his mature agewhich was at least twenty not that he usually felt this an assumption it was a firm conviction of his serious nature that he impressed others as he did himself with the blended austerity and ennui of deep and exhausted experience  the building which was assigned to him and his flock by the board of education of tuolumne county california had been originally a church it still bore a faded odor of sanctity mingled however with a later and slightly alcoholic breath of political discussion the result of its weekly occupation under the authority of the board as a tribune for the enunciation of party principles and devotion to the liberties of the people there were a few dogeared hymnbooks on the teachers desk and the blackboard but imperfectly hid an impassioned appeal to the citizens of indian spring to rally for stebbins as supervisor the master had been struck with the size of the black type in which this placard was printed and with a shrewd perception of its value to the round wandering eyes of his smaller pupils allowed it to remain as a pleasing example of orthography unfortunately although subdivided and spelt by them in its separate letters with painful and perfect accuracy it was collectively known as wally and its general import productive of vague hilarity  taking a large key from his pocket the master unlocked the door and threw it open stepping back with a certain precaution begotten of his experience in once finding a small but sociable rattlesnake coiled up near the threshold a slight disturbance which followed his intrusion showed the value of that precaution and the fact that the room had been already used for various private and peaceful gatherings of animated nature an irregular attendance of yellowbirds and squirrels dismissed themselves hurriedly through the broken floor and windows but a golden lizard stiffened suddenly into stony fright on the edge of an open arithmetic touched the heart of the master so strongly by its resemblance to some keptin and forgotten scholar who had succumbed over the task he could not accomplish that he was seized with compunction  recovering himself and reestablishing as it were the decorous discipline of the room by clapping his hands and saying sho he passed up the narrow aisle of benches replacing the forgotten arithmetic and picking up from the desks here and there certain fragmentary pieces of plaster and crumbling wood that had fallen from the ceiling as if this grove of academus had been shedding its leaves overnight when he reached his own desk he lifted the lid and remained for some moments motionless gazing into it his apparent meditation however was simply the combined reflection of his own features in a small pocketmirror in its recesses and a perplexing doubt in his mind whether the sacrifice of his budding moustache was not essential to the professional austerity of his countenance but he was presently aware of the sound of small voices light cries and brief laughter scattered at vague and remote distances from the schoolhousenot unlike the birds and squirrels he had just dispossessed he recognized by these signs that it was nine oclock and his scholars were assembling  they came in their usual desultory fashionthe fashion of country schoolchildren the world overirregularly spasmodically and always as if accidentally a few handinhand others driven ahead of or dropped behind their elders some in straggling groups more or less coherent and at times only connected by faroff intermediate voices scattered on a space of half a mile but never quite alone always preoccupied by something else than the actual business on hand appearing suddenly from ditches behind trunks and between fencerails cropping up in unexpected places along the road after vague and purposeless detoursseemingly going anywhere and everywhere but to school so unlookedfor in fact was their final arrival that the master who had a few moments before failed to descry a single torn straw hat or ruined sunbonnet above his visible horizon was always startled to find them suddenly under his windows as if like the birds they had alighted from the trees nor was their moral attitude towards their duty any the more varied they always arrived as if tired and reluctant with a doubting sulkiness that perhaps afterwards beamed into a charming hypocrisy but invariably temporizing with their instincts until the last moment and only relinquishing possible truancy on the very threshold even after they were marshalled on their usual benches they gazed at each other every morning with a perfectly fresh astonishment and a daily recurring enjoyment of some hidden joke in this tremendous rencontre  it had been the habit of the master to utilize these preliminary vagrancies of his little flock by inviting them on assembling to recount any interesting incident of their journey hither or failing this from their not infrequent shyness in expressing what had secretly interested them any event that had occurred within their knowledge since they last met he had done this partly to give them time to recover themselves in that more formal atmosphere and partly i fear because notwithstanding his conscientious gravity it greatly amused him it also diverted them from their usual roundeyed breathless contemplation of himselfa regular morning inspection which generally embraced every detail of his dress and appearance and made every change or deviation the subject of whispered comment or stony astonishment he knew that they knew him more thoroughly than he did himself and shrank from the intuitive vision of these small clairvoyants  well said the master gravely  there was the usual interval of bashful hesitation verging on nervous hilarity or hypocritical attention for the last six months this question by the master had been invariably received each morning as a veiled pleasantry which might lead to baleful information or conceal some query out of the dreadful books before him yet this very element of danger had its fascinations johnny filgee a small boy blushed violently and without getting up began hurriedly in a high key tige ith got and then suddenly subsided into a whisper  speak up johnny said the master encouragingly  please sir it aint anythin hes seednor any real news said rupert filgee his elder brother rising with family concern and frowning openly upon johnny its jest his foolishness he oughter be licked finding himself unexpectedly on his feet and apparently at the end of a long speech he colored also and then said hurriedly jimmy snyderhe seed suthin ask him and sat downa recognized hero  every eye including the masters was turned on jimmy snyder but that youthful observer instantly diving his head and shoulders into his desk remained there gurgling as if under water two or three nearest him endeavored with some struggling to bring him to an intelligible surface again the master waited patiently johnny filgee took advantage of the diversion to begin again in a high key tige ith got thix and subsided  come jimmy said the master with a touch of peremptoriness thus adjured jimmy snyder came up glowingly and bristling with full stops and exclamation points seed a black bar comin outer daves woods he said excitedly nigh to me ez you be n big ez a hoss n snarlin n snappinlike gosh kem alongkerclump torords me reckoned hed skeer me didnt skeer me worth a cent i heaved a rock at himi did now in defiance of murmurs of derisive commentn he slid ef hed kem up furder id hev up with my slate and swotted him over the snootbet your boots  the master here thought fit to interfere and gravely point out that the habit of striking bears as large as a horse with a schoolslate was equally dangerous to the slate which was also the property of tuolumne county and to the striker and that the verb to swot and the noun substantive snoot were likewise indefensible and not to be tolerated thus admonished jimmy snyder albeit unshaken in his faith in his own courage sat down  a slight pause ensued the youthful filgee taking advantage of it opened in a higher key tige ithbut the masters attention was here diverted by the searching eyes of octavia dean a girl of eleven who after the fashion of her sex preferred a personal recognition of her presence before she spoke succeeding in catching his eye she threw back her long hair from her shoulders with an easy habitual gesture rose and with a faint accession of color said  cressy mckinstry came home from sacramento mrs mckinstry told mother shes comin back here to school  the master looked up with an alacrity perhaps inconsistent with his cynical austerity seeing the young girl curiously watching him with an expectant smile he regretted it cressy mckinstry who was sixteen years old had been one of the pupils he had found at the school when he first came but as he had also found that she was there in the extraordinary attitude of being engaged to one seth davis a fellowpupil of nineteen and as most of the courtship was carried on freely and unceremoniously during schoolhours with the full permission of the masters predecessor the master had been obliged to point out to the parents of the devoted couple the embarrassing effects of this association on the discipline of the school the result had been the withdrawal of the lovers and possibly the goodwill of the parents the return of the young lady was consequently a matter of some significance had the masters protest been accepted or had the engagement itself been broken off  either was not improbable his momentary loss of attention was johnny filgees great gain  tige said johnny with sudden and alarming distinctness ith got thix pupthsmothly yaller  in the laugh which followed this long withheld announcement of an increase in the family of johnnys yellow and disreputable setter tiger who usually accompanied him to school and howled outside the master joined with marked distinctness then he said with equally marked severity books the little levee was ended and school began  it continued for two hours with short sighs corrugations of small foreheads the complaining cries and scratchings of slate pencils over slates and other signs of minor anguish among the more youthful of the flock and with more or less whisperings movements of the lips and unconscious soliloquy among the older pupils the master moved slowly up and down the aisle with a word of encouragement or explanation here and there stopping with his hands behind him to gaze abstractedly out of the windows to the wondering envy of the little ones a faint hum as of invisible insects gradually pervaded the school the more persistent droning of a large bee had become dangerously soporific the hot breath of the pines without had invaded the doors and windows the warped shingles and weatherboarding at times creaked and snapped under the rays of the vertical and unclouded sun a gentle perspiration broke out like a mild epidemic in the infant class little curls became damp brief lashes limp round eyes moist and small eyelids heavy the master himself started and awoke out of a perilous dream of other eyes and hair to collect himself severely for the irresolute halfembarrassed halflazy figure of a man had halted doubtingly before the porch and open door luckily the children who were facing the master with their backs to the entrance did not see it  yet the figure was neither alarming nor unfamiliar the master at once recognized it as ben dabney otherwise known as uncle ben a goodhumored but not overbright miner who occupied a small cabin on an unambitious claim in the outskirts of indian spring his avuncular title was evidently only an ironical tribute to his amiable incompetency and heavy goodnature for he was still a young man with no family ties and by reason of his singular shyness not even a visitor in the few families of the neighborhood as the master looked up he had an irritating recollection that ben had been already haunting him for the last two days alternately appearing and disappearing in his path to and from school as a more than usually reserved and bashful ghost this to the masters cynical mind clearly indicated that like most ghosts he had something of essentially selfish import to communicate catching the apparitions halfappealing eye he proceeded to exorcise it with a portentous frown and shake of the head that caused it to timidly wane and fall away from the porch only however to reappear and wax larger a few minutes later at one of the side windows the infant class hailing his appearance as a heavensent boon the master was obliged to walk to the door and command him sternly away when retreating to the fence he mounted the uppermost rail and drawing a knife from his pocket cut a long splinter from the rail and began to whittle it in patient and meditative silence but when recess was declared and the relieved feelings of the little flock had vent in the clearing around the schoolhouse the few who rushed to the spot found that uncle ben had already disappeared whether the appearance of the children was too inconsistent with his ghostly mission or whether his heart failed him at the last moment the master could not determine yet distasteful as the impending interview promised to be the master was vaguely and irritatingly disappointed  a few hours later when school was being dismissed the master found octavia dean lingering near his desk looking into the girls mischievous eyes he goodhumoredly answered their expectation by referring to her mornings news i thought miss mckinstry had been married by this time he said carelessly  octavia swinging her satchel like a censer as if she were performing some act of thurification over her completed tasks replied demurely oh no dear nonot that  so it would seem said the master  i reckon she never kalkilated to either continued octavia slyly looking up from the corner of her lashes  indeed  noshe was just funning with seth davisthats all  funning with him  yes sir kinder foolin him you know  kinder foolin him  for an instant the master felt it his professional duty to protest against this most unmaidenly and frivolous treatment of the matrimonial engagement but a second glance at the significant face of his youthful auditor made him conclude that her instinctive knowledge of her own sex could be better trusted than his imperfect theories he turned towards his desk without speaking octavia gave an extra swing to her satchel tossing it over her shoulder with a certain small coquettishness and moved towards the door as she did so the infant filgee from the safe vantage of the porch where he had lingered was suddenly impelled to a crowning audacity as if struck with an original idea but apparently addressing himself to space he cried out crethy mkinthry likth teacher and instantly vanished  putting these incidents sternly aside the master addressed himself to the task of setting a few copies for the next day as the voices of his departing flock faded from the porch presently a silence fell upon the little schoolhouse through the open door a cool restful breath stole gently as if nature were again stealthily taking possession of her own a squirrel boldly came across the porch a few twittering birds charging in stopped beat the air hesitatingly for a moment with their wings and fell back with bashfully protesting breasts aslant against the open door and the unlookedfor spectacle of the silent occupant then there was another movement of intrusion but this time human and the master looked up angrily to behold uncle ben  he entered with a slow exasperating step lifting his large boots very high and putting them down again softly as if he were afraid of some insecurity in the floor or figuratively recognized the fact that the pathways of knowledge were thorny and difficult reaching the masters desk and the ministering presence above it he stopped awkwardly and with the rim of his soft felt hat endeavored to wipe from his face the meek smile it had worn when he entered it chanced also that he had halted before the minute stool of the infant filgee and his large figure instantly assumed such brobdingnagian proportions in contrast that he became more embarrassed than ever the master made no attempt to relieve him but regarded him with cold interrogation  i reckoned he began leaning one hand on the masters desk with affected ease as he dusted his leg with his hat with the other i reckonedthat isi allowedi orter saythat id find ye alone at this time ye ginrally are ye know its a nice soothin restful stoodious time when a man kin so to speak run back on his eddication and think of all he ever knowed yere jist like me and ye see i sorter spotted your ways to onct  then why did you come here this morning and disturb the school demanded the master sharply  thats so i sorter slipped up thar didnt i said uncle ben with a smile of rueful assent you see i didnt allow to come in then but ony to hang round a leetle and kinder get used to it and it to me  used to what said the master impatiently albeit with a slight softening at his intruders penitent expression  uncle ben did not reply immediately but looked around as if for a seat tried one or two benches and a desk with his large hand as if testing their security and finally abandoning the idea as dangerous seated himself on the raised platform beside the masters chair having previously dusted it with the flap of his hat finding however that the attitude was not conducive to explanation he presently rose again and picking up one of the schoolbooks from the masters desk eyed it unskilfully upside down and then said hesitatingly  i reckon ye aint usin dobells rithmetic here  no said the master  thats bad pears to be played outthat dobell feller i was brought up on dobell and parsings grammar ye dont seem to be a using parsings grammar either  no said the master relenting still more as he glanced at uncle bens perplexed face with a faint smile  and i reckon youd be saying the same of jones stronomy and algebry things hev changed youve got all the new style here he continued with affected carelessness but studiously avoiding the masters eye for a man ez wos brought up on parsings dobell and jones thar dont appear to be much show nowadays  the master did not reply observing several shades of color chase each other on uncle bens face he bent his own gravely over his books the act appeared to relieve his companion who with his eyes still turned towards the window went on  ef youd had them bookswhich you haventi had it in my mind to ask you suthen i had an idea ofofsort of reviewing my eddication kinder going over the old books aginjist to pass the time sorter running in yer arter school hours and doin a little practisin eh you looking on me as an extry scholarand i payin ye as sichbut keepin it twixt ourselves you knowjust for a pastime eh  as the master smilingly raised his head he became suddenly and ostentatiously attracted to the window  them jay birds out there is mighty peart coming right up to the schoolhouse i reckon they think it sort o restful too  but if you really mean it couldnt you use these books uncle ben said the master cheerfully i dare say theres little differencethe principle is the same you know  uncle bens face which had suddenly brightened as suddenly fell he took the book from the masters hand without meeting his eyes held it at arms length turned it over and then laid it softly down upon the desk as if it were some excessively fragile article certingly he murmured with assumed reflective ease certingly the principles all there nevertheless he was quite breathless and a few beads of perspiration stood out upon his smooth blank forehead  and as to writing for instance continued the master with increasing heartiness as he took notice of these phenomena you know any copybook will do  he handed his pen carelessly to uncle ben the large hand that took it timidly not only trembled but grasped it with such fatal and hopeless unfamiliarity that the master was fain to walk to the window and observe the birds also  theyre mighty boldthem jays said uncle ben laying down the pen with scrupulous exactitude beside the book and gazing at his fingers as if he had achieved a miracle of delicate manipulation they dont seem to be afeared of nothing do they  there was another pause the master suddenly turned from the window i tell you what uncle ben he said with prompt decision and unshaken gravity the only thing for you to do is to just throw over dobell and parsons and jones and the old quill pen that i see youre accustomed to and start in fresh as if youd never known them forget em all you know it will be mighty hard of course to do that he continued looking out of the window but you must do it  he turned back the brightness that transfigured uncle bens face at that moment brought a slight moisture into his own eyes the humble seeker of knowledge said hurriedly that he would try  and begin again at the beginning continued the master cheerfully exactly like one of thosein fact as if you really were a child again  thats so said uncle ben rubbing his hands delightedly thats me why thats jest what i was sayin to roop  then youve already been talking about it intercepted the master in some surprise i thought you wanted it kept secret  well yes responded uncle ben dubiously but you see i sorter agreed with roop filgee that if you took to my ideas and didnt object id give him two bits every time hed kem here and help me of an arternoon when you was away and kinder stand guard around the schoolhouse you know so as to keep the fellows off and roops mighty sharp for a boy ye know        two bits i e twentyfive cents  the master reflected a moment and concluded that uncle ben was probably right rupert filgee who was a handsome boy of fourteen was also a strongly original character whose youthful cynicism and blunt honest temper had always attracted him he was a fair scholar with a possibility of being a better one and the proposed arrangement with uncle ben would not interfere with the discipline of school hours and might help them both nevertheless he asked goodhumoredly but couldnt you do this more securely and easily in your own house i might lend you the books you know and come to you twice a week  uncle bens radiant face suddenly clouded it wouldnt be exactly the same kind o game to me an roop he said hesitatingly you see thars the idea o the schoolhouse ye know and the restfulness and the quiet and the genral air o study and the boys around town ez wouldnt think nothin o trapsen into my cabin if they spotted what i was up to thar would never dream o hunting me here  very well said the master let it be here then observing that his companion seemed to be struggling with an inarticulate gratitude and an apparently inextricable buckskin purse in his pocket he added quietly ill set you a few copies to commence with and began to lay out a few unfinished examples of master johnny filgees scholastic achievements  after thanking you mr ford said uncle ben faintly ef youll jest kinder signify you know what you consider a fair  mr ford turned quickly and dexterously offered his hand to his companion in such a manner that he was obliged to withdraw his own from his pocket to grasp it in return youre very welcome said the master and as i can only permit this sort of thing gratuitously youd better not let me know that you propose giving anything even to rupert he shook uncle bens perplexed hand again briefly explained what he had to do and saying that he would now leave him alone a few minutes he took his hat and walked towards the door  then you reckon said uncle ben slowly regarding the work before him that id better jest chuck them dobell fellers overboard  i certainly should responded the master with infinite gravity  and sorter waltz in fresh like one them children  like a child nodded the master as he left the porch  a few moments later as he was finishing his cigar in the clearing he paused to glance in at the schoolroom window uncle ben stripped of his coat and waistcoat with his shirtsleeves rolled up on his powerful arms had evidently cast dobell and all misleading extraneous aid aside and with the perspiration standing out on his foolish forehead and his perplexed face close to the masters desk was painfully groping along towards the light in the tottering and devious tracks of master johnny filgee like a very child indeed     chapter ii   as the children were slowly straggling to their places the next morning the master waited for an opportunity to speak to rupert that beautiful but scarcely amiable youth was as usual surrounded and impeded by a group of his small female admirers for whom it is but just to add he had a supreme contempt possibly it was this healthy quality that inclined the master towards him and it was consequently with some satisfaction that he overheard fragments of his openly disparaging comments upon his worshippers  there to clarinda jones dont flop and dont you to octavia dean go on breathing over my head like that if theres anything i hate its having a girl breathing round me yes you were i felt it in my hair and you tooyoure always snoopin and snoodgin oh yes you want to know why ive got an extry copybook and another rithmetic miss curiosity well what would you give to know want to see if theyre pretty with infinite scorn at the adjective no they aint pretty thats all you girls think aboutwhats pretty and whats curious quit now come dont ye see teacher lookin at you aint you ashamed  he caught the masters beckoning eye and came forward slightly abashed with a flush of irritation still on his handsome face and his chestnut curls slightly rumpled one which octavia had covertly accented by twisting round her forefinger stood up like a crest on his head  ive told uncle ben that you might help him here after school hours said the master taking him aside you may therefore omit your writing exercise in the morning and do it in the afternoon  the boys dark eyes sparkled and if it would be all the same to you sir he added earnestly you might sorter give out in school that i was to be kept in  im afraid that would hardly do said the master much amused but why  ruperts color deepened so ez to keep them darned girls from foolin round me and followin me back here  we will attend to that said the master smiling a moment after he added more seriously i suppose your father knows that you are to receive money for this and he doesnt object  he oh no returned rupert with a slight look of astonishment and the same general suggestion of patronizing his progenitor that he had previously shown to his younger brother you neednt mind him in reality filgee pere a widower of two years standing had tacitly allowed the discipline of his family to devolve upon rupert remembering this the master could only say very well and goodnaturedly dismiss the pupil to his seat and the subject from his mind the last laggard had just slipped in the master had glanced over the occupied benches with his hand upon his warning bell when there was a quick step on the gravel a flutter of skirts like the sound of alighting birds and a young woman lightly entered  in the rounded untouched and untroubled freshness of her cheek and chin and the forward droop of her slender neck she appeared a girl of fifteen in her developed figure and the maturer drapery of her full skirts she seemed a woman in her combination of naive recklessness and perfect understanding of her person she was both in spite of a few schoolbooks that jauntily swung from a strap in her gloved hand she bore no resemblance to a pupil in her pretty gown of dotted muslin with bows of blue ribbon on the skirt and corsage and a cluster of roses in her belt she was as inconsistent and incongruous to the others as a fashionplate would have been in the dry and dogeared pages before them yet she carried it off with a demure mingling of the naivete of youth and the aplomb of a woman and as she swept down the narrow aisle burying a few small wondering heads in the overflow of her flounces there was no doubt of her reception in the arch smile that dimpled her cheek dropping a half curtsey to the master the only suggestion of her equality with the others she took her place at one of the larger desks and resting her elbow on the lid began to quietly remove her gloves it was cressy mckinstry  irritated and disturbed at the girls unceremonious entrance the master for the moment recognized her salutation coldly and affected to ignore her elaborate appearance the situation was embarrassing he could not decline to receive her as she was no longer accompanied by her lover nor could he plead entire ignorance of her broken engagement while to point out the glaring inappropriateness of costume would be a fresh interference he knew indian spring would scarcely tolerate he could only accept such explanation as she might choose to give he rang his bell as much to avert the directed eyes of the children as to bring the scene to a climax  she had removed her gloves and was standing up  i reckon i can go on where i left off she said lazily pointing to the books she had brought with her  for the present said the master dryly  the first class was called later when his duty brought him to her side he was surprised to find that she was evidently already prepared with consecutive lessons as if she were serenely unconscious of any doubt of her return and as coolly as if she had only left school the day before her studies were still quite elementary for cressy mckinstry had never been a brilliant scholar but he perceived with a cynical doubt of its permanency that she had bestowed unusual care upon her present performance there was moreover a certain defiance in it as if she had resolved to stop any objection to her return on the score of deficiencies he was obliged in selfdefence to take particular note of some rings she wore and a large bracelet that ostentatiously glittered on her white armwhich had already attracted the attention of her companions and prompted the audible comment from johnny filgee that it was truly gold without meeting her eyes he contented himself with severely restraining the glances of the children that wandered in her direction she had never been quite popular with the school in her previous role of fiancee and only octavia dean and one or two older girls appreciated its mysterious fascination while the beautiful rupert secure in his avowed predilection for the middleaged wife of the proprietor of the indian spring hotel looked upon her as a precocious chit with more than the usual propensity to objectionable breathing nevertheless the master was irritatingly conscious of her presencea presence which now had all the absurdity of her ridiculous loveexperiences superadded to it he tried to reason with himself that it was only a phase of frontier life which ought to have amused him but it did not the intrusion of this preposterous girl seemed to disarrange the discipline of his life as well as of his school the usual vague faroff dreams in which he was in the habit of indulging during schoolhours dreams that were perhaps superinduced by the remoteness of his retreat and a certain restful sympathy in his little auditors which had made himthe grownup dreameracceptable to them in his gentle understanding of their needs and weaknesses now seemed to have vanished forever  at recess octavia dean who had drawn near cressy and reached up to place her arm round the older girls waist glanced at her with a patronizing smile born of some rapid freemasonry and laughingly retired with the others the master at his desk and cressy who had halted in the aisle were left alone  i have had no intimation yet from your father or mother that you were coming back to school again he began but i suppose they have decided upon your return  an uneasy suspicion of some arrangement with her former lover had prompted the emphasis  the young girl looked at him with languid astonishment i reckon paw and maw aint no objection she said with the same easy ignoring of parental authority that had characterized rupert filgee and which seemed to be a local peculiarity maw did offer to come yer and see you but i told her she neednt bother  she rested her two hands behind her on the edge of a desk and leaned against it looking down upon the toe of her smart little shoe which was describing a small semicircle beyond the hem of her gown her attitude which was halfdefiant halfindolent brought out the pretty curves of her waist and shoulders the master noticed it and became a trifle more austere  then i am to understand that this is a permanent thing he asked coldly  whats that said cressy interrogatively  am i to understand that you intend coming regularly to school repeated the master curtly or is this merely an arrangement for a few daysuntil  oh said cressy comprehendingly lifting her unabashed blue eyes to his you mean that oh thats broke off yes she added contemptuously making a larger semicircle with her foot thats overthree weeks ago  and seth davisdoes he intend returning too  he she broke into a light girlish laugh i reckon not much slongs im here at least she had just lifted herself to a sitting posture on the desk so that her little feet swung clear of the floor in their saucy dance suddenly she brought her heels together and alighted so thats all she asked  yes  kin i go now  yes  she laid her books one on the top of the other and lingered an instant  been quite well she asked with indolent politeness  yesthank you  youre lookin right peart  she walked with a southern girls undulating languor to the door opened it then charged suddenly upon octavia dean twirled her round in a wild waltz and bore her away appearing a moment after on the playground demurely walking with her arm around her companions waist in an ostentatious confidence at once lofty exclusive and exasperating to the smaller children  when school was dismissed that afternoon and the master had remained to show rupert filgee how to prepare uncle bens tasks and had given his final instructions to his youthful vicegerent that irascible adonis unburdened himself querulously  is cressy mckinstry comin reglar mr ford  she is said the master dryly after a pause he asked why  ruperts curls had descended on his eyebrows in heavy discontent its mighty rough jest ez a feller reckons hes got quit of her and her jackass bo to hev her prancin back inter school agin and rigged out like ez if shed been to a fire in a milliners shop  you shouldnt allow your personal dislikes rupert to provoke you to speak of a fellowscholar in that wayand a young lady too corrected the master dryly  the woods is full o sich fellerscholars and sich young ladies if yer keer to go a gunning for em said rupert with dark and slangy significance ef id known she was comin back idhe stopped and brought his sunburnt fist against the seam of his trousers with a boyish gesture id hev jist  what said the master sharply  id hev played hookey till she left school agin it moutnt hev bin so long neither he added with a mysterious chuckle  that will do said the master peremptorily for the present youll attend to your duty and try to make uncle ben see youre something more than a foolish prejudiced schoolboy or he added significantly he and i may both repent our agreement let me have a good account of you both when i return  he took his hat from its peg on the wall and in obedience to a suddenly formed resolution left the schoolroom to call upon the parents of cressy mckinstry he was not quite certain what he should say but after his habit would trust to the inspiration of the moment at the worst he could resign a situation that now appeared to require more tact and delicacy than seemed consistent with his position and he was obliged to confess to himself that he had lately suspected that his present occupationthe temporary expedient of a poor but clever young man of twentywas scarcely bringing him nearer a realization of his daily dreams for mr jack ford was a youthful pilgrim who had sought his fortune in california so lightly equipped that even in the matter of kin and advisers he was deficient that prospective fortune had already eluded him in san francisco had apparently not waited for him in sacramento and now seemed never to have been at indian spring nevertheless when he was once out of sight of the schoolhouse he lit a cigar put his hands in his pockets and strode on with the cheerfulness of that youth to which all things are possible  the children had already dispersed as mysteriously and completely as they had arrived between him and the straggling hamlet of indian spring the landscape seemed to be without sound or motion the wooded upland or ridge on which the schoolhouse stood half a mile further on began to slope gradually towards the river on whose banks seen from that distance the town appeared to have been scattered irregularly or thrown together hastily as if cast ashore by some overflowthe cosmopolitan hotel drifting into the baptist church and dragging in its tail of wreckage two saloons and a blacksmiths shop while the county courthouse was stranded in solitary grandeur in a waste of gravel half a mile away the intervening flat was still gashed and furrowed by the remorseless engines of earlier goldseekers  mr ford was in little sympathy with this unsuccessful record of frontier endeavorthe fortune he had sought did not seem to lie in that directionand his eye glanced quickly beyond it to the pinecrested hills across the river whose primeval security was so near and yet so inviolable or back again to the trail he was pursuing along the ridge the latter prospect still retained its semisavage character in spite of the occasional suburban cottages of residents and the few outlying farms or ranches of the locality the grounds of the cottages were yet uncleared of underbrush bear and catamount still prowled around the rude fences of the ranches the late alleged experience of the infant snyder was by no means improbable or unprecedented  a light breeze was seeking the heated flat and river and thrilling the leaves around him with the strong vitality of the forest the vibrating crosslights and tremulous chequers of shade cast by the stirred foliage seemed to weave a fantastic net around him as he walked the quaint odors of certain woodland herbs known to his scholars and religiously kept in their desks or left like votive offerings on the threshold of the schoolhouse recalled all the primitive simplicity and delicious wildness of the little temple he had left even in the mischievous glances of evasive squirrels and the moist eyes of the contemplative rabbits there were faint suggestions of some of his own truants the woods were trembling with gentle memories of the independence he had always known hereof that sweet and grave retreat now so ridiculously invaded  he began to hesitate with one of those revulsions of sentiment characteristic of his nature why should he bother himself about this girl after all why not make up his mind to accept her as his predecessor had done why was it necessary for him to find her inconsistent with his ideas of duty to his little flock and his mission to them was he not assuming a sense of decorum that was open to misconception the absurdity of her school costume and any responsibility it incurred rested not with him but with her parents what right had he to point it out to them and above all how was he to do it he halted irresolutely at what he believed was his sober second thought but which like most reflections that take that flattering title was only a reaction as impulsive and illogical as the emotion that preceded it  mr mckinstrys snake rail fence was already discernible in the lighter opening of the woods not far from where he had halted as he stood there in hesitation the pretty figure and bright gown of cressy mckinstry suddenly emerged from a more secluded trail that intersected his own at an acute angle a few rods ahead of him she was not alone but was accompanied by a male figure whose arm she had evidently just dislodged from her waist he was still trying to resume his lost vantage she was as resolutely evading him with a certain nymphlike agility while the sound of her halflaughing halfirate protest could be faintly heard without being able to identify the face or figure of her companion at that distance he could see that it was not her former betrothed seth davis  a superior smile crossed his face he no longer hesitated but at once resumed his former path for some time cressy and her companion moved on quietly before him then on reaching the railfence they turned abruptly to the right were lost for an instant in the intervening thicket and the next moment cressy appeared alone crossing the meadow in a shorter cut towards the house having either scaled the fence or slipped through some familiar gap her companion had disappeared whether they had noticed that they were observed he could not determine he kept steadily along the trail that followed the line of fence to the lane that led directly to the farmbuilding and pushed open the front gate as cressys light dress vanished round an angle at the rear of the house  the house of the mckinstrys rose or rather stretched itself before him in all the lazy ungainliness of southwestern architecture a collection of temporary makeshifts of boards of logs of canvas prematurely decayed and in some instances abandoned for a newer erection or degraded to mere outhousesit presented with singular frankness the nomadic and tentative disposition of its founder it had been repaired without being improved its additions had seemed only to extend its primitive ugliness over a larger space its roofs were roughly shingled or rudely boarded and battened and the rafters of some of its leantos were simply covered with tarred canvas as if to settle any doubt of the impossibility of this heterogeneous mass ever taking upon itself any picturesque combination a small building of corrugated iron transported in sections from some remoter locality had been set up in its centre the mckinstry ranch had long been an eyesore to the master even that morning he had been mutely wondering from what convolution of that hideous chrysalis the bright butterfly cressy had emerged it was with a renewal of this curiosity that he had just seen her flutter back to it again  a yellow dog who had observed him hesitating in doubt where he should enter here yawned rose from the sunlight where he had been blinking approached the master with languid politeness and then turned towards the iron building as if showing him the way mr ford followed him cautiously painfully conscious that his hypocritical canine introducer was only availing himself of an opportunity to gain ingress into the house and was leading him as a responsible accomplice to probable exposure and disgrace his expectation was quickly realized a lazily querulous feminine outcry with the words yers that darned hound agin came from an adjacent room and his exposed and abashed companion swiftly retreated past him into the road again mr ford found himself alone in a plainlyfurnished sittingroom confronting the open door leading to another apartment at which the figure of a woman preceded hastily by a thrown dishcloth had just appeared it was mrs mckinstry her sleeves were rolled up over her red but still shapely arms and as she stood there wiping them on her apron with her elbows advanced and her closed hands raised alternately in the air there was an odd pugilistic suggestion in her attitude it was not lessened on her sudden discovery of the master by her retreating backwards with her hands up and her elbows still well forward as if warily retiring to an imaginary corner  mr ford at once tactfully stepped back from the doorway i beg your pardon he said delicately addressing the opposite wall but i found the door open and i followed the dog  thats just one of his pizenous tricks responded mrs mckinstry dolefully from within ony last week he let in a chinaman and in the natral hustlin that follered he managed to help himself outer the pork barl there aint no shade o cussedness that ornary hound aint up to yet notwithstanding this ominous comparison she presently made her appearance with her sleeves turned down her black woollen dress tidied and a smile of fatigued but not unkindly welcome and protection on her face dusting a chair with her apron and placing it before the master she continued maternally now that youre here set ye right down and make yourself to home my men folks are all out o door but some of ems sure to happen in soon for suthin that day aint yet created that they dont come huntin up mammy mckinstry every five minutes for this thing or that  the glow of a certain hard pride burned through the careworn languor of her brown cheek what she had said was strangely true this rawboned woman before him although scarcely middleaged had for years occupied a selfimposed maternal and protecting relation not only to her husband and brothers but to the three or four men who as partners or hired hands lived at the ranch an inherited and trained sympathy with what she called her boyss and her men folk and their needs had partly unsexed her she was a fair type of a class not uncommon on the southwestern frontier women who were ruder helpmeets of their rude husbands and brothers who had shared their privations and sufferings with surly masculine endurance rather than feminine patience women who had sent their loved ones to hopeless adventure or terrible vendetta as a matter of course or with partisan fury who had devotedly nursed the wounded to keep alive the feud or had received back their dead dryeyed and revengeful small wonder that cressy mckinstry had developed strangely under this sexless relationship looking at the mother albeit not without a certain respect mr ford found himself contrasting her with the daughters graceful femininity and wondering where in cressys youthful contour the possibility of the grim figure before him was even now hidden  hiram allowed to go over to the schoolhouse and see you this mornin said mrs mckinstry after a pause but i reckon ez how he had to look up stock on the river the cattle are that wild this time o year huntin water and hangin round the tules that my men are nigh worrited out o their butes with em hank and jim aint been off their mustangs since sun up and hiram what with partrollen the west boundary all night watchin stakes whar them low down harrisons hev been trespassinhasnt put his feet to the ground in fourteen hours mebbee you noticed hiram ez you kem along ef so ye didnt remember what kind o shootin irons he had with him i see his rifle over yon like ez not hez only got his sixshooter and them harrisons are mean enough to lay for him at long range but she added returning to the less important topic i spose cressy came all right  yes said the master hopelessly  i reckon she looked so continued mrs mckinstry with tolerant abstraction she allowed to do herself credit in one of them new store gownds that she got at sacramento at least thats what some of our men said late years i aint kept tech with the fashions myself she passed her fingers explanatorily down the folds of her own coarse gown but without regret or apology  she seemed well prepared in her lessons said the master abandoning for the moment that criticism of his pupils dress which he saw was utterly futile but am i to understand that she is coming regularly to schoolthat she is now perfectly free to give her entire attention to her studiesthatthatherengagement is broken off  why didnt she tell ye echoed mrs mckinstry in languid surprise  she certainly did said the master with slight embarrassment but  ef she said so interrupted mrs mckinstry abstractedly she oughter know and you kin tie to what she says  but as im responsible to parents and not to scholars for the discipline of my school returned the young man a little stiffly i thought it my duty to hear it from you  thats so said mrs mckinstry meditatively then i reckon youd better see hiram that ar seth davis engagement was a matter of hern and her fathers and not in my line i spose that hiram natrally allows to set the thing square to you and inquirin friends  i hope you understand said the master slightly resenting the classification that my reason for inquiring about the permanency of your daughters attendance was simply because it might be necessary to arrange her studies in a way more suitable to her years perhaps even to suggest to you that a young ladies seminary might be more satisfactory  sartain sartain interrupted mrs mckinstry hurriedly but whether from evasion of annoying suggestion or weariness of the topic the master could not determine youd better speak to hiram about it ony she hesitated slightly ez hes got now sorter set and pinted towards your school and is a trifle worrited with stock and them harrisons ye might tech it lightly he oughter be along yer now i cant think what keeps him her eye wandered again with troubled preoccupation to the corner where her husbands sharps rifle stood suddenly she raised her voice as if forgetful of mr fords presence  o cressy  o maw  the response came from the inner room the next moment cressy appeared at the door with an odd halflazy defiance in her manner which the master could not understand except upon the hypothesis that she had been listening she had already changed her elaborate toilet for a long clinging coarse blue gown that accented the graceful curves of her slight petticoatless figure nodding her head towards the master she said howdy and turned to her mother who practically ignored their personal acquaintance cressy she said dads gone and left his sharps yer dye mind takin it along to meet him afore he passes the boundary corner ye might tell him the teachers yer wantin to see him  one moment said the master as the young girl carelessly stepped to the corner and lifted the weapon let me take it its all on my way back to school and ill meet him  mrs mckinstry looked perturbed cressy opened her clear eyes on the master with evident surprise no mr ford said mrs mckinstry with her former maternal manner yed better not mix yourself up with these yer doins yeve no call to do it and cressy has its all in the family but its outer your line and them harrison whelps go to your school fancy the teacher takin weppins betwixt and between  its fitter work for the teacher than for one of his scholars and a young lady at that said mr ford gravely as he took the rifle from the hands of the halfamused halfreluctant girl its quite safe with me and i promise i shall deliver it into mr mckinstrys hands and none other  perhaps it wouldnt be ez likely to be ginrally noticed ez it would if one of us carried it murmured mrs mckinstry in confidential abstraction gazing at her daughter sublimely unconscious of the presence of a third party  youre quite right said the master composedly throwing the rifle over his shoulder and turning towards the door so ill say goodafternoon and try and find your husband  mrs mckinstry constrainedly plucked at the folds of her coarse gown yell like a drink afore ye go she said in an illconcealed tone of relief i clean forgot my manners cressy fetch out that demijohn  not for me thank you returned mr ford smiling  oh i seeyoure temperance natrally said mrs mckinstry with a tolerant sigh  hardly that returned the master i follow no rule i drink sometimesbut not today  mrs mckinstrys dark face contracted dont you see maw struck in cressy quickly teacher drinks sometimes but he dont use whiskey thats all  her mothers face relaxed cressy slipped out of the door before the master and preceded him to the gate when she had reached it she turned and looked into his face  what did maw say to yer about seein me just now  i dont understand you  to your seein me and joe masters on the trail  she said nothing  humph said cressy meditatively what was it you told her about it  nothing  then you didnt see us  i saw you with some onei dont know whom  and you didnt tell maw  i did not it was none of my business  he instantly saw the utter inconsistency of this speech in connection with the reason he believed he had in coming but it was too late to recall it and she was looking at him with a bright but singular expression  that joe masters is the conceitedest fellow goin i told him you could see his foolishness  ah indeed  mr ford pushed open the gate as the girl still lingered he was obliged to hold it a moment before passing through  maw couldnt quite hitch on to your not drinkin she reckons youre like everybody else about yer thats where she slips up on you and everybody else i kalkilate  i suppose shes somewhat anxious about your father and i dare say is expecting me to hurry returned the master pointedly  oh dads all right said cressy mischievously youll come across him over yon in the clearing but youre looking right purty with that gun it kinder sets you off you oughter wear one  the master smiled slightly said goodby and took leave of the girl but not of her eyes which were still following him even when he had reached the end of the lane and glanced back at the rambling dwelling she was still leaning on the gate with one foot on the lower rail and her chin cupped in the hollow of her hand she made a slight gesture not clearly intelligible at that distance it might have been a mischievous imitation of the way he had thrown the gun over his shoulder it might have been a wafted kiss  the master however continued his way in no very selfsatisfied mood although he did not regret having taken the place of cressy as the purveyor of lethal weapons between the belligerent parties he knew he was tacitly mingling in the feud between people for whom he cared little or nothing it was true that the harrisons sent their children to his school and that in the fierce partisanship of the locality this simple courtesy was open to misconstruction but he was more uneasily conscious that this mission so far as mrs mckinstry was concerned was a miserable failure the strange relations of the mother and daughter perhaps explained much of the girls conduct but it offered no hope of future amelioration would the father worrited by stock and boundary quarrelsa man in the habit of cutting gordian knots with a bowie knifeprove more reasonable was there any nearer sympathy between father and daughter but she had said he would meet mckinstry in the clearing she was right for here he was coming forward at a gallop     chapter iii   when within a dozen paces of the master mckinstry scarcely checking his mustang threw himself from the saddle and with a sharp cut of his riata on the animals haunches sent him still galloping towards the distant house then with both hands deeply thrust in the side pockets of his long loose linen coat he slowly lounged with clanking spurs towards the young man he was thickset of medium height densely and reddishly bearded with heavylidded pale blue eyes that wore a look of drowsy pain and after their first wearied glance at the master seemed to rest anywhere but on him  your wife was sending you your rifle by cressy said the master but i offered to bring it myself as i thought it scarcely a proper errand for a young lady here it is i hope you didnt miss it before and dont require it now he added quietly  mr mckinstry took it in one hand with an air of slightly embarrassed surprise rested it against his shoulder and then with the same hand and without removing the other from his pocket took off his soft felt hat showed a bullethole in its rim and returned lazily its about half an hour late but them harrisons reckoned i was fixed for em and war too narvous to draw a clear bead on me  the moment was evidently not a felicitous one for the masters purpose but he was determined to go on he hesitated an instant when his companion who seemed to be equally but more sluggishly embarrassed in a moment of preoccupied perplexity withdrew from his pocket his right hand swathed in a bloodstained bandage and following some instinctive habit attempted as if reflectively to scratch his head with two stiffened fingers  you are hurt said the master genuinely shocked and here i am detaining you  i had my hand upso explained mckinstry with heavy deliberation and the ball raked off my little finger after it went through my hat but that aint what i wanted to say when i stopped ye i aint just kam enough yet he apologized in the calmest manner and i clean forgit myself he added with perfect selfpossession but i was kalkilatin to ask youhe laid his bandaged hand familiarly on the masters shoulderif cressy kem all right  perfectly said the master but shant i walk on home with you and we can talk together after your wound is attended to  and she looked purty continued mckinstry without moving  very  and you thought them new store gownds of hers right peart  yes said the master perhaps a little too fine for the school you know he added insinuatingly and  not for hernot for her interrupted mckinstry i reckon thars more whar that cam from ye neednt fear but that she kin keep up that gait ez long ez hiram mckinstry hez the runnin of her  mr ford gazed hopelessly at the hideous ranch in the distance at the sky and the trail before him then his glance fell upon the hand still upon his shoulder and he struggled with a final effort at another time id like to have a long talk with you about your daughter mr mckinstry  talk on said mckinstry putting his wounded hand through the masters arm i admire to hear you youre that kam it does me good  nevertheless the master was conscious that his own arm was scarcely as firm as his companions it was however useless to draw back now and with as much tact as he could command he relieved his mind of its purpose addressing the obtruding bandage before him he dwelt upon cressys previous attitude in the school the danger of any relapse the necessity of her having a more clearly defined position as a scholar and even the advisability of her being transferred to a more advanced school with a more mature teacher of her own sex this is what i wished to say to mrs mckinstry today he concluded but she referred me to you  in course in course said mckinstry nodding complacently shes a good woman in and around the ranch and in any doins o this kind he lightly waved his wounded arm in the air there aint a better tho i say it she was blair rawlins darter she and her brother clay bein the only ones that kem out safe arter their twenty years fight with the mcentees in west kaintuck but she dont understand gals ez you and me do not that im much ez i orter be more kam and the old woman jest sized the hull thing when she said she hadnt any hand in cressys engagement no more she had and ez far ez that goes no more did me nor seth davis nor cressy he paused and lifting his heavylidded eyes to the master for the second time said reflectively ye mustnt mind my tellin yeez betwixt man and manthat the one ez is most responsible for the makin and breakin o that engagement is you  me said the master in utter bewilderment  you repeated mckinstry quietly reinstalling the hand ford had attempted to withdraw i aint sayin ye either knowd it or kalkilated on it but it war so ef yed hark to me and meander on a little ill tell ye how it war i dont mind walkin a piece your way for if we go towards the ranch and the hounds see me theyll set up a racket and bring out the old woman and then goodby to any confidential talk betwixt you and me and im somehow kammer out yer  he moved slowly down the trail still holding fords arm confidentially although owing to his large protecting manner he seemed to offer a ridiculous suggestion of supporting him with his wounded member  when you first kem to injin spring he began seth and cressy was goin to school boy and girl like and nothin more theyd known each other from babiesthe davises bein our neighbors in kaintuck and emigraten with us from st joe seth mout hev cottoned to cress and cress to him in course o time and there wasnt anythin betwixt the families to hev kept em from marryin when they wanted but there never war any words passed and no engagement  but interrupted ford hastily my predecessor mr martin distinctly told me that there was and that it was with your permission  thats only because you noticed suthin the first day you looked over the school with martin dad sez cress to me that new teachers very peart and hes that keen about noticin me and seth that i reckon youd better giv out that were engaged but are you sez i itll come to that in the end sez cress and if that yer teacher hez come here with northern ideas o society its just ez well to let him see injin spring aint entirely in the woods about them things either so i agreed and martin told you it was all right cress and seth was an engaged couple and you was to take no notice and then you ups and objects to the hull thing and allows that courtin in school even among engaged pupils aint proper  the master turned his eyes with some uneasiness to the face of cressys father it was heavy but impassive  i dont mind tellin you now that its over what happened the trouble with me mr ford isi aint kam and you air and thats what got me for when i heard what youd said i got on that mustang and started for the schoolhouse to clean you out and giv you five minutes to leave injin spring i dont know ez you remember that day id kalkilated my time so ez to ketch ye comin out o school but i was too airly i hung around out o sight and then hitched my hoss to a buckeye and peeped inter the winder to hev a good look at ye it was very quiet and kam there was squirrels over the roof yellowjackets and bees dronin away and kinder sleepinglike all around in the air and jaybirds twitterin in the shingles and they never minded me you were movin up and down among them little gals and boys liftin up their heads and talkin to em softly and quiet like ez if you was one of them yourself and they looked contented and kam and oncti dont know if you remember ityou kem close up to the winder with your hands behind you and looked out so kam and quiet and so far off ez if everybody else outside the school was miles away from you it kem to me then that id given a heap to hev had the old woman see you thar it kem to me mr ford that there wasnt any place for me thar and it kem to me tooand a little rough likethat mebbee there wasnt any place there for my cress either so i rode away without disturbin you nor the birds nor the squirrels talkin with cress that night she said ez how it was a fair sample of what happened every day and that youd always treated her fair like the others so she allowed that shed go down to sacramento and get some things agin her and seth bein married next month and she reckoned she wouldnt trouble you nor the school agin hark till ive done mr ford he continued as the young man made a slight movement of deprecation well i agreed but arter she got to sacramento and bought some fancy fixins she wrote to me and sez ez how shed been thinkin the hull thing over and she reckoned that she and seth were too young to marry and the engagement had better be broke and i broke it for her  but how asked the bewildered master  ginrally with this gun returned mckinstry with slow gravity indicating the rifle he was carrying for i aint kam i let on to seths father that if i ever found seth and cressy together again id shoot him it made a sort o coolness betwixt the families and hez given some comfort to them lowdown harrisons but even the law i reckon recognizes a fathers rights and ez cress sez now ez seths out o the way thar aint no reason why she cant go back to school and finish her eddication and i reckoned she was right and we both agreed that ez shed left school to git them store clothes it was only fair that shed give the school the benefit of em  the case seemed more hopeless than ever the master knew that the man beside him might hardly prove as lenient to a second objection at his hand but that very reason perhaps impelled him now that he knew his danger to consider it more strongly as a duty and his pride revolted from a possible threat underlying mckinstrys confidences nevertheless he began gently  but you are quite sure you wont regret that you didnt avail yourself of this broken engagement and your daughters outfitto send her to some larger boardingschool in sacramento or san francisco dont you think she may find it dull and soon tire of the company of mere children when she has already known the excitement ofhe was about to say a lover but checked himself and added a young girls freedom  mr ford returned mckinstry with the slow and fatuous misconception of a oneideaed man when i said just now that lookin inter that kam peaceful school of yours i didnt find a place for cress it warnt because i didnt think she oughter hev a place thar thar was that thar wot she never had ez a little girl with me and the old woman and that she couldnt find ez a grownd up girl in any boardingschoolthe home of a child that kind o innocent foolishness that i sometimes reckon must hev slipped outer our emigrant wagon comin across the plains or got left behind at st joe she was a grownd girl fit to marry afore she was a child she had young fellers asparkin her afore she ever played with em ez boy and girl i dont mind tellin you that it wernt in the natur of blair rawlins darter to teach her own darter any better for all shes been a mighty help to me so if its all the same to you mr ford we wont talk about a grownd up school id rather cress be a little girl again among them other children i should be a powerful sight more kam if i knowed that when i was away huntin stock or fightin stakes with them harrisons that she was a settin there with them and the birds and the bees and listenin to them and to you mebbee theres been a little too many scrimmages goin on round the ranch sence shes been a child mebbee she orter know suthin more of a man than a feller who sparks her and fights for her  the master was silent had this dull narrowminded partisan stumbled upon a truth that had never dawned upon his own broader comprehension had this selfish savage and literally redhanded frontier brawler been moved by some dumb instinct of the power of gentleness to understand his daughters needs better than he for a moment he was staggered then he thought of cressys later flirtations with joe masters and her concealment of their meeting from her mother had she deceived her father also or was not the father deceiving him with this alternate suggestion of threat and of kindlinessof power and weakness he had heard of this cruel phase of southwestern cunning before with the feeble sophistry of the cynic he mistrusted the good his scepticism could not understand howbeit glancing sideways at the slumbering savagery of the man beside him and his wounded hand he did not care to show his lack of confidence he contented himself with that equally feeble resource of weak humanity in such casesgoodnatured indifference all right he said carelessly ill see what can be done but are you quite sure you are fit to go home alone shall i accompany you as mckinstry waived the suggestion with a gesture he added lightly as if to conclude the interview ill report progress to you from time to time if you like  to me emphasized mckinstry not over thar indicating the ranch but prhaps you wouldnt mind my ridin by and lookin in at the schoolroom winder onct in a while ahyou would he added with the first deepening of color he had shown well never mind  you see it might distract the children from their lessons explained the master gently who had however contemplated with some concern the infinite delight which a glimpse of mckinstrys fiery and fatuous face at the window would awaken in johnny filgees infant breast  well no matter returned mckinstry slowly ye dont keer i spose to come over to the hotel and take suthin a julep or a smash  i shouldnt think of keeping you a moment longer from mrs mckinstry said the master looking at his companions wounded hand thank you all the same goodby  they shook hands mckinstry transferring his rifle to the hollow of his elbow to offer his unwounded left the master watched him slowly resume his way towards the ranch then with a half uneasy and half pleasurable sense that he had taken some step whose consequences were more important than he would at present understand he turned in the opposite direction to the schoolhouse he was so preoccupied that it was not until he had nearly reached it that he remembered uncle ben with an odd recollection of mckinstrys previous performance he approached the school from the thicket in the rear and slipped noiselessly to the open window with the intention of looking in but the schoolhouse far from exhibiting that kam and studious abstraction which had so touched the savage breast of mckinstry was filled with the accents of youthful and unrestrained vituperation the voice of rupert filgee came sharply to the masters astonished ears  you neednt try to play off dobell or mitchell on meyou hear much you know of either dont you look at that copy if johnny couldnt do better than that id lick him of course its the penit aint your stodgy fingersoh no praps youd like to hev a few more boxes o quills and gold pens and gillotts best thrown in for two bits a lesson i tell you what ill throw up the contract in another minit there goes another quill busted look here what you want aint a pen but a clothespin and a split nail thatll about jibe with your dilikit gait  the master at once stepped to the window and unobserved took a quick survey of the interior following some ingenious idea of his own regarding fitness the beautiful filgee had induced uncle ben to seat himself on the floor before one of the smallest desks presumably his brothers in an attitude which while it certainly gave him considerable elbowroom for those contortions common to immature penmanship offered his youthful instructor a superior eminence from which he hovered occasionally swooping down upon his grownup pupil like a mischievous but graceful jay but mr fords most distinct impression was that far from resenting the derogatory position and the abuse that accompanied it uncle ben not only beamed upon his persecutor with unquenchable good humor but with undisguised admiration and showed not the slightest inclination to accept his proposed resignation  go slow roop he said cheerfully you was onct a boy yourself natrally i kalkilate to stand all the damages youve got ter waste some powder over a blast like this yer way down to the bed rock next time ill bring my own pens  do some from the dobell school you uster go to suggested the darkly ironical rupert they was ironclad injinrubber warnt they  never you mind wot they were said uncle ben goodhumoredly look at that string of cs in that line theres nothing mean about them  he put his pen between his teeth raised himself slowly on his legs and shading his eyes with his hand from the severe perspective of six feet gazed admiringly down upon his work rupert with his hands in his pockets and his back to the window cynically assisted at the inspection  wots that sick worm at the bottom of the page he asked  wot might you think it wos said uncle ben beamingly  looks like one o them snake roots you dig up with a little mud stuck to it returned rupert critically  thats my name  they both stood looking at it with their heads very much on one side it aint so bad as the rest youve done it might be your name that ez it dont look like anythin else suggested rupert struck with a new idea that it was perhaps more professional occasionally to encourage his pupil you might get on in course o time but what are you doin all this for he asked suddenly  doin what  this yer comin to school when you aint sent and you aint got no call to goyou a grownup man  the color deepened in uncle bens face to the back of his ears wot would you giv to know roop spose i reckoned some day to make a strike and sorter drop inter saciety easyeh spose i wanted to be ready to keep up my end with the other fellers when the time kem to be able to sling potry and read novels and sicheh  an expression of infinite and unutterable scorn dawned in the eyes of rupert you do well he repeated with slow and cutting deliberation ill tell you what youre comin here for and the only thing that makes you come  what  itssomegirl  uncle ben broke into a boisterous laugh that made the roof shake stamping about and slapping his legs till the crazy floor trembled but at that moment the master stepped to the perch and made a quiet but discomposing entrance     chapter iv   the return of miss cressida mckinstry to indian spring and her interrupted studies was an event whose effects were not entirely confined to the school the broken engagement itself seemed of little moment in the general estimation compared to her resumption of her old footing as a scholar a few illnatured elders of her own sex and naturally exempt from the discriminating retort of mr mckinstrys shotgun alleged that the seminary at sacramento had declined to receive her but the majority accepted her return with local pride as a practical compliment to the educational facilities of indian spring the tuolumne star with a breadth and eloquence touchingly disproportionate to its actual size and quality of type and paper referred to the possible growth of a grove of academus at indian spring under whose cloistered boughs future sages and statesmen were now meditating in a way that made the master feel exceedingly uncomfortable for some days the trail between the mckinstrys ranch and the schoolhouse was lightly patrolled by reliefs of susceptible young men to whom the enfranchised cressida relieved from the dangerous supervision of the davismckinstry clique was an object of ambitious admiration the young girl herself who in spite of the masters annoyance seemed to be following some conscientious duty in consecutively arraying herself in the different dresses she had bought however she may have tantalized her admirers by this revelation of bridal finery did not venture to bring them near the limits of the playground it struck the master with some surprise that indian spring did not seem to trouble itself in regard to his own privileged relations with its rustic enchantress the young men clearly were not jealous of him no matron had suggested any indecorum in a young girl of cressys years and antecedents being intrusted to the teachings of a young man scarcely her senior notwithstanding the attitude which mr ford had been pleased to assume towards her this implied compliment to his supposed monastic vocations affected him almost as uncomfortably as the stars extravagant eulogium he was obliged to recall certain foolish experiences of his own to enable him to rise superior to this presumption of his asceticism  in pursuance of his promise to mckinstry he had procured a few elementary books of study suitable to cressys new position without however taking her out of the smaller classes or the discipline of the school in a few weeks he was enabled to further improve her attitude by making her a monitor over the smaller girls thereby dividing certain functions with rupert filgee whose ministrations to the deceitful and silly sex had been characterized by perhaps more vigilant scorn and disparagement than was necessary cressy had accepted it as she had accepted her new studies with an indolent goodhumor and at times a frankly supreme ignorance of their abstract or moral purpose that was discouraging whats the good of that she would ask lifting her eyes abruptly to the master mr ford somewhat embarrassed by her look which always sooner or later frankly confessed itself an excuse for a perfectly irrelevant examination of his features in detail would end in giving her some severely practical answer yet if the subject appealed to any particular idiosyncrasy of her own she would speedily master the study a passing predilection for botany was provoked by a single incident the master deeming this study a harmless youngladylike occupation had one day introduced the topic at recess and was met by the usual answer but suppose he continued artfully somebody sent you anonymously some flowers  her ho suggested johnny filgee hoarsely with bold bad recklessness ignoring the remark and the kick with which rupert had resented it on the person of his brother the master continued  and if you couldnt find out who sent them you would want at least to know what they were and where they grew  ef they grew anywhere bout yer we could tell her that said a chorus of small voices  the master hesitated he was conscious of being on delicate ground he was surrounded by a dozen pairs of little keen eyes from whom nature had never yet succeeded in hiding her secretseyes that had waited for and knew the coming up of the earliest flowers little fingers that had never turned the pages of a textbook but knew where to scrape away the dead leaves above the first anemone or had groped painfully among the lifeless branches in forgotten hollows for the shy dogrose unguided little feet that had instinctively made their way to remote southern slopes for the first mariposas or had unerringly threaded the tulehidden banks of the river for flowerdeluce convinced that he could not hold his own on their level he shamelessly struck at once above it  suppose that one of those flowers he continued was not like the rest that its stalks and leaves instead of being green and soft were white and stringy like flannel as if to protect it from cold wouldnt it be nice to be able to say at once that it had lived only in the snow and that some one must have gone all that way up there above the snow line to pick it the children taken aback by this unfair introduction of a floral stranger were silent cressy thoughtfully accepted botany on those possibilities a week later she laid on the masters desk a limplooking plant with a stalk like heavy frayed worsted yarn it aint much to look at after all is it she said i reckon i could cut a better one with scissors outer an old cloth jacket of mine  and you found it here asked the master in surprise  i got masters to look for it when he was on the summit i described it to him i didnt allow he had the gumption to get it but he did  although botany languished slightly after this vicarious effort it kept cressy in fresh bouquets and extending its gentle influence to her friends and acquaintances became slightly confounded with horticulture led to the planting of one or two gardens and was accepted in school as an implied concession to berries apples and nuts in reading and writing cressy greatly improved with a marked decrease in grammatical solecisms although she still retained certain characteristic words and always her own slow southwestern half musical intonation this languid deliberation was particularly noticeable in her reading aloud and gave the studied and measured rhetoric a charm of which her careless colloquial speech was incapable even the fifth reader with its imposing passages from the english classics carefully selected with a view of paralyzing small hesitating or hurried voices in cressys hands became no longer an unintelligible incantation she had quietly mastered the difficulties of pronunciation by some instinctive sense of euphony if not of comprehension the master with his eyes closed hardly recognized his pupil whether or not she understood what she read he hesitated to inquire no doubt as with her other studies she knew what attracted her rupert filgee a sympathetic if not always a correct reader who boldly took four and five syllabled fences flying only to come to grief perhaps in the ditch of some rhetorical pause beyond alone expressed his scorn of her performance octavia dean torn between her hopeless affection for this beautiful but inaccessible boy and her soulfriendship for this bigger but manyfrocked girl studied the masters face with watchful anxiety  it is needless to say that hiram mckinstry was in the intervals of stakedriving and stockhunting heavily contented with this latest evidence of his daughters progress he even intimated to the master that her reading being an accomplishment that could be exercised at home was conducive to that kam in which he was so deficient it was also rumored that cressys oral rendering of addisons reflections in westminster abbey and burkes indictment of warren hastings had beguiled him one evening from improving an opportunity to plug one of harrisons boundary raiders  the master shared in cressys glory in the public eye but although mrs mckinstry did not materially change her attitude of tolerant goodnature towards him he was painfully conscious that she looked upon her daughters studies and her husbands interests in them as a weakness that might in course of time produce infirmity of homicidal purpose and become enervating of eye and triggerfinger and when mr mckinstry got himself appointed as schooltrustee and was thereby obliged to mingle with certain eastern settlerscolleagues on the boardthis possible weakening of the old sharply drawn sectional line between yanks and themselves gave her grave doubts of hirams physical stamina  the old mans worrits hev sorter shook out a little of his sand she had explained on those evenings when he attended the board she sought higher consolation in prayer meeting at the southern baptist church in whose exercises her northern and eastern neighbors thinly disguised as baal and astaroth were generally overthrown and their temples made desolate  if uncle bens progress was slower it was no less satisfactory without imagination and even without enthusiasm he kept on with a dull laborious persistency when the irascible impatience of rupert filgee at last succumbed to the obdurate slowness of his pupil the master himself touched by uncle bens perspiring forehead and perplexed eyebrows often devoted the rest of the afternoon to a gentle elucidation of the mysteries before him setting copies for his heavy hand or even guiding it with his own like a childs across the paper at times the appalling uselessness of uncle bens endeavors reminded him of ruperts taunting charge was he really doing this from a genuine thirst for knowledge it was inconsistent with all that indian spring knew of his antecedents and his present ambitions he was a simple miner without scientific or technical knowledge his already slight acquaintance with arithmetic and the scrawl that served for his signature were more than sufficient for his needs yet it was with this latter signmanual that he seemed to take infinite pains the master one afternoon thought fit to correct the apparent vanity of this performance  if you took as much care in trying to form your letters according to copy youd do better your signature is fair enough as it is  but it dont look right mr ford said uncle ben eying it distrustfully somehow it aint all there  why certainly it is look d a b n e ynot very plain its true but there are all the letters  thats just it mr ford them aint all the letters that orter be there ive allowed to write it d a b n e y to save time and ink but it orter read daubigny said uncle ben with painful distinctness  but that spells daubigny  it are  is that your name  i reckon  the master looked at uncle ben doubtfully was this only another form of the dobell illusion was your father a frenchman he asked finally  uncle ben paused as if to recall the trifling circumstances of his fathers nationality no  your grandfather  i reckon not at least ye couldnt prove it by me  was your father or grandfather a voyageur or trapper or canadian  they were from pike county mizzoori  the master regarded uncle ben still dubiously but you call yourself dabney what makes you think your real name is daubigny  thats the way it uster be writ in letters to me in the states hold on ill show ye he deliberately began to feel in his pockets finally extracting his old purse from which he produced a crumpled envelope and carefully smoothing it out compared it with his signature  thar you see its the samedaubigny  the master hesitated after all it was not impossible he recalled other instances of the singular transformation of names in the californian emigration yet he could not help saying then you concluded daubigny was a better name than dabney  do you think its better  women might i dare say your wife would prefer to be called mrs daubigny rather than dabney  the chance shot told uncle ben suddenly flushed to his ears  i didnt think o that he said hurriedly i had another idee i reckoned that on the matter o holdin property and passin in money it would be better to hev your name put on the square and to sorter go down to bed rock for it eh if i wanted to take a hand in them lots or ditch shares for instanceit would be only law to hev it made out in the name o daubigny  mr ford listened with certain impatient contempt it was bad enough for uncle ben to have exposed his weakness in inventing fictions about his early education but to invest himself now with a contingency of capital for the sake of another childish vanity was pitiable as it was preposterous there was no doubt that he had lied about his school experiences it was barely probable that his name was really daubigny and it was quite consistent with all thiseven setting apart the fact that he was perfectly well known to be only a poor minerthat he should lie again like most logical reasoners mr ford forgot that humanity might be illogical and inconsistent without being insincere he turned away without speaking as if indicating a wish to hear no more  some o these days said uncle ben with dull persistency ill tell ye suthen  id advise you just now to drop it and stick to your lessons said the master sharply  thats so said uncle ben hurriedly hiding himself as it were in an allencompassing blush in course lessons first boys thats the motto he again took up his pen and assumed his old laborious attitude but after a few moments it became evident that either the masters curt dismissal of his subject or his own preoccupation with it had somewhat unsettled him he cleaned his pen obtrusively going to the window for a better light and whistling from time to time with a demonstrative carelessness and a depressing gayety he once broke into a murmuring meditative chant evidently referring to the previous conversation in itsthats soyer we golessons the first boys yo heave o the rollicking marine character of this refrain despite its utter incongruousness apparently struck him favorably for he repeated it softly occasionally glancing behind him at the master who was coldly absorbed at his desk presently he arose carefully put his books away symmetrically piling them in a pyramid beside mr fords motionless elbow and then lifting his feet with high but gentle steps went to the peg where his coat and hat were hanging as he was about to put them on he appeared suddenly struck with a sense of indecorousness in dressing himself in the school and taking them on his arm to the porch resumed them outside then saying i clean disremembered id got to see a man so long till tomorrow he disappeared whistling softly  the old woodland hush fell back upon the school it seemed very quiet and empty a faint sense of remorse stole over the master yet he remembered that uncle ben had accepted without reproach and as a good joke much more direct accusations from rupert filgee and that he himself had acted from a conscientious sense of duty towards the man but a conscientious sense of duty to inflict pain upon a fellowmortal for his own good does not always bring perfect serenity to the inflicterpossibly because in the defective machinery of human compensation pain is the only quality that is apt to appear in the illustration mr ford felt uncomfortable and being so was naturally vexed at the innocent cause why should uncle ben be offended because he had simply declined to follow his weak fabrications any further this was his return for having tolerated it at first it would be a lesson to him henceforth nevertheless he got up and went to the door the figure of uncle ben was already indistinct among the leaves but from the motion of his shoulders he seemed to be still stepping high and softly as if not yet clear of insecure and engulfing ground  the silence still continuing the master began mechanically to look over the desks for forgotten or mislaid articles and to rearrange the pupils books and copies a few heartsease gathered by the devoted octavia dean neatly tied with a black thread and regularly left in the inkstand cavity of ruperts desk were still lying on the floor where they had been always hurled with equal regularity by that disdainful adonis picking up a slate from under a bench his attention was attracted by a forgotten cartoon on the reverse side mr ford at once recognized it as the work of that youthful but eminent caricaturist johnny filgee broad in treatment comprehensive in subject liberal in detail and slatepencilit represented uncle ben lying on the floor with a book in his hand tyrannized over by rupert filgee and regarded in a striking profile of two features by cressy mckinstry the daring realism of introducing the names of each character on their legsperhaps ideally enlarged for that purposeleft no doubt of their identity equally daring but no less effective was the rendering of a limited but dramatic conversation between the parties by the aid of emotional balloons attached to their mouths like a visible gulp bearing the respective legends i luv you o my and you git  the master was for a moment startled at this unlookedfor but graphic testimony to the fact that uncle bens visits to the school were not only known but commented upon the small eyes of those youthful observers had been keener than his own he had again been stupidly deceived in spite of his efforts love albeit deficient in features and wearing an improperly short bellshaped frock had boldly reentered the peaceful school and disturbing complications on abnormal legs were following at its heels     chapter v   while this simple pastoral life was centred around the schoolhouse in the clearing broken only by an occasional warning pistolshot in the direction of the harrisonmckinstry boundaries the more business part of indian spring was overtaken by one of those spasms of enterprise peculiar to all californian mining settlements the opening of the eureka ditch and the extension of stagecoach communication from big bluff were events of no small importance and were celebrated on the same day the double occasion overtaxing even the fluent rhetoric of the editor of the star left him struggling in the metaphorical difficulties of a pactolian spring which he had rashly turned into the ditch and obliged him to transfer the onerous duty of writing the editorial on the big bluff extension to the hands of the honorable abner dean assemblyman from angels the loss of the honorable mr deans right eye in an early pioneer fracas did not prevent him from looking into the dim vista of the future and discovering with that single unaided optic enough to fill three columns of the star it is not too extravagant to say he remarked with charming deprecation that indian spring through its own perfectly organized system of inland transportation the confluence of its north fork with the sacramento river and their combined effluence into the illimitable pacific is thus put not only into direct communication with far cathay but even remoter antipodean markets the citizen of indian spring taking the 9 a m pioneer coach and arriving at big bluff at 240 is enabled to connect with the through express to sacramento the same evening reaching san francisco per the steam navigation companys palatial steamers in time to take the pacific mail steamer to yokohama on the following day at 830 p m although no citizen of indian spring appeared to avail himself of this admirable opportunity nor did it appear at all likely that any would everybody vaguely felt that an inestimable boon lay in the suggestion and even the master professionally intrusting the reading aloud of the editorial to rupert filgee with ulterior designs of practice in the pronunciation of fivesyllable words was somewhat affected by it johnny filgee and jimmy snyder accepting it as a mysterious something that made desert islands accessible at a moments notice and a trifling outlay were roundeyed and attentive and the culminating information from the master that this event would be commemorated by a halfholiday combined to make the occasion as exciting to the simple schoolhouse in the clearing as it was to the gilded saloon in the main street  and so the momentous day arrived with its two new coaches from big bluff containing the specially invited speakersalways specially invited to those occasions and yet strangely enough never before feeling the extreme importance and privilege of it as they did then then there were the firing of two anvils the strains of a brass band the hoisting of a new flag on the libertypole and later the ceremony of the ditch opening when a distinguished speaker in a most unworkmanlike tall hat black frock coat and white cravat which gave him the general air of a festive gravedigger took a spade from the hands of an apparently hilarious chief mourner and threw out the first sods there were anvils brass bands and a collation at the hotel but everywhereoverriding the most extravagant expectation and even the laughter it provokedthe spirit of indomitable youth and resistless enterprise intoxicated the air it was the spirit that had made california possible that had sown a thousand such ventures broadcast through its wilderness that had enabled the sower to stand halfhumorously among his scant or ruined harvests without fear and without repining and turn his undaunted and ever hopeful face to further fields what mattered it that indian spring had always before its eyes the abandoned trenches and ruined outworks of its earlier pioneers what mattered it that the eloquent eulogist of the eureka ditch had but a few years before as prodigally scattered his adjectives and his fortune on the useless tunnel that confronted him on the opposite side of the river the sublime forgetfulness of youth ignored its warning or recognized it as a joke the master fresh from his little flock and prematurely aged by their contact felt a stirring of something like envy as he wandered among these scarcely older enthusiasts  especially memorable was the exciting day to johnny filgee not only for the delightfully bewildering clamor of the brass band in which between the trombone and the bass drum he had got inextricably mixed not only for the halffrightening explosions of the anvils and the maddening smell of the gunpowder which had exalted his infant soul to sudden and irrelevant whoopings but for a singular occurrence that whetted his always keen perceptions having been shamelessly abandoned on the veranda of the eureka hotel while his brother rupert paid bashful court to the pretty proprietress by assisting her in her duties johnny gave himself up to unlimited observation the rosettes of the six horses the new harness the length of the drivers whiplash his enormous buckskin gloves and the way he held his reins the fascinating odor of shining varnish on the coach the goldheaded cane of the honorable abner dean all these were stored away in the secret recesses of johnnys memory even as the unconsidered trifles he had picked up en route were distending his capacious pockets but when a young man had alighted from the second or truly coach among the real passengers and strolled carelessly and easily in the veranda as if the novelty and the occasion were nothing to him johnny with a gulp of satisfaction knew that he had seen a prince beautifully dressed in a white duck suit with a diamond ring on his finger a gold chain swinging from his fob and a panama hat with a broad black ribbon jauntily resting on his curled and scented hair johnnys eyes had never rested on a more resplendent vision he was more romantic than yuba bill more imposing and less impossible than the honorable abner dean more eloquent than the masterfar more beautiful than any colored print that he had ever seen had he brushed him in passing johnny would have felt a thrill had he spoken to him he knew he would have been speechless to reply judge then of his utter stupefaction when he saw uncle benactually uncle benapproach this paragon of perfection albeit with some embarrassment and after a word or two of unintelligible conversation walk away with him need it be wondered that johnny forgetful at once of his brother the horses and even the collation with its possible goodies instantly followed  the two men turned into the side street which after a few hundred yards opened upon the deserted mining flat crossed and broken by the burrows and mounds made by the forgotten engines of the early goldseekers johnny at times hidden by these irregularities kept closely in their rear sauntering whenever he came within the range of their eyes in that sidelong spasmodic and generally diagonal fashion peculiar to small boys but ready at any moment to assume utter unconsciousness and the appearance of going somewhere else or of searching for something on the ground in this way appearing if noticed at all each time in some different position to the right or left of them johnny followed them to the fringe of woodland which enabled him to draw closer to their heels  utterly oblivious of this artistic shadowing in the insignificant person of the small boy who once or twice even crossed their path with affected timidity they continued an apparently confidential previous interview the words stocks and shares were alone intelligible johnny had heard them during the day but he was struck by the fact that uncle ben seemed to be seeking information from the paragon and was perfectly submissive and humble but the boy was considerably mystified when after a tramp of half an hour they arrived upon the debatable ground of the harrisonmckinstry boundary having been especially warned never to go there johnny as a matter of course was perfectly familiar with it but what was the incomprehensible stranger doing there was he brought by uncle ben with a view of paralyzing both of the combatants with the spectacle of his perfections was he a youthful sheriff a young judge or maybe the son of the governor of california or was it that uncle ben was silly and didnt know the locality here was an opportunity for him johnny to introduce himself and explain and even magnify the danger with perhaps a slight allusion to his own fearless familiarity with it unfortunately as he was making up his small mind behind a tree the paragon turned and with the easy disdain that so well became him said  well i wouldnt offer a dollar an acre for the whole ranch but if you choose to give a fancy pricethats your lookout  to johnnys already prejudiced mind uncle ben received this just contempt submissively as he ought but nevertheless he muttered something silly in reply which johnny was really too disgusted to listen to ought he not to step forward and inform the paragon that he was wasting his time on a man who couldnt even spell baker and who was taught his letters by his johnnys brother  the paragon continued  and of course you know that merely your buying the title to the land dont give you possession youll have to fight these squatters and jumpers just the same itll be three instead of two fightingthats all  uncle bens imbecile reply did not trouble johnny he had ears now only for the superior intellect before him it continued coolly  now lets take a look at that yield of yours i havent much time to give you as i expect some men to be looking for me hereand i suppose you want this thing still kept a secret i dont see how youve managed to do it so far is your claim near you live on iti think you said  but that the little listener was so preoccupied with the stranger this suggestion of uncle bens having a claim worth the attention of that distinguished presence would have set him thinking the little that he understood he set down to uncle bens gassin as the two men moved forward again he followed them until uncle bens house was reached  it was a rude shanty of boards and rough boulders half burrowing in one of the largest mounds of earth and gravel which had once represented the tailings or refuse of the abandoned indian spring placer in fact it was casually alleged by some that uncle ben eked out the scanty grub wages he made by actual mining in reworking and sifting the tailings at odd timesa degrading work hitherto practised only by chinese and unworthy the caucasian ambition the mining code of honor held that a man might accept the smallest results of his daily labor as long as he was sustained by the prospect of a larger strike but condemned his contentment with a modest certainty nevertheless a little of this suspicion encompassed his dwelling and contributed to its loneliness even as a long ditch the former tailrace of the claim separated him from his neighbors prudently halting at the edge of the wood johnny saw his resplendent vision cross the strip of barren flat and enter the cabin with uncle ben like any other mortal he sat down on a stump and awaited its return which he fondly hoped might be alone at the end of half an hour he made a short excursion to examine the condition of a blackberry bramble and returned to his post of observation but there was neither sound nor motion in the direction of the cabin when another ten minutes had elapsed the door opened and to johnnys intense discomfiture uncle ben appeared alone and walked leisurely towards the woods burning with anxiety johnny threw himself in uncle bens way but here occurred one of those surprising inconsistencies known only to children as uncle ben turned his small gray eyes upon him in a half astonished half questioning manner the potent spirit of childish secretiveness suddenly took possession of the boy wild horses could not now have torn from him that question which only a moment before was on his lips  hullo johnny what are ye doin here said uncle ben kindly  nothin after a pause in which he walked all round uncle bens large figure gazing up at him as if he were a monument he added huntin blackberrieth  why aint you over at the collation  ruperth there he answered promptly  the idea of being thus vicariously present in the person of his brother seemed a sufficient excuse he leapfrogged over the stump on which he had been sitting as an easy unembarrassing pause for the next question but uncle ben was apparently perfectly satisfied with johnnys reply and nodding to him walked away  when his figure had disappeared in the bushes johnny cautiously approached the cabin at a certain distance he picked up a stone and threw it against the door immediately taking to his heels and the friendly copse again no one appearing he repeated the experiment twice and even thrice with a larger stone and at a nearer distance then he boldly skirted the cabin and dropped into the raceway at its side following it a few hundred yards he came upon a long disused shaft opening into it which had been covered with a rough trap of old planks as if to protect incautious wayfarers from falling in here a sudden and inexplicable fear overtook johnny and he ran away when he reached the hotel almost the first sight that met his astounded eyes was the spectacle of the paragon apparently still in undisturbed possession of all his perfectionsdriving coolly off in a buggy with a fresh companion  meantime mr ford however touched by the sentimental significance of the celebration became slightly wearied of its details as his own room in the eureka hotel was actually thrilled by the brass band without and the eloquence of speakers below and had become redolent of gunpowder and champagne exploded around it he determined to return to the schoolhouse and avail himself of its woodland quiet to write a few letters  the change was grateful the distant murmur of the excited settlement came only as the soothing sound of wind among the leaves the pure air of the pines that filled every cranny of the quiet schoolroom and seemed to disperse all taint of human tenancy made the faroff celebrations as unreal as a dream the only reality of his life was here  he took from his pocket a few letters one of which was worn and soiled with frequent handling he reread it in a half methodical half patient way as if he were waiting for some revelation it inspired which was slow that afternoon in coming at other times it had called up a youthful enthusiasm which was wont to transfigure his grave and prematurely reserved face with a new expression today the revelation and expression were both wanting he put the letter back with a slight sigh that sounded so preposterous in the silent room that he could not forego an embarrassed smile but the next moment he set himself seriously to work on his correspondence  presently he stopped once or twice he had been overtaken by a vague undefinable sense of pleasure even to the dreamy halting of his pen it was a sensation in no way connected with the subject of his correspondence or even his previous reflectionsit was partly physical and yet it was in some sense suggestive it must be the intoxicating effect of the woodland air he even fancied he had noticed it before at the same hour when the sun was declining and the fresh odors of the undergrowth were rising it certainly was a perfume he raised his eyes there lay the cause on the desk before hima little nosegay of wild californian myrtle encircling a rosebud which had escaped his notice  there was nothing unusual in the circumstance the children were in the habit of making their offerings generally without particular reference to time or occasion and it might have been overlooked by him during schoolhours he felt a pity for the forgotten posy already beginning to grow limp in its neglected solitude he remembered that in some folklore of the childrens perhaps a tradition of the old association of the myrtle with venus it was believed to be emblematic of the affections he remembered also that he had even told them of this probable origin of their superstition he was still holding it in his hand when he was conscious of a silken sensation that sent a magnetic thrill through his fingers looking at it more closely he saw that the sprigs were bound together not by thread or ribbon but by long filaments of soft brown hair tightly wound around them he unwound a single hair and held it to the light its length color texture and above all a certain inexplicable instinct told him it was cressy mckinstrys he laid it down quickly as if he had in that act familiarly touched her person  he finished his letter but presently found himself again looking at the myrtle and thinking about it from the position in which it had been placed it was evidently intended for him the fancy of binding it with hair was also intentional and not a necessity as he knew his feminine scholars were usually well provided with bits of thread silk or ribbon if it had been some new absurdity of childish fashion introduced in the school he would have noticed it ere this for it was this obtrusion of a personality that vaguely troubled him he remembered cressys hair it was certainly very beautiful in spite of her occasional vagaries of coiffure he recalled how one afternoon it had come down when she was romping with octavia in the playground and was surprised to find what a vivid picture he retained of her lingering in the porch to put it up her rounded arms held above her head her pretty shoulders full throat and glowing face thrown back and a wisp of the very hair between her white teeth he began another letter  when it was finished the shadow of the pinebranch before the window thrown by the nearly level sun across his paper had begun slowly to reach the opposite wall he put his work away lingered for a moment in hesitation over the myrtle sprays and then locked them in his desk with an odd feeling that he had secured in some vague way a hold upon cressys future vagaries then reflecting that uncle ben whom he had seen in town would probably keep holiday with the others he resolved to wait no longer but strolled back to the hotel the act however had not recalled uncle ben to him by any association of ideas for since his discovery of johnny filgees caricature he had failed to detect anything to corroborate the caricaturists satire and had dismissed the subject from his mind  on entering his room at the hotel he found rupert filgee standing moodily by the window while his brother johnny overcome by a repletion of excitement and collation was asleep on the single armchair their presence was not unusual as mr ford touched by the loneliness of these motherless boys had often invited them to come to his rooms to look over his books and illustrated papers  well he said cheerfully  rupert did not reply or change his position mr ford glancing at him sharply saw a familiar angry light in the boys beautiful eyes slightly dimmed by a tear laying his hand gently on ruperts shoulder he said whats the matter rupert  nothin said the boy doggedly with his eyes still fixed on the pane  hashasmrs tripp the fair proprietress been unkind he went on lightly  no reply  you know rupe continued mr ford demurely she must show some reserve before companylike today it wont do to make a scandal  rupert maintained an indignant silence but the dimple which he usually despised as a feminine blot on the cheek nearer the master became slightly accented only for a moment the dark eyes clouded again  i wish i was dead mr ford  hallo  ordoin suthin  thats better what do you want to do  to workmake a livin myself quit toten wood and water at home quit cookin and makin beds like a yaller chinaman quit nussin babies and dressin em and undressin em like a girl look at him now pointing to the sweetly unconscious johnny look at him there do you know what that means it means ive got to pack him home through the town jist ez he is thar and then make a fire and bile his food for him and wash him and undress him and put him to bed and now i lay me down to sleep him and tuck him up and dad all the while scootin round town with other idjits jawin about progress and the future of injin spring much future weve got over our own house mr ford much future hes got laid up for me  the master to whom those occasional outbreaks from rupert were not unfamiliar smiled albeit with serious eyes that belied his lips and consoled the boy as he had often done before but he was anxious to know the cause of this recent attack and its probable relations to the fascinating mrs tripp  i thought we talked all that over some time ago rupe in a few months youll be able to leave school and ill advise your father about putting you into something to give you a chance for yourself patience old fellow youre doing very well considertheres your pupil uncle ben  oh yes thats another big baby to tot round in school when i aint niggerin at home  and i dont see exactly what else you could do at indian spring continued mr ford  no said rupert gloomily but i could get away to sacramento yuba bill says they take boys no bigger nor me in thar express offices or banksand in a year or two theyre as good ez anybody and get paid as big why there was a fellow here just now no older than you mr ford and not half your learnin and he dressed to death with jewelry and everybody bowin and scrapin to him that it was perfectly sickenin  mr ford lifted his eyebrows oh you mean the young man of benham and co who was talking to mrs tripp he said  a quick flush of angry consciousness crossed ruperts face maybe he has just cheek enough for anythin  and you want to be like him said mr ford  you know what i mean mr ford not like him why youre as good as he is any day continued rupert with relentless naivete but if a jaybird like that can get on why couldnt i  there was no doubt that the master here pointed out the defectiveness of ruperts logic and the beneficence of patience and study as became their relations of master and pupil but with the addition of a certain fellow sympathy and some amusing recital of his own boyish experiences that had the effect of calling ruperts dimples into action again at the end of half an hour the boy had become quite tractable and getting ready to depart approached his sleeping brother with something like resignation but johnnys nap seemed to have had the effect of transforming him into an inert jellylike mass it required the joint exertions of both the master and rupert to transfer him bodily into the latters arms where with a single limp elbow encircling his brothers neck he lay with his unfinished slumber still visibly distending his cheeks his eyelids and even lifting his curls from his moist forehead the master bade rupert goodnight and returned to his room as the boy descended the stairs with his burden  but here providence with i fear its occasional disregard of mere human morality rewarded rupert after his own foolish desires mrs tripp was at the foot of the stairs as rupert came slowly down he saw her and was covered with shame she saw him and his burden and was touched with kindliness whether or not she was also mischievously aware of ruperts admiration and was not altogether displeased with it i cannot say in a voice that thrilled him she said  what rupert are you going so soon  yes maamon account of johnny  but let me take himi can keep him here tonight  it was a great temptation but rupert had strength to refuse albeit with his hat pulled over his downcast eyes  poor dear how tired he looks  she approached her still fresh and pretty face close to rupert and laid her lips on johnnys cheek then she lifted her audacious eyes to his brother and pushing back his wellworn chip hat from his clustering curls she kissed him squarely on the forehead  goodnight dear  the boy stumbled and then staggered blindly forward into the outer darkness but with a gentlemans delicacy he turned almost instantly into a side street as if to keep this consecration of himself from vulgar eyes the path he had chosen was rough and weary the night was dark and johnny was ridiculously heavy but he kept steadily on the womans kiss in the fancy of the foolish boy shining on his forehead and lighting him onward like a star     chapter vi   when the door closed on rupert the master pulled down the blind and trimming his lamp tried to compose himself by reading outside the great day for indian spring was slowly evaporating in pale mists from the river and the celebration itself spasmodically taking flight here and there in roman candles and rockets an occasional outbreak from revellers in the barroom below a stumbling straggler along the planked sidewalk before the hotel only seemed to intensify the rustic stillness for the future of indian spring was still so remote that nature insensibly reinvested its boundaries on the slightest relaxation of civic influence and mr ford lifted his head from the glowing columns of the star to listen to the faroff yelp of a coyote on the opposite shore  he was also conscious of the recurrence of that vague pleasurable recollection so indefinite that when he sought to identify it with anythingeven the finding of the myrtle sprays on his deskit evaded him he tried to work with the same interruption then an uneasy sensation that he had not been sufficiently kind to rupert in his foolish lovetroubles remorsefully seized him a half pathetic half humorous picture of the miserable rupert staggering under the double burden of his sleeping brother and a misplaced affection or possibly abandoning the one or both in the nearest ditch in a reckless access of boyish frenzy and fleeing his home forever rose before his eyes he seized his hat with the intention of seeking himor forgetting him in some other occupation by the way for mr ford had the sensitive conscience of many imaginative people an unfailing monitor it was always calling his whole moral being into play to evade it  as he crossed the passage he came upon mrs tripp hooded and elaborately attired in a white ball dress which however did not to his own fancy become her as well as her ordinary costume he was passing her with a bow when she said with complacent consciousness of her appearance arent you going to the ball tonight  he remembered then that an opening ball at the courthouse was a part of the celebration no he said smiling but it is a pity that rupert couldnt have seen you in your charming array  rupert said the lady with a slightly coquettish laugh you have made him as much a womanhater as yourself i offered to take him in our party and he ran away to you she paused and giving him a furtive critical glance said with an easy mingling of confidence and audacity why dont you go nobodyll hurt you  im not so sure of that replied mr ford gallantly theres the melancholy example of rupert always before me  mrs tripp tossed her chignon and descended a step of the stairs youd better go she continued looking up over the balusters you can look on if you cant dance  now mr ford could dance and it so chanced rather well too with this consciousness he remained standing in half indignant hesitation on the landing as she disappeared why shouldnt he go it was true he had half tacitly acquiesced in the reserve with which he had been treated and had never mingled socially in the gatherings of either sex at indian springbut that was no reason he could at least dress himself walk to the courthouse andlook on  any black coat and white shirt was sufficiently de rigueur for indian spring mr ford added the superfluous elegance of a forgotten white waistcoat when he reached the sidewalk it was only nine oclock but the windows of the courthouse were already flaring like a stranded steamer on the barren bank where it had struck on the way thither he was once or twice tempted to change his mind and hesitated even at the very door but the fear that his hesitation would be noticed by the few loungers before it and the fact that some of them were already hesitating through bashfulness determined him to enter  the clerks office and judges chambers on the lower floor had been invaded by wraps shawls and refreshments but the dancing was reserved for the upper floor or courtroom still unfinished flags laurelwreaths and appropriate floral inscriptions hid its bare walls but the coat of arms of the state already placed over the judges dais with its illimitable golden sunset its triumphant goddess and its implacable grizzly seemed figuratively to typify the occasion better than the inscriptions the room was close and crowded the flickering candles in tin sconces against the walls or depending in rude chandeliers of barrelhoops from the ceiling lit up the most astounding diversity of female costume the master had ever seen gowns of bygone fashions creased and stained with packing and disuse toilets of forgotten festivity revised with modern additions garments in and out of seasona furtrimmed jacket and a tulle skirt a velvet robe under a pique sacque fresh young faces beneath faded headdresses and mature and buxom charms in virgin white the small space cleared for the dancers was continually invaded by the lookerson who in files of three deep lined the room  as the master pushed his way to the front a young girl who had been standing in the sides of a quadrille suddenly darted with a nymphlike quickness among the crowd and was for an instant hidden without distinguishing either face or figure mr ford recognized in the quick impetuous action a characteristic movement of cressys with an embarrassing instinct that he could not account for he knew she had seen him and that for some inexplicable reason he was the cause of her sudden disappearance  but it was only for a moment even while he was vaguely scanning the crowd she reappeared and took her place beside her mystified partnerthe fascinating stranger of johnnys devotion and ruperts dislike she was pale he had never seen her so beautiful all that he had thought distasteful and incongruous in her were but accessories of her loveliness at that moment in that light in that atmosphere in that strange assembly even her full pink gauze dress from which her fair young shoulders slipped as from a sunset cloud seemed only the perfection of virginal simplicity her girlish length of limb and the long curves of her neck and back were now the outlines of thorough breeding the absence of color in her usually fresh face had been replaced by a faint magnetic aurora that seemed to him half spiritual he could not take his eyes from her he could not believe what he saw yet that was cressy mckinstryhis pupil had he ever really seen her did he know her now small wonder that all eyes were bent upon her that a murmur of unspoken admiration or still more intense hush of silence moved the people around him he glanced hurriedly at them and was oddly relieved by this evident participation in his emotions  she was dancing now and with that same pale restraint and curious quiet that had affected him so strongly she had not even looked in his direction yet he was aware by the same instinct that had at first possessed him that she knew he was present his desire to catch her eye was becoming mingled with a certain dread as if in a single interchange of glances the illusions of the moment would either vanish utterly or become irrevocably fixed he forced himself when the set was finished to turn away partly to avoid contact with some acquaintances who had drifted before him and whom politeness would have obliged him to ask to dance and partly to collect his thoughts he determined to make a tour of the rooms and then go quietly home those who recognized him made way for him with passive curiosity the middleaged and older adding a confidential sympathy and equality that positively irritated him for an instant he had an idea of seeking out mrs tripp and claiming her as a partner merely to show her that he danced  he had nearly made the circuit of the room when he was surprised by the first strains of a waltz waltzing was not a strong feature of indian spring festivity partly that the church people had serious doubts if davids saltatory performances before the ark included round dances and partly that the young had not yet mastered its difficulties when he yielded to his impulse to look again at the dancers he found that only three or four couples had been bold enough to take the floor cressy mckinstry and her former partner were one of them in his present exaltation he was not astonished to find that she had evidently picked up the art in her late visit and was now waltzing with quiet grace and precision but he was surprised that her partner was far from being equally perfect and that after a few turns she stopped and smilingly disengaged her waist from his arm as she stepped back she turned with unerring instinct to that part of the room where the master stood and raised her eyes through the multitude of admiring faces to his their eyes met in an isolation as supreme as if they had been alone it was an attraction the more dangerous because unformulateda possession without previous pledge promise or even intentiona love that did not require to be made  he approached her quietly and even more coolly than he thought possible will you allow me a trial he asked  she looked in his face and as if she had not heard the question but was following her own thought said i knew you would come i saw you when you first came in without another word she put her hand in his and as if it were part of an instinctive action of drawing closer to him caught with her advancing foot the accent of the waltz and the next moment the room seemed to slip away from them into whirling space  the whole thing had passed so rapidly from the moment he approached her to the first graceful swing of her full skirt at his side that it seemed to him almost like the embrace of a lovers meeting he had often been as near her before had stood at her side at school and even leaned over her desk but always with an irritated instinct of reserve that had equally affected her and which he now understood with her conscious but pale face so near his own with the faint odor of her hair clinging to her and with the sweet confusion of the half lingering half withheld contact of her hand and arm all had changed he did not dare to reflect that he could never again approach her except with this feeling he did not dare to think of anything he abandoned himself to the sense that had begun with the invasion of her hairbound myrtle in the silent schoolroom and seemed to have at last led her to his arms they were moving now in such perfect rhythm and unison that they seemed scarcely conscious of motion once when they neared the open window he caught a glimpse of the round moon rising above the solemn heights of the opposite shore and felt the cool breath of mountain and river sweep his cheek and mingle a few escaped threads of her fair hair with his own with that glimpse and that sensation the vulgarity and the tawdriness of their surroundings the guttering candles in their sconces the bizarre figures the unmeaning faces seemed to be whirled far into distant space they were alone with night and nature it was they who were still all else had receded in a vanishing perspective of dull reality in which they had no part  play on o waltz of strauss whirl on o love and youth for you cannot whirl so swiftly but that this receding world will return again with narrowing circle to hem you in faster o cracked clarionet louder o too brazen bassoon keep back o dull and earthy environment till master and pupil have dreamed their foolish dream  they are in fancy alone on the riverbank only the round moon above them and their linked shadows faintly fluttering in the stream they have drawn so closely together now that her arm is encircling his neck her soft eyes uplifted like the moons reflection and drowning into his closer and closer till their hearts stop beating and their lips have met in a first kiss faster o little feet swing clear o cressys skirt and keep the narrowing circle back    they are again alone the judges dais and the emblazoning of the state caught in a single whirling flash of consciousness are changed to an altar seen dimly through the bridal veil that covers her fair head there is the murmur of voices mingling two lives in one they turn and pass proudly down between the aisles of wondering festal faces ah the circle is drawing closer one more quick whirl to keep them back o flying skirt and daintywinged feet too late the music stops the tawdry walls shut in again the vulgar crowds return they stand pale and quiet the centre of a ring of breathless admiring frightened or forbidding faces her arms fold like wings at her side the waltz is over  a shrill feminine chorus assail her with praises struck here and there with a metallic ring of envy a dozen alldaring cavaliers made reckless by her grace and beauty clamor for her hand in the next waltz she replies not to them but to him not again and slips away in the crowd with that strange new shyness that of all her transformations seems the most delicious yet so conscious are they of their mutual passion that they do not miss each other and he turns away as if their next meeting were already an appointed tryst a few congratulate him on his skill johnnys paragon looks after him curiously certain elders shake hands with him perplexedly as if not quite sure of the professional consistency of his performance those charming tidewaiters on social success the fair artfully mingling expectation with compliment only extract from him the laughing statement that this one waltz was the single exception allowed him from the rule of his professional conduct and he refers them to his elder critics a single face loutish looming and vindictive stands on among the crowdthe face of seth davis he had not seen him since he left the school he had forgotten his existence even now he only remembered his successor joe masters and he looked curiously around to see if that later suitor of cressys was present it was not until he reached the door that he began to think seriously of seth daviss jealous face and was roused to a singular indignation why hadnt this great fool vented his jealousy on the openly compromising masters he thought he even turned and walked back with some vaguely aggressive instinct but the young man had disappeared with this incident still in his mind he came upon uncle ben and hiram mckinstry standing among the spectators in the doorway why might not uncle ben be jealous too and if his single waltz had really appeared so compromising why should not cressys father object but both menalbeit mckinstry usually exhibited a vague unreasoning contempt for uncle benwere unanimous in their congratulations and outspoken admiration  when i seed you sail in mr ford said uncle ben with abstract reflectiveness i sez to the fellers lie low boys and youll see style and when you put on them first steps i sez thats frenchthe latest hightoned french styleouter the best masters andand outer the best books for why sez i its the same long sliding stroke you see in his copies theres that long up sweep and that easy curve to the right with no hitch thats the sorter swing he hez in readin potry too thats why its called the potry of motion sez i and you ken bet your boots boys its all in the trainin o education  mr ford said mr mckinstry gravely slightly waving a lavendercolored kid glove with which he had elected to conceal his maimed hand and at the same moment indicate a festal occasion i hev to thank ye for the way you took out that child o mine like ez she woz an ontried filly and put her through her paces i dont dance myself partikly in that gaitwhich i take to be suthin betwixt a lope and a canter and i dont get to see much dancin nowadays on account o bein worrited by stock but seein you two together just now suthin came over me and i dont think i ever felt so kam in my life  the blood rushed to the masters cheek with an unexpected consciousness of guilt and shame but he stammered awkwardly your daughter dances beautifully herself she has certainly had practice  that said mckinstry laying his gloved hand impressively on the masters shoulder with the empty little finger still more emphasized by being turned backward in the net that may be ez it ez but i wanted to say that it was the simple easy fammily touch that you gev it that took me toward the end when you kinder gathered her up and she sorter dropped her head into your breastpocket and seemed to go to sleep like ez ef she was still a little girl it so reminded me of the times when i used to tote her myself walkin by the waggin at platt river that it made me wish the old woman was here to see it  still coloring the master cast a rapid sidelong glance at mckinstrys dark red face and beard but in the slow satisfaction of his features there was no trace of that irony which the masters selfconsciousness knew  then your wife is not here said mr ford abstractedly  she war at church she reckoned that id do to look arter cressyshe bein so to speak under conviction dye mind walkin this way a bit i want to speak a word with ye he put his maimed hand through the masters arm after his former fashion and led him to a corner  did ye happen to see seth davis about yer  i believe i saw him a moment ago returned mr ford half contemptuously  did he get off anythin rough on ye  certainly not said the master haughtily why should he dare  thats so said mckinstry meditatively you had better keep right on in that line thats your gait remember leave himor his fatherits the same thingto me dont you let yourself be roped in to this yer row betwixt me and the davises you aint got no call to do it its already been on my mind your bringin that gun to me in the harrison row the old woman hadnt oughter let younor cress either hark to me mr ford i reckon to stand between you and both the davises till the cows come homeonlymind you give him the goby when he happens to meander along towards you  im very much obliged to you said ford with disproportionately sudden choler but i dont propose to alter my habits for a ridiculous schoolboy whom i have dismissed the unjust and boyish petulance of his speech instantly flashed upon him and he felt his cheek burn again  mckinstry regarded him with dull red slumbrous eyes dont you go to lose your best holt mr fordand thats kam keep your kamand youve allus got the dead wood on injin springs i aint got it he continued in his slowest most passionless manner and a row more or less aint much account to mebut you you keep your kam he paused stepped back and regarding the master with a slight wave of his crippled hand over his whole person as if indicating some personal adornment said it sets you off  he nodded turned and reentered the ballroom mr ford without trusting himself to further speech elbowed his way through the crowded staircase to the street but even there his strange anger as well as the equally strange remorse which had seized him in mckinstrys presence seemed to evaporate in the clear moonlight and soft summer air there was the riverbank with the tremulous river glancing through the dreamy mist as they had seen it from the window together he even turned to look back on the lighted ballroom as if she might have been looking out too but he knew he should see her again tomorrow and he hurriedly put aside all reserve all thought of the future all examination of his conduct to walk home enwrapped in the vaguer pleasure of the past rupert filgee to whom he had never given a second thought now peacefully slumbering beside his baby brother had not gone home in more foolish or more dangerous company  when he reached the hotel he was surprised to find it only eleven oclock no one had returned the building was deserted by all but the barkeeper and a flirting chambermaid who regarded him with aggrieved astonishment he began to feel very foolish and half regretted that he had not stayed to dance with mrs tripp or at least remained as a quiet onlooker apart from the others with a hasty excuse about returning to write letters for the mornings post he took a candle and slowly remounted the stairs to his room but on entering he found himself unprepared for that singular lack of sympathy with which familiar haunts always greet our new experiences he could hardly believe that he had left that room only two hours before it seemed so uncongenial and strange to the sensation that was still possessing him yet there were his table his books his armchair his bed as he had left them even a sticky fragment of gingerbread that had fallen from johnnys pocket he had not yet reached that stage of absorbing passion where he was able to put the loved one in his own surroundings she as yet had no place in this quiet room he could scarcely think of her here and he must think of her if he had to go elsewhere an extravagant idea of walking the street until his restless dream was over seized him but even in his folly the lackadaisical moonstruck quality of such a performance was too obvious the schoolhouse he would go there it was only a pleasant walk the night was lovely and he could bring the myrtlespray from his desk it was too significant nowif not too preciousto be kept there perhaps he had not examined it closely nor the place where it had lain there might be an additional sign word or token he had overlooked the thought thrilled him even while he was calmly arguing to himself that it was an instinct of caution  the air was quieter and warmer than usual though still characteristic of the locality in its dry dewless clarity the grass was yet warm from the daylong sun and when he entered the pines that surrounded the schoolhouse they had scarcely yet lost their spicy heat the moon riding high filled the dark aisles with a delicious twilight that lent itself to his waking dreams it was not long before tomorrow he could easily manage to bring her here in the grove at recess and would speak with her there it did not occur to him what he should say or why he should say it it did not occur to him that he had no other provocation than her eyes her conscious manner her eloquent silence and her admission that she had expected him it did not occur to him that all this was inconsistent with what he knew of her antecedents her character and her habits it was this very inconsistency that charmed and convinced him we are always on the lookout for these miracles of passion we may doubt the genuineness of an affection that is firsthand but never of one that is transferred  he approached the schoolhouse and unlocking the door closed it behind him not so much to keep out human intrusion as the invasion of bats and squirrels the nearly vertical moon while it perfectly lit the playground and openings in the pines around the house left the interior in darkness except the reflection upon the ceiling from the shining gravel without partly from a sense of precaution and partly because he was familiar with the position of the benches he did not strike a light and reached his own desk unerringly drew his chair before it and unlocked it groped in its dark recess for the myrtle spray felt its soft silken binding with an electrical thrill drew it out and in the security of the darkness raised it to his lips  to make room for it in his breast pocket he was obliged to take out his lettersamong them the wellworn one he had tried to read that morning a mingling of pleasure and remorse came over him as he felt that it was already of the past and as he dropped it carelessly into the empty desk it fell with a faint hollow sound as if it were ashes to ashes  what was that  the noise of steps upon the gravel light laughter the moving of two or three shadows on the ceiling the sound of voices a mans a childs and hers  could it be possible was not he mistaken no the mans voice was masters the childs octavias the womans hers  he remained silent in the shadow the schoolroom was not far from the trail where she would have had to pass going home from the ball but why had she come there had they seen him arrive and were mischievously watching him the sound of cressys voice and the lifting of the unprotected window near the door convinced him to the contrary  there thatll do now you two can step aside tave take him over to yon fence and keep him there till i get in nothank you siri can assist myself ive done it before it aint the first time ive been through this window is it tave  fords heart stopped beating there was a moment of laughing expostulation the sound of retreating voices the sudden darkening of the window the billowy sweep of a skirt the faint quick flash of a little ankle and cressy mckinstry swung herself into the room and dropped lightly on the floor  she advanced eagerly up the moonlit passage between the two rows of benches suddenly she stopped the master rose at the same moment with outstretched warning hand to check the cry of terror he felt sure would rise to her lips but he did not know the lazy nerves of the girl before him she uttered no outcry and even in the faint dim light he could see only the same expression of conscious understanding come over her face that he had seen in the ballroom mingled with a vague joy that parted her breathless lips as he moved quickly forward their hands met she caught his with a quick significant pressure and darted back to the window  oh tave very languidly  yes  you two had better wait for me at the edge of the trail yonder and keep a lookout for folks going by dont let them see you hanging round so near do you hear im all right  with her hand still meaningly lifted she stood gazing at the two figures until they slowly receded towards the distant trail then she turned as he approached her the reflection of the moonlit road striking up into her shining eyes and eager waiting face a dozen questions were upon his lips a dozen replies were ready upon hers but they were never uttered for the next moment her eyes half closed she leaned forward and fellinto a kiss  she was the first to recover holding his face in her hands turned towards the moonlight her own in passionate shadow listen she said quickly they think i came here to look for something i left in my desk they thought it high fun to come with methese two i did come to look for somethingnot in my desk but yours  was it this he whispered taking the myrtle from his breast she seized it with a light cry putting it first to her lips and then to his then clasping his face again between her soft palms she turned it to the window and said look at them and not at me  he did soseeing the two figures slowly walking in the trail and holding her there firmly against his breast it seemed a blasphemy to ask the question that had been upon his lips  thats not all she murmured moving his face backwards and forwards to her lips as if it were something to which she was giving breath when we came to the woods i felt that you would be here  and feeling that you brought him said ford drawing back  why not she replied indolently even if he had seen you i could have managed to have you walk home with me  but do you think its quite fair would he like it  would he like it she echoed lazily  cressy said the young man earnestly gazing into her shadowed face have you given him any right to object do you understand me  she stopped as if thinking do you want me to call him in she said quietly but without the least trace of archness or coquetry would you rather he were hereor shall we go out now and meet him ill say you just came as i was going out  what should he say cressy he asked almost curtly do you love me  it seemed such a ridiculous thing to ask holding her thus in his arms if it were true it seemed such a villainous question if it were not  i think i loved you when you first came she said slowly it must have been that that made me engage myself to him she added simply i knew i loved you and thought only of you when i was away i came back because i loved you i loved you the day you came to see maweven when i thought you came to tell her of masters and to say that you couldnt take me back  but you dont ask me if i love you  but you doyou couldnt help it now she said confidently  what could he do but reply as illogically with a closer embrace albeit a slight tremor as if a cold wind had blown across the open window passed over him she may have felt it too for she presently said kiss me and let me go  but we must have a longer talk darlingwhenwhenothers are not waiting  do you know the far barn near the boundary she asked  yes  i used to take your books there afternoons totobe with you she whispered and paw gave orders that no one was to come nigh it while i was there come tomorrow just before sundown  a long embrace followed in which all that they had not said seemed to them at least to become articulate on their tremulous and clinging lips then they separated he unlocking the door softly to give her egress that way she caught up a book from a desk in passing and then slipped like a rosy shaft of the coming dawn across the fading moonlight and a moment after her slow voice without a tremor of excitement was heard calling to her companions     chapter vii   the conversation which johnny filgee had overheard between uncle ben and the gorgeous stranger although unintelligible to his infant mind was fraught with some significance to the adult settlers of indian spring the town itself like most interior settlements was originally a mining encampment and as such its founders and settlers derived their possession of the soil under the mining laws that took precedence of all other titles but although that title was held to be good even after the abandonment of their original occupation and the establishment of shops offices and dwellings on the site of the deserted places the suburbs of the town and outlying districts were more precariously held by squatters under the presumption of their being public land open to preemption or the settlement of schoolland warrants upon them few of the squatters had taken the trouble to perfect even these easy titles merely holding possession for agricultural or domiciliary purposes and subject only to the invasion of jumpers a class of adventurers who in the abeyance of recognized legal title jumped or forcibly seized such portions of a squatters domains as were not protected by fencing or superior force it was therefore with some excitement that indian spring received the news that a mexican grant of three square leagues which covered the whole district had been lately confirmed by the government and that action would be taken to recover possession it was understood that it would not affect the adverse possessions held by the town under the mining laws but it would compel the adjacent squatters like mckinstry davis masters and filgee and jumpers like the harrisons to buy the legal title or defend a slow but losing lawsuit the holders of the grantrich capitalists of san franciscowere open to compromise to those in actual possession and in the benefits of this compromise the unscrupulous jumper who had neither sown nor reaped but simply dispossessed the squatter who had done both shared equally with him  a diversity of opinion as to the effect of the new claim naturally obtained the older settlers still clung to their experiences of an easy aboriginal holding of the soil and were sceptical both as to the validity and justice of these revived alien grants but the newer arrivals hailed this certain tenure of legal titles as a guarantee to capital and an incentive to improvement there was also a growing and influential party of eastern and northern men who were not sorry to see a fruitful source of dissension and bloodshed removed the feuds of the mckinstrys and harrisons kept alive over a boundary to which neither had any legal claim would seem to bring them hereafter within the statute law regarding ordinary assaults without any ethical mystification on the other hand mckinstry and harrison would each be able to arrange any compromise with the new title holders for the lands they possessed or make over that actual possession for a consideration it was feared that both men being naturally lawless would unite to render any legal eviction a long and dangerous process and that they would either be left undisturbed till the last or would force a profitable concession but a greater excitement followed when it was known that a section of the land had already been sold by the owners of the grant that this section exactly covered the debatable land of the mckinstryharrison boundaries and that the new landlord would at once attempt its legal possession the inspiration of genius that had thus effected a division of the harrisonmckinstry combination at its one weak spot excited even the admiration of the sceptics no one in indian spring knew its real author for the suit was ostensibly laid in the name of a san francisco banker but the intelligent reader of johnny filgees late experience during the celebration will have already recognized uncle ben as the man and it becomes a part of this veracious chronicle at this moment to allow him to explain not only his intentions but the means by which he carried them out in his own words  it was one afternoon at the end of his usual solitary lesson and the master and uncle ben were awaiting the arrival of rupert uncle bens educational progress lately through dint of slow tenacity had somewhat improved and he had just completed from certain forms and examples in a book before him a letter to a consignee informing him that he uncle ben had just shipped 2 cwt ivory elephant tusks 80 peculs of rice and 400bbls prime mess pork from indian spring and another beginning honored madam and conveying in admirably artificial phraseology the lamented decease of the ladys husband from yellow fever contracted on the gold coast and uncle ben was surveying his work with critical satisfaction when the master somewhat impatiently consulted his watch uncle ben looked up  i oughter told ye that rupe didnt kalkilate to come to day  indeedwhy not  i reckon because i told him he neednt i allowed toto hev a little private talk with ye mr ford if ye didnt mind  mr fords face did not shine with invitation very well he said only remember i have an engagement this afternoon  but that aint until about sundown said uncle ben quietly i wont keep ye ez long ez that  mr ford glanced quickly at uncle ben with a rising color what do you know of my engagements he said sharply  nothin mr ford returned uncle ben simply but hevin bin layin round lookin for ye here and at the hotel for four or five days allus about that time and not findin you i rather kalkilated you might hev suthin reglar on hand  there was certainly nothing in his face or manner to indicate the least evasion or deceit or indeed anything but his usual naivete perhaps a little perturbed and preoccupied by what he was going to say i had an idea of writin you a letter he continued kinder combinin practice and confidential information you know to be square with you mr ford in pint o fact ive got it here but ez it dont seem to entirely gibe with the facts and leaves a heap o things onsaid and onseen perhaps its jest ez wall ez i read it to you myselfputten in a word here and there and explainin it ginrally do you sabe  the master nodded and uncle ben drew from his desk a rude portfolio made from the two covers of a dilapidated atlas and took from between them a piece of blottingpaper which through inordinate application had acquired the color and consistency of a slate and a few pages of copybook paper that to the casual glance looked like sheets of exceedingly difficult music surveying them with a blending of chirographic pride orthographic doubt and the bashful consciousness of a literary amateur he traced each line with a forefinger inked to the second joint and slowly read aloud as follows  mr ford teacher  dear siryours of the 12th recd and contents noted i didnt explained uncle ben parenthetically receive any letter of yours but i thought i might heave in that beginning from copy for practice the rest is me in refference to my having munney continued uncle ben reading and pointing each word as he read and being able to buy ditch stocks an land  one moment said mr ford interrupting i thought you were going to leave out copy come to what you have to say  but i hevthis is all real now hold on and youll see said uncle ben he resumed with triumphant emphasis  when it were ginrally allowed that i haddent a red cent i want to explain to you mister ford for the first time a secret this here is how it was done when i first came to injian spring i settled down into the old palmetto claim near a heap of old taillings knowin it were against rools and reglar chinymans bizness to work them i diddnt let on to enyboddy what i didwitch wos to turn over some of the quarts what i thought was likely and orrifferus doing this i kem uppon some pay ore which them palmetto fellers had overlookt or more likely had kaved in uppon them from the bank onknown workin at it in od times by and large sometimes afore sun up and sometimes after sundown and all the time keeping up a days work on the clame for a show to the boys i emassed a honist fortun in 2 years of 50000 dolers and still am but it will be askd by the incredjulos reeder how did you never let out anything to injian spring and how did you get rid of your yeald mister ford the anser is i took it twist a month on hoss back over to la port and sent it by express to a bank in sacramento givin the name of daubigny witch no one in la port took for me the ditch stok and the land was all took in the same name hens the secret was onreviled to the general eyestop a minit he interrupted himself quickly as the master in an accession of impatient scepticism was about to break in upon him it aint all then dropping his voice to a tremulous and almost funereal climax he went on  thus we see that pashent indurstry is rewarded in spite of mining rools and reggylashuns and predgudisses agin furrin labor is played out and fleeth like a shador contenueyeth not long in one spot and that a man may apear to be off no account and yet emass that witch is far abov rubles and fadith not away  hoppin for a continneyance  of your fevors i remain  yours to command  benj daubigny   the gloomy satisfaction with which uncle ben regarded this perorationa satisfaction that actually appeared to be equal to the revelation itselfonly corroborated the masters indignant doubts  come he said impulsively taking the paper from uncle bens reluctant hand how much of this is a concoction of yours and rupesand how much is a true story do you really mean  hold on mr ford interrupted uncle ben suddenly fumbling in the breastpocket of his red shirt i reckoned on your being a little hard with me remembering our first talk bout these thingsso i allowed id bring you some proof slowly extracting a long legal envelope from his pocket he opened it and drew out two or three crisp certificates of stock and handed them to the master  thers one hundred shares made out to benj daubigny id hev brought you over the deed of the land too but ez its rather hard to read offhand on account of the law palaver ive left it up at the shanty to tackle at odd times by way of practising but ef you like well go up thar and ill show it to you  still haunted by his belief in uncle bens small duplicities mr ford hesitated these were certainly bona fide certificates of stock made out to daubigny but he had never actually accepted uncle bens statement of his identity with that person and now it was offered as a corroboration of a still more improbable story he looked at uncle bens simple face slightly deepening in color under his scrutinyperhaps with conscious guilt  have you made anybody your confidant rupe for instance he asked significantly  in course not replied uncle ben with a slight stiffening of wounded pride ony yourself mr ford and the young feller stacey from the bankez was obligated to know it in fact i wos kalkilatin to ask you to help me talk to him about that yer boundary land  mr fords scepticism was at last staggered any practical joke or foolish complicity between the agent of the bank and a man like uncle ben was out of the question and if the story were his own sole invention he would have scarcely dared to risk so accessible and uncompromising a denial as the agent had it in his power to give  he held out his hand to uncle ben let me congratulate you he said heartily and forgive me if your story really sounded so wonderful i couldnt quite grasp it now let me ask you something more have you had any reason for keeping this a secret other than your fear of confessing that you violated a few bigoted and idiotic mining ruleswhich after all are binding only upon sentimentand which your success has proved to be utterly impractical  there was another reason mr ford said uncle ben wiping away an embarrassed smile with the back of his hand that is to be square with you why i thought of consultin you i didnt keer to have mckinstry andhe added hurriedly in course harrison too know that i bought up the title to thur boundary  i understand nodded the master i shouldnt think you would  why shouldnt ye asked uncle ben quickly  welli dont suppose you care to quarrel with two passionate men  uncle bens face changed presently however with his hand to his face he managed to manipulate another smile only it appeared for the purpose of being as awkwardly wiped away  say one passionate man mr ford  well one if you like returned the master cheerfully but for the matter of that why any comedo you mind telling me why you bought the land at all you know its of little value to any but mckinstry and harrison  soppose said uncle ben slowly with a great affectation of wiping his inkspotted desk with his sleeve soppose that i had got kinder tired of seein mckinstry and harrison allus fightin and scrimmagin over their boundary line soppose i kalkilated that it warnt the sort o thing to induce folks to settle here soppose i reckoned that by gettin the real title in my hands id have the deadwood on both o them and settle the thing my own way eh  that certainly was a very laudable intention returned mr ford observing uncle ben curiously and from what you said just now about one passionate man i suppose you have determined already who to favor i hope your public spirit will be appreciated by indian spring at leastif it isnt by those two men  you lay low and keep dark and youll see returned his companion with a hopefulness of speech which his somewhat anxious eagerness however did not quite bear out but youre not goin yet surely he added as the master again absently consulted his watch its ony half past four its true thar aint any more to tell he added simply but i had an idea that you might hev took to this yer little story of mine more than you pear to be and might be askin questions and kinder bedevlin me with jokes ez to what i was goin to doand all that but praps it dont seem so wonderful to you arter all come to think of itsquarely now he said with a singular despondency im rather sick of it myselfeh  my dear old boy said ford grasping both his hands with a swift revulsion of shame at his own utterly selfish abstraction i am overjoyed at your good luck more than that i can say honestly old fellow that it couldnt have fallen in more worthy hands or to any one whose good fortune would have pleased me more there and if ive been slow and stupid in taking it in it is because its so wonderful so like a fairy tale of virtue rewardedas if you were a kind of male cinderella old man he had no intention of lyinghe had no belief that he was he had only forgotten that his previous impressions and hesitations had arisen from the very fact that he did doubt the consistency of the story with his belief in uncle bens weakness but he thought himself now so sincere that the generous reader who no doubt is ready to hail the perfect equity of his neighbors good luck will readily forgive him  in the plenitude of this sincerity ford threw himself at full length on one of the long benches and with a gesture invited uncle ben to make himself equally at his ease come he said with boyish gayety lets hear your plans old man to begin with whos to share them with you of course there are the old folks at home first then you have brothersand perhaps sisters he stopped and glanced with a smile at uncle ben the idea of there being a possible female of his species struck his fancy  uncle ben who had hitherto always exercised a severe restraintpartly from respect and partly from cautionover his long limbs in the schoolhouse here slowly lifted one leg over another bench and sat himself astride of it leaning forward on his elbow his chin resting between his hands  as far as the old folks goes mr ford im a kind of an orphan  a kind of orphan echoed ford  yes said uncle ben leaning heavily on his chin so that the action of his jaws with the enunciation of each word slightly jerked his head forward as if he were imparting confidential information to the bench before him yes that is you see im all right ez far as the old man goeshes dead died way back in mizzouri but ez to my mother its sorter betwixt and betweenkinder unsartain you see mr ford she went off with a city felleran entire stranger to meafore the old man died and thats wot broke up my schoolin now whether shes here there or yon cant be found out though squire tompkins allowedand he were a lawyerthat the old man could get a divorce if he wanted and that you see would make me a whole orphan ef i keerd to prove title ez the lawyers say wellthut sorter lets the old folks out then my brother was onct drowned in the north platt and i never had any sisters that dont leave much family for plannin aboutdoes it  no said the master reflectively gazing at uncle ben unless you avail yourself of your advantages now and have one of your own i suppose now that you are rich youll marry  uncle ben slightly changed his position and then with his finger and thumb began to apparently feed himself with certain crumbs which had escaped from the childrens luncheonbaskets and were still lying on the bench intent on this occupation and without raising his eyes to the master he returned slowly well you see im sorter married already  the master sat up quickly  what you marriednow  well perhaps thats a question its a good deal like my beein an orphanoncertain and onsettled he paused to pursue an evasive crumb to the end of the bench and having captured it went on it was when i was younger than you be and she warnt very old neither but she knew a heap more than i did and ez to readin and writin she was thar i tell you every time youd hev admired to see her mr ford as he paused here as if he had exhausted the subject the master said impatiently well where is she now  uncle ben shook his head slowly i aint seen her sens i left mizzouri goin on five years ago  but why havent you what was the matter persisted the master  wellyou seei runned away not she you know but ii scooted skedaddled out here  but what for asked the master regarding uncle ben with hopeless wonder something must have happened what was it was she  she was a good schollard said uncle ben gravely and allowed to be sech by all she stood about so high he continued indicating with his hand a medium height war little and dark complected  but you must have had some reason for leaving her  ive sometimes had an idea said uncle ben cautiously that mebbee runnin away ran in some famlies now there war my mother run off with an entire stranger and yers me ez run off by myself and what makes it the more onelike is that jest as dad allus allowed he could get a devorce agin mother so my wife could hev got one agin me for leavin her and its almost an evenhanded game that she hez its there where the oncertainty comes in  but are you satisfied to remain in this doubt or do you propose now that you are able to institute a thorough search for her  i was kalkilatin to look around a little said uncle ben simply  and return to her if you find her continued the master  i didnt say that mr ford  but if she hasnt got a divorce from you thats what youll have to do and what you ought to doif i understand your story for by your own showing a more causeless heartless and utterly inexcusable desertion than yours i never heard of  do you think so said uncle ben with exasperating simplicity  do i think so repeated mr ford indignantly everybodyll think so they cant think otherwise you say you deserted her and you admit she did nothing to provoke it  no returned uncle ben quickly nothin did i tell you mr ford that she could play the pianner and sing  no said mr ford curtly rising impatiently and crossing the room he was more than half convinced that uncle ben was deceiving him either under the veil of his hidebound simplicity he was an utterly selfish heartless secretive man or else he was telling an idiotic falsehood  im sorry i can neither congratulate you nor condole with you on what you have just told me i cannot see that you have the least excuse for delaying a single moment to search for your wife and make amends for your conduct and if you want my opinion it strikes me as being a much more honorable way of employing your new riches than mediating in your neighbors squabbles but its getting late and im afraid we must bring our talk to an end i hope youll think this over before we meet againand think differently  nevertheless as they both left the schoolhouse mr ford lingered over the locking of the door to give uncle ben a final chance for further explanation but none came the new capitalist of indian spring regarded him with an intensification of his usual half sad half embarrassed smile and only said you understand this yers a secret mr ford  certainly said ford with illconcealed irritation  bout my bein sorter married  dont be alarmed he responded dryly its not a taking story  they separated uncle ben more than ever involved in his usual unsatisfactory purposes wending his way towards his riches the master lingering to observe his departure before he plunged in virtuous superiority into the woods that fringed the harrison and mckinstry boundaries     chapter viii   the religious attitude which mrs mckinstry had assumed towards her husbands weak civilized tendencies was not entirely free from human rancor that strong loyal nature which had unsexed itself in the one idea of duty now that duty seemed to be no longer appreciated took refuge in her forgotten womanhood and in the infinitesimally small arguments resources and manoeuvres at its command she had conceived a singular jealousy of this daughter who had changed her husbands nature and who had supplanted the traditions of the household life she had acquired an exaggerated depreciation of those feminine charms which had never been a factor in her own domestic happiness she saw in her husbands desire to mitigate the savage austerities of their habits only a weak concession to the powers of beauty and adornmentdegrading vanities she had never known in their lifelong struggle for frontier supremacythat had never brought them victorious out of that struggle frizzles furblows and fancy fixins had never helped them in their exodus across the plains had never taken the place of swift eyes quick ears strong hands and endurance had never nursed the sick or bandaged the wounded when envy or jealousy invades the female heart after forty it is apt to bring a bitterness which knows no attenuating compensation in that coquetry emulation passionate appeal or innocent tenderness which makes tolerable the jealous caprices of the younger woman the struggle for rivalry is felt to be hopeless the power of imitation is gone of her forgotten womanhood mrs mckinstry revived only a capacity to suffer meanly and inflict mean suffering upon others in the ruined castle of her youth and the falling in of banqueting hall and bower the dungeon and torturechamber appeared to have been left or to use her own metaphor she had querulously complained to the parson that accordin to some folks she mout hev bin the barren figtree elected to bear persimmums  her methods were not entirely different from those employed by her suffering sisterhood in like emergencies the unlucky hiram worrited by stock was hardly placated or consoled by learning from her that it was only the result of his own weakness acting upon the cussedness of the stockdispersing harrisons the perplexity into which he was thrown by the news of the new legal claim to his land was not soothed by the suggestion that it was a trick of that yankee civilization to which he was meanly succumbing she who had always been a rough but devoted nurse in sickness was now herself overtaken by vague irregular disorders which involved the greatest care and the absence of all exciting causes the attendance of mckinstry and cressy at a crazy quilting party had brought on blind chills the importation of a melodeon for cressy to play on had superinduced an innerd rash and a threatened attack of palsy creeps had only been warded off by the timely postponement of an evening party suggested by her daughter the old nomadic instinct morbidly excited by her discontent caused her to lay artful plans for a further emigration she knew she had the germs of mash fever caught from the adjacent river she related mysterious information gathered in class meeting of the superior facilities for stock raising on the higher foothills she resuscitated her dead and gone missouri relations in her daily speech to a manifest invidious comparison with the living she revived even the incidents of her early married life with the same baleful intent the acquisition of a few biled shirts by hiram for festive appearances with cressy painfully reminded her that he had married her in hickory she further accented the change by herself appearing in her oldest clothes on the hypothesis that it was necessary for some one to keep up the traditions of the past  her attitude towards cressy would have been more decided had she ever possessed the slightest influence over her or had even understood her with the intuitive sympathies of the maternal relations yet she went so far as to even openly regret the breaking off of the match with seth davis whose family at least still retained the habits and traditions she revered but she was promptly silenced by her husband informing her that words that had to be tuk back had already passed between him and seths father and that according to those same traditions blood was more likely to be spilled than mingled whether she was only withheld from attempting a reconciliation herself through lack of tact and opportunity remains to be seen for the present she encouraged masterss attentions under a new and vague idea that a flirtation which distracted cressy from her studies was displeasing to mckinstry and inimical to his plans blindly ignorant of mr fords possible relations to her daughter and suspecting nothing she felt towards him only a dull aversion as being the senseless pivot of her troubles seeing no one and habitually closing her ears to any family allusion to cressys social triumphs she was unaware of even the popular admiration their memorable waltz had excited  on the morning of the day that uncle ben had confided to the master his ingenious plan for settling the boundary disputes the barking of mckinstrys yellow dog announced the approach of a stranger to the ranch it proved to be mr staceynot only as dazzlingly arrayed as when he first rose above johnny filgees horizon but wearing in addition to his jaunty business air a look of complacent expectation of the pretty girl whom he had met at the ball he had not seen her for a month it was a happy inspiration of his own that enabled him to present himself that morning in the twin functions of a victorious mercury and apollo  mckinstry had to be summoned from an adjacent meadow while cressy in the mean time undertook to entertain the gallant stranger this was easily done it was part of her fascinations that disdaining the ordinary real or assumed ignorance of the ingenue of her class she generally exhibited to her admirers with perhaps the single exception of the master a laughing consciousness of the state of mind into which her charms had thrown them she understood their passion if she could not accept it this to a bashful rustic community was helpful but in the main unsatisfactory with advances so promptly unmasked the most strategic retreat was apt to become an utter rout leaning against the lintel of the door her curved hand shading the sparkling depths of her eyes and the sunlight striking down upon the pretty curves of her languid figure she awaited the attack  i havent seen you miss cressy since we danced togethera month ago  that was mighty rough papers said cressy who was purposely dialectical to strangers considering that you trapsed up and down the lane past the house twice yesterday  then you saw me said the young man with a slightly discomfited laugh  i did and so did the hound and so i reckon did joe masters and the hired man and when you pranced back on the home stretch there was the hound masters the hired man and maw all on your trail and paw bringin up the rear with a shotgun there was about a half a mile of you altogether she removed her hand from her eyes to indicate with a lazily graceful sweep this somewhat imaginative procession and laughed  you are certainly well guarded said stacey hesitatingly and looking at you miss cressy he added boldly i dont wonder at it  well it is reckoned that next to paws boundaries im pretty well protected from squatters and jumpers  forceful and quaint as her language was the lazy sweetness of her intonation and the delicate refinement of her face more than atoned for it it was unconventional and picturesque as her gestures so at least thought mr stacey and it emboldened him to further gallantry  well miss cressy as my business with your father today was to try to effect a compromise of his boundary claims perhaps you might accept my services in your own behalf  which means responded the young lady pertly the same thing to me as to paw no trespassers but yourself thank you sir she twirled lightly on her heel and dropped him that exaggerated curtsey known to the schoolchildren as a cheese it permitted in its progress the glimpse of a pretty little slipper which completed his subjugation  well if its only a fair compromise he began laughingly  compromise means somebody giving up who is it she asked  the infatuated stacey had reached the point of thinking this repartee if possible more killing than his own  ha thats for miss cressy to say  but the young lady leaning back against the lintel with the comfortable ease of being irresponsibly diverted sagely pointed out that that was the function of the arbitrator  ah well suppose we begin by giving up seth davis eh you see that im pretty well posted miss cressy  you alarm me said cressy sweetly but i reckon he had given up  he was in the running that night at the ball looked half savage while i was dancing with you wanted to eat me  poor seth and he used to be so particular in his food said the witty cressy  mr stacey was convulsed and theres mr dabneyuncle ben he continued eh very quiet but very sly a dark horse eh pretends to take lessons for the sake of being near some one eh would he were a boy again because somebody else is a girl  i should be frightened of you if you lived here always returned cressy with invincible naivete but perhaps then you wouldnt know so much  stacey simply accepted this as a compliment and theres masters he said insinuatingly  not joe said cressy with a low laugh turning her eyes to the door  yes said stacey with a quick uneasy smile ah i see we mustnt drop him is he out there he added trying to follow the direction of her eyes  but the young girl kept her face studiously averted is that all she asked after a pause  welltheres that solemn schoolmaster who cut me out of the waltz with youthat mr ford  had he been a perfectly cool and impartial observer he would have seen the slight tremor cross cressys soft eyelids even in profile followed by that momentary arrest of her whole face mouth dimples and eyes which had overtaken it the night the master entered the ballroom but he was neither and it passed quickly and unnoticed her usual lithe but languid play of expression and color came back and she turned her head lazily towards the speaker theres paw coming i suppose you wouldnt mind giving me a sample of your style of arbitrating with him before you try it on me  certainly not said stacey by no means displeased at the prospect of having so pretty and intelligent a witness in the daughter of what he believed would form an attractive display of his diplomatic skill and graciousness to the father dont go away ive got nothing to say miss cressy could not understand and answer  the jingling of spurs and the shadow of mckinstry and his shotgun falling at this moment between the speaker and cressy spared her the necessity of a reply mckinstry cast an uneasy glance around the apartment and not seeing mrs mckinstry looked relieved and even the deep traces of the loss of a valuable steer that morning partly faded from his indianred complexion he placed his shotgun carefully in the corner took his soft felt hat from his head folded it and put it in one of the capacious pockets of his jacket turned to his daughter and laying his maimed hand familiarly on her shoulder said gravely without looking at stacey what might the stranger be wantin cress  perhaps id better answer that myself said stacey briskly im acting for benham and co of san francisco who have bought the spanish title to part of this property i  stop there said mckinstry in a voice dull but distinct he took his hat from his pocket put it on walked to the corner and took up his gun looked at stacey for the first time with narcotic eyes that seemed to drowsily absorb his slight figure then put the gun back half contemptuously and with a wave of his hand towards the door said well settle this yer outside cress you stop in here theres mans talk goin on  but paw said cressy laying her hand languidly on her fathers sleeve without the least change of color or amused expression this gentleman has come over here on a compromise  on awhich said mckinstry glancing scornfully out of the door for some rare species of mustang vaguely suggested to him in that unfamiliar word  to see if we couldnt come to some fair settlement said stacey ive no objection to going outside with you but i think we can discuss this matter here just as well his fine feathers had not made him a coward although his heart had beaten a little faster at this sudden recollection of the dangerous reputation of his host  go on said mckinstry  the plain facts of the case are these continued stacey with more confidence we have sold a strip of this property covering the land in dispute between you and harrison we are bound to put our purchaser in peaceable possession now to save time we are willing to buy that possession of any man who can give it we are told that you can  well considerin that for the last four years ive been fightin night and day agin them lowdown harrisons for it i reckon youve been lied to said mckinstry deliberately whyexcept the clearing on the north side whar i put up a barn thar aint an acre of it as hasnt been shifted first this side and then that as fast ez i druv boundary stakes and fences and the harrisons pulled em up agin thar aint more than fifty acres ez ive hed a clear hold on and i wouldnt hev had that ef it hadnt bin for the barn the raisin alone o which cost me a man two horses and this yer little finger  put us in possession of even that fifty acres and well undertake to hold the rest and eject those harrisons from it returned stacey complacently you understand that the moment weve made a peaceable entrance to even a foothold on your side the harrisons are only trespassers and with the title to back us we can call on the whole sheriffs posse to put them off thats the law  that ar the law repeated mckinstry meditatively  yes said stacey so he continued with a selfsatisfied smile to cressy far from being hard on you mr mckinstry were rather inclined to put you on velvet we offer you a fair price for the only thing you can give usactual possession and we help you with your old grudge against the harrisons we not only clear them out but we pay you for even the part they held adversely to you  mr mckinstry passed his three whole fingers over his forehead and eyes as if troubled by a drowsy aching then you dont reckon to hev anythin to say to them harrisons  we dont propose to recognize them in the matter at all returned stacey  nor allow em anythin  not a cent so you see mr mckinstry he continued magnanimously yet with a mischievous smile to cressy there is nothing in this amicable discussion that requires to be settled outside  aint there said mckinstry in a dull deliberate voice raising his eyes for the second time to stacey they were bloodshot with a heavy hanging furtiveness not unlike one of his own hunted steers but i aint kam enuff in yer he moved to the door with a beckoning of his fateful hand outside a minitef you please  stacey started shrugged his shoulders and half defiantly stepped beyond the threshold cressy unchanged in color or expression lazily followed to the door  wot said mckinstry slowly facing stacey wot ef i refoose wot ef i say i dont allow any man or any bank or any compromise to take up my quorlls wot ef i say that lowdown and mean as them harrisons is they dont begin to be ez mean ez lowdown ez underhanded ez sneakin ez that yer compromise wot ef i say that ef thats the kind o hogwash that law and snivelization offers me for peace and quietness ill take the fightin and the lawbreakin and the sheriff and all hll for his posse instead wot ef i say that  it will only be my duty to repeat it said stacey with an affected carelessness which however did not conceal his surprise and his discomfiture its no affair of mine  unless said cressy assuming her old position against the lintel of the door and smoothing the worn bearskin that served as a mat with the toe of her slipper unless youve mixed it up with your other arbitration you know  wot other arbitration asked mckinstry suddenly with murky eyes  stacey cast a rapid half indignant glance at the young girl who received it with her hands tucked behind her back her lovely head bent submissively forward and a prolonged little laugh  oh nothing paw she said only a little private foolishness betwixt me and the gentleman youd admire to hear him talk pawabout other things than business hes just that chipper and gay  nevertheless as with a muttered goodmorning the young fellow turned away she quietly brushed past her father and followed himwith her hands still penitently behind her and the rosy palms turned upwardas far as the gate her single long marguerite braid of hair trailing down her back nearly to the hem of her skirt appeared to accent her demure reserve at the gate she shaded her eyes with her hand and glanced upward  it dont seem to be a good day for arbitrating a trifle early in the season aint it  goodmorning miss mckinstry  she held out her hand he took it with an affected ease but cautiously as if it had been the velvet paw of a young panther who had scratched him after all what was she but the cub of the untamed beast mckinstry he was well out of it he was not revengefulbut business was business and he had given them the first chance  as his figure disappeared behind the buckeyes of the lane cressy cast a glance at the declining sun she reentered the house and went directly to her room as she passed the window she could see her father already remounted galloping towards the tules as if in search of that riparian kam his late interview had disturbed a few straggling bits of color in the sloping meadows were the children coming home from school she hastily tied a girlish sunbonnet under her chin and slipping out of the back door swept like a lissom shadow along the line of fence until she seemed to melt into the umbrage of the woods that fringed the distant north boundary     chapter ix   meanwhile unaware of her husbands sudden relapse to her old border principles and of the visit that had induced it mrs mckinstry was slowly returning from a lugubrious recital of her moods and feelings at the parsons as she crossed the barren flat and reached the wooded upland midway between the schoolhouse and the ranch she saw before her the old familiar figure of seth davis lounging on the trail in her habitual loyalty to her husbands feuds she would probably have stalked defiantly past him notwithstanding her late regrets of the broken engagement but seth began to advance awkwardly towards her in fact he had noticed the tall gaunt plaidshawled and hollandbonneted figure approaching and had waited for it  as he seemed intent upon getting in her way she stopped and raised her right hand warningly before her in spite of the shawl and the sunbonnet suffering had implanted a rude runic dignity to her attitude words that hev to be took back seth davis she said hastily hev passed between you and my man out of my way then that i may pass too  not much betwixt you and me aunt rachel he said with slouching deprecation using the old household title by which he had familiarly known her ive nothin agin youand i kin prove it by wot im yer to say and i aint trucklin to yer for myself for ez far ez me and yourn ez concerned he continued with a malevolent glance thar aint gold enough in caleforny to mak the weddin ring that could hitch me and cress together i want to tell you that youre bein played that youre bein befooled and bamboozled and honeyfogled thet while youre groanin at classmeetin and hirams quollin with dad and joe masters waitin round to pick up any bone thats throwed him that sneakin hypocritical yankee schoolmaster is draggin your daughter to hll with him on the sly  quit that seth davis said mrs mckinstry sternly or be man enough to tell it to a man thats hirams business to know  and what if he knows it well enough and winks at it what if hes willin enough to truckle to it to curry favor with them sneakin yanks said seth malignantly  a spasm of savage conviction seized mrs mckinstry but it was more from her jealous fears of her husbands disloyalty than concern for her daughters transgression nevertheless she said desperately its a lie where are your proofs  proofs returned seth who is it sneaks around the schoolhouse to have private talks with the schoolmaster and edges him on with cressy afore folks your husband who goes sneakin off every arternoon with that same cantin hound of a schoolmaster your daughter whos been carryin on together and hidin thick enough to be ridden out on a rail together your daughter and the schoolmaster proofsask anybody ask the children look yaryou johnnycome here  he had suddenly directed his voice to a blackberry bush near the trail from which the curly head of johnny filgee had just appeared that homereturning infant painfully disengaged himself his slate his books and his small dinnerpail half filled with fruit as immature as himself and came towards them sideways  yers a dime johnny to git some candy said seth endeavoring to distort his passionset face into a smile  johnny filgees small berrystained palm promptly closed over the coin  now dont lie wheres cressy  kithin her bo  good boy what bo  johnny hesitated he had once seen the schoolmaster and cressy together he had heard it whispered by the other children that they loved each other but looking at seth and mrs mckinstry he felt that something more tremendous than this stupid fact was required of him for grownup people and being honest and imaginative he determined that it should be worth the money  speak up johnny dont be afeard to tell  johnny was not afeardhe was only thinking he had it he remembered that he had just seen his paragon the brilliant stacey coming from the boundary woods what more poetical and startlingly effective than to connect him with cressy he replied promptly  mithter thtathy he gived her a watch and ring of truly gold goin to be married at thacramento  you lyin limb said seth seizing him roughly but mrs mckinstry interposed  let that brat go she said with gleaming eyes i want to talk to you seth released johnny its a trick he said hes bin put up to it by that ford  but johnny after securing a safe vantage behind the blackberry bush determined to give them another trialwith facts  i know morn that he called out  gityou measly pup said seth savagely  i know theriff briggth he rid over the boundary with a lot o men and horthes said johnny with that hurried delivery with which he was able to estop interruption theed em go by maur harrithon theth his dads goin to chuck out ole mckinthtry hooray  mrs mckinstry turned her dark face sharply on seth whats that he sez  nothin but childrens gassin he answered meeting her eyes with an evil consciousness half loutish half defiant and ef it war true it would only sarve hiram mckinstry right  she laid her hand upon his shoulder with swift suspicion out o my way seth davis she said suddenly pushing him aside ef this ez any underhanded work of yours youll pay for it  she strode past him in the direction of johnny but at the approach of the tall woman with the angry eyes the boy flew she hesitated a moment turned again with a threatening wave of the hand to seth and started off rapidly in the direction of the boundary  she had not placed so much faith in the boys story as in the vague revelation of evil in daviss manner if there was any cussedness afoot seth convinced of cressys unfaithfulness and with no further hope of any mediation from the parents would know it unless hiram had been warned he was still lulled in his fatuous dream of civilization at that time he and his men were in the tules with the stock to be satisfied she herself must go to the boundary  she reached the ridge of the cottonwoods and sycamores and a few hundred yards further brought her to the edge of that gentle southern slope which at last sank into the broad meadow of the debatable ground in spite of staceys invidious criticism of its intrinsic value this theatre of savage dissension violence and bloodshed was by some irony of nature a pastoral landscape of singular and peaceful repose the soft glacis stretching before her was in spring cerulean with lupins and later starred with mariposas the meadow was transversely crossed by a curving line of alders that indicated a rare watercourse of which in the dry season only a single pool remained to flash back the unvarying sky there had been no attempt at cultivation of this broad expanse wild oats mustard and rank grasses left it a tossing sea of turbulent and variegated color whose waves rode high enough to engulf horse and rider in their choking depths even the traces of human struggle the uprooted stakes scattered fencerails and empty postholes were forever hidden under these billows of verdure midway of the field and near the watercourse arose mckinstrys barnthe solitary human structure whose rude misshapen bulging sides and swallowhaunted eaves bursting with hay from the neighboring pasture seemed however only an extravagant growth of the prolific soil mrs mckinstry gazed at it anxiously there was no sign of life or movement near or around it it stood as it had always stood deserted and solitary but turning her eyes to the right beyond the watercourse she could see a slight regular undulation of the grassy sea and what appeared to be the drifting on its surface of half a dozen slouched hats in the direction of the alders there was no longer any doubt a party from the other side was approaching the border  a shout and the quick galloping of hoofs behind her sent a thrill of relief to her heart she had barely time to draw aside as her husband and his followers swept past her down the slope but it needed not his furious cry the harrisons hev sold us out to tell her that the crisis had come  she held her breath as the cavalcade diverged and in open order furiously approached the watercourse and she could see a sudden check and hesitation in the movement in the meadow at that unlookedfor onset then she thought of the barn it would be a rallyingpoint for them if driven backa tower of defence if besieged there were arms secreted beneath the hay for such an emergency she would run there swingto its open doors and get ready to barricade them  she ran crouchingly seeking the higher grasses and brambles of the ridge to escape observation from the meadow until she could descend upon the barn from the rear she threw aside her impeding shawl her brown holland sunbonnet torn off her head and hanging by its strings from her shoulders let her coarse silverthreaded hair stream like a mane over her back her face and hands were bleeding from thorns and whitened by dust but she struggled on fiercely like some hunted animal until she reached the descending trail when letting herself go blindly only withheld by the long grasses she clutched at wildly on either side she half fell half stumbled down the slope and emerged beside the barn breathless and exhausted  but what a contrast was there for an instant she could scarcely believe that she had left the ridge with her husbands savage outcry in her ears and in her eyes the swift vision of his furious cavalcade the boundary meadow was hidden by the soft lines of graceful willows in whose dim recesses the figures of the passionate horsemen seemed to have melted forever there was nothing now to interrupt the long vista of peaceful beauty that stretched before her through this lonely hollow to the distant sleeping hills the bursting barn in the foreground heaped with grain that fringed its eaves and bristled from its windows and doors until its unlovely bulk was hidden in trailing feathery outlines the gentle flutter of wings and soothing twitter of swallows and jays around its open rafters and the drifting shadows of a few circling crows above it the drowsy song of bees on the wild mustard that half hid its walls with yellow bloom the sound of faintlytrickling water in one of those old indianhaunted springs that had given its name to the locality all these for an instant touched the senses of this hard fierce woman as she had not been touched since she was a girl for one brief moment the joys of peace and that matured repose that never had been hers flashed upon her but with it came the savage consciousness that even now it was being wrested away and the thought fired her blood again she listened eagerly for a second in the direction of the meadow there was no report of firearmsthere was yet time to prepare the barn for defence she ran to the front of the building and seized the latch of the halfclosed door a little feminine cry that was half a laugh came from within with the rapid rustle of a skirt and as the door swung open a light figure vanished through the rear window the slanting sunlight falling in the shadowed interior disclosed only the single erect figure of the schoolmaster john ford  the first confusion and embarrassment of an interrupted rendezvous that had colored fords cheeks gave way to a look of alarm as he caught sight of the bleeding face and dishevelled figure of mrs mckinstry she saw it to her distorted fancy it seemed only a proof of deeper guilt without a word she closed the heavy door behind her and swung the huge crossbar unaided to its place she then turned and confronted him wiping the dust from her face and arms with her torn and dangling sunbonnet in a way that recalled her attitude on the first day he had met her  that was cress with ye she said  he hesitated still gazing at her in wonder  dont lie  he started i dont propose to he retorted indignantly it was  i dont ask ye how long this yers bin goin on she said pointing to cressys sunbonnet a few books and a scattered nosegay of wild flowers lying on the hay and i dont want to know in five minutes either her father will be here or them hellhounds of harrisons whove sold him out will swarm round this barn to git possesshun ef this yershe again pointed contemptuously to the objects just indicatedmeans that youve cast your lot with us and kalkilate to take our bitter with our sweet yell lift up that stack of hay and bring out a gun to help defend it ef youre meanin anythin else ford youll hide yourself in that hay till hiram comes and has time enough to attend to ye  and if i choose to do neither he said haughtily  she looked at him in unutterable scorn theres the windertake it while theres time afore i bar it ef you see hiram tell him ye left an old woman behind ye to defend the place whar you uster hide with her darter  before he could reply there was a distant report followed almost directly by another with a movement of irritation he walked to the window turned and looked at herbolted it and came back  wheres that gun he said almost rudely  i reckons that would fetch ye she said dragging away the hay and disclosing a long troughlike box covered with tarpaulin it proved to contain powder shot and two guns he took one  i suppose i may know what i am fighting for he said dryly  ye might say cress ef theyindicating the direction of the reportshappen to ask ye she returned with equal sobriety jess now ye kin take your stand up thar in the loft and see whats comin  he did not linger but climbed to the place assigned him glad to escape the company of the woman who at that moment he almost hated in his unreflecting passion for cressy he had always evaded the thought of this relationship or propinquity the mother had recalled it to him in a way that imperilled even his passion for the daughter his mind was wholly preoccupied with the idiotic exasperating and utterly hopeless position that had been forced upon him in the bitterness of his spirit his sense of personal danger was so far absorbed that he speculated on the chance bullet in the melee that might end his folly and relieve him of responsibility shut up in a barn with a furious woman in a lawless defence of questionable rightswith the added consciousness that an equally questionable passion had drawn him into it and that she knew itdeath seemed to offer the only escape from the explanation he could never give if another sting could have been added it was the absurd conviction that cressy would not appreciate his sacrifice but was perhaps even at that moment calmly congratulating herself on the felicitousness of the complication in which she had left him  suddenly he heard a shout and the tramping of horse the sides of the loft were scantily boarded to allow the extension of the pentup grain and between the interstices ford without being himself seen had an uninterrupted view of the plain between him and the line of willows as he gazed five men hurriedly issued from the extreme left and ran towards the barn mckinstry and his followers simultaneously broke from the same covert further to the right and galloped forward to intercept them but although mounted the greater distance they had to traverse brought them to the rear of the building only as the harrison party came to a sudden halt before the closed and barricaded doors of the usually defenceless barn the discomfiture of the latter was greeted by a derisive shout from the mckinstry partyalbeit equally astonished but in that brief moment ford recognized in the leader of the harrisons the wellknown figure of the sheriff of tuolumne it needed only this to cap the climax of the fatality that seemed to pursue him he was no longer a lawless opposer of equally lawless forces but he was actually resisting the law itself he understood the situation now it was some idiotic blunder of uncle bens that had precipitated this attack  the belligerents had already cocked their weapons although the barn was still a rampart between the parties but an adroit flanker of mckinstrys creeping through the tall mustard managed to take up an enfilading position as the harrisons advanced to break in the door a threatening shout from the ambuscaded partisans caused them to hurriedly fall back towards the rear of the barn there was a pause and then began the usual homeric chaffwith this western difference that it was cunningly intended to draw the others fire  why dont you blaze away at the door you   it wont hurt ye  hes afraid the bolt will shoot back laughter from the mckinstrys  come outer the tall grass and show yourself you black mudeating gopher  he cant hes dropped his grit and is sarchin for it goading laughter from the harrisons  each man waited for that single shot which would precipitate the fight even in their lawlessness the rude instinct of the duello swayed them the officer of the law recognized the principle as well as its practical advantage in a collision but he hesitated to sacrifice one of his men in an attack on the barn which would draw the fire of mckinstry at that necessarily fatal range as a brave man he would have taken the risk himself but as a prudent one he reflected that his hurriedly collected posse were all partisans and if he fell the conflict would resolve itself into a purely partisan struggle without a single unprejudiced witness to justify his conduct in the popular eye the master also knew this it had checked his first impulse to come forward as a mediator his only reliance now was on mrs mckinstrys restraint and the sheriffs forbearance the next instant both seemed to be imperilled  well why dont you wade in sneered dick mckinstry who do you reckons hidden in the barn  ill tell ye said a harsh passionate voice from the hillside its cressy mckinstry and the schoolmaster hidin in the hay  both parties turned quickly towards the intruder who had approached them unperceived but the speech was followed by a more startling revulsion of sentiment as mrs mckinstrys voice rang out from the barn you lie seth davis  the brief advantage offered to the sheriff in daviss advent as a neutral witness was utterly lost by this unlookedfor revelation of mrs mckinstrys presence in the barn the fates were clearly against him a woman in the fight and an old one at that a white woman to be forcibly ejected in the whole unwritten code of southwestern chivalry there was no such precedent  stand back he said disgustedly to his followers stand back and let the dd barn slide but you hiram mckinstry ill give you five minutes to shake yourself clear of your wifes petticoats and git his blood was up nowthe quicker from his momentary weakness and the trick of which he thought himself a dupe  again the fatal signal seemed imminent again it was delayed for hiram mckinstry with clanking spurs and rifle in hand stepped from behind the barn full in the presence of his antagonists  ez to my gitten in five minits he began in his laziest drowsiest manner well see when the times up but jest now words hev passed betwixt my wife and seth davis afore anythin else goes on yer hes got to take his back my wife allows he lies i allow he lies too and i stan here to say it  the right of personal insult to precedence of redress was too old a frontier principle to be gainsaid now both parties held back and every eye was turned to where seth davis had been standing but he had disappeared  where  when mrs mckinstry hurled her denial from the barn he had taken advantage of the greater surprise to leap to one of the trusses of hay that projected beyond the loft and secure a footing from which he quickly scrambled through the open scantling to the interior the master who startled by his voice had made his way through the loose grain to the rear reached it as seth half crawled half tumbled through their eyes met in a single flash of rage but before seth could utter an outcry the master had dropped his gun seized him around the neck and crammed a thick handful of the soft hay he had hurriedly snatched up into his face and gasping mouth a furious but silent struggle ensued the yielding hay on which they both fell deadened all sound of a scuffle and concealed them from view masses of it already loosened by the intruders entrance and dislodged in their contortions began to slip through the opening to the ground the master still uppermost and holding seth firmly down allowed himself to slip with them shoving his adversary before him the maddened missourian detecting his purpose made a desperate attempt to change his position and succeeded in raising his knee against the masters chest ford guarding against what seemed to be only a wrestlers strategy contented himself by locking the bent knee firmly in that position and thus unwittingly gave seth the lookedfor opportunity of drawing the bowieknife concealed in his boot leg he knew his mistake only as seth violently freed his arm and threw it upward for the blow he heard the steel slither like a scythe through the hay and unlocking his hold desperately threw himself on the uplifted arm the movement saved him for the released body of seth slipped rapidly through the opening upheld for a single instant on the verge by the grasp of the masters two hands on the arm that still held the knife and then dropped heavily downward even then the hay that had slipped before him would have broken his fall but his head came in violent contact with some farming implements standing against the wall and without a cry he was stretched senseless on the ground the whole occurrence passed so rapidly and so noiselessly that not only did mckinstrys challenge fall upon his already unconscious ears but the loosened hay which in the masters struggles to recover himself still continued to slide gently from the loft actually hid him from the eyes of the spectators who sought him a moment afterwards a mass of hay and wild oats dislodged apparently by mrs mckinstry in securing her defences was all that met their eyes even the woman herself was unconscious of the deadly struggle that had taken place above her  the master staggered to an upright position half choked and half blinded with dust turgid and bursting with the rush of blood to his head but clear and collected in mind and unremorsefully triumphant unconscious of the real extent of seths catastrophe he groped for and seized his gun examined the cap and eagerly waited for a renewed attack he tried to kill me he would have killed me if he comes again i must kill him he kept repeating to himself it never occurred to him that this was inconsistent with his previous thoughtindeed with the whole tenor of his belief perhaps the most peaceful man who has been once put in peril of life by an adversary who has recognized death threatening him in the eye of his antagonist is by some strange paradox not likely to hold his own life or the life of his adversary as dearly as before everything was silent now the suspense irritated him he no longer dreaded but even longed for the shot that would precipitate hostilities what were they doing guided by seth were they concerting a fresh attack  listening more intently he became aware of a distant shouting and even more distinctly of the dull heavy trampling of hoofs a sudden angry fear that the mckinstrys had been beaten off and were flyinga fear and anger that now for the first time identified him with their causecame over him and he scrambled quickly towards the opening below but the sound was approaching and with it came a voice  hold on there sheriff  it was the voice of the agent stacey  there was a pause of reluctant murmuring but the warning was enforced by a command from another voiceweak unheroic but familiar i order this yer to stopright yer  a burst of ironical laughter followed the voice was uncle bens  stand back this is no time for foolin said the sheriff roughly  hes right sheriff briggs said staceys voice hurriedly youre acting for him hes the owner of the land  what that ben dabney  yes hes daubigny who bought the title from us  there was a momentary hush and then a hurried murmur  which means gents rose uncle bens voice persuasively that this yer young man though fairminded and wellintended hez bin a leetle too chipper and previous in orderin out the law this yer aint no law matter with me boys it aint to be settled by lawpapers nor shotguns and deringers its suthin to be chawed over sociablelike between drinks ef any harm hez bin done ef anythins happened im yer to demnify the sheriff and make it comfble all round yer know me boys im talkin its medabney or daubigny which ever way you like it  but in the silence that followed the passions had not yet evidently cooled it was broken by the sarcastic drawl of dick mckinstry if them harrisons dont mind heven had their medders trampled over by a few white men why  the sheriff ez demnified for that interrupted uncle ben hastily  n ef dick mckinstry dont mind the damage to his pants in crawlin out o gunshot in the tall grassretorted joe harrison  im yer to settle that boys said uncle ben cheerfully  but wholl settle this clamored the voice of the older harrison from behind the barn where he had stumbled in crossing the fallen hay yers seth davis lyin in the hay with the top of his head busted whos to pay for that  there was a rush to the spot and a quick cry of reaction  whose work is this demanded the sheriffs voice with official severity  the master uttered an instinctive exclamation of defiance and dropping quickly to the barn floor would the next moment have opened the door and declared himself but mrs mckinstry after a single glance at his determined face suddenly threw herself before him with an imperious gesture of silence then her voice rang clearly from the barn  well if its the hound that tried to force his way in yer i reckon ye kin put that down to me     chapter x   it was known to indian spring the next day amid great excitement that a serious fracas had been prevented on the illfated boundary by the dramatic appearance of uncle ben dabney not only as a peacemaker but as mr daubigny the bona fide purchaser and owner of the land it was known and accepted with great hilarity that old marm mckinstry had defended the barn alone and unaided withas variously stateda pitchfork an old stablebroom and a pail of dirty water against harrison his party and the entire able posse of the sheriff of tuolumne county with no further damage than a scalp wound which the head of seth davis received while falling from the loft of the barn from which he had been dislodged by mrs mckinstry and the broom aforesaid it was known with unanimous approbation that the acquisition of the landtitle by a hitherto humble citizen of indian spring was a triumph of the settlement over foreign interference but it was not known that the schoolmaster was a participant in the fight or even present on the spot at mrs mckinstrys suggestion he had remained concealed in the loft until after the withdrawal of both parties and the still unconscious seth when ford had remonstrated with the remark that seth would be sure to declare the truth when he recovered his senses mrs mckinstry smiled grimly i reckon when he comes to know i was with ye all the time hed rather hev it allowed that i licked him than you i dont say hell let it pass ez far ez youre concerned or wont try to get even with ye but he wont go round tellin why however she added still more grimly if you think youre ekul to tellin the hull storyhow ye kem to be yer and that seth wasnt lyin arter all when he blurted it out afore emwhy i shant hinder ye the master said no more and indeed for a day or two nothing transpired to show that seth was not equally reticent  nevertheless mr ford was far from being satisfied with the issue of his adventure his relations with cressy were known to the mother and although she had not again alluded to them she would probably inform her husband yet he could not help noticing with a mingling of unreasoning relief and equally unreasoning distrust that she exhibited a scornful unconcern in the matter apart from the singular use to which she had put it he could hardly count upon mckinstry with his heavy blind devotion to cressy being as indifferent on the contrary he had acquired the impression without caring to examine it closely that her father would not be displeased at his marrying cressy for it would really amount to that but here again he was forced to contemplate what he had always avoided the possible meaning and result of their intimacy in the reckless thoughtless extravagantyet thus far innocentindulgence of their mutual passion he had never spoken of marriage norand it struck him now with the same incongruous mingling of relief and uneasinesshad she perhaps this might have arisen from some superstitious or sensitive recollection on her part of her previous engagement to seth but he remembered now that they had not even exchanged the usual vows of eternal constancy it may seem strange that in the halfdozen stolen and rapturous interviews which had taken place between these young lovers there had been no suggestion of the future nor any of those glowing projects for a united destiny peculiar to their years and inexperience they had lived entirely in a blissful present with no plans beyond their next rendezvous in that mysterious and sudden absorption of each other not only the past but the future seemed to have been forgotten  these thoughts were passing through his mind the next afternoon to the prejudice of that calm and studious repose which the deserted schoolhouse usually superinduced and which had been so fondly noted by mckinstry and uncle ben the latter had not arrived for his usual lesson it was possible that undue attention had been attracted to his movements now that his good fortune was known and the master was alone save for the occasional swooping incursion of a depredatory jay in search of crumbs from the childrens luncheons who added apparently querulous insult to the larcenous act he regretted uncle bens absence as he wanted to know more about his connection with the harrison attack and his eventual intentions ever since the master emerged from the barn and regained his hotel under cover of the darkness he had heard only the vaguest rumors and he purposely avoided direct inquiry  he had been quite prepared for cressys absence from school that morningindeed in his present vacillating mood he had felt that her presence would have been irksome and embarrassing but it struck him suddenly and unpleasantly that her easy desertion of him at that critical moment in the barn had not since been followed by the least sign of anxiety to know the result of her mothers interference what did she imagine had transpired between mrs mckinstry and himself had she confidently expected her mothers prompt acceptance of the situation and a reconciliation was that the reason why she had treated that interruption as lightly as if she were already his recognized betrothed had she even calculated upon it had she he stopped his cheek glowing from irritation under the suspicion and shame at the disloyalty of entertaining it  opening his desk he began to arrange his papers mechanically when he discovered with a slight feeling of annoyance that he had placed cressys bouquetnow dried and witheredin the same pigeonhole with the mysterious letters with which he had so often communed in former days he at once separated them with a half bitter smile yet after a moments hesitation and with his old sense of attempting to revive a forgotten association he tried to reperuse them but they did not even restrain his straying thoughts nor prevent him from detecting a singular occurrence the nearly level sun was after its old fashion already hanging the shadowed tassels of the pine boughs like a garland on the wall but the shadow seemed to have suddenly grown larger and more compact and he turned with a quick consciousness of some interposing figure at the pane nothing however was to be seen yet so impressed had he been that he walked to the door and stepped from the porch to discover the intruder the clearing was deserted there was a slight rustling in the adjacent laurels but no human being was visible nevertheless the old feeling of security and isolation which had never been quite the same since mr mckinstrys confession seemed now to have fled the sylvan schoolhouse altogether and he somewhat angrily closed his desk locked it and determined to go home  his way lay through the first belt of pines towards the miningflat but today from some vague impulse he turned and followed the ridge he had not proceeded far when he perceived rupert filgee lounging before him on the trail and at a little distance further on his brother johnny at the sight of these two favorite pupils mr fords heart smote him with a consciousness that he had of late neglected them possibly because ruperts lofty scorn of the silly sex was not as amusing to him as formerly and possibly because johnnys curiosity had been at times obtrusive he however quickened his pace and joined rupert laying his hand familiarly as of old on his shoulder to his surprise the boy received his advances with some constraint and awkwardness glancing uneasily in the direction of johnny a sudden idea crossed mr fords mind  were you looking for me at the schoolroom just now  no sir  you didnt look in at the window to see if i was there continued the master  no sir  the master glanced at rupert truthtelling was a part of ruperts truculent temper although as the boy had often bitterly remarked it had always told agin him  all right said the master perfectly convinced it must have been my fancy but i thought somebody looked inor passed by the window  but here johnny who had overheard the dialogue and approached them suddenly threw himself upon his brothers unoffending legs and commenced to beat and pull them about with unintelligible protests rupert without looking down said quietly quit that nowi wont i tell ye and went through certain automatic movements of dislodging johnny as if he were a mere impeding puppy  whats the matter johnny said the master to whom these gyrations were not unfamiliar  johnny only replied by a new grip of his brothers trousers  well sir said rupert slightly recovering his dimples and his readiness johnny yer wants me to tell ye something ef he wasnt the most original selfcocking godforsaken liar in injin springef he didnt lie awake in his crib mornins to invent lies fer the day i wouldnt mind tellin ye and would hev told you before however since you ask and since you think you saw somebody around the schoolhouse johnny yer allows that seth davis is spyin round and followin ye wherever you go and he dragged me down yer to see it he says he saw him doggin ye  with a knife and pithtolth added johnnys boundless imagination to the detriment of his limited facts  mr ford looked keenly from the one to the other but rather with a suspicion that they were cognizant of his late fracas than belief in the truth of johnnys statement  and what do you think of it rupert he asked carelessly  i think sir said rupert that allowinfor onctthat johnny aint lying mebbee its cressy mckinstry that seths huntin round and knowin that shes always runnin after youhe stopped and reddening with a newborn sense that his fatal truthfulness had led him into a glaring indelicacy towards the master hurriedly added i mean sir that mebbee its uncle ben hes jealous of now that hes got rich enough for cressy to hev him and knowin he comes to school in the afternoon perhaps  taint either broke in johnny promptly theths over ther beyond the thchool and crethys eatin ithecream at the bakerth with uncle ben  well suppose she is seth dont know it silly answered rupert sharply then more politely to the master thats it seth has seen uncle ben gallivanting with cressy and thinks hes bringing her over yer dont you see  the master however did not see but one thing the girl who had only two days ago carelessly left it to him to explain a compromising situation to her motherthis girl who had precipitated him into a frontier fight to the peril of his position and her good name was calmly eating ices with an available suitor without the least concern of the past the connection was perhaps illogical but it was unpleasant it was the more awkward from the fact that he fancied that not only ruperts beautiful eyes but even the infant johnnys round ones were fixed upon him with an embarrassed expression of hesitating and foreboding sympathy  i think johnny believes what he saysdont you johnny he smiled with an assumption of cheerful ease but i see no necessity just yet for binding seth davis over to keep the peace tell me about yourself rupe i hope uncle ben doesnt think of changing his young tutor with his good fortune  no sir returned rupert brightening he promises to take me to sacramento with him as his private secretary or confidential clerk you know efefhe hesitated again with very unrupertlike caution ef things go as he wants em he stopped awkwardly and his brown eyes became clouded like ez not mr ford hes only foolin meandhimself the boys eyes sought the masters curiously  i dont know about that returned mr ford uneasily with a certain recollection of uncle bens triumph over his own incredulity he surely hasnt shown himself a fool or a boaster so far i consider your prospect a very fair one and i wish you joy of it my boy he ran his fingers through ruperts curls in his old caressing fashion the more tenderly perhaps that he fancied he still saw symptoms of stormy and wet weather in the boys brown eyes run along home both of you and dont worry yourselves about me  he turned away but had scarcely proceeded half a dozen yards before he felt a tug at his coat looking down he saw the diminutive johnny theyll be comin home thith way he said reaching up in a hoarse confidential whisper  who  crethy and im  but before the master could make any response to this presumably gratifying information johnny had rejoined his brother the two boys waved their hands towards him with the same diffident and mysterious sympathy that left him hesitating between a smile and a frown then he proceeded on his way nevertheless for no other reason than that he felt a sudden distaste to meeting any one when he reached the point where the trail descended directly to the settlement he turned into a longer and more solitary detour by the woods  the sun was already so low that its long rays pierced the forest from beneath and suffused the dim colonnade of straight pine shafts with a golden haze while it left the dense intercrossed branches fifty feet above in deeper shadow walking in this yellow twilight with his feet noiselessly treading down the yielding carpet of pine needles it seemed to the master that he was passing through the woods in a dream there was no sound but the dull intermittent double knock of the woodpecker or the drowsy croak of some early roosting bird all suggestion of the settlement with all traces of human contiguity were left far behind it was therefore with a strange and nervous sense of being softly hailed by some woodland sprite that he seemed to hear his own name faintly wafted upon the air he turned quickly it was cressy panting behind him even then in her white closely gathered skirts her bared head and graceful arching neck bent forward her flying braids freed from the straw hat which she had swung from her arm so as not to impede her flight there was so much of the following maenad about her that he was for an instant startled  he stopped she bounded to him and throwing her arms around his neck with a light laugh let herself hang for a moment breathless on his breast then recovering her speech she said slowly  i started on an injin trot after you just as you turned off the trail but youd got so far ahead while i was shaking myself clear of uncle ben that i had to jist lope the whole way through the woods to catch up she stopped and looking up into his troubled face caught his cheeks between her hands and bringing his knit brows down to the level of her humid blue eyes said you havent kissed me yet whats the matter  doesnt it strike you that i might ask that question considering that its three days since ive seen you and that you left me in a rather awkward position to explain matters to your mother he said coldly he had formulated the sentence in his mind some moments before but now that it was uttered it appeared singularly weak and impotent  thats so she said with a frank laugh burying her face in his waistcoat you see dandy boyhis pet namei reckoned for that reason wed better lie low for a day or two well she continued untying his cravat and retying it again how did you crawl out of it  do you mean to say your mother did not tell you he asked indignantly  why should she returned cressy lazily she never talks to me of these things honey  and you knew nothing about it  cressy shook her head and then winding one of her long braids around the young mans neck offered the end of it to his mouth and on his sternly declining it took it in her own  yet even her ignorance of what had really happened did not account to the master for the indifference of her long silence and albeit conscious of some inefficiency in his present unheroic attitude he continued sarcastically may i ask what you imagined would happen when you left me  well said cressy confidently i reckoned chile you could lie as well as the next man and that being gifted youd sling maw something new and purty why i aint got no fancy but i fixed up something against paws questioning me i made that conceited masters promise to swear that he was in the barn with me then i calculated to tell paw that you came meandering along just before maw popped in and that i skedaddled to join masters of course she added quickly tightening her hold of the master as he made a sudden attempt at withdrawal i didnt let on to masters why i wanted him to promise or that you were there  cressy said ford irritated beyond measure are you mad or do you think i am  the girls face changed she cast a half frightened half questioning glance at his eyes and then around the darkening aisle if were going to quarrel jack she said hurriedly dont lets do it before folks  in the name of heaven he said following her eyes indignantly what do you mean  i mean she said with a slight shiver of resignation and scorn if youoh dear if its all going to be like them lets keep it to ourselves  he gazed at her in hopeless bewilderment did she really mean that she was more frightened at the possible revelation of their disagreement than of their intimacy  come she continued tenderly still glancing however uneasily around her come well be more comfortable in the hollow its only a step still holding him by her braid she half led half dragged him away to the right was one of those sudden depressions in the ground caused by the subsidence of the earth from hidden springs and the uprooting of one or two of the larger trees when she had forced him down this declivity below the level of the needlestrewn forest floor she seated him upon a mossy root and shaking out her skirts in a half childlike half coquettish way comfortably seated herself in his lap with her arm supplementing the clinging braid around his neck  now hark to me and dont holler so loud she said turning his face to her questioning eyes whats gone of you anyway nigger boy it should be premised that cressys terms of endearment were mainly negrodialectical reminiscences of her brief babyhood her slavenurse and the only playmates she had ever known  still implacable the master coldly repeated the counts of his indictment against the girls strange indifference and still stranger entanglements winding up by setting forth the whole story of his interview with her mother his forced defence of the barn seths outspoken accusation and their silent and furious struggle in the loft but if he had expected that this daughter of a southwestern fighter would betray any enthusiasm over her lovers participation in one of their characteristic feudsif he looked for any fond praise for his own prowess he was bitterly mistaken she loosened her arm from his neck of her own accord unwound the braid and putting her two little hands clasped between her knees crossed her small feet before her and albeit still in his lap looked the picture of languid dejection  maw ought to have more sense and you ought to have lit out of the window after me she said with a lazy sigh fightin aint in your lineits too much like them that seths sure to get even with you  i can protect myself he said haughtily nevertheless he had a depressing consciousness that his lithe and graceful burden was somewhat in the way of any heroic expression  seth can lick you out of your boots chile she said with naive abstraction then as he struggled to secure an upright position dont git riled honey of course youd let them kill you before youd give in but thats their best holtthats their trade thats all they can dodont you see thats where youre not like themthats why youre not their low down kind thats why youre my boythats why i love you  she had thrown her whole weight again upon his shoulders until she had forced him back to his seat then with her locked hands again around his neck she looked intently into his face the varying color dropped from her cheeks her eyes seemed to grow larger the same look of rapt absorption and possession that had so transfigured her young face at the ball was fixed upon it now her lips parted slightly she seemed to murmur rather than speak  what are these people to us what are seths jealousies uncle bens and masterss foolishness paw and maws quarrls and tantrums to you and me dear what is it what they think what they reckon what they plan out and what they set themselves againstto us we love each other we belong to each other without their help or their hindrance from the time we first saw each other it was so and from that time paw and maw and seth and masters and even you and me dear had nothing else to do that was love as i know it not seths sneaking rages and uncle bens sneaking fooleries and masterss sneaking conceit but only love and knowing that i let seth rage and uncle ben dawdle and masters trifleand for what to keep them from me and my boy they were satisfied and we were happy  vague and unreasoning as he knew her speech to be the rapt and perfect conviction with which it was uttered staggered him  but how is this to end cressy he said passionately  the abstracted look passed and the slight color and delicate mobility of her face returned to end dandy boy she repeated lazily you didnt think of marrying medid you  he blushed stammered and said yes albeit with all his past vacillation and his present distrust of her transparent on his cheek and audible in his voice  no dear she said quietly reaching down untying her little shoe and shaking the dust and pine needles from its recesses no i dont know enough to be a wife to you just now and you know it and i couldnt keep a house fit for you and you couldnt afford to keep me without it and then it would be all known and it wouldnt be us two dear and our lonely meetings any more and we couldnt be engagedthat would be too much like me and seth over again thats what you mean dandy boyfor youre only a dandy boy you know and they dont get married to backwood southern girls who havent a nigger to bless themselves with since the war no she continued lifting her proud little head so promptly after ford had recovered from his surprise as to make the ruse of emptying her shoe perfectly palpable no thats what weve both allowed dear all along and now honey its near time for me to go tell me something goodbefore i go tell me that you love me as you used totell me how you felt that night at the ball when you first knew we loved each other but stopkiss me firstthere once morefor keeps     chapter xi   when uncle ben or benjamin daubigny esq as he was already known in the columns of the star accompanied miss cressy mckinstry on her way home after the first display of attention and hospitality since his accession to wealth and position he remained for some moments in a state of bewildered and smiling idiocy it was true that their meeting was chance and accidental it was true that cressy had accepted his attention with lazy amusement it was true that she had suddenly and audaciously left him on the borders of the mckinstry woods in a way that might have seemed rude and abrupt to any escort less invincibly goodhumored than uncle ben but none of these things marred his fatuous felicity it is even probable that in his gratuitous belief that his timid attentions had been too marked and impulsive he attributed cressys flight to a maidenly coyness that pleasurably increased his admiration for her and his confidence in himself in his abstraction of enjoyment and in the gathering darkness he ran against a firtree very much as he had done while walking with her and he confusedly apologized to it as he had to her and by her own appellation in this way he eventually overran his trail and found himself unexpectedly and apologetically in the clearing before the schoolhouse  ef this aint the singlerest thing miss he said and then stopped suddenly a faint noise in the schoolhouse like the sound of splintered wood attracted his attention the master was evidently there if he was alone he would speak to him  he went to the window looked in and in an instant his amiable abstraction left him he crept softly to the door tried it and then putting his powerful shoulder against the panel forced the lock from its fastenings he entered the room as seth davis frightened but furious lifted himself from before the masters desk which he had just broken open he had barely time to conceal something in his pocket and close the lid again before uncle ben approached him  what mouut ye be doin here seth davis he asked with the slow deliberation which in that locality meant mischief  and what mouut you be doin here mister ben dabney said seth resuming his effrontery  well returned uncle ben planting himself in the aisle before his opponent i aint doin no sheriffs posse business jest now but i reckon to keep my hand in far enuff to purtect other folks property he added with a significant glance at the broken lock of the desk  ben dabney said seth in snarling expostulation i haint got no quarll with ye  then hand me over whatever you took just now from teachers desk and well talk about that afterwards said uncle ben advancing  i tell ye i haint got no quarll with ye uncle ben continued seth retreating with a malignant sneer and when you talk of protectin other folks property mebbe yed better protect your ownor what yed like to call soinstead of quarllin with the man thats helpin ye ive got yer the proofs that that sneakin hound of a yankee schoolmaster that cress mckinstrys hell bent on and that the old man and old woman are just chuckin into her arms is a lyin blackhearted hypocritical seducer  stop said uncle ben in a voice that made the crazy casement rattle  he strode towards seth davis no longer with his habitual careful hesitating step but with a tread that seemed to shake the whole schoolroom a single dominant clutch of his powerful right hand on the young mans breast forced him backwards into the vacant chair of the master his usually florid face had grown as gray as the twilight his menacing form in a moment filled the little room and darkened the windows then in some inexplicable reaction his figure slightly drooped he laid one heavy hand tremblingly on the desk and with the other affected to wipe his mouth after his old embarrassed fashion  whats that you were sayin o cressy he said huskily  wot everybody says said the frightened seth gaining a cowardly confidence under his adversarys emotion wot every cub that sets yer under his cantin teachin and sees em together knows its wot youd hev knowed ef he and roop filgee hadnt played ye fer a softy all the time and while youve bin hangin round yer fer a flicker of cressys gownd as she prances out o school hes bin lyin low and laffin at ye and while hes turned roop over to keep you here pretendin to give ye lessons hes bin gallivantin round with her and huggin and kissin her in barns and in the brushand now you want to quarll with me  he stopped panting for breath and stared malignantly in the gray face of his hearer but uncle ben only lifted his heavy hand mildly with an awkward gesture of warning stepped softly in his old cautious hesitating manner to the open door closed it and returned gently  i reckon ye got in through the winder didnt ye seth he said with a labored affectation of unemotional ease a kind o one leg over and one two and then youre in eh  never you mind how i got in ben dabney returned seth his hostility and insolence increasing with his opponents evident weakness ez long ez i got yer and got by gd what i kem here fer for whiles all this was goin on and whiles the old fool man and old fool woman was swallowin what they did see and blinkin at what they didnt and huggin themselves that theyd got hightoned kempany fer their darter that hightoned kempany was playin them too by gd yes sir that hightoned cantin schoolteacher was keepin a married woman in frisco all the while he was here honeyfoglin with cressy and ive got the papers yer to prove it he tapped his breastpocket with a coarse laugh and thrust his face forward into the gray shadow of his adversarys  an you sorter spotted their bein in this yer desk and bursted it said uncle ben gravely examining the broken lock in the darkness as if it were the most important feature of the incident  seth nodded you bet your life i saw him through the winder only this afternoon lookin over em alone and i reckoned to lay my hands on em if i had to bust him or his desk and i did he added with a triumphant chuckle  and you didsure pop said uncle ben with slow deliberate admiration passing his heavy hand along the splintered lid and you reckon seth that this yer showin of him up will break off enythin betwixt him and this yerthis yer missmiss mckinstry he continued with labored formality  i reckon ef the old fool mckinstry dont shoot him in his tracks tharll be white men enough in injin springs to ride this hightoned pizenous hypocrit on a rail outer the settlement  thats so said uncle ben musingly after a thoughtful pause in which he still seemed to be more occupied with the broken desk than his companions remark then he went on cautiously and ez this thing orter be worked mighty fine seth praps on the hull youd better let me have them papers  what you snarled seth drawing back with a glance of angry suspicion not if i know it  seth said uncle ben resting his elbows on the desk confidentially and speaking with painful and heavy deliberation when you first interdoosed this yer subject you elluded to my hevin so to speak rights o preemption and interference with this young lady and that in your opinion i wasnt purtectin them rights it pears to me that allowin that to be gospel truth them ther papers orter be in my possessionyou hevin so to speak no rights to purtect bein off the board with this yer young lady and bein moved ginrally by free and independent cussedness and ez i sed afore this sort o thing havin to be worked mighty fine and them papers manniperlated with judgment i reckon seth if you dont objeck ill hevhevto trouble you  seth started to his feet with a rapid glance at the door but uncle ben had risen again with the same alarming expression of completely filling the darkened schoolroom and of shaking the floor beneath him at the slightest movement already he fancied he saw uncle bens powerful arm hovering above him ready to descend it suddenly occurred to him that if he left the execution of his scheme of exposure and vengeance to uncle ben the onus of stealing the letters would fall equally upon their possessor this advantage seemed more probable than the danger of uncle bens weakly yielding them up to the master in the latter case he seth could still circulate the report of having seen the letters which uncle ben had himself stolen in a fit of jealousya hypothesis the more readily accepted from the latters familiar knowledge of the schoolhouse and his presumed ambitious jealousy of cressy in his present attitude as a man of position with affected reluctance and hesitation he put his hand to his breastpocket  of course he said if youre kalkilatin to take up the quarll on your rights and ez cressy aint anythin more to me you orter hev the proofs only dont trust them into that hounds hands once he gets em again hell secure a warrant agin you for stealin thatll be his game id show em to her firstdont ye seeand i reckon ef shes old maam mckinstrys darter shell make it lively for him  he handed the letters to the looming figure before him it seemed to become again a yielding mortal and said in a hesitating voice praps youd better make tracks outer this seth and leave me yer to put things to rights and fix up that door and the desk agin tomorrow mornin hed better not know it to onct and so start a row about bein broken into  the proposition seemed to please seth he even extended his hand in the darkness but he met only an irresponsive void with a slight shrug of his shoulders and a grunting farewell he felt his way to the door and disappeared for a few moments it seemed as if uncle ben had also deserted the schoolhouse so profound and quiet was the hush that fell upon it but as the eye became accustomed to the shadow a grayish bulk appeared to grow out of it over the masters desk and shaped itself into the broad figure of uncle ben later when the moon rose and looked in at the window it saw him as the master had seen him on the first day he had begun his lessons in the schoolhouse with his face bent forward over the desk and the same look of childlike perplexity and struggle that he had worn at his allotted task unheroic ridiculous and no doubt blundering and idiotic as then but still vaguely persistent in his thought he remained for some moments in this attitude then rising and taking advantage of the moonlight that flooded the desk he set himself to mend the broken lock with a large mechanical claspknife he produced from his pocket and the aid of his workmanlike thumb and finger presently he began to whistle softly at first a little artificially and with relapses of reflective silence the lock of the desk restored he secured into position again that part of the doorlock which he had burst off in his entrance this done he closed the door gently and once more stepped out into the moonlit clearing in replacing his knife in his pocket he took out the letters which he had not touched since they were handed to him in the darkness his first glance at the handwriting caused him to stop then still staring at it he began to move slowly and automatically backwards to the porch when he reached it he sat down unfolded the letter and without attempting to read it turned its pages over and over with the unfamiliarity of an illiterate man in search of the signature this when found apparently plunged him again into motionless abstraction only once he changed his position to pull up the legs of his trousers open his knees and extend the distance between his feet and then with the unfolded pages carefully laid in the moonlit space thus opened before him regarded them with dubious speculation at the end of ten minutes he rose with a sigh of physical and mental relaxation refolded the letter put it in his pocket and made his way to the town  when he reached the hotel he turned into the barroom and observing that it happened to be comparatively deserted asked for a glass of whiskey in response to the barkeepers glance of curiosityas uncle ben seldom drank and then only as a social function with othershe explained  i reckon straight whiskey is about ez good ez the next thing for blind chills  the barkeeper here interposed that in his larger medical experience he had found the exhibition of ginger in combination with gin attended with effect although it was evident that in his business capacity he regarded uncle ben as a drinker with distrust  ye aint seen mr ford hanging round yer lately continued uncle ben with laborious ease  the barkeeper with his eye still scornfully fixed on his customer but his hands which were engaged in washing his glasses under the counter giving him the air of humorously communicating with a hidden confederate had not seen the schoolmaster that afternoon  uncle ben turned away and slowly mounted the staircase to the masters room after a moments pause on the landing which must have been painfully obvious to any one who heard his heavy ascent he gave two timid raps on the door which were equally ridiculous in contrast with his powerful tread the door was opened promptly by the master  oh its you is it he said shortly come in  uncle ben entered without noticing the somewhat ungracious form of invitation it war me he said dropped in not finding ye downstairs lets have a drink  the master gazed at uncle ben who owing to his abstraction had not yet wiped his mouth of the liquor he had imperfectly swallowed and was in consequence more redolent of whiskey than a confirmed toper he rang the bell for the desired refreshment with a slightly cynical smile he was satisfied that his visitor like many others of humble position was succumbing to his good fortune  i wanted to see ye mr ford he began taking an unproffered chair and depositing his hat after some hesitation outside the door in regard to what i onct told ye about my wife in mizzouri praps you disremember  i remember returned the master resignedly  you know it was that arternoon that fool stacey sent the sheriff and the harrisons over to mckinstrys barn  go on petulantly said the master who had his own reasons for not caring to recall it  it was that arternoon you know that you hadnt time to hark to mehevin to go off on an engagement continued uncle ben with protracted deliberation and  yes yes i remember interrupted the master exasperatedly and really unless you get on faster ill have to leave you again  it was that arternoon said uncle ben without heeding him when i told you i hadnt any idea what had become o my wife ez i left in mizzouri  yes said the master sharply and i told you it was your bounden duty to look for her  thats so said uncle ben nodding comfortably thems your very words ony a leetle more strong than that ef i dont disremember well i reckon ive got an idee the master assumed a sudden expression of interest but uncle ben did not vary his monotonous tone  i kem across that idee so to speak on the trail i kem across it in some letters ez was lying wide open in the brush i picked em up and ive got em here  he slowly took the letters from his pocket with one hand while he dragged the chair on which he was sitting beside the master but with a quick flush of indignation mr ford rose and extended his hand  these are my letters dabney he said sternly stolen from my desk who has dared to do this  but uncle ben had as if accidentally interposed his elbow between the master and seths spoils  then its all right he returned deliberately i brought em here because i thought they might give an idee where my wife was for them letters is in her own handwrite you remember ez i told ez how she was a scollard  the master sat back in his chair white and dumb incredible extraordinary and utterly unlooked for as was this revelation he felt instinctively that it was true  i couldnt read it myselfez you know i didnt keer to ax any one else to read it for meyou kin reckon why too and thats why im troublin you tonight mr fordez a friend  the master with a desperate effort recovered his voice it is impossible the lady who wrote those letters does not bear your name more than that he added with hasty irrelevance she is so free that she is about to be married as you might have read you have made a mistake the handwriting may be like but it cannot be really your wifes  uncle ben shook his head slowly its herntheres no mistake when a man mr ford hez studied that handwritehavin so to speak knowed it ony from the outsidefrom seein it passin like between friendsthat mans chances o bein mistook aint ez great ez the mans who ony takes in the sense of the words that might blong to everybody and her name not bein the same ez mine dont foller ef she got a divorce shed take her old gals namethe name of her fammerly and that would seem to allow she did get a divorce what mowt she hev called herself when she writ this  the master saw his opportunity and rose to it with a chivalrous indignation that for the moment imposed even upon himself i decline to answer that question he said angrily i refuse to allow the name of any woman who honors me with her confidence to be dragged into the infamous outrage that has been committed upon me and common decency and i shall hold the thief and scoundrelwhoever he may beanswerable to myself in the absence of her natural protector  uncle ben surveyed the hero of these glittering generalities with undisguised admiration he extended his hand to him gravely  shake ef another proof was wantin mr ford of that bein my wifes letter he said that hightoned style of yours would settle it for ef thar was one thing she did like it was that sort of potry and one reason why her and me didnt get on and why i skedaddled was because it wasnt in my line ets all in trainin ony a man ez had the fourth reader at his fingers ends could talk like that bein brought up on dobellez is nowhereit sorter lets me outer you ez it did outer her but allowin it aint the square thing for you to mention her name that wouldnt be nothin agin my doin it and callin her welllou price in a keerless sort o way eh  i decline to answer further replied the master quickly although his color had changed at the name i decline to say another word on the matter until this mystery is cleared upuntil i know who dared to break into my desk and steal my property and the purpose of this unheardof outrage and i demand possession of those letters at once  uncle ben without a word put them in the masters hand to his slight surprise and it must be added to his faint discomfiture nor was it decreased when uncle ben added with grave naivete and a patronizing pressure of his hand on his shoulderin course ez youre taken it on to yourself and ez lou price aint got no further call on me they orter be yours ez to who got em outer the desk i reckon you aint got no suspicion of any one spyin round yehev ye  in an instant the recollection of seth daviss face at the window and the corroboration of ruperts warning flashed across fords mind the hypothesis that seth had imagined that they were cressys letters and had thrown them down without reading them when he had found out his mistake seemed natural for if he had read them he would undoubtedly have kept them to show to cressy the complex emotions that had disturbed the master on the discovery of uncle bens relationship to the writer of the letters were resolving themselves into a furious rage at seth but before he dared revenge himself he must be first assured that seth was ignorant of their contents he turned to uncle ben  i have a suspicion but to make it certain i must ask you for the present to say nothing of this to any one  uncle ben nodded and when you hev found out and youre settled in your mind that you kin make my mind easy about this yer lou price ez well call her bein divorced squarely and bein so to speak in the way o gettin married agin ye might let me know ez a friend i reckon i wont trouble you any more tonightonless you and me takes another sociable drink together in the bar no well then goodnight he moved slowly towards the door with his hand on the lock he added ef yer writin to her agin you might say ez how you found me lookin well and comfable and hopin shes enjyin the same blessin so long  he disappeared leaving the master in a hopeless collapse of conflicting and it is to be feared not very heroic emotions the situation which had begun so dramatically had become suddenly unromantically ludicrous without however losing any of its embarrassing quality he was conscious that he occupied the singular position of being more ridiculous than the husbandwhose invincible and complacent simplicity stung him like the most exquisite irony for an instant he was almost goaded into the fury of declaring that he had broken off from the writer of the letters forever but its inconsistency with the chivalrous attitude he had just taken occurred to him in time to prevent him from becoming doubly absurd his rage with seth davis seemed to him the only feeling left that was genuine and rational and yet now that uncle ben had gone even that had a spurious ring it was necessary for him to lash himself into a fury over the hypothesis that the letters might have been cressys and desecrated by that scoundrels touch perhaps he had read them and left them to be picked up by others he looked over them carefully to see if their meaning would to the ordinary reader appear obvious and compromising his eye fell on the first paragraph  i should not be quite fair with you jack if i affected to disbelieve in your faith in your love for me and its endurance but i should be still more unfair if i didnt tell you what i honestly believe that at your age you are apt to deceive yourself and without knowing it to deceive others you confess you have not yet decided upon your career and you are always looking forward so hopefully dear jack for a change in the future but you are willing to believe that far more serious things than that will suffer no change in the mean time if we continued as we were i who am older than you and have more experience might learn the misery of seeing you change towards me as i have changed towards another and for the same reason if i were sure i could keep pace with you in your dreams and your ambition if i were sure that i always knew what they were we might still be happybut i am not sure and i dare not again risk my happiness on an uncertainty in coming to my present resolution i do not look for happiness but at least i know i shall not suffer disappointment nor involve others in it i confess i am growing too old not to feel the value to a womana necessity to her in this countryof security in her present and future position another can give me that and although you may call this a selfish view of our relations i believe that you will soonif you do not even as you read this nowfeel the justice of it and thank me for taking it  with a smile of scorn he tore up the letter in what he fondly believed was the bitterness of an outraged trustful nature forgetting that for many weeks he had scarcely thought of its writer and that he himself in his conduct had already anticipated its truths     chapter xii   the master awoke the next morning albeit after a restless night with that clarity of conscience and perception which it is to be feared is more often the consequence of youth and a perfect circulation than of any moral conviction or integrity he argued with himself that as the only party really aggrieved in the incident of the previous night the right of remedy remained with him solely and under the benign influence of an early breakfast and the fresh morning air he was inclined to feel less sternly even towards seth davis in any event he must first carefully weigh the evidence against him and examine the scene of the outrage closely for this purpose he had started for the schoolhouse fully an hour before his usual time he was even lighthearted enough to recognize the humorous aspect of uncle bens appeal to him and his own ludicrously paradoxical attitude and as he at last passed from the dreary flat into the fringe of upland pines he was smiling well for him perhaps that he was no more affected by any premonition of the day before him than the lately awakened birds that lightly cut the still sleeping woods around him in their long flashing sabrecurves of flight a yellowthroat destined to become the breakfast of a lazy hawk still swinging above the river was especially moved to such a causeless and idiotic roulade of mirth that the master listening to the foolish bird was fain to whistle too he presently stopped however with a slight embarrassment for a few paces before him cressy had unexpectedly appeared  she had evidently been watching for him but not with her usual indolent confidence there was a strained look of the muscles of her mouth as of some past repression and a shaded hollow under her temples beneath the blonde rings of her shorter hair her habitually slow steady eye was troubled and she cast a furtive glance around her before she searched him with her glance without knowing why yet vaguely fearing that he did he became still more embarrassed and in the very egotism of awkwardness stammered without a further salutation a disgraceful thing has happened last night and im up early to find the perpetrator my desk was broken into and  i know it she interrupted with a halfimpatient half uneasy putting away of the subject with her little handtheredont go all over it again paw and maw have been at me about it all nightever since those harrisons in their anxiousness to make up their quarrel rushed over with the news im tired of it  for an instant he was staggered how much had she learned with the same awkward indirectness he said vaguely but it might have been your letters you know  but it wasnt she said simply it ought to have been i wish it hadshe stopped and again regarded him with a strange expression well she said slowly what are you going to do  to find out the scoundrel who has done this he said firmly and punish him as he deserves  the almost imperceptible shrug that had raised her shoulders gave way as she regarded him with a look of wearied compassion  no she said gravely you cannot theyre too many for you you must go away at once  never he said indignantly even if it were not a cowardice it would be morea confession  not more than they already know she said wearily but i tell you you must go i have sneaked out of the house and run here all the way to warn you if youyou care for me jackyou will go  i should be a traitor to you if i did he said quickly i shall stay  but ififjackifshe drew nearer him with a newfound timidity and then suddenly placed her two hands upon his shoulders ififjacki were to go with you  the old rapt eager look of possession had come back to her face now her lips were softly parted yet even then she seemed to be waiting some reply more potent than that syllabled on the lips of the man before her  howbeit that was the only response darling he said kissing her but wouldnt that justify them  stop she said suddenly then putting her hand over his mouth she continued with the same halfweary expression dont let us go over all that again either it is so tiresome listen dear youll do one or two little things for mewont you dandy boy dont linger long at the schoolhouse after lessons go right home dont look after these men todaytomorrow saturday is your holidayyou knowand youll have more time keep to yourself today as much as you can dear for twelve hoursuntiluntilyou hear from me you know it will be all right then she added lifting her eyelids with a sudden odd resemblance to her fathers look of drowsy pain which ford had never noticed before promise me that dear wont you  with a mental reservation he promised hurriedlypreoccupied in his wonder why she seemed to avoid his explanation in his desire to know what had happened in the pride that had kept him from asking more or volunteering a defence and in his still haunting sense of having been wronged yet he could not help saying as he caught and held her hand  you have not doubted me cressy you have not allowed this infamous raking up of things that are past and gone to alter your feelings  she looked at him abstractedly you think it might alter anybodys feelings then  nobodys who really loved anotherhe stammered  dont let us talk of it any more she said suddenly stretching out her arms lifting them above her head with a wearied gesture and then letting them fall clasped before her in her old habitual fashion it makes my head ache what with paw and maw and the rest of themim sick of it all  she turned away as ford drew back coldly and let her hand fall from his arm she took a few steps forward stopped ran back to him again crushed his face and head in a close embrace and then seemed to dip like a bird into the tall bracken and was gone  the master stood for some moments chagrined and bewildered it was characteristic of his temperament that he had paid less heed to what she told him than what he imagined had passed between her mother and herself she was naturally jealous of the lettershe could forgive her for that she had doubtless been twitted about them but he could easily explain them to her parentsas he would have done to her but he was not such a fool as to elope with her at such a moment without first clearing his characterand knowing more of hers and it was equally characteristic of him that in his sense of injury he confounded her with the writer of the lettersas sympathizing with his correspondent in her estimate of his character and was quite carried away with the belief that he was equally wronged by both  it was not until he reached the schoolhouse that the evidences of last nights outrage for a time distracted his mind from his singular interview he was struck with the workmanlike manner in which the locks had been restored and the care that had evidently been taken to remove the more obvious and brutal traces of burglary this somewhat staggered his theory that seth davis was the perpetrator mechanical skill and thoughtfulness were not among the louts characteristics but he was still more disconcerted on pushing back his chair to find a small indiarubber tobacco pouch lying beneath it the master instantly recognized it he had seen it a hundred times beforeit was uncle bens it was not there when he had closed the room yesterday afternoon either uncle ben had been there last night or had anticipated him this morning but in the latter case he would scarcely have overlooked his fallen propertythat in the darkness of the night might have readily escaped detection his brow darkened with a sudden conviction that it was uncle ben who was the real and only offender and that his simplicity of the previous night was part of his deception a sickening sense that he had been again dupedbut why or to what purpose he hardly dared to thinkovercame him who among these strange people could he ever again trust after the fashion of more elevated individuals he had accepted the respect and kindness of those he believed his inferiors as a natural tribute to his own superiority any change in their feelings must therefore be hypocrisy or disloyalty it never occurred to him that he might have fallen below their standard  the arrival of the children and the resumption of his duties for a time diverted him but although the mornings exercise restored the masters selfconfidence it cannot be said to have improved his judgment disdaining to question rupert filgee as the possible confidant of uncle ben he answered the curious inquiries of the children as to the broken doorlock with the remark that it was a matter that he should have to bring before the trustees of the board and by the time that school was over and the pupils dismissed he had quite resolved upon this formal disposition of it in spite of cressys warningrather because of itin the new attitude he had taken towards her and her friends he lingered in the schoolhouse until late he had occupied himself in drawing up a statement of the facts with an intimation that his continuance in the school would depend upon a rigid investigation of the circumstances when he was aroused by the clatter of horses hoofs the next moment the schoolhouse was surrounded by a dozen men  he looked up half of them dismounted and entered the room the other half remained outside darkening the windows with their motionless figures each man carried a gun before him on the saddle each man wore a rude mask of black cloth partly covering his face  although the master was instinctively aware that he was threatened by serious danger he was far from being impressed by the arms and disguise of his mysterious intruders on the contrary the obvious and glaring inconsistency of this cheaply theatrical invasion of the peaceful schoolhouse of this opposition of menacing figures to the scattered childish primers and textbooks that still lay on the desks around him only extracted from him a half scornful smile as he coolly regarded them the fearlessness of ignorance is often as unassailable as the most experienced valor and the aweinspiring invaders were at first embarrassed and then humanly angry a lank figure to the right made a forward movement of impotent rage but was checked by the evident leader of the party  ef he likes to take it that way there aint no regulators law agin it i reckon he said in a voice which the master instantly recognized as jim harrisons though ez a ginral thing they dont usually find it fun then turning to the master he added mister ford ef thats the name you go by everywhere were wantin a man about your size  ford knew that he was in hopeless peril he knew that he was physically defenceless and at the mercy of twelve armed and lawless men but he retained a preternatural clearness of perception and audacity born of unqualified scorn for his antagonists with a feminine sharpness of tongue in a voice which astonished even himself by its contemptuous distinctness he said my name is ford but as i only suppose your name is harrison perhaps youll be fair enough to take that rag from your face and show it to me like a man  the man removed the mask from his face with a slight laugh  thank you said ford now perhaps you will tell me which one of you gentlemen broke into the schoolhouse forced the lock of my desk and stole my papers if he is here i wish to tell him he is not only a thief but a cur and a coward for the letters are a womanswhom he neither knows nor has the right to know  if he had hoped to force a personal quarrel and trust his life to the chance of a single antagonist he was disappointed for although his unexpected attitude had produced some effect among the group and even attracted the attention of the men at the windows harrison strode deliberately towards him  that kin wait he said jest now we propose to take you and your letters and drop em and you outer this yer township of injin springs you kin take em back to the woman or critter you got em of but we kalkilate youre a little too handy and free in them sorter things to teach school round yer and we kinder allow we dont keer to hev our gals and boys eddicated up to your hightoned standard so ef you choose to kem along easy well mak you comfble on a hoss weve got waitin outside an escort you across the line ef you dontwell take you anyway  the master cast a rapid glance around him in his quickness of perception he had already noted that the led horse among the cavalcade was fastened by a lariat to one of the riders so that escape by flight was impossible and that he had not a single weapon to defend himself with or even provoke in his desperation the struggle that could forestall ignominy by death nothing was left him but his voice clear and trenchant as he faced them  you are twelve to one he said calmly but if there is a single man among you who dare step forward and accuse me of what you only together dare do i will tell him he is a liar and a coward and stand here ready to make it good against him you come here as judge and jury condemning me without trial and confronting me with no accusers you come here as lawless avengers of your honor and you dare not give me the privilege of as lawlessly defending my own  there was another slight murmur among the men but the leader moved impatiently forward weve had enough o your preachin we want you he said roughly come  stop said a dull voice  it came from a mute figure which had remained motionless among the others every eye was turned upon it as it rose and lazily pushed the cloth from its face  hiram mckinstry said the others in mingled tones of astonishment and suspicion  thats me said mckinstry coming forward with heavy deliberation i joined this yer delegation at the crossroads instead o my brother who had the call i reckon ets all the sameor mebbe better for i perpose to take this yer gentleman off your hands  he lifted his slumbrous eyes for the first time to the master and at the same time put himself between him and harrison i perpose he continued to take him at his word i perpose ter give him a chance to answer with a gun and ez i reckon by all accounts theres no man yer ez hez a better right than me i perpose to be the man to put that question to him in the same way et may not suit some gents he continued slowly facing an angry exclamation from the lank figure behind him ez would prefer to hev eleven men to take up their private quolls but even then i reckon that the man who is the most injured hez the right to the first say and that mans me  with a careful deliberation that had a double significance to the malcontents he handed his own rifle to the master and without looking at him continued i reckon sir youve seen that afore but ef it aint quite to your hand any of those gents i kalkilate will be hightoned enuff to giv you the chyce o theirs and theres no need o trapsin beyon the township lines to fix this yer affair i perpose to do it in ten minutes in the brush yonder  whatever might have been the feelings and intentions of the men around him the precedence of mckinstrys right to the duello was a principle too deeply rooted in their traditions to deny if any resistance to it had been contemplated by some of them the fact that the master was now armed and that mr mckinstry would quickly do battle at his side with a revolver in defence of his rights checked any expression they silently drew back as the master and mckinstry slowly passed out of the schoolhouse together and then followed in their rear in that interval the master turned to mckinstry and said in a low voice i accept your challenge and thank you for it you have never done me a greater kindnesswhatever i have done to youyet i want you to believe that neither now nor theni meant you any harm  ef you mean by that sir that ye reckon ye wont return my fire yere blind and wrong for it will do you no good with them he said with a significant wave of his crippled hand towards the following crowd nor me neither  firmly resolved however that he would not fire at mckinstry and clinging blindly to this which he believed was the last idea of his foolish life he continued on without another word until they reached the open strip of chemisal that flanked the clearing  the rude preliminaries were soon settled the parties armed with rifles were to fire at the word from a distance of eighty yards and then approach each other continuing the fight with revolvers until one or the other fell the selection of seconds was effected by the elder harrison acting for mckinstry and after a moments delay by the volunteering of the long lank figure previously noted to act for the master preoccupied by other thoughts mr ford paid little heed to his selfelected supporter who to the others seemed to be only taking that method of showing his contempt for mckinstrys recent insult the master received the rifle mechanically from his hand and walked to position he noticed however and remembered afterwards that his second was half hidden by the trunk of a large pine to his right that marked the limit of the ground  in that supreme moment it must be recorded albeit against all preconceived theory that he did not review his past life was not illuminated by a flash of remorseful or sentimental memory and did not commend his soul to his maker but that he was simply and keenly alive to the very actual present in which he still existed and to his one idea of not firing at his adversary and if anything could render his conduct more theoretically incorrect it was a certain exalted sense that he was doing quite right and was not only not a bad sort of fellow but one whom his survivors might possibly regret  are you ready gentlemen onetwothreefi      the explosions were singularly simultaneousso remarkable in fact that it seemed to the master that his rifle fired in the air had given a double report a light wreath of smoke lay between him and his opponent he was unhurtso evidently was his adversary for the voice rose again  advance    hallo there stop  he looked up quickly to see mckinstry stagger and then fall heavily to the ground  with an exclamation of horror the first and only terrible emotion he had felt he ran to the fallen man as harrison reached his side at the same moment  for gods sake he said wildly throwing himself on his knees beside mckinstry what has happened for i swear to you i never aimed at you i fired in the air speak tell him you he turned with a despairing appeal to harrison you must have seen it alltell him it was not me  a half wondering half incredulous smile passed quickly over harrisons face in course you didnt mean it he said dryly but let that slide get up and get away from yer while you kin he added impatiently with a significant glance at one or two men who lingered after the sudden and general dispersion of the crowd at mckinstrys fall getwill ye  never said the young man passionately until he knows that it was not my hand that fired that shot  mckinstry painfully struggled to his elbow it took me yere he said with a slow deliberation as if answering some previous question and pointing to his hip and it kinder let me down when i started forward at the second call  but it was not i who did it mckinstry i swear it hear me for gods sake say you believe me  mckinstry turned his drowsy troubled eyes upon the master as if he were vaguely recalling something stand back thar a minit will ye he said to harrison with a languid wave of his crippled hand i want ter speak to this yer man  harrison drew back a few paces and the master sought to take the wounded mans hand but he was stopped by a gesture where hev you put cressy mckinstry said slowly  i dont understand you stammered ford  where are you hidin her from me repeated mckinstry with painful distinctness whar hev you run her to that youre reckonin to jine her arterarterthis  i am not hiding her i am not going to her i do not know where she is i have not seen her since we parted early this morning without a word of meeting again said the master rapidly yet with a bewildered astonishment that was obvious even to the dulled faculties of his hearer  that war true asked mckinstry laying his hand upon the masters shoulder and bringing his dull eyes to the level of the young mans  it is the whole truth said ford fervently and true also that i never raised my hand against you  mckinstry beckoned to harrison and the two others who had joined him and then sank partly back with his hand upon his side where the slow empurpling of his red shirt showed the slight ooze of a deeplyseated wound  you fellers kin take me over to the ranch he said calmly and let him pointing to ford ride your best hoss fer the doctor i dont he continued in grave explanation ginrally use a doctor but this yer is suthin outside the old womans regular gait he paused and then drawing the masters head down towards him he added in his ear when i get to hev a look at the size and shape o this yer ball thats in my hip illillillbealittle more kam a gleam of dull significance struggled into his eye the master evidently understood him for he rose quickly ran to the horse mounted him and dashed off for medical assistance while mckinstry closing his heavy lids anticipated this lookedfor calm by fainting gently away     chapter xiii   of the various sentimental fallacies entertained by adult humanity in regard to childhood none are more ingeniously inaccurate and gratuitously idiotic than a comfortable belief in its profound ignorance of the events in which it daily moves and the motives and characters of the people who surround it yet even the occasional revelations of an enfant terrible are as nothing compared to the perilous secrets which a discreet infant daily buttons up or secures with a hookandeye or even fastens with a safetypin across its gentle bosom society can never cease to be grateful for that tact and considerationqualities more often joined with childish intuition and perception than with matured observationthat they owe to it and the most accomplished man or woman of the great world might take a lesson from this little audience who receive from their lips the lie they feel too palpable with roundeyed complacency or outwardly accept as moral and genuine the hollow sentiment they have overheard rehearsed in private for their benefit  it was not strange therefore that the little people of the indian spring school knew perhaps more of the real relations of cressy mckinstry to her admirers than the admirers themselves not that this knowledge was outspokenfor children rarely gossip in the grownup senseor even communicable by words intelligent to the matured intellect a whisper a laugh that often seemed vague and unmeaning conveyed to each other a world of secret significance and an apparently senseless burst of merriment in which the whole class joined and that the adult critic set down to animal spiritsa quality much more rare with children than generally supposedwas only a sympathetic expression of some discovery happily oblivious to older preoccupation the childish simplicity of uncle ben perhaps appealed more strongly to their sympathy and although for that very reason they regarded him with no more respect than they did each other he was at times carelessly admitted to their confidence it was especially rupert filgee who extended a kind of patronizing protectorate over himnot unmixed with doubts of his sanity in spite of the promised confidential clerkship he was to receive from his hands  on the day of the events chronicled in the preceding chapter rupert on returning from school was somewhat surprised to find uncle ben perched upon the railfence before the humble door of the filgee mansion and evidently awaiting him slowly dismounting as rupert and johnny approached he beamed upon the former for some moments with arch and yet affable mystery  roopy old man i spose yeve got yer duds all ready in yer pack eh  a flush of pleasure passed over the boys handsome face he cast however a hurried look down on the allpervading johnny  cause ye see we kalkilate to take the down stage to sacramento at four oclock continued uncle ben enjoying ruperts half sceptical surprise ye enter into office so to speak with me at that hour when the sellery seventyfive dollars a month and board ez private and confidential clerk beginseh  ruperts dimples deepened in charming almost feminine embarrassment but dad he stammered  ets all right with him hes agreeable  but  uncle ben followed ruperts glance at johnny who however appeared to be absorbed in the pattern of uncle bens new trousers  thats fixed he said with a meaning smile theres a sort o bonus we pays down you knowfor a chinyman to do the odd jobs  and teachermr forddid ye tell him said rupert brightening  uncle ben coughed slightly hes agreeable too i reckon that is he wiped his mouth meditatively he ez good ez allowed it in ginral conversation a week ago roop  a swift shadow of suspicion darkened the boys brown eyes is anybody else goin with us he said quickly  not this yer trip replied uncle ben complacently ye see roop he continued drawing him aside with an air of comfortable mystery this yer bizness blongs to the private and confidential branch of the office from informashun weve received  we interrupted rupert  we thats the office you know continued uncle ben with a heavy assumption of business formality wot weve received per several hands and consigneewethats you and me roopwe goes down to sacramento to inquire into the standin of a certing party as per invoice and ter seeter seeter negotiate you know ter find out if shes married or divorced he concluded quickly as if abandoning for the moment his business manner in consideration of ruperts inexperience were to find out her standin roop he began again with a more judicious blending of ease and technicality and her contracts if any and where she lives and her way o life and examine her books and papers ez to marriages and sich and arbitrate with her ginrally in conversationyou inside the house and me out on the pavement ready to be called in if an interview with business principals is desired  observing rupert somewhat perplexed and confused with these technicalities he tactfully abandoned them for the present and consulting a pocketbook said ive made a memorandum of some pints that well talk over on the journey again charged rupert to be punctually at the stage office with his carpetbag and cheerfully departed  when he had disappeared johnny filgee without a single word of explanation fell upon his brother and at once began a violent attack of kicks and blows upon his legs and other easily accessible parts of his person accompanying his assault with unintelligible gasps and actions finally culminating in a flood of tears and the casting of himself on his back in the dust with the copperfastened toes of his small boots turning imaginary wheels in the air rupert received these characteristic marks of despairing and outraged affection with great forbearance only saying there now johnny quit that and eventually bearing him still struggling into the house here johnny declaring that he would kill any chinyman that offered to dress him and burn down the house after his brothers infamous desertion of it rupert was constrained to mingle a few nervous excited tears with his brothers outbreak whereat johnny admitting the alleviation of an orange a fourbladed knife and the reversionary interest in much of ruperts personal property became more subdued sitting there with their arms entwined about each other the sunlight searching the shiftless desolation of their motherless home the few cheap playthings they had known lying around them they beguiled themselves with those charming illusions of their future intentions common to their yearsillusions they only half believed themselves and half accepted of each other rupert was quite certain that he would return in a few days with a gold watch and a present for johnny and johnny with a baleful vision of never seeing him again and a catching breath magnificently undertook to bring in the wood and build the fire and wash the dishes all of himself and then there were a few childish confidences regarding their absent fatherthen ingenuously playing poker in the magnolia saloonthat might have made that publicspirited genial companion somewhat uncomfortable and more tears that were half smiling and some brave silences that were wholly pathetic and then the hour for ruperts departure all too suddenly arrived they separated with ostentatious whooping and then johnny suddenly overcome with the dreadfulness of all earthly things and the hollowness of life generally instantly resolved to run away  to do this he prepared himself with a purposeless hatchet an inconsistent but longtreasured lump of putty and all the sugar that was left in the cracked sugarbowl thus accoutred he sallied forth first to remove all traces of his hated existence that might be left in his desk at school if the master were there he would say rupert had sent him if he wasnt he would climb in at the window the sun was already sinking when he reached the clearing and found a cavalcade of armed men around the building  johnnys first conviction was that the master had killed uncle ben or masters and that the men taking advantage of the absence of hisjohnnysbig brother were about to summarily execute him observing no struggle from within his second belief was that the master had been suddenly elected governor of california and was about to start with a state escort from the schoolhouse and that he johnny was in time to see the procession but when the master appeared with mckinstry followed by part of the crowd afoot this quickwitted child of the frontier from his secure outlook in the brush gathered enough from their fragmentary speech to guess the serious purport of their errand and thrill with anticipation and slightly creepy excitement  a duel a thing hitherto witnessed only by grownup men afterwards swaggering with importance and strange technical bloodthirsty words and now for the first time reserved for a boyand that boy him johnnyto behold in all its fearful completeness a duel of which he johnny meanly abandoned by his brother was now exalted perhaps to be the only survivor he could scarcely credit his senses it was too much  to creep through the brush while the preliminaries were being settled reach a certain silver fir on the appointed ground and with the aid of his now lucky hatchet climb unseen to its upper boughs was an exciting and difficult task but one eventually overcome by his short but energetic legs here he could not only see all that occurred but by a fortunate chance the large pine next to him had been selected as the limit of the ground the sharp eyes of the boy had long since penetrated the disguises of the remaining masked men and when the long lank figure of the masters selfappointed second took up its position beneath the pines in full view of him although hidden from the spectators johnny instantly recognized it to be none other than seth davis the manifest inconsistency of his appearance as mr fords second with what johnny knew of his relations to the master was the one thing that firmly fixed the incident in the boys memory  the men were already in position harrison stepped forward to give the word johnnys downhanging legs tingled with cramp and excitement why didnt they begin what were they waiting for what if it were interrupted orterrible thoughtmade up at the last moment would they holler out when they were hit or stagger round convulsively as they did at the cirkiss would they all run away afterwards and leave johnny alone to tell the tale andhorrible thoughtwould any body believe him would rupert rupert had he ony knowed this he wouldnt have gone away  one  with a childs perfect faith in the invulnerable superiority of his friends he had not even looked at the master but only at his destined victim yet as the word two rang out johnnys attention was suddenly attracted to the surprising fact that the masters second seth davis had also drawn a pistol and from behind his tree was deliberately and stealthily aiming at mckinstry he understood it all nowhe was a friend of the masters bully for seth  three  crack ziip crackle what a funny noise and yet he was obliged to throw himself flat upon the bough to keep from falling it seemed to have snapped beneath him and benumbed his right leg he did not know that the masters bullet fired in the air had ranged along the bough stripping the bark throughout its length and glancing with halfspent force to inflict a slight flesh wound on his leg  he was giddy and a little frightened and he had seen nobody hit nor nothin it was all a humbug seth had disappeared so had the others there was a faint sound of voices and something like a group in the distancethat was all it was getting dark too and his leg was still asleep but warm and wet he would get down this was very difficult for his leg would not wake up and but for the occasional support he got by striking his hatchet in the tree he would have fallen in descending when he reached the ground his leg began to pain and looking down he saw that his stocking and shoe were soaked with blood  his small and dirty handkerchief a hard wad in his pocket was insufficient to staunch the flow with a vague recollection of a certain poultice applied to a boil on his fathers neck he collected a quantity of soft moss and dried yerba buena leaves and with the aid of his check apron and of one of his torn suspenders tightly wound round the whole mass achieved a bandage of such elephantine proportions that he could scarcely move with it in fact like most imaginative children he became slightly terrified at his own alarming precautions nevertheless although a word or an outcry from him would have at that moment brought the distant group to his assistance a certain respect to himself and his brother kept him from uttering even a whimper of weakness  yet he found refuge oddly enough in a suppressed but bitter denunciation of the other boys of his acquaintance what was cal harrison doing while he johnny was alone in the woods wounded in a grownup duelfor nothing would convince this doughty infant that he had not been an active participant where was jimmy snyder that he didnt come to his assistance with the other fellers cowards all they were afraid ho ho and he johnny wasnt afraid hohe didnt mind it nevertheless he had to repeat the phrase two or three times until after repeated struggles to move forward through the brush he at last sank down exhausted by this time the distant group had slowly moved away carrying something between them and leaving johnny alone in the fast coming darkness yet even this desertion did not affect him as strongly as his implicit belief in the cowardly treachery of his old associates  it grew darker and darker until the open theatre of the late conflict appeared enclosed in funereal walls a cool searching breath of air that seemed to have crept through the bracken and undergrowth like a stealthy animal lifted the curls on his hot forehead he grasped his hatchet firmly as against possible wild beasts and as a medicinal and remedial precaution took another turn with his suspender around his bandage it occurred to him then that he would probably die they would all feel exceedingly sorry and alarmed and regret having made him wash himself on saturday night they would attend his funeral in large numbers in the little graveyard where a white tombstone inscribed to john filgee fell in a duel at the age of seven would be awaiting him he would forgive his brother his father and mr ford yet even then he vaguely resented a few leaves and twigs dropped by a woodpecker in the tree above him with a shake of his weak fist and an incoherent declaration that they couldnt play no babes in the wood on him and then having composed himself he once more turned on his side to die as became the scion of a heroic race the free woods touched by an upspringing wind waved their dark arms above him and higher yet a few patient stars silently ranged themselves around his pillow  but with the rising wind and stars came the swift trampling of horses hoofs and the flashing of lanterns and doctor duchesne and the master swept down into the opening  it was here said the master quickly but they must have taken him on to his own home let us follow  hold on a moment said the doctor who had halted before the tree whats all this why its baby filgeeby thunder  in another moment they had both dismounted and were leaning over the half conscious child johnny turned his feverishly bright eyes from the lantern to the master and back again  what is it johnny boy asked the master tenderly were you lost  with a gleam of feverish exaltation johnny rose albeit wanderingly to the occasion  hit he lisped feebly hit in a doell at the age of theven  what asked the bewildered master  but doctor duchesne after a single swift scrutiny of the boys face had unearthed him from his nest of leaves laid him in his lap and deftly ripped away the preposterous bandage hold the light here by jove he tells the truth who did it johnny  but johnny was silent in an interval of feverish consciousness and pain his perception and memory had been quickened a suspicion of the real cause of his disaster had dawned upon himbut his childish lips were heroically sealed the master glanced appealingly at the doctor  take him before you in the saddle to mckinstrys said the latter promptly i can attend to both  the master lifted the boy tenderly in his arms johnny stimulated by the prospect of a free ride became feebly interested in his fellow sufferer  did theth hit him bad he asked  seth echoed the master wildly  yeth i theed him when he took aim  the master did not reply but the next moment johnny felt himself clasped in his arms in the saddle before him borne like a whirlwind in the direction of the mckinstry ranch     chapter xiv   they found the wounded man lying in the front room upon a rudely extemporized couch of bearskins he having sternly declined the effeminacy of his wifes bedroom in the possibility of a fatal termination to his wound and in obedience to a grim frontier tradition he had also refused to have his boots removed in order that he might die with them on as became his ancestral custom johnny was therefore speedily made comfortable in the mckinstry bed while dr duchesne gave his whole attention to his more serious patient the master glanced hurriedly around for mrs mckinstry she was not only absent from the room but there seemed to be no suggestion of her presence in the house to his greater surprise the hurried inquiry that rose to his lips was checked by a significant warning from the attendant he sat down beside the now sleeping boy and awaited the doctors return with his mind wandering between the condition of the little sufferer and the singular revelation that had momentarily escaped his childish lips if johnny had actually seen seth fire at mckinstry the latters mysterious wound was accounted forbut not seths motive the act was so utterly incomprehensible and inconsistent with seths avowed hatred of the master that the boy must have been delirious  he was roused by the entrance of the surgeon its not so bad as i thought he said with a reassuring nod it was a mighty close shave between a shattered bone and a severed artery but weve got the ball and hell pull through in a week by jove thoughthe old fireeater was more concerned about finding the ball than living or dying go in therehe wants to see you dont let him talk too much hes called in a lot of his friends for some reason or otherand theres a regular massmeeting in there go in and get rid of em ill look after baby filgeethough the little chap will be all right again after another dressing  the master cast a hurried look of relief at the surgeon and reentered the front room it was filled with men whom the master instinctively recognized as his former adversaries but they gave way before him with a certain rude respect and half abashed sympathy as mckinstry called him to his side the wounded man grasped his hand lift me up a bit he whispered the master assisted him with difficulty to his elbow  gentlemen said mckinstry with a characteristic wave of his crippled hand towards the crowd as he laid the other on the masters shoulder ye heerd me talkin a minit ago ye heer me now this yer young man as weve slipped up on and meskalkilated has told the truthevery time ye ken tie to him whenever and wherever ye want to ye aint expected to feel ez i feel in course but the man ez goes back on himquolls with me thats alland thanks for inquiring friends yell git now boys and leave him a minit with me  the men filed slowly out a few lingering long enough to shake the masters hand with grave earnestness or half smiling half abashed embarrassment the master received the proffered reconciliation of these men who but a few hours before would have lynched him with equal sincerity with cold bewilderment as the door closed on the last of the party he turned to mckinstry the wounded man had sunk down again but was regarding with drowsy satisfaction a leaden bullet he was holding between his finger and thumb  this yer shot mr ford he said in a slow voice whose weakness was only indicated by its extreme deliberation never kem from the gun i gave yeand was never fired by you he paused and then added with his old dull abstraction its a long time since ive run agin anythin that makes me feel morekam  in mr mckinstrys weak condition the master did not dare to make johnnys revelation known to him and contented himself by simply pressing his hand but the next moment the wounded man resumed  that ball jest fits seths navy revolverand the hound hes made tracks outer the country  but what motive could he have in attacking you at such a time asked the master  he reckoned that either id kill you and so hed got shut of us both in that way without it being noticed or if i missed you the others would hang youez they kalkilated tofor killing me the idea kem to him when he overheard you hintin you wouldnt return my fire  a shuddering conviction that mckinstry had divined the real truth passed over the master in the impulse of the moment he again would have corroborated it by revealing johnnys story but a glance at the growing feverishness of the wounded man checked his utterance dont talk of it now he said hurriedly enough for me to know that you acquit me i am here now only to beg you to compose yourself until the doctor comes backas you seemed to be alone and mrs mckinstryhe stopped in awkward embarrassment  a singular confusion overspread the invalids face she hed steppt out afore this happened owin to contrairy opinions betwixt me and her ye mout hev noticed mr ford that ginrally she didnt pear to cotton to ye thar aint a woman a goin ez is the ekal of blair rawlins darter in nussin a man and keeping him in fightin order but in matters like things that consarn herself and cress i begin to think mr ford that somehow she aint exaklykam bein kam yourself yell put any unpleasantness down to that wotever you hear from her and for the matter o that from her own darter toofor im takin back the foolishness i said to ye over yon about your runnin off with cressyoull remember mr ford it warnt from no ill feeling to you in her or cressbut ony a want of kam i mout hev had my idees about cress you mout hev had yours and that fool dabney mout hev had his but it warnt the old womansnor cressysit warnt blair rawlins darters ideanor yet her darters and why for want o kam times i reckon it was left out o womans nater and bein kam yourself you understand it and take it all in  the old look of drowsy pain had settled so strongly in his red eyes again that the master was fain to put his hand gently over them and with a faint smile beg him to compose himself to sleep this he finally did after a whispered suggestion that he himself was feeling more kam the master sat for some moments with his hand upon the sleeping mans eyes and a vague and undefinable sense of loneliness seemed to fall upon him from the empty rafters of the silent and deserted house the rising wind moaned fitfully around its bleak shell with the despairing sound of far and forever receding voices so strong was the impression that when the doctor and mckinstrys attending brother reentered the room the master still lingered beside the bed with a dazed sensation of abandonment that the doctors practical reassuring smile could hardly dispel  hes doing splendidly now he said listening to the sleepers more regular respiration and id advise you to go now mr ford before he wakes lest he might be tempted to excite himself by talking to you again hes really quite out of danger now goodnight ill drop in on you at the hotel when i return  the master albeit still confused and bewildered felt his way to the door and out into the open night the wind was still despairingly wrestling with the treetops but the far receding voices seemed to be growing fainter in the distance until as he passed on they too seemed to pass away forever    monday morning had come again and the master was at his desk in the school house early with a still damp and inky copy of the star fresh from the press before him the free breath of the pines was blowing in the window and bringing to his ears the distant voices of his slowly gathering flock as he read as follows  the perpetrator of the dastardly outrage at the indian spring academy on thursday lastwhich through unfortunate misrepresentation of the facts led to a premature calling out of several of our most publicspirited citizens and culminated in a most regrettable encounter between mr mckinstry and the accomplished and estimable principal of the schoolhas we regret to say escaped condign punishment by leaving the country with his relations if as is seriously whispered he was also guilty of an unparalleled offence against a chivalrous code which will exclude him in the future from ever seeking redress at the court of honor our citizens will be only too glad to get rid of the contamination of being obliged to arrest him those of our readers who know the high character of the two gentlemen who were thus forced into a hostile meeting will not be surprised to know that the most ample apologies were tendered on both sides and that the entente cordiale has been thoroughly restored the bulletwhich it is said played a highly important part in the subsequent explanation proving to have come from a revolver fired by some outsiderhas been extracted from mr mckinstrys thigh and he is doing well with every prospect of a speedy recovery  smiling albeit not uncomplacently at this valuable contribution to history from an unfettered press his eye fell upon the next paragraph perhaps not so complacently  benjamin daubigny esq who left town for sacramento on important business not entirely unconnected with his new interests in indian springs will it is rumored be shortly joined by his wife who has been enabled by his recent good fortune to leave her old home in the states and take her proper proud position at his side although personally unknown to indian springs mrs daubigny is spoken of as a beautiful and singularly accomplished woman and it is to be regretted that her husbands interests will compel them to abandon indian springs for sacramento as a future residence mr daubigny was accompanied by his private secretary rupert the eldest son of h g filgee esq who has been a promising graduate of the indian spring academy and offers a bright example to the youth of this district we are happy to learn that his younger brother is recovering rapidly from a slight accident received last week through the incautious handling of firearms  the master with his eyes upon the paper remained so long plunged in a reverie that the schoolroom was quite filled and his little flock was wonderingly regarding him before he recalled himself he was hurriedly reaching his hand towards the bell when he was attracted by the rising figure of octavia dean  please sir you didnt ask if we had any news  truei forgot said the master smiling well have you anything to tell us  yes sir cressy mckinstry has left school  indeed  yes sir shes married  married repeated the master with an effort yet conscious of the eyes concentrated upon his colorless face marriedand to whom  to joe masters sir at the baptist chapel at big bluff sunday an marm mckinstry was thar with her  there was a momentary and breathless pause then the voices of his little pupilsthose sage and sweet truants from tradition those gentle but relentless historians of the futurerose around him in shrill choruswhy we knowed it all along sir
