daughter and lady hunterleys on one side and monsieur douaille on the other were in the van     mr grex of monte carlo     chapter i  an unexpected meeting   the eyes of the man who had looked in upon a scene inordinately fantastically brilliant underwent after those first few moments of comparative indifference a curious transformation he was contemplating one of the sights of the world crowded around the two roulette tables promenading or lounging on the heavily cushioned divans against the wall he took note of a conglomeration of people representing perhaps every grade of society every nationality of importance yet with a curious common likeness by reason of their tribute paid to fashion he glanced unmoved at a beautiful englishwoman who was a duchess but looked otherwise at an equally beautiful frenchwoman who looked like a duchess but wasotherwise on every side of him were women gowned by the great artists of the day women like flowers all perfume and softness and colour his eyes passed them over almost carelessly a little tired with many weeks travel in countries where the luxuries of life were few his senses were dulled to the magnificence of the scene his pulses as yet had not responded to its charm and wonder and then the change came he saw a woman standing almost exactly opposite to him at the nearest roulette table and he gave a noticeable start for a moment his pale expressionless face was transformed his secret was at any ones mercy that however was the affair of an instant only he was used to shocks and he survived this one he moved a little on one side from his prominent place in the centre of the wideflung doorway he stood by one of the divans and watched  she was tall and fair and slight she wore a highnecked gown of shimmering grey a black hat under which her many coils of hair shone like gold and a necklace of pearls around her throat pearls on which his eyes had rested with a curious expression she played unlike many of her neighbours with restraint yet with interest almost enthusiasm there was none of the strain of the gambler about her smooth beautiful face her delicately curved lips were free from the grim lines of concentrated acquisitiveness she was thirtytwo years old but she looked much younger as she stood there her lips a little parted in a pleased smile of anticipation she was leaning a little over the table and her eyes were fixed with humorous intentness upon the spinning wheel even amongst that crowd of beautiful women she possessed a certain individual distinction she not only looked what she wasan englishwoman of good birthbut there was a certain delicate aloofness about her expression and bearing which gave an added charm to a personality which seemed to combine the two extremes of provocativeness and reserve one would have hesitated to address to her even the chance remarks which pass so easily between strangers around the tables  violet here the man murmured under his breath violet  there was tragedy in the whisper a gleam of something like tragedy too in the look which passed between the man and the woman a few moments later with her hands full of plaques which she had just won she raised her eyes at last from the board the smile upon her lips was the delighted smile of a girl and then as she was in the act of sweeping her winnings into her gold bag she saw the man opposite the smile seemed to die from her lips it appeared indeed to pass with all else of expression from her face the plaques dropped one by one through her fingers into the satchel her eyes remained fixed upon him as though she were looking upon a ghost the seconds seemed drawn out into a grim hiatus of time the croupiers voice the muttered imprecation of a loser by her side the necessity of making some slight movement in order to allow the passage of an arm from some one in search of changesome such trifle at last brought her back from the shadows her expression became at once more normal she did not remove her eyes but she very slightly inclined her head towards the man he in return bowed very gravely and without a smile  the table in front of her was cleared now people were beginning to consider their next coup the voice of the croupier with his parrotlike cry travelled down the board  faites vos jeux mesdames et messieurs  the woman made no effort to stake after a moments hesitation she yielded up her place and moving backwards seated herself upon an empty divan rapidly the thoughts began to form themselves in her mind her delicate eyebrows drew closer together in a distinct frown after that first shock that queer turmoil of feeling beyond analysis yet having within it some entirely unexpected constituent she found herself disposed to be angry the sensation had not subsided when a moment or two later she was conscious that the man whose coming had proved so disturbing was standing before her  good afternoon he said a little stiffly  she raised her eyes the frown was still upon her forehead although to a certain extent it was contradicted by a slight tremulousness of the lips  good afternoon henry  for some reason or other further speech seemed to him a difficult matter he moved towards the vacant place  if you have no objection he observed as he seated himself  she unfurled her fanan ancient but wonderful weapon of defence it gave her a brief respite then she looked at him calmly  of all places in the world she murmured to meet you here  is it so extraordinary  i find it so she admitted you dont at all fit in you know a scene like this she added glancing around would scarcely ever be likely to attract you for its own sake would it  it doesnt particularly he admitted  then why have you come  he remained silent the frown upon her forehead deepened  perhaps she went on coldly i can help you with your reply you have come because you are not satisfied with the reports of the private detective whom you have engaged to watch me you have come to supplement them by your own investigation  his frown matched hers the coldness of his tone was rendered even more bitter by its note of anger  i am surprised that you should have thought me capable of such an action he declared all i can say is that it is thoroughly in keeping with your other suspicions of me and that i find it absolutely unworthy  she laughed a little incredulously not altogether naturally  my dear henry she protested i cannot flatter myself that there is any other person in the world sufficiently interested in my movements to have me watched  are you really under the impression that that is the case he enquired grimly  it isnt a matter of impression at all she retorted it is the truth i was followed from london i was watched at cannes i am watched here day by dayby a little man in a brown suit and a homburg hat and with a habit of lounging he lounges under my windows he is probably lounging across the way now he has lounged within fifty yards of me for the last three weeks and to tell you the truth i am tired of him couldnt i have a weeks holiday ill keep a diary and tell you all that you want to know  is it sufficient he asked for me to assure you upon my word of honour that i know nothing of this  she was somewhat startled she turned and looked at him his tone was convincing he had not the face of a man whose word of honour was a negligible thing  but henry she protested i tell you that there is no doubt about the matter i am watched day and nighti an insignificant person whose doings can be of no possible interest save to you and you only  the man did not at once reply his thoughts seemed to have wandered off for a moment when he spoke again his tone had lost its note of resentment  i do not blame you for your suspicion he said calmly although i can assure you that i have never had any idea of having you watched it is not a course which could possibly have suggested itself to me even in my most unhappy moments  she was puzzledat once puzzled and interested  i am so glad to hear this she said and of course i believe you but there the fact is i think that you will agree with me that it is curious  isnt it possible he ventured to suggest that it is your companions who are the object of this mans vigilance you are not i presume alone here  she eyed him a little defiantly  i am here she announced with mr and mrs draconmeyer  he heard her without any change of expression but somehow or other it was easy to see that her news although more than half expected had stung him  mr and mrs draconmeyer he repeated with slight emphasis on the latter portion of the sentence  certainly i am sorry she went on a moment late that my companions do not meet with your approval that however i could scarcely expect considering  considering what he insisted watching her steadfastly  considering all things she replied after a moments pause  mrs draconmeyer is still an invalid  she is still an invalid  the slightly satirical note in his question seemed to provoke a certain defiance in her manner as she turned a little sideways towards him she moved her fan slowly backwards and forwards her head was thrown back her manner was almost belligerent he took up the challenge he asked her in plain words the question which his eyes had already demanded  i find myself constrained to ask you he said in a studiously measured tone by what means you became possessed of the pearls you are wearing i do not seem to remember them as your property  her eyes flashed  dont you think she returned that you are a little outstepping your privileges  not in the least he declared you are my wife and although you have defied me in a certain matter you are still subject to my authority i see you wearing jewels in public of which you were certainly not possessed a few months ago and which neither your fortune nor mine  let me set your mind at rest she interrupted icily the pearls are not mine they belong to mrs draconmeyer  mrs draconmeyer  i am wearing them she continued at lindas special request she is too unwell to appear in public and she is very seldom able to wear any of her wonderful jewelry it gives her pleasure to see them sometimes upon other people  he remained quite silent for several moments he was in reality passionately angry selfrestraint however had become such a habit of his that there were no indications of his condition save in the slight twitchings of his long fingers and a tightening at the corners of his lips she however recognised the symptoms without difficulty  since you defy my authority he said may i ask whether my wishes have any weight with you  that depends she replied  it is my earnest wish he went on that you do not wear another womans jewelry either in public or privately  she appeared to reflect for a moment in effect she was struggling against a conviction that his request was reasonable  i am sorry she said at last i see no harm whatever in my doing so in this particular instance it gives great pleasure to poor mrs draconmeyer to see her jewels and admire them even if she is unable to wear them herself it gives me an intense joy which even a normal man could scarcely be expected to understand certainly not you i am sorry that i cannot humour you  he leaned towards her  not if i beg you  she looked at him fixedly looked at him as though she searched for something in his face or was pondering over something in his tone it was a moment which might have meant much if she could have seen into his heart and understood the fierce jealousy which prompted his words it might have meant a very great deal as it was her contemplation appeared to be unsatisfactory  i am sorry that you should lay so much stress upon so small a thing she said you were always unreasonable your present request is another instance of it i was enjoying myself very much indeed until you came and now you wish to deprive me of one of my chief pleasures i cannot humour you  he turned away even then chance might have intervened the moment her words had been spoken she realised a certain injustice in them realised a little perhaps the point of view of this man who was still her husband she watched him almost eagerly hoping to find some sign in his face that it was not only his stubborn pride which spoke she failed however he was one of those men who know too well how to wear the mask  may i ask where you are staying here he enquired presently  at the hotel de paris  it is unfortunate he observed i will move my quarters tomorrow  she shrugged her shoulders  monte carlo is full of hotels she remarked but it seems a pity that you should move the place is large enough for both of us  it is not long he retorted since you found london itself too small i should be very sorry to spoil your holiday  her eyes seemed to dwell for a moment upon the spanish dancer who sat at the table opposite them a woman whose name had once been a household word dethroned now yet still insistent for notice and homage commanding them even with the wreck of her beauty and the splendour of her clothes  it seems a queer place this she observed for domestic disagreements let us try to avoid disputable subjects shall i be too inquisitive if i ask you once more what in the name of all that is unsuitable brought you to such a place as monte carlo  he fenced with her question perhaps he resented the slightly ironical note in her tone perhaps there were other reasons  why should i not come to monte carlo he enquired parliament is not particularly amusing when one is in opposition and i do not hunt the whole world amuses itself here  but not you she replied quickly i know you better than that my dear henry there is nothing here or in this atmosphere which could possibly attract you for long there is no work for you to dowork the very breath of your body work the one thing you live for and were made for work you man of sawdust and red tape  am i as bad as all that he asked quietly  she fingered her pearls for a moment  perhaps i havent the right to complain she acknowledged i have gone my own way always but if one is permitted to look for a moment into the past can you tell me a single hour when work was not the prominent thought in your brain the idol before which you worshipped why even our honeymoon was spent canvassing  the election was an unexpected one he reminded her  it would have been the same thing she declared the only literature which you really understand is a blue book and the only music you hear is the chiming of big ben  you speak he remarked as though you resented these things yet you knew before you married me that i had ambitions that i did not propose to lead an idle life  oh yes i knew she assented drily but we are wandering from the point i am still wondering what has brought you here have you come direct from england  he shook his head  i came today from bordighera  more and more mysterious she murmured bordighera indeed i thought you once told me that you hated the riviera  so i do he agreed  and yet you are here  yet i am here  and you have not come to look after me she went on and the mystery of the little brown man who watches me is still unexplained  i know nothing about that person he asserted and i had no idea that you were here  or you would not have come she challenged him  your presence he retorted nettled into forgetting himself for a moment would not have altered my plans in the slightest  then you have a reason for coming she exclaimed quickly  he gave no sign of annoyance but his lips were firmly closed she watched him steadfastly  i wonder at myself no longer she continued i do not think that any woman in the world could ever live with a man to whom secrecy is as great a necessity as the very air he breathes no wonder my dear henry the politicians speak so well of you and so confidently of your brilliant future  i am not aware he observed calmly that i have ever been unduly secretive so far as you are concerned during the last few months however of our life together you must remember that you chose to receive on terms of friendship a person whom i regard  her eyes suddenly flashed him a warning he dropped his voice almost to a whisper a man was approaching them  as an enemy he concluded under his breath     chapter ii  by accident or design   the newcomer who had presented himself now before hunterleys and his wife was a man of somewhat unusual appearance he was tall thicklybuilt his black beard and closelycropped hair were streaked with grey he wore goldrimmed spectacles and he carried his head a little thrust forward as though even with the aid of his glasses he was still shortsighted he had the air of a foreigner although his tone when he spoke was without accent he held out his hand a little tentatively an action however which hunterleys appeared to ignore  my dear sir henry he exclaimed this is a surprise indeed monte carlo is absolutely the last place in the world in which i should have expected to come across you the sporting club too well well well  hunterleys standing easily with his hands behind his back raised his eyebrows the two men were of curiously contrasting types hunterleys slim and distinguished had still the frame of an athlete notwithstanding his colourless cheeks and the worn lines about his eyes he was dressed with extreme simplicity his deepset eyes and sensitive mouth were in marked contrast to the others coarser mould of features and rather full lips yet there was about both men an air of strength strength developed perhaps in a different manner but still an appreciable quality  they say that the whole world is here hunterleys remarked why may not i form a harmless unit of it  why not indeed draconmeyer assented heartily the most serious of us must have our frivolous moments i hope that you will dine with us tonight we shall be quite alone  hunterleys shook his head  thank you he said i have another engagement pending  mr draconmeyer was filled with polite regrets but he did not renew the invitation  when did you arrive he asked  a few hours ago hunterleys replied  by the luxe how strange i went down to meet it  i came from the other side  ah  mr draconmeyers ejaculation was interrogative hunterleys hesitated for a moment then he continued with a little shrug of the shoulders  i have been staying at san remo and bordighera  mr draconmeyer was much interested  so that is where you have been burying yourself he remarked i saw from the papers that you had accepted a six months pair surely though you dont find the italian riviera very amusing  i am abroad for a rest hunterleys replied  mr draconmeyer smiled curiously  a rest he repeated that rather belies your reputation you know they say that you are tireless even when you are out of office  hunterleys turned from the speaker towards his wife  i have not tempted fortune myself yet he observed i think that i shall have a look into the baccarat room do you care to stroll that way  lady hunterleys rose at once to her feet mr draconmeyer however intervened he laid his fingers upon hunterleys arm  sir henry he begged our meeting has been quite unexpected but in a sense it is opportune will you be good enough to give me five minutes conversation  with pleasure hunterleys replied my time is quite at your disposal if you have anything to say  draconmeyer led the way out of the crowded room along the passage and into the little bar they found a quiet corner and two easychairs draconmeyer gave an order to a waiter for a few moments their conversation was conventional  i trust that you think your wife looking better for the change draconmeyer began her companionship is a source of great pleasure and relief to my poor wife  does the conversation you wish to have with me refer to lady hunterleys her husband asked quietly if so i should like to say a few preliminary words which would i hope place the matter at once beyond the possibility of any misunderstanding  draconmeyer moved a little uneasily in his place  i have other things to say he declared yet i would gladly hear what is in your mind at the present moment you do not i fear approve of this friendship between my wife and lady hunterleys  hunterleys was uncompromising almost curt  i do not he agreed it is probably no secret to you that my wife and i are temporarily estranged he continued the chief reason for that estrangement is that i forbade her your house or your acquaintance  draconmeyer was a little taken back such extreme directness of speech was difficult to deal with  my dear sir henry he protested you distress me i do not understand your attitude in this matter at all  there is no necessity for you to understand it hunterleys retorted coolly i claim the right to regulate my wifes visiting list she denies that right  apart from the question of marital control mr draconmeyer persisted will you tell me why you consider my wife and myself unfit persons to find a place amongst lady hunterleys acquaintances  no man is bound to give the reason for his dislikes hunterleys replied of your wife i know nothing nobody does i have every sympathy with her unfortunate condition and that is all you personally i dislike i dislike my wife to be seen with you i dislike having her name associated with yours in any manner whatsoever i dislike sitting with you here myself i only hope that the five minutes conversation which you have asked for will not be exceeded  mr draconmeyer had the air of a benevolent person who is deeply pained  sir henry he sighed it is not possible for me to disregard such plain speaking forgive me if i am a little taken aback by it you are known to be a very skilful diplomatist and you have many weapons in your armoury one scarcely expected howeverones breath is a little taken away by such candour  i am not aware hunterleys said calmly that the question of diplomacy need come in when ones only idea is to regulate the personal acquaintances of oneself and ones wife  mr draconmeyer sat quite still for a moment stroking his black beard his eyes were fixed upon the carpet he seemed to be struggling with a problem  you have taken the ground from beneath my feet he declared your opinion of me is such that i hesitate to proceed at all in the matter which i desired to discuss with you  that hunterleys replied is entirely for you to decide i am perfectly willing to listen to anything you have to sayall the more ready because now there can be no possibility of any misunderstanding between us  very well mr draconmeyer assented i will proceed after all i am not sure that the personal element enters into what i was about to say i was going to propose not exactly an alliancethat of course would not be possiblebut i was certainly going to suggest that you and i might be of some service to one another  in what way  i call myself an englishman mr draconmeyer went on i have made large sums of money in england i have grown to love england and english ways yet i came as you know from berlin the position which i hold in your city is still the position of president of the greatest german bank in the world it is german finance which i have directed and with german money i have made my fortune to be frank with you however after these many years in london i have grown to feel myself very much of an englishman  hunterleys was sitting perfectly still his face was rigid but expressionless he was listening intently  on the other hand mr draconmeyer proceeded slowly i wish to be wholly frank with you at heart i must remain always a german the interests of my country must always be paramount but listen in germany there are as you know two parties and year by year they are drawing further apart i will not allude to factions i will speak broadly there is the war party and there is the peace party i belong to the peace party i belong to it as a german and i belong to it as a devoted friend of england and if the threatened conflict between the two should come i should take my stand as a peaceloving germancumenglishman against the war party even of my own country  hunterleys still made no sign yet for one who knew him it was easy to realise that he was listening and thinking with absorbed interest  so far draconmeyer pointed out i have laid my cards on the table i have told you the solemn truth i regret that it did not occur to me to do so many months ago in london now to proceed i ask you to emulate my frankness and in return i will give you information which should enable us to work hand in hand for the peace which we both desire  you ask me hunterleys said thoughtfully to be perfectly frank with you in what respect what is it that you wish from me  not political information mr draconmeyer declared his eyes blinking behind his glasses for that i certainly should not come to you i only wish to ask you a question and i must ask it so that we may meet on a common ground of confidence are you here in monte carlo to look after your wife or in search of change of air and scene is that your honest motive for being here or is there any other reason in the world which has prompted you to come to monte carlo during this particular monthi might almost say this particular week  hunterleys attitude was that of a man who holds in his hand a puzzle and is doubtful where to commence in his efforts to solve it  are you not a little mysterious this afternoon mr draconmeyer he asked coldly or are you trying to incite a supposititious curiosity i really cannot see the drift of your question  answer it mr draconmeyer insisted  hunterleys took a cigarette from his case tapped it upon the table and lit it in leisurely fashion  if you have any idea he said that i came here to confront my wife or to interfere in any way with her movements let me assure you that you are mistaken i had no idea that lady hunterleys was in monte carlo i am here because i have a six months holiday and a holiday for the average englishman between january and april generally means as you must be aware the riviera i have tried bordighera and san remo i have found them as i no doubt shall find this place wearisome in the end i suppose i shall drift back to london  mr draconmeyer frowned  you left london he remarked tersely on december first it is today february twentieth do you wish me to understand that you have been at bordighera and san remo all that time  how did you know when i left london hunterleys demanded  mr draconmeyer pursed his lips  i heard of your departure from london entirely by accident he said your wife for some reason or other declined to discuss your movements i imagine that she was acting in accordance with your wishes  i see hunterleys observed coolly and your present anxiety is to know where i spent the intervening time and why i am here in monte carlo frankly mr draconmeyer i look upon this close interest in my movements as an impertinence my travels have been of no importance but they concern myself only i have no confidence to offer respecting them if i had it would not be to you that i should unburden myself  you suspect me then you doubt my integrity  not at all hunterleys assured his questioner for anything i know to the contrary you are outside the world of finance one of the dullest and most harmless men existing my own position is simply as i explained it during the first few sentences we exchanged i do not like you i detest my wifes name being associated with yours and for that reason the less i see of you the better i am pleased  mr draconmeyer nodded thoughtfully he was to all appearance studying the pattern of the carpet for once in his life he was genuinely puzzled was this man by his side merely a jealous husband or had he any idea of the greater game which was being played around them had he by any chance arrived to take part in it was it wise in any case to pursue the subject further yet if he abandoned it at this juncture it must be with a sense of failure and failure was a thing to which he was not accustomed  your frankness he admitted grimly is almost exhilarating our personal relations being so clearly defined i am inclined to go further even than i had intended we cannot now possibly misunderstand one another supposing i were to tell you that your arrival in monte carlo accidental though it may be is in a sense opportune that you may in a short time meet here one or two politicians friends of mine with whom an interchange of views might be agreeable supposing i were to offer my services as an intermediary you would like to bring about better relations with my country would you not sir henry you are admittedly a statesman and an influential man in your party i am only a banker it is true but i have been taken into the confidence of those who direct the destinies of my country  hunterleys face reflected none of the others earnestness he seemed indeed a little bored and he answered almost irritably  i am much obliged to you he said but monte carlo seems scarcely the place to me for political discussions added to which i have no official position i could not receive or exchange confidences while my party is out of power there is nothing left for us but to mark time i dare say you mean well mr draconmeyer he added rising to his feet but i am here to forget politics altogether if i can if you will excuse me i think i will look in at the baccarat rooms  he was on the point of departure when through the open doorway which communicated with the baccarat rooms beyond came a man of sufficiently arresting personality a man remarkably fat with closecropped grey hair which stuck up like bristles all over his head a huge cleanshaven face which seemed concentrated at that moment in one tremendous smile of overwhelming goodhumour he held by the hand a little french girl dark small looking almost like a marionette in her slim tailormade costume he recognised draconmeyer with enthusiasm  my friend draconmeyer he exclaimed in stentorian tones baccarat is the greatest game in the world i have woni who know nothing about it have won a hundred louis it is amazing there is no place like this in the world we are here to drink a bottle of wine together mademoiselle and i mademoiselle who was at once my instructress and my mascot afterwards we go to the jewelers why not a fair division of the spoilsfifty louis for myself fifty louis for a bracelet for mademoiselle and then  he broke off suddenly his gesture was almost dramatic  i am forgotten he cried holding out his hand to hunterleysforgotten already sir henry there are many who forget me as a humble minister of my master but there are few who forget me physically i am selingman we met in berlin six years ago you came with your great foreign secretary  i remember you perfectly hunterleys assured him as he submitted to the newcomers vigorous handshake we shall meet again i trust  selingman thrust his arm through hunterleys as though to prevent his departure  you shall not run away he declared i introduce both of youmr draconmeyer the great anglogerman banker sir henry hunterleys the english politicianto mademoiselle estelle nipon of the opera house now we all know one another we shall be good friends we will share that bottle of champagne  one bottle between four mademoiselle laughed poutingly and i am parched i have taught monsieur baccarat i am exhausted  a magnum selingman ordered in a voice of thunder shaking his fist at the startled waiter we seat ourselves here at the round table mademoiselle we will drink champagne together until the eyes of all of us sparkle as yours do we will drink champagne until we do not believe that there is such a thing as losing at games or in life we will drink champagne until we all four believe that we have been brought up together that we are bosom friends of a lifetime see this is how we will place ourselves mademoiselle if the others make love to you take no notice it is i who have put fifty louis in one pocket for that bracelet do not trust sir henry there he has a reputation  as usual the overpowering selingman had his way neither draconmeyer nor hunterleys attempted to escape they took their places at the table they drank champagne and they listened to selingman all the time he talked save when mademoiselle interrupted him seated upon a chair which seemed absurdly inadequate his great stomach with its vast expanse of white waistcoat in full view his short legs doubled up beneath him he beamed upon them all with a smile which never failed  it is a wonderful place he declared as he lifted his glass for the fifth time we will drink to it this monte carlo it is here that they come from all quarters of the worldthe ladies who charm away our hearts he added bowing to mademoiselle the financiers whose word can shake the moneymarkets of the world and the politicians who unbend perhaps just a little in the sunshine here however cold and inflexible they may be under their own austere skies for the last time thento monte carlo to monte carlo dear mademoisellemessieurs  illustration for the last time thento monte carlo  they drank the toast and a few minutes later hunterleys slipped away the two men looked after him the smile seemed gradually to leave selingmans lips his face was large and impressive  run and fetch your cloak dear he said to the girl  she obeyed at once selingman leaned across the table towards his companion  what does hunterleys do here he asked  draconmeyer shook his head  who knows he answered perhaps he has come to look after his wife he has been to bordighera and san remo  is that all he told you of his movements  that is all draconmeyer admitted he was suspicious i made no progress  bordighera and san remo selingman muttered under his breath for a day perhaps or two  what do you know about him draconmeyer asked his eyes suddenly bright beneath his spectacles i have been suspicious ever since i met him an hour ago he left england on december first  it is true selingman assented he crossed to paris andmark the cunning of ithe returned to england that same night he travelled to germany we lost him in vienna and found him again in sofia what does it mean i wonder what does it mean  i have been talking to him for twenty minutes in here before you came draconmeyer said i tried to gain his confidence he told me nothing he never even mentioned that journey of his  selingman was sitting drumming upon the table with his broad fingertips  sofia he murmured and nowhere draconmeyer there is work before us i know men i tell you i know hunterleys i watched him i listened to him in berlin six years ago he was with his master then but he had nothing to learn from him he is of the stuff diplomats are fashioned of he has it in his blood there is work before us draconmeyer  if monsieur is ready mademoiselle interposed a little petulantly letting the tip of her boa play for a moment on his cheek  selingman finished his wine and rose to his feet once more the smile encompassed his face of what account after all were the wanderings of this melancholy englishman there was mademoiselles bracelet to be bought and perhaps a few flowers selingman pulled down his waistcoat and accepted his grey homburg hat from the vestiaire he held mademoiselles fingers as they descended the stairs he looked like a schoolboy of enormous proportions on his way to a feast  we drank to monte carlo in champagne he declared as they turned on to the terrace and descended the stone steps but dear estelle we drink to it from our hearts with every breath we draw of this wonderful air every time our feet touch the buoyant ground believe me little one the other things are of no account the true philosophy of life and living is here in monte carlo you and i will solve it     chapter iii  a warning   hunterleys dined alone at a small round table set in a remote corner of the great restaurant attached to the hotel de paris the scene around him was full of colour and interest a scarletcoated band made wonderful music the toilettes of the women who kept passing backwards and forwards on their way to the various tables were marvellous in their way unique the lights and flowers of the room its appointments and adornments all represented the last word in luxury everywhere was colour everywhere an almost strained attempt to impress upon the passerby the fact that this was no ordinary holiday resort but the giant pleasureground of all in the world who had money to throw away and the capacity for enjoyment only once a more somber note seemed struck when mrs draconmeyer leaning on her husbands arm and accompanied by a nurse and lady hunterleys passed to their table hunterleys eyes followed the little party until they had reached their destination and taken their places his wife was wearing black and she had discarded the pearls which had hung around her neck during the afternoon she wore only a collar of diamonds his gift her hair was far less elaborately coiffured and her toilette less magnificent than the toilettes of the women by whom she was surrounded yet as he looked from his corner across the room at her hunterleys realised as he had realised instantly twelve years ago when he had first met her that she was incomparable there was no other woman in the whole of that great restaurant with her air of quiet elegance no other woman so faultless in the smaller details of her toilette and person hunterleys watched with expressionless face but with anger growing in his heart as he saw draconmeyer bending towards her accepting her suggestions about the dinner laughing when she laughed watching almost humbly for her pleasure or displeasure it was a cursed mischance which had brought him to monte carlo  hunterleys hurried over his dinner and without even going to his room for a hat or coat walked across the square in the soft twilight of an unusually warm february evening and took a table outside the caf√© de paris where he ordered coffee around him was a far more cosmopolitan crowd increasing every moment in volume every language was being spoken mostly german as a rule such a gathering of people was in its way interesting to hunterleys tonight his thoughts were truant he forgot his strenuous life of the last three months the dangers and discomforts through which he had passed the curious sequence of events which had brought him full of anticipation nerved for a crisis to monte carlo of all places in the world he forgot that he was in the midst of great events himself likely to take a hand in them his thoughts took rarely enough for him a purely personal and sentimental turn he thought of the earliest days of his marriage when he and his wife had wandered about the gardens of his old home in wiltshire on spring evenings such as these and had talked sometimes lightly sometimes seriously of the future almost as he sat there in the midst of that noisy crowd he could catch the faint perfume of hyacinths from the borders along which they had passed and the trimlycut flowerbeds which fringed the deep green lawn almost he could hear the chiming of the old stable clock the clear note of a thrush singing a puff of wind brought them a waft of fainter odour from the wild violets which carpeted the woods then the darkness crept around them a star came out hand in hand they turned towards the house and into the library where a wood fire was burning on the grate his thoughts travelled on a wave of tenderness had assailed him then he was awakened by the waiters voice at his elbow  le caf√© monsieur  he sat up in his chair his dreaming moments were few and this one had passed he set his heel upon that tide of weakening memories sipped his coffee and looked out upon the crowd three or four times he glanced at his watch impatiently precisely at nine oclock a man moved from somewhere in the throng behind and took the vacant chair by his side  if one could trouble monsieur for a match  hunterleys turned towards the newcomer as he handed his matchbox he was a young man of medium height with sandy complexion a little freckled and with a straggling fair moustache he had keen grey eyes and the faintest trace of a scotch accent he edged his chair a little nearer to hunterleys  much obliged he said wonderful evening isnt it  hunterleys nodded  have you anything to tell me david he asked  we are right in the thick of it the other replied his tone a little lowered there is more to tell than i like  shall we stroll along the terrace hunterleys suggested  dont move from your seat the young man enjoined you are watched here and so am i in a way although its more my news they want to censor than anything personal this crowd of germans around us without a single vacant chair is the best barrier we can have listen selingman is here  i saw him this afternoon at the sporting club hunterleys murmured  douaille will be here the day after tomorrow if he has not already arrived the newcomer continued it was given out in paris that he was going down to marseilles and from there to toulon to spend three days with the fleet they sent a paragraph into our office there as a matter of fact hes coming straight on here i cant learn how exactly but i fancy by motorcar  youre sure that douaille is coming himself hunterleys asked anxiously  absolutely his wife and family have been bustled down to mentone so as to afford a pretext for his presence here if the papers get hold of it i have found out for certain that they came at a moments notice and were not expecting to leave home at all douaille will have full powers and the conference will take place at the villa mimosa that will be the headquarters of the whole thing look out sir henry theyve got their eyes on us the little fellow in brown close behind is hand in glove with the police they tried to get me into a row last night its only my journalism they suspect but theyd shove me over the frontier at the least excuse theyre certain to try something of the sort with you if they get any idea that we are on the scent sit tight sir and watch im off you know where to find me  the young man raised his hat and left hunterleys with the polite farewell of a stranger his seat was almost immediately seized by a small man dressed in brown a man with a black imperial and moustache curled upwards as hunterleys glanced towards him he raised his hamburg hat politely and smiled  monsieurs friend has departed he enquired this seat is disengaged  as you see hunterleys replied  the little man smiled his thanks seated himself with a sigh of content and ordered coffee from a passing waiter  monsieur is doubtless a stranger to monte carlo  it is my second visit only hunterleys admitted  for myself i am an habitu√© the little man continued i might almost say a resident therefore all faces soon become familiar to me directly i saw monsieur i knew that he was not a frequenter  hunterleys turned a little in his chair and surveyed his neighbour curiously the man was neatly dressed and he spoke english with scarcely any accent his shoulders and upturned moustache gave him a military appearance  there is nothing i envy any one so much in life he proceeded as coming to monte carlo for the first or second time there is so much to know to see to understand  hunterleys made no effort to discourage his companions obvious attempts to be friendly the latter talked with spirit for some time  if it would not be regarded as a liberty he said at last as hunterleys rose to move off may i be permitted to present myself my name is hugot i am half english half french years ago my health broke down and i accepted a position in a bank here since then i have come in to money if i have a hobby in life it is to show my beloved monte carlo to strangers if monsieur would do me the honour to spare me a few hours tonight later on i would endeavour to see that he was amused  hunterleys shook his head he remained however perfectly courteous he had a conviction that this was the man who had been watching his wife  you are very kind sir he replied i am here only for a few days and for the benefit of my health i dare not risk late hours we shall meet again i trust  he strolled off and as he hesitated upon the steps of the casino he glanced across towards the hotel de paris at that moment a woman came out a light cloak over her evening gown she was followed by an attendant hunterleys recognised his wife and watched them with a curious little thrill they turned towards the terrace very slowly he too moved in the same direction they passed through the gardens of the hotel de paris and hunterleys keeping to the left met them upon the terrace as they emerged as they came near he accosted them  violet he began  she started  i beg your pardon she said i did not recognise you  havent you been told he asked stiffly that the terrace is unsafe for women after twilight  very often she assented with that little smile at the corners of her lips which once he had found so charming and which now half maddened him unfortunately i have a propensity for doing things which are dangerous besides i have my maid  another woman is no protection he declared  susanne can shriek lady hunterleys assured him she has wonderful lungs and she loves to use them she would shriek at the least provocation  and meanwhile hunterleys observed drily while she is indulging in her vocal exercises things happen if you wish to promenade here permit me to be your escort  she hesitated for a moment frowning then she continued her walk  you are very kind she assented perhaps you are like me though and feel the restfulness of a quiet place after these throngs and throngs of people  they passed slowly down the broad promenade deserted now save for one or two loungers like themselves and a few other furtive hurrying figures in front of them stretched an arc of glittering lightsthe wonderful bay of mentone with bordighera on the distant seaboard higher up the twinkling lights from the villas built on the rocky hills and at their feet the sea calm deep blue lapping the narrow belt of hard sand scintillating with the reflection of a thousand lights on the horizon a bloodred moon only half emerged from the sea  since we have met henry lady hunterleys said at last there is something which i should like to say to you  certainly  she glanced behind susanne had fallen discreetly into the rear she was a new importation and she had no idea as to the identity of the tall severelooking englishman who walked by her mistresss side  there is something going on in monte carlo lady hunterleys went on which i cannot understand mr draconmeyer knows about it i believe although he is not personally concerned in it but he will tell me nothing i only know that for some reason or other your presence here seems to be an annoyance to certain people why it should be i dont know but i want to ask you about it will you tell me the truth are you sure that you did not come here to spy upon me  i certainly did not hunterleys answered firmly i had no idea that you were near the place if i had  she turned her head the smile was there once more and a queer soft light in her eyes  if you had she murmured  my visit here under the present circumstances would have been more distasteful than it is hunterleys replied stiffly  she bit her lip and turned away when she resumed the conversation her tone was completely changed  i speak to you now she said in your own interests mr draconmeyer is of course not personally connected with this affair whatever it may be but he is a wonderful man and he hears many things tonight before dinner he gave me a few words of warning he did not tell me to pass them on to you but i feel sure that he hoped i would you would not listen to them from him because you do not like him i am afraid that you will take very little more heed of what i say but at least you will believe that i speak in your own interests mr draconmeyer believes that your presence here is misunderstood a person whom he describes as being utterly without principle and of great power is incensed by it to speak plainly you are in danger  i am flattered hunterleys remarked by this interest on my behalf  she turned her head and looked at him his face in this cold light before the moon came up was almost like the face of some marble statue lifeless set of almost stonelike severity she knew the look so well and she sighed  you need not be she replied bitterly mine is merely the ordinary feeling of one human creature for another in a sense it seems absurd i suppose to speak to you as i am doing yet i do know that this place which looks so beautiful has strange undercurrents people pass away here in the most orthodox fashion in the world outwardly but their real ending is often never known at all everything is possible here and mr draconmeyer honestly believes that you are in danger  they had reached the end of the terrace and they turned back  i thank you very much violet hunterleys said earnestly in return may i say something to you if there is any danger threatening me or those interests which i guard the man whom you have chosen to make your intimate friend is more deeply concerned in it than you think i told you once before that draconmeyer was something more than the great banker the king of commerce as he calls himself he is ambitious beyond your imaginings a schemer in ways you know nothing of and his residence in london during the last fifteen years has been the worst thing that ever happened for england to me it is a bitter thing that you should have ignored my warning and accepted his friendship  it is not mr draconmeyer who is my friend henry she interrupted you continually ignore that fact it is mrs draconmeyer whom i cannot desert i knew her long before i did her husband we were at school together and there was a time before her last illness when we were inseparable  that may have been so at first hunterleys agreed but how about since then you cannot deny violet that this man draconmeyer has in some way impressed or fascinated you you admire him you find great pleasure in his society isnt that the truth now honestly  her face was a little troubled  i do certainly find pleasure in his society she admitted i cannot conceive any one who would not he is a brilliant a wonderful musician a delightful talker a generous host and companion he has treated me always with the most scrupulous regard and i feel that i am entirely reasonable in resenting your mistrust of him  you do resent it still then  i do she asserted emphatically  and if i told you hunterleys went on that the man was in love with you what then  i should say that you were a fool  hunterleys shrugged his shoulders  there is no more to be said he declared only for a clever woman violet you are sometimes woefully or wilfully blind i tell you that i know the type sooner or laterbefore very long i should thinkyou will have the usual scene i warn you of it now if you are wise you will go back to england  absurd she scoffed why we have only just come i want to win some moneynot that your allowance isnt liberal enough she added hastily but there is a fascination in winning you know and besides i could not possibly desert mrs draconmeyer she would not have come at all if i had not joined them  you are the mistress of your own ways hunterleys said according to my promise i shall attempt to exercise no authority over you in any way but i tell you that draconmeyer is my enemy and the enemy of all the things i represent and i tell you too that he is in love with you when you realise that these things are firmly established in my brain you can perhaps understand how thoroughly distasteful i find your association with him here it is all very well to talk about mrs draconmeyer but she goes nowhere the consequence is that he is your escort on every occasion i am quite aware that a great many people in society accept him i personally am not disposed to i look upon him as an unfit companion for my wife and i resent your appearance with him in public  we will discuss this subject no further she decided from the moment of our first disagreement it has been your object to break off my friendship with the draconmeyers until i have something more than words to go by i shall continue to give him my confidence  they crossed the stone flags in front of the opera together and turned up towards the rooms  i think perhaps then he said that we may consider the subject closed only he added you will forgive me if i still  he hesitated she turned her head quickly her eyes sought his but unfortunately he was looking straight ahead and seeing gloomy things if he had happened to turn at that moment he might have concluded his speech differently  if i still exhibit some interest in your doings  i shall always think it most kind of you she replied her face suddenly hardening have i not done my best to reciprocate i have even passed on to you a word of warning which i think you are very unwise to ignore  they were outside the hotel hunterleys paused  i have nothing to fear from the mysterious source you have spoken of he assured her the only enemy i have in monte carlo is draconmeyer himself  enemy she repeated scornfully mr draconmeyer is much too wrapped up in his finance and too big a man in his way to have enemies oh henry if only you could get rid of a few of your prejudices how much more civilised a human being you would be  he raised his hat his expression was a little grim  the man without prejudices my dear violet he retorted is a man without instincts i wish you luck  she ran lightly up the steps and waved her hand he watched her pass through the doors into the hotel     chapter iv  enter the american   lady weybourne was lunching on the terrace of ciros restaurant with her brother she was small dark vivacious her friends of whom she had thousands all called her flossie and she was probably the most popular american woman who had ever married into the english peerage her brother richard lane on the other hand was tall very broadshouldered with a strong cleanshaven face inclined by disposition to be taciturn on this particular morning he had less even than usual to say and although lady weybourne who was a great chatterbox was content as a rule to do most of the talking for herself his inattention became at last a little too obvious he glanced up eagerly as every newcomer appeared and his answers to his sisters criticisms were sometimes almost at random  dicky im not at all sure that im liking you this morning she observed finally looking across at him with a critically questioning smile a certain amount of nonresponsiveness to my advances i can put up withfrom a brotherbut this morning you are positively inattentive tell me your troubles at once has harris been bothering you or did you lose a lot of money last night  considering that the young mans income was derived from an exceedingly wellinvested capital of nine million dollars and that harris was the all too perfect captain of his yacht lying then in the harbour whose worst complaint was that he had never enough work to do lady weybournes enquiries might have been considered as merely tentative richard shook his head a little gloomily  those things arent likely to trouble me he remarked harris is all right and ive promised him well make up a little party and go over to cannes in a day or two  what a ripping idea lady weybourne declared breaking up her thin toast between her fingers id love it and so would harry we could easily get together a delightful party the pelhams are here and simply dying for a change and theres captain gardner and frank clowes and lots of nice girls couldnt we fix a date dick  not just yet her brother replied  and why not  i am waiting he told her until i can ask the girl i want to go  and why cant you now she demanded with upraised eyebrows ill be hostess and chaperone all in one  i cant ask her because i dont know her yet the young man explained doggedly  lady weybourne leaned back in her chair and laughed  so thats it she exclaimed now i know why youre sitting there like an owl this morning in love with a fair unknown are you dick be careful monte carlo is full of young ladies whom it would be just as well to know a little about before you thought of taking them yachting  this one isnt that sort the young man said  how do you know that she asked leaning across the table her head resting on her clasped hands  he looked at her almost contemptuously  how do i know he repeated there are just one or two things that happen in this world which a man can be utterly and entirely sure of she is one of them say flossie he added the enthusiasm creeping at last into his tone you never saw any one quite like her in all your life  do i know her i wonder lady weybourne enquired  thats just what ive asked you here to find out her brother replied ingenuously i heard her tell the man she was with this morningher father i believeabout an hour ago that she would be at ciros at halfpast one its twenty minutes to two now  lady weybourne laughed heartily  so thats why you dragged me out of bed and made me come to lunch with you dick what a fraud you are i was thinking what a dear affectionate brother you were and all the time you were just making use of me  sorry the young man said briskly but after all we neednt stand on ceremony need we ive always been your pal gave you a leg up with the old man you know when he wasnt keen on the british alliance  she nodded  oh ill do what i can for you she promised if she is any one in particular i expect i shall know her whats happening dick  the young mans face was almost transformed his eyes were bright and very fixed his lips had come together in a firm straight line as though he were renewing some promise to himself lady weybourne followed the direction of his gaze a man and a girl had reached the entrance to the restaurant and were looking around them as though to select a table the chief ma√Ætre dh√¥tel had hastened out to receive them they were without doubt people of importance the man was of medium height with irongrey hair and moustache and a small imperial he wore light clothes of perfect cut patent shoes with white linen gaiters a black tie fastened with a pin of opals he carried himself with an air which was unmistakable and convincing the girl by his side was beautiful she was simply dressed in a tailormade gown of white serge her black hat was a miracle of smartness her hair was of a very light shade of goldenbrown her complexion wonderfully fair lady weybourne glanced at her shoes and gloves at the bag which she was carrying and the handle of her parasol then she nodded approvingly  you dont know her richard asked in a disappointed whisper  she shook her head  sorry she admitted but i dont theyve probably only just arrived  with great ceremony the newcomers were conducted to the best table upon the terrace the man was evidently an habitu√© he had scarcely taken his seat before with a very low bow the sommelier brought him a small wineglass filled with what seemed to be vermouth while he sipped it he smoked a russian cigarette and with a gold pencil wrote out the menu of his luncheon in a few minutes the manager himself came hurrying out from the restaurant his salute was almost reverential when after a few moments conversation he departed he did so with the air of one taking leave of royalty lady weybourne who was an inquisitive little person was puzzled  i dont know who they are dick she confessed but i know the ways of this place well and i can tell you one thingthey are people of importance you can tell that by the way they are received these restaurant people dont make mistakes  of course they are people of importance the young man declared any one can see that by a glance at the girl i am sorry you dont know them he went on but youve got to find out who they are and pretty quickly too look here flossie i am a bit useful to you now and then arent i  without you my dear dick she murmured i should never be able to manage those awful trustees you are invaluable a perfect jewel of a brother  well ill give you that little electric coup√© you were so keen on last time we were in london if youll get me an introduction to that girl within twentyfour hours  lady weybourne gasped  what a whirlwind she exclaimed dicky are you by any chance in earnest  in earnest for the first time in my life he assured her something has got hold of me which im not going to part with  she considered him reflectively he was twentyseven years of age and notwithstanding the boundless opportunities of his youth and great wealth he had so far shown an almost singular indifference to the whole of the opposite sex from the fascinating chorus girls of london and new york to the no less enterprising young women of his own order as she sat there studying his features she felt a sensation almost of awe there was something entirely different something stronger in his face she thought for a moment of their father as she had known him in her childhood the founder of their fortunes a man who had risen from a moderate position to immense wealth through sheer force of will of pertinacity for the first time she saw the same look upon her brothers face  well she sighed i shall do my best to earn it i only hope dick that she is  she is what he demanded looking at her steadfastly  oh not engaged or anything i mean lady weybourne explained hastily i must admit dick although i dont suppose any sister is particularly keen upon her brothers young women that i think youve shown excellent taste she is absolutely the best style of any one ive seen in monte carlo  how are you going to manage that introduction he asked bluntly have you made any plans  i dont suppose it will be difficult she assured him lighting a cigarette and shaking her head at the tray of liqueurs which the sommelier was offering get me some cream for my coffee dick now ill tell you she continued as the waiter disappeared you will have to call that underma√Ætre dh√¥tel you had better give him a substantial tip and ask him quietly for their names then ill see about the rest  that seems sensible enough he admitted  and look here dick she went on i know how impetuous you are dont do anything foolish remember this isnt an ordinary adventure if you go rushing in upon it youll come to grief  i know he answered shortly i was fool enough to hang about the flower shops and that milliners this morning i couldnt help it i dont know whether she noticed i believe she did once our eyes did meet and although ill swear she never changed her expression i felt that the whole world didnt hold so small a creature as i here comes charles ill ask him  he beckoned to the ma√Ætre dh√¥tel and talked for a moment about the luncheon then he ordered a table for the next day and slipping a louis into the mans hand leaned over and whispered in his ear  i want you to tell me the name of the gentleman and young lady who are sitting over there at the corner table  the ma√Ætre dh√¥tel glanced covertly in the direction indicated he did not at once reply his face was perplexed almost troubled  i am very sorry sir he said hesitatingly but our orders are very strict monsieur ciro does not like anything in the way of gossip about our clients and the gentleman is a very honoured patron the young lady is his daughter  quite right the young man agreed bluntly this isnt an ordinary case charles you go over to the desk there write me down the name and bring it and theres a hundred franc note waiting here for you no need for the name to pass your lips  the man bowed and retreated in a few minutes he came back again and laid a small card upon the table  monsieur will pardon my reminding him he begged earnestly but if he will be so good as to never mention this little matter  richard nodded and waved him away  sure he promised  he drew the card towards him and looked at it in a puzzled manner then he passed it to his sister her expression too was blank  who in the name of mischief he exclaimed softly is mr grex     chapter v  who is mr grex   lady weybourne insisted after a reasonable amount of time spent over their coffee that her brother should pay the bill and leave the restaurant they walked slowly across the square  what are you going to do about it he asked  there is only one thing to be done she replied i shall speak to every one i meet this afternooni shall be in fact most sociableand sooner or later in our conversation i shall ask every one if they know mr grex and his daughter when i arrive at some one who does that will be the first step wont it  i wonder whether we shall see some one soon he grumbled looking around where are all the people today  she laughed softly  just a little impetuous arent you  i should say so he admitted id like to be introduced to her before four oclock propose to her this evening andand  and what  never mind he concluded marching on with his head turned towards the clouds lets go and sit down upon the terrace and talk about her  but my dear dicky his sister protested i dont want to sit upon the terrace i am going to my dressmakers across the way there and afterwards to lucies to try on some hats then i am going back to the hotel for an hours rest and to prink and afterwards into the sporting club at four oclock thats my programme i shall be doing what i can the whole of the time i shall make discreet enquiries of my dressmaker who knows everybody and i shant let a single acquaintance go by you will have to amuse yourself till four oclock at any rate theres sir henry hunterleys over there having coffee go and talk to him he may put you out of your misery thanks ever so much for my luncheon and au revoir  she turned away with a little nod her brother after a moments hesitation approached the table where hunterleys was sitting alone  how do you do sir henry  hunterleys returned his greeting a little blankly at first then he remembered the young man and held out his hand  of course you are richard lane arent you sit down and have some coffee what are you doing here  ive got a little boat in the harbour richard replied as he drew up a chair ive been at algiers for a time with some friends and ive brought them on here just been lunching with my sister are you alone  hunterleys hesitated  yes i am alone  wonderful place the young man went on wonderful crowd of people here too i suppose you know everybody he added warming up as he approached his subject  on the contrary hunterleys answered i am almost a stranger here i have been staying further down the coast  happen to know any one of the name of grex lane asked with elaborate carelessness  hunterleys made no immediate reply he seemed to be considering the name  grex he repeated knocking the ash from his cigarette rather an uncommon name isnt it why do you ask  oh ive seen an elderly man and a young lady about once or twice lane explained very interestinglooking people some one told me that their name was grex  there is a person living under that name i think hunterleys said who has taken the villa mimosa for the season  do you know him personally the young man asked eagerly  personally no i can scarcely say that i do  richard lane sighed it was disappointment number one for some reason or other too hunterleys seemed disposed to change the conversation  the young lady who is always with him richard persisted would that be his daughter  hunterleys turned a little in his seat and surveyed his questioner he had met lane once or twice and rather liked him  look here young fellow he said good humouredly let me ask you a question for a change what is the nature of these enquiries of yours  lane hesitated something in hunterleys face and manner induced him to tell the truth  i have fallen head over heels in love with the young lady he confessed dont think i am a confounded jackass i am not in the habit of doing such things im twentyseven and i have never gone out of my way to meet a girl yet this is somethingdifferent i want to find out about them and get an introduction  hunterleys shook his head regretfully  i am afraid he said that i can be of no use to youno practical use that is i can only give you one little piece of advice  well what is it richard asked eagerly  if you are in earnest hunterleys continued and i will do you the credit to believe that you are you had better pack up your things return to your yacht and take a cruise somewhere  take a cruise somewhere  hunterleys nodded  get out of monte carlo as quickly as you can and above all dont think anything more of that young lady get the idea out of your head as quickly as you can  the young man was sitting upright in his chair his manner was half minatory  say what do you mean by this he demanded  exactly what i said just now hunterleys rejoined if you are in earnest and i have no doubt that you are i should clear out  what is it you are trying to make me understand richard asked bluntly  that you have about as much chance with that young lady hunterleys assured him as with that very graceful statue in the square yonder  richard sat for a moment with knitted brows  then you know who she is any way  whether i do or whether i do not the older man said gravely so far as i am concerned the subject is exhausted i have given you the best advice you ever had in your life its up to you to follow it  richard looked at him blankly  well youve got me puzzled he confessed  hunterleys rose to his feet and summoning a waiter paid his bill  youll excuse me wont you he begged i have an appointment in a few minutes if you are wise young man he added patting him on the shoulder as he turned to go you will take my advice  left to himself richard lane strolled around the place towards the terrace he had no fancy for the rooms and he found a seat as far removed as possible from the tir du pigeons he sat there with folded arms looking out across the sundappled sea his matteroffact brain offered him but one explanation as to the meaning of hunterleys words and against that explanation his whole being was in passionate revolt he represented a type of young man who possesses morals by reason of a certain unsuspected idealism mingled with perfect physical sanity it seemed to him as he sat there that he had been waiting for this day for years the old nights in new york and paris and london floated before his memory he pushed them on one side with a shiver and yet with a curious feeling of exultation he recalled a certain sensation which had been drawn through his life like a thin golden thread a sensation which had a habit of especially asserting itself in the midst of these youthful orgies a curious sense of waiting for something to happen a sensation which had been responsible very often for what his friends had looked upon as eccentricity he knew now that this thing had arrived and everything else in life seemed to pale by the side of it hunterleys words had thrown him temporarily into a strange turmoil solitude for a few moments he had felt to be entirely necessary yet directly he was alone directly he was free to listen to his convictions he could have laughed at that first mad surging of his blood the fierce instinctive rebellion against the conclusion to which hunterleys words seemed to point now that he was alone he was not even angry no one else could possibly understand  before long he was once more upon his feet starting out upon his quest with renewed energy he had scarcely taken a dozen steps however when he came face to face with lady hunterleys and mr draconmeyer quite oblivious of the fact that they seemed inclined to avoid him he greeted them both with unusual warmth  saw your husband just now lady hunterleys he remarked a little puzzled i fancied he said he was alone here  she smiled  we did not come together she explained in fact our meeting was almost accidental henry had been at bordighera and san remo and i came out with mr and mrs draconmeyer  the young man nodded and turned towards draconmeyer who was standing a little on one side as though anxious to proceed  mr draconmeyer doesnt remember me perhaps i met him at my sisters lady weybournes just before christmas  i remember you perfectly mr draconmeyer assured him courteously we have all been admiring your beautiful yacht in the harbour there  i was thinking of getting up a little cruise before long richard continued if so i hope youll all join us flossie is going to be hostess and the montressors are passengers already  they murmured something noncommittal lady hunterleys seemed as though about to pass on but lane blocked the way  i only arrived the other day from algiers he went on making frantic efforts to continue the conversation i brought freddy montressor and his sister and fothergill  mr montressor has come to the hotel de paris lady hunterleys remarked what sort of weather did you have in algiers  ripping the young man replied absently entirely oblivious of the fact that they had been driven away by incessant rain this place is much more fun though he added with sudden inspiration crowds of interesting people i suppose you know every one  lady hunterleys shook her head  indeed i do not mr draconmeyer here is my guide he is as good as a walking directory  i wonder if either of you know some people named grex richard asked with studious indifference  mr draconmeyer for the first time showed some signs of interest he looked at their questioner steadfastly  grex he repeated a very uncommon name  very uncommonlooking people richard declared the man is elderly and looks as though he took great care of himselfawfully well turned out and all that the daughter isgoodlooking  mr draconmeyer took off his goldrimmed spectacles and rubbed them with his handkerchief  why do you ask he enquired is this just curiosity  rather more than that richard said boldly its interest  mr draconmeyer readjusted his spectacles  mr grex he announced is a gentleman of great wealth and illustrious birth who has taken a very magnificent villa and desires for a time to lead a life of seclusion that is as much as i or any one else knows  what about the young lady richard persisted  the young lady mr draconmeyer answered is as you surmised his daughter shall we finish our promenade lady hunterleys  richard stood grudgingly a little on one side  mr draconmeyer he said desperately do you think thered be any chance of my getting an introduction to the young lady  mr draconmeyer at first smiled and then began to laugh as though something in the idea tickled him he looked at the young man and richard hated him  not the slightest in the world i should think he declared good afternoon  lady hunterleys joined in her companions amusement as they continued their promenade  is the young man in love do you suppose she enquired lightly  if so her companion replied he has made a somewhat unfortunate choice however it really doesnt matter love at his age is nothing more than a mood it will pass as all moods pass  she turned and looked at him  do you mean she asked incredulously that youth is incapable of love  they had paused for a moment looking out across the bay towards the glittering white front of bordighera mr draconmeyer took off his hat somehow without it in that clear light one realised notwithstanding his spectacles his grizzled black beard of unfashionable shape his overmassive forehead and shaggy eyebrows that his too was the face of one whose feet were not always upon the earth  perhaps he answered it is a matter of degree yet i am almost tempted to answer your question absolutely i do not believe that youth can love because from the first it misapprehends the meaning of the term i believe that the gift of loving comes only to those who have reached the hills  she looked at him a little surprised always thoughtful always sympathetic generally stimulating it was very seldom that she had heard him speak with so much real feeling suddenly he turned his head from the sea his eyes seemed to challenge hers  your question he continued touches upon one of the great tragedies of life upon those who are free from their youth there is a great tax levied nature has decreed that they should feel something which they call love they marry and in this small world of ours they give a hostage as heavy as a millstone of their chances of happiness for it is only in later life when a man has knowledge as well as passion when unless he is fortunate it is too late that he can know what love is  she moved a little uneasily she felt that something was coming which she desired to avoid some confidence something from which she must escape the memory of her husbands warning was vividly present with her she felt the magnetism of her companions words his compelling gaze  it is so with me he went on leaning a little towards her only in my case  providence was intervening never had the swish of a womans skirt sounded so sweet to her before  heres dolly montressor she interrupted coming up to speak to us     chapter vi  cakes and counsels   the sporting club seemed to fill up that afternoon almost as soon as the doors were opened at halfpast four people were standing two or three deep around the roulette tables selingman very warm and looking somewhat annoyed withdrew himself from the front row of the lower table and taking mr grex and draconmeyer by the arm led them towards the tearoom  i have lost six louis he exclaimed fretfully i have had the devils own luck i shall play no more for the present we will have tea together  they appropriated a round table in a distant corner of the restaurant  history selingman continued heaping his plate with rich cakes has been made before now in strange places why not here we sit here in close touch with one of the most interesting phases of modern life we can even hear the voice of fate the click of the little ball as it finishes its momentous journey and sinks to rest why should we too not speak of fateful things  mr draconmeyer glanced around  for myself he muttered i must say that i prefer a smaller room and a locked door  selingman demolished a chocolate √©clair and shook his head vigorously  the public places for me he declared now look around there is no one as you will admit within earshot very well what will they say those who suspect us if they see us drinking tea and eating many cakes together certainly not that we conspire that we make mischief here on the other hand they will say there are three great men at play come to monte carlo to rest from their labours to throw aside for a time the burden from their shoulders to flirt to play to eat cakes it is a good place to talk this and i have something in my mind which must be said  mr grex sipped his pale lemonflavoured tea and toyed with his cigarettecase he was eating nothing  assuming you to be a man of sense my dear selingman he remarked i think that what you have to say is easily surmised the englishman  selingman agreed with ponderous emphasis  we have before us he declared a task of unusual delicacy our friend from paris may be here at any moment how we shall fare with him heaven only knows but there is one thing very certain at the sight of hunterleys he will take alarm he will be like a frightened bird all ruffled feathers he will never settle down to a serious discussion hunterleys knows this that is why he presents himself without reserve in public why he is surrounded with secret service men of his own country all on the qui vive for the coming of douaille  it appears tolerably certain mr draconmeyer said calmly that we must get rid of hunterleys  mr grex looked out of the window for a moment  to some extent he observed i am a stranger here i come as a guest to this conference as our other friend from paris comes too any small task which may arise from the necessities of the situation devolves i think i may say without unfairness upon you my friend  selingman assented gloomily  that is true he admitted but in hunterleys we have to do with no ordinary man he does not gamble to the ordinary attractions of monte carlo he is indifferent he is one of these thinblooded men with principles cromwell would have made a lay preacher of him  you find difficulties mr grex queried with slightly uplifted eyebrows  not difficulties selingman continued quickly or if indeed we do call them difficulties let us say at once that they are very minor ones only the thing must be done neatly and without ostentation for the sake of our friend who comes  my own position mr draconmeyer intervened is in a way delicate the unexplained disappearance of sir henry hunterleys might by some people be connected with the great friendship which exists between my wife and his  mr grex polished his hornrimmed eyeglass selingman nodded sympathetically neither of them looked at draconmeyer finally selingman heaved a sigh and brushed the crumbs from his waistcoat  if one were assured he murmured thoughtfully that hunterleys presence here had a real significance  draconmeyer pushed his chair forward and leaned across the table the heads of the three men were close together his tone was stealthily lowered  let me tell you something my friend selingman which i think should strengthen any halfformed intention you may have in your brain hunterleys is no ordinary sojourner here you were quite right when you told me that his stay at bordighera and san remo was a matter of days only now i will tell you something three weeks ago he was at bukharest he spent two days with novisko from there he went to sofia he was heard of in athens and constantinople my own agent wrote me that he was in belgrade hunterleys is the bosom friend of the english foreign secretary that i know for myself you have your reports you can read between the lines i tell you that hunterleys is the man who has paralysed our action amongst the balkan states he has played a neat little game out there it is he who was the inspiration of roumania it is he who drafted the secret understanding with turkey the war which we hoped for will not take place from there hunterleys came in a gunboat and landed on the italian coast he lingered at bordighera for appearances only he is here if he can to break up our conference i tell you that you none of you appreciate this man hunterleys is the most dangerous englishman living  one moment selingman interrupted to some extent i follow you but when you speak of hunterleys as a power in the present tense doesnt it occur to you that his party is not in office he is simply a member of the opposition if his party get in again at the next election i grant you that he will be foreign minister and a dangerous one but today he is simply a private person  it is not every one mr draconmeyer said slowly who bows his knee to the shibboleth of party politics remember that i come to you from london and i have information of which few others are possessed hunterleys is of the stuff of which patriots are made party is no concern of his he and the present foreign secretary are the greatest of personal friends i know for a fact that hunterleys has actually been consulted and has helped in one or two recent crises the very circumstance that he is not of the ruling party makes a free lance of him when his people are in power he will have to take office and wear the shackles today with every quality which would make him the greatest foreign minister england has ever had since disraeli he is nothing more nor less than a roving diplomatist emperor of his countrys secret service if you like to put it so furthermore look a little into that future of which i have spoken the present english government will last at the most another two years i tell you that when they go out of power whoever comes in hunterleys will go to the foreign office we shall have to deal with a man who knows a man  i am not wholly satisfied with these √©clairs selingman interrupted gazing into the dish ma√Ætre dh√¥tel come and listen to an awful complaint he went on and addressing one of the headwaiters your √©clairs are too small your creamcakes too irresistible i eat too much here how i ask you in the name of common sense can a man dine who takes tea here bring the bill  the man smiling hastened away not a word had passed between the three yet the other two understood the situation perfectly hunterleys and richard lane had entered the room together and were seated at an adjoining table selingman plunged into a fresh tirade pointing to the halfdemolished plateful of cakes  i will eat one more he declared we will bilk the management the bill is made out i shall not be observed our friend he continued under his breath has secured a valuable bodyguard something very large and exceedingly powerful  draconmeyer hesitated for a moment then he turned to mr grex  you have perhaps observed he said the young man who is seated at the next table it may amuse you to hear of a very extraordinary piece of impertinence of which only this afternoon he was guilty he accosted me upon the terracehe is a young american whom i have met in londonand asked me for information respecting a mr and miss grex  mr grex looked slowly towards the speaker there was very little change in his face yet draconmeyer seemed in some way confused  you will understand i am sure sir he continued a little hastily that i was in no way to blame for the question which the young man addressed to me he had the presumption to enquire whether i could procure for him an introduction to the young lady whom he knew as miss grex even at this moment draconmeyer went on lowering his voice he is trying to persuade hunterleys to let him come over to us  the young man mr grex said deliberately is ignorant if necessary he must be taught his lesson  selingman intervened he breathed a heavy sigh  well he observed i perceive that the task at which we have hinted is to fall upon my shoulders we must do what we can i am a tenderhearted man and if extremes can be avoided i shall like my task better and now i have changed my mind the loss of that six louis weighs upon me i shall endeavour to regain it let us go  they rose and passed out into the roulette rooms richard lane who remained in his seat with an effort watched them pass with a frown upon his face  say sir henry he complained i dont quite understand this why id only got to go over to draconmeyer there and stand and talk for a moment and he must have introduced me  hunterleys shook his head  let me assure you he said that draconmeyer would have done nothing of the sort for one thing we dont introduce over here as a matter of course as you do in america and for anotherwell i wont trouble you with the other reason look here lane take my advice theres a sensible fellow i am a man of the world you know and there are certain situations in which one can make no mistake if you are as hard hit as you say you are go for a cruise and get over it dont hang around here no good will come of it  the young man set his teeth he was looking very determined indeed  there isnt anything in this world short of a bomb he declared which is going to blow me out of monte carlo before i have made the acquaintance of miss grex     chapter vii  the effrontery of richard   hunterleys took leave of his companion as soon as they arrived at the roulette rooms  take my advice lane he said seriously find something to occupy your thoughts throw a few hundred thousand of your dollars away at the tables if you must do something foolish youll get into far less trouble  richard made no direct reply he watched hunterleys depart and took up his place opposite the door to await his sisters arrival it was a quarter to five before she appeared and found him waiting for her in the doorway  say youre late flossie he grumbled i thought you were going to be here soon after four  she glanced at the little watch upon her wrist  how the time does slip away she sighed but really dicky i am late in your interests as much as anything i have been paying a few calls i went out to the villa rosa to see some people who almost live here and then i met lady crawley and she made me go in and have some tea  well he asked impatiently well  she laid her fingers upon his arm and drew him into a less crowded part of the room  dicky she confessed i dont seem to have had a bit of luck the comtesse dhausson who lives at the villa rosa knows them and showed me from the window the villa mimosa where they live but she would tell me absolutely nothing about them the villa is the finest in monte carlo and has always been taken before by some one of note she declares that they do not mix in the society of the place but she admits that she has heard a rumour that grex is only an assumed name  i begin to believe that myself he said doggedly hunterleys knows who they are and wont tell me so does that fellow draconmeyer  sir henry and mr draconmeyer she repeated raising her eyes my dear dick that doesnt sound very reasonable does it  i tell you that they do he persisted they as good as told me so hunterleys especially left me here only halfanhour ago and his last words were advising me to chuck it hes a sensible chap enough but he wont even tell me why ive had enough of it ive a good mind to take the bull by the horns myself mr grex is here now somewhere about he was sitting with mr draconmeyer and a fat old german a few minutes ago at the next table to ours if i had been alone i should have gone up and chanced being introduced but hunterleys wouldnt let me  well so far lady weybourne admitted i fear that i havent done much towards that electric coup√© but she added in a changed tone looking across the tables there is just one thing dicky fate sometimes has a great deal to do with these little affairs look over there  richard left his sister precipitately without even a word of farewell she watched him cross the room and smiled at the fury of a little frenchman whom he nearly knocked over in his hurry to get round to the other side of the table a moment later he was standing a few feet away from the girl who had taken so strange a hold upon his affections he himself was conscious of a curious and unfamiliar nervousness physically he felt as though he had been running hard he set his teeth and tried to keep cool he found some plaques in his pocket and began to stake then he became aware that the girl was holding in her hand a note and endeavouring to attract the attention of the man who was giving change  petite monnaie sil vous pla√Æt he heard her say stretching out the note  the man took no notice richard held out his hand  will you allow me to get it changed for you he asked  her first impulse at the sound of his voice was evidently one of resentment she seemed indeed in the act of returning some chilling reply then she glanced half carelessly towards him and her eyes rested upon his face richard was goodlooking enough but the chief characteristic of his face was a certain honesty which seemed accentuated at that moment by his undoubted earnestness the type was perhaps strange to her she was almost startled by what she saw scarcely knowing what she did she allowed him to take the note from her fingers  thank you very much she murmured  richard procured the change he would have lifted every one out of the way if she had been in a hurry then he turned round and counted it very slowly into her hands from the left one she had removed the glove and he saw to his relief that there was no engagement ring there he counted so slowly that towards the end she seemed to become a little impatient  that is quite all right she said it was very kind of you to trouble  she spoke very correct english with the slightest of foreign accents he looked once more into her eyes  it was a pleasure he declared  she smiled faintly an act of graciousness which absolutely turned his head with her hand full of plaques she moved away and found a place a little lower down the table richard fought with his first instinct and conquered it he remained where he was and when he moved it was in another direction he went into the bar and ordered a whisky and soda he was as excited as he had been in the old days when he had rowed stroke in a winning race for his college boat he felt somehow or other that the first step had been a success she had been inclined at first to resent his offer she had looked at him and changed her mind even when she had turned away she had smiled it was ridiculous but he felt as though he had taken a great step presently lady weybourne on her way to the baccarat rooms saw him sitting there and looked in  well dicky she exclaimed what luck  sit down flossie he begged ive spoken to her  you dont mean she began horrified  oh no no nothing of that sort he interrupted dont think im such a blundering ass she was trying to get change and couldnt reach i took the note from her got the change and gave it to her she said thank you when she went away she smiled  lady weybourne flopped down upon the divan and screamed with laughter  dicky she murmured wiping her eyes tell me is that why you are sitting there looking as though you could see right into heaven do you know that your face was one great beam when i came in  cant help it he answered contentedly ive spoken to her and she smiled  lady weybourne opened her gold bag and produced a card  well she said here is another chance for you of course i dont know that it will come to anything but you may as well try your luck  what is it he asked  she thrust a square of giltedged cardboard into his hand  its an invitation she told him from the directors to attend a dinner at la turbie golf clubhouse up in the mountains tonight it isnt entirely a joke i can tell you it takes at least an hour to get there climbing all the way and the place is as likely as not to be wrapped in clouds but a great many of the important people are going and as i happened to see mr grexs name amongst the list of members the other night there is always a chance that they may be there if not you see you can soon come back  im on richard decided give me the ticket i am awfully obliged to you flossie  if she is there lady weybourne declared rising i shall consider that it is equivalent to one wheel of the coup√©  have a cocktail instead he suggested  she shook her head  too early if we meet later on ill have one what are you going to do  same as ive been doing ever since lunch he answeredhang around and see if i can meet any one who knows them  she laughed and hurried off into the baccarat room and richard presently returned to the table at which the girl was still playing he took particular care not to approach her but he found a place on the opposite side of the room from which he could watch her unobserved she was still standing and apparently she was losing her money once with a little petulant frown she turned away and moved a few yards lower down the room the first time she staked in her new position she won and a smile which it seemed to him was the most brilliant he had ever seen parted her lips he stood there looking at her and in the midst of a scene where money seemed god of all things he realised all manner of strange and pleasant sensations the fact that he had twenty thousand francs in his pocket to play with scarcely occurred to him he was watching a little wisp of golden hair by her ear watching her slightly wrinkled forehead as she leaned over the table her little grimace as she lost and her stake was swept away she seemed indifferent to all bystanders it was obvious that she had very few acquaintances where he stood it was not likely that she would notice him and he abandoned himself wholly to the luxury of gazing at her then some instinct caused him to turn his head he felt that he in his turn was being watched he glanced towards the divan set against the wall by the side of which he was standing mr grex was seated there only a few feet away smoking a cigarette their eyes met and richard was conscious of a sudden embarrassment he felt like a detected thief and he acted at that moment as he often didentirely on impulse he leaned down and resolutely addressed mr grex  i should be glad sir if you would allow me to speak to you for a moment  mr grexs expression was one of cold surprise unmixed with any curiosity  do you address me he asked  his tone was vastly discouraging but it was too late to draw back  i should like to speak to you if i may richard continued  i am not aware mr grex said that i have the privilege of your acquaintance  you havent richard admitted but all the same i want to speak to you if i may  since you have gone so far mr grex conceded you had better finish but you must allow me to tell you in advance that i look upon any address from a perfect stranger as an impertinence  youll think worse of me before ive finished then richard declared desperately you dont mind if i sit down  these seats mr grex replied coldly are free to all  the young man took his place upon the divan with a sinking heart there was something in mr grexs tone which seemed to destroy all his confidence a note of something almost alien in the measured contempt of his speech  i am sorry to give you any offence richard began i happened to notice that you were watching me i was looking at your daughterstaring at her i am afraid you thought me impertinent  your perspicuity mr grex observed seems to be of a higher order than your manners you are perhaps a stranger to civilised society  i dont know about that richard went on doggedly i have been to college and mixed with the usual sort of people my birth isnt much to speak of perhaps if you count that for anything  something which was almost like the ghost of a smile devoid of any trace of humour parted mr grexs lips  if i count that for anything he repeated half closing his eyes for a moment pray proceed young man  i am an american richard continued my name is richard lane my father was very wealthy and i am his heir my sister is lady weybourne i was lunching with her at ciros today when i saw you and your daughter i think i can say that i am a respectable person i have a great many friends to whom i can refer you  i am not thinking of engaging anybody that i know of mr grex murmured  i want to marry your daughter richard declared desperately feeling that any further form of explanation would only lead him into greater trouble  mr grex knocked the ash from his cigarette  is your keeper anywhere in the vicinity he asked  i am perfectly sane richard assured him i know that it sounds foolish but it isnt really i am twentyseven years old and i have never asked a girl to marry me yet i have been waiting until  the words died away upon his lips it was impossible for him to continue the cold enmity of this man was too chilling  i am absolutely in earnest he insisted i have been endeavouring all day to find some mutual friend to introduce me to your daughter will you do so will you give me a chance  i will not mr grex replied firmly  why not please tell me why not richard begged i am not asking for anything more now than just an opportunity to talk with her  it is not a matter which admits of discussion mr grex pronounced i have permitted you to say what you wished notwithstanding the colossal the unimaginable impertinence of your suggestion i request you to leave me now and i advise you most heartily to indulge no more in the most preposterous and idiotic idea which ever entered into the head of an apparently sane young man  richard rose slowly to his feet  very well sir he replied ill go all the same what you have said doesnt make any difference  does not make any difference mr grex repeated with arched eyebrows  none at all richard declared i dont know what your objection to me is but i hope youll get over it some day id like to make friends with you perhaps later on you may look at the matter differently  later on mr grex murmured  when i have married your daughter richard concluded marching defiantly away  mr grex watched the young man until he had disappeared in the crowd then he leaned hack amongst the cushions of the divan with folded arms little lines had become visible around his eyes there was a slight twitching at the corners of his lips he looked like a man who was inwardly enjoying some huge joke     chapter viii  up the mountain   richard passing the hotel de paris that evening in his wickedlooking grey racing car saw hunterleys standing on the steps and pulled up  not going up to la turbie by any chance he enquired  hunterleys nodded  im going up to the dinner he replied the hotel motor is starting from here in a few minutes  come with me richard invited  hunterleys looked a little doubtfully at the long low machine  are you going to shoot up he asked its rather a dangerous road  ill take care of you the young man promised that hotel bus will be crammed  they glided through the streets on to the broad hard road and crept upwards with scarcely a sound through the blueblack twilight around and in front of them little lights shone out from the villas and small houses dotted away in the mountains almost imperceptibly they passed into a different atmosphere the air became cold and exhilarating the flavour of the mountain snows gave life to the breeze hunterleys buttoned up his coat but bared his head  my young friend he said this is wonderful  its a great climb richard assented and doesnt she just eat it up  they paused for a moment at la turbie below them was a chain of glittering lights fringing the bay of mentone and at their feet the lights of the casino and monte carlo flared up through the scented darkness once more they swung upwards the road now had become narrower and the turnings more frequent they were up above the region of villas and farmhouses in a country which seemed to consist only of bleak hillside open to the winds wrapped in shadows now and then they heard the tinkling of a goat bell far below they saw the twin lights of other ascending cars they reached the plateau at last and drew up before the clubhouse ablaze with cheerful lights  ill just leave the car under the trees richard declared no one will be staying late  hunterleys unwound his scarf and handed his coat and hat to a pageboy then he stood suddenly rigid he bit his lip his wife had just issued from the cloakroom and was drawing on her gloves she saw him and hesitated she too turned a little paler slowly hunterleys approached her  an unexpected pleasure he murmured  i am here with mr draconmeyer she told him almost bluntly  hunterleys bowed  and a party he enquired  no she replied i really did not want to come mr draconmeyer had promised monsieur pericot the director here to come and bring mrs draconmeyer at the last moment however she was not well enough and he almost insisted upon my taking her place  is it necessary to explain hunterleys asked quietly you know very well how i regard this friendship of yours  i am sorry she said if i had known that we were likely to meetwell i would not have come here tonight  you were at least considerate he remarked bitterly may i be permitted to compliment you upon your toilette  as you pay for my frocks she answered there is certainly no reason why you shouldnt admire them  he bit his lip there was a certain challenge in her expression which made him for a moment feel weak she was a very beautiful woman and she was looking her best he spoke quickly on another subject  are you still he asked troubled by the attentions of the person you spoke to me about  i am still watched she replied drily  i have made some enquiries hunterleys continued and i have come to the conclusion that you are right  and you still tell me that you have nothing to do with it  i assure you upon my honour that i have nothing whatever to do with it  it was obvious that she was puzzled but at that moment mr draconmeyer presented himself the newcomer simply bowed to hunterleys and addressed some remark about the room to violet then richard came up and they all passed on into the reception room where two or three very fussy but very suave and charming frenchmen were receiving the guests a few minutes afterwards dinner was announced a black frown was upon richards forehead  she isnt coming he muttered i say sir henry you wont mind if we leave early  i shall be jolly glad to get away hunterleys assented heartily  then he suddenly felt a grip of iron upon his arm  shes come richard murmured ecstatically look at her all in white just look at the colour of her hair there she is going into the reception room jove im glad we are here after all  hunterleys smiled a little wearily they passed on into the salle √† manger the seats at the long diningtables were not reserved and they found a little table for two in a corner which they annexed hunterleys was in a grim humour but his companion was in the wildest spirits considering that he was placed where he could see mr grex and his daughter nearly the whole of the time he really did contrive to keep his eyes away from them to a wonderful extent but he talked of her unceasingly  say im sorry for you sir henry he declared its just your bad luck being here with me while ive got this fit on but ive got to talk to some one so you may as well make up your mind to it there never was anything like that girl upon the earth there never was anything like the feeling you get he went on when youre absolutely and entirely convinced when you knowthat theres just one girl who counts for you in the whole universe gee whiz it does get hold of you i suppose youve been through it all though  yes ive been through it hunterleys admitted with a sigh  the young man bit his lip the story of hunterleys matrimonial differences was already being whispered about richard talked polo vigorously for the next quarter of an hour it was not until the coffee and liqueurs arrived that they returned to the subject of miss grex then it was hunterleys himself who introduced it he was beginning to rather like this big selfconfident young man so full of his simple love affair so absolutely honest in his purpose in his outlook upon life  lane he said i have given you several hints during the day havent i  thats so richard agreed youve done your best to head me off so did my future fatherinlaw sort of hopeless task i can assure you  hunterleys shook his head  honestly he continued i wouldnt let myself think too much about her lane i dont want to explain exactly what i mean theres no real reason why i shouldnt tell you what i know about mr grex but for a good many peoples sakes its just as well that those few of us who know keep quiet i am sure you trust me and its just the same therefore if i tell you straight as man to man that youre only laying up for yourself a store of unhappiness by fixing your thoughts so entirely upon that young woman  richard for all his sublime confidence was a little staggered by the others earnestness  look here he said the girl isnt married to start with  not that i know of hunterleys confessed  and shes not engaged because ive seen her left hand richard proceeded im not one of those americans who go shouting all over the world that because ive got a few million dollars i am the equal of anybody but honestly sir henry there are a good many prejudices over this side that you fellows lay too much store by grex may be a nobleman in disguise i dont care i am a man i can give her everything she needs in life and i am not going to admit even if she is an aristocrat that you croakers are right when you shake your heads and advise me to give her up i dont care who she is hunterleys i am going to marry her  hunterleys helped himself to a liqueur  young man he said in a sense i admire your independence in another i think youve got all the conceit a man needs for this world let us presume for a moment that she is as you surmise the daughter of a nobleman when it suits her father to throw off his incognito she is probably in touch with young men in the highest circles of many countries why should you suppose that you can come along and cut them all out  because i love her the young man answered simply they dont  you must remember hunterleys resumed that all foreign noblemen are not what they are represented to be in your comic papers austrian and russian men of high rank are most of them very highly cultivated very accomplished and very goodlooking you dont know much of the world do you its a pretty formidable enterprise to come from a new york office with only harvard behind you and a year or sos travel as a tourist and enter the list against men who have had twice your opportunities i am talking to you like this young fellow for your good i hope you realise that youre used to getting what you want thats because youve been brought up in a country where money can do almost anything i am behind the scenes here and i can assure you that your money wont count for much with mr grex  i never thought it would richard admitted i think when i talk to her shell understand that i care more than any of the others if you want to know the reason thats why im so hopeful  monsieur le directeur had risen to his feet some one had proposed his health and he made a graceful little speech of acknowledgment he remained standing for a few minutes after the cheers which had greeted his neat oratorical display had died away the conclusion of his remarks came as rather a surprise to his guests  i have to ask you ladies and gentlemen he announced with many many regrets and begging you to forgive my apparent inhospitality to make your arrangements for leaving us as speedily as may be possible our magnificent situation with which i believe that most of you are familiar has but one drawback we are subject to very dense mountain mists and alas i have to tell you that one of these has come on most unexpectedly and the descent must be made with the utmost care believe me there is no risk or any danger he went on earnestly so long as you instruct your chauffeurs to proceed with all possible caution at the same time as there is very little chance of the mist becoming absolutely dispelled before daylight in your own interests i would suggest that a start be made as soon as possible  every one rose at once richard and hunterleys amongst them  this will test your skill tonight young man hunterleys remarked hows the nerve eh  richard smiled almost beatifically for once he had allowed his eyes to wander and he was watching the girl with golden hair who was at that moment receiving the respectful homage of the director  lunatics and men who are head over heels in love he declared never come to any harm youll be perfectly safe with me     chapter ix  in the mists   their first glimpse of the night as hunterleys and lane passed out through the grudgingly opened door was sufficiently disconcerting a little murmur of dismay broke from the assembled crowd nothing was to be seen but a dense bank of white mist through which shone the brilliant lights of the automobiles waiting at the door monsieur le directeur hastened about doing his best to reassure everybody  if i thought it was of the slightest use he declared i would ask you all to stay but when the clouds once stoop like this there is not likely to be any change for twentyfour hours and we have not alas sleeping accommodation if the cars are slowly driven and kept to the inside it is only a matter of a mile or two before you will drop below the level of the clouds  hunterleys and lane made their way out to the front and with their coat collars turned up groped their way to the turf on the other side of the avenue from where they stood looking downwards the whole world seemed wrapped in mysterious and somber silence there was nothing to be seen but the grey driving clouds in less than a minute their hair and eyebrows were dripping a slight breeze had sprung up the cold was intense  cheerful sort of place this lane remarked gloomily shall we make a start  hunterleys hesitated  not just yet look  he pointed downwards for a moment the clouds had parted thousands of feet below like little pinpricks of red fire they saw the lights of monte carlo almost as they looked the clouds closed up again it was as though they had peered into another world  jove that was queer lane muttered look whats that  a long ray of sickly yellow light shone for a moment and was then suddenly blotted out by a rolling mass of vapour the clouds had closed in again once more the obscurity was denser than ever  the lighthouse hunterleys replied do you think its any use waiting  well go inside and put on our coats lane suggested my car is by the side of the avenue there i covered it over and left it  they found their coats in the hall wrapped themselves up and lit cigarettes already many of the cars had started and vanished cautiously into obscurity every now and then one could hear the tooting of their horns from far away below the chief steward was directing the departures and insisting upon an interval of three minutes between each the two men stood on one side and watched him he was holding open the door of a large exceptionally handsome car on the other side was a servant in white livery lane gripped his companions arm  there she goes he exclaimed  the girl followed by mr grex stepped into the landaulette which was brilliantly illuminated inside with electric light almost immediately the car glided noiselessly off the two men watched it until it disappeared then they crossed the road  now then sir henry richard observed grimly as he turned the handle of the car and they took their places in the little wellshaped space better say your prayers im going to drive slowly enough but its an awful job this crawling down the side of a mountain in the dark with nothing between you and eternity but your brakes  they crept off as far as the first turn the lights from the clubhouse helped them immediately afterwards however the obscurity was enveloping their faces were wet and shiny with moisture even the fingers of lanes gloves which gripped the wheel were sodden he proceeded at a snails pace keeping always on the inside of the road and only a few inches from the wall or bank once he lost his way and his front wheel struck a small stump but they were going too slowly for disaster another time he failed to follow the turn of the road and found himself in a rough cart track they backed with difficulty and got right once more at the fourth turn they came suddenly upon a huge car which had left the road as they had done and was standing amongst the pine trees its lights flaring through the mist  hullo lane called out coming to a standstill youve missed the turn  my master is going to stay here all night the chauffeur shouted back  a man put his head from the window and began to talk in rapid french  it is inconceivable he exclaimed that any one should attempt the descent we have rugs my wife and i we stay here till the clouds pass  good night then lane cried cheerfully  not sure that youre not wise hunterleys added with a shiver  twice they stopped while lane rubbed the moisture from his gloves and lit a fresh cigarette  this is a test for your nerve young fellow hunterleys remarked are you feeling it  not in the least lane replied i cant make out though why that steward made us all start at intervals of three minutes seems to me we should have been better going together at this pace save any one from getting lost anyhow  they crawled on for another twenty minutes the routine was always the samea hundred yards or perhaps two an abrupt turn and then a similar distance the other way they had one or two slight misadventures but they made progress once through a rift they caught a momentary vision of a carpet of lights at a giddy distance below  well make it all right lane declared crawling around another corner gee but this is the toughest thing in driving ive ever known i can do ninety with this car easier than i can do this three hullo some one else in trouble  before them in the middle of the road a light was being slowly swung backwards and forwards lane brought the car to a standstill he had scarcely done so when they were conscious of the sound of footsteps all around them the arms of both men were seized from behind they were addressed in guttural french  messieurs will be pleased to descend  what thewhats wrong lane demanded  descend at once was the prompt order  by the light of the lantern which the speaker was holding they caught a glimpse of a dozen white faces and the dull gleam of metal from the firearms which his companions were carrying hunterleys stepped out an escort of two men was at once formed on either side of him  tell us what its all about anyhow he asked coolly  nothing serious the same guttural voice answereda little affair which will be settled in a few minutes as for you monsieur the man continued turning to lane you will drive your car slowly to the next turn and leave it there afterwards you will return with me  richard set his teeth and leaned over his wheel then it suddenly flashed into his mind that mr grex and his daughter were already amongst the captured he quickly abandoned his first instinct  with pleasure monsieur he assented tell me when to stop  he drove the car a few yards round the corner past a line of others their lights were all extinguished and the chauffeurs absent  this is a pleasant sort of picnic he grumbled as he brought his car to a standstill now what do i do monsieur  you return with me if you please was the reply  richard stood for a moment irresolute the idea of giving in without a struggle was most distasteful to this selfreliant young american then he realised that not only was his captor armed but that there were men behind him and one on either side  lead the way he decided tersely  they marched him up the hill a little way across some short turf and round the back of a rock to a long building which he remembered to have noticed on his way up his guide threw open the door and richard looked in upon a curious scene ranged up against the further wall were about a dozen of the guests who had preceded him in his departure from the clubhouse one man only had his hands tied behind him the others apparently were considered harmless mr grex was the one man and there was a little blood dripping from his right hand the girl stood by his side she was no paler than usualshe showed indeed no signs of terror at allbut her eyes were bright with indignation one man was busy stripping the jewels from the women and throwing them into a bag in the far corner the little group of chauffeurs was being watched by two more men also carrying firearms lane looked down the line of faces lady hunterleys was there and by her side draconmeyer hunterleys was a little apart from the others freddy montressor who was leaning against the wall chuckled as lane came in  so theyve got you too dicky have they he remarked its a holdupa bully one too makes one feel quite homesick eh how much have you got on you  precious little thank heavens richard muttered  his eyes were fixed upon the brigand who was collecting the jewels and who was now approaching miss grex he felt something tingling in his blood one of the guests began to talk excitedly the man who was apparently the leader and who was standing at the door with an electric torch in one hand and a revolver in the other stepped a little forward  ladies and gentlemen he said once more i beg you not to be alarmed so long as you part with your valuables peaceably you will be at liberty to depart as soon as every one has been dealt with if there is no resistance there will be no trouble we do not wish to hurt any one  the collector of jewels had arrived in front of the girl she unfastened her necklace and handed it to him  the little pendant around my neck she remarked calmly is valueless i desire to keep it  impossible the man replied off with it  but i insist she exclaimed it is an heirloom  the man laughed brutally his filthy hand was raised to her neck even as he touched her lane with a roar of anger sent one of his guards flying on to the floor of the barn and snatching the gun from his hand sprang forward  come on you fellows he shouted bringing it down suddenly upon the hand of the robber these things arent loaded theres only one of these blackguards with a revolver  illustration come on you fellows he shouted  and ive got him hunterleys who had been watching lane closely cried suddenly swinging his arm around the mans neck and knocking his revolver up  there was a yell of pain from the man with the jewels whose wrist lane had broken a howl of dismay from the otherspandemonium  at em freddy lane shouted seizing the nearest of his assailants by the neck and throwing him out into the darkness to hell with you he added just escaping a murderous blow and driving his fist into the face of the man who had aimed it good for you hunterleys there isnt one of those old guns of theirs thatll go off they arent even loaded  the barn seemed suddenly to become half empty into the darkness the little band of brigands crept away like rats in less than half a minute they had all fled excepting the one who lay on the ground unconscious from the effects of richards blow and the leader of the gang whom hunterleys still held by the throat richard with a claspknife which he had drawn from his pocket cut the cord which they had tied around mr grexs wrists his action however was altogether mechanical he scarcely glanced at what he was doing somehow or other he found the girls hands in his  that brutedidnt touch you did he he asked  she looked at him whether the clouds were still outside or not lane felt that he had passed into heaven  he did not thanks to you she murmured but do you mean really that those guns all the time werent loaded  i dont believe they were richard declared stoutly that chap kept on playing about with the lock of his old musket and i felt sure that it was of no use loaded or not anyway when i saw that brute try to handle youwell  he stopped with an awkward little laugh mr grex tapped a cigarette upon his case and lit it  i am sure my young friend we are all very much indebted to you the methods which sometimes are scarcely politic in the ordinary affairs of life he continued drily are admirable enough in a case like this we will just help hunterleys tie up the leader of the gang a very plucky stroke that of his  he crossed the barn one of the women had fainted others were busy collecting their jewelry the chauffeurs had hurried off to relight the lamps of the cars  i must tell you this richard said drawing a a little nearer to the girl please dont be angry with me i went to your father this afternoon i made an idiot of myselfi couldnt help it i was staring at you and he noticed it i didnt want him to think that i was such an illmannered brute as i seemed i tried to make him understand but he wouldnt listen to me id like to tell you nownow that i have the opportunitythat i think youre just  she smiled very faintly  what is it that you wish to tell me she asked patiently  that i love you he wound up abruptly  there was a moments silence a silence with a background of strange noises people were talking almost shouting to one another with excitement newcomers were being told the news the man whom hunterleys had captured was shrieking and cursing from beyond came the tooting of motorhorns as the cars returned lane heard nothing he saw nothing but the white face of the girl as she stood in the shadows of the barn with its walls of roughly threaded pine trunks  but i have scarcely ever spoken to you in my life she protested looking at him in astonishment  it doesnt make any difference he replied you know i am speaking the truth i think in your heart that you too know that these things dont matter now and then of course you dontyou couldnt feel anything of what i feel but with me its there now and for always and i want to have a chance just a chance to make you understand im not really mad im justin love with you  she smiled at him still in a friendly manner but her face had clouded there was a look in her eyes almost of trouble perhaps of regret  i am so sorry she murmured it is only a sudden feeling on your part isnt it you have been so splendid tonight that i can do no more than thank you very very much and as for what you have told me i think it is an honour but i wish you to forget it it is not wise for you to think of me in that way i fear that i cannot even offer you my friendship  again there was a brief silence the clamour of exclamations from the little groups of people still filled the air outside they could hear cars coming and going the man whom hunterleys and mr grex were tying up was still groaning and cursing  are you married richard asked abruptly  she shook her head  engaged  no  do you care very much for any one else  no she told him softly  he drew her away  come outside for one moment he begged i hate to see you in the place where that beast tried to lay hands upon you here is your necklace  he picked it up from her feet and she followed him obediently outside people were standing about shadowy figures in little groups some of the cars had already left others were being prepared for a start below once more the clouds had parted and the lights twinkled like fireflies through the trees this time they could even see the lights from the village of la turbie less brilliant but almost at their feet richard glanced upwards there was a star clearly visible  the clouds are lifting he said listen if there is no one else tell me why there shouldnt be the slightest chance for me i am not clever i am nobody of any account but i care for you so wonderfully i love you i always shall love you more than any one else could i never understood before but i understand now just this caring means so much  she stood close to his side her manner at the same time seemed to depress him and yet to fill him with hope  what is your name she enquired  richard lane he told her i am an american  then mr richard lane she continued softly i shall always think of you and think of tonight and think of what you have said and perhaps i shall be a little sorry that what you have asked me cannot be  cannot he muttered  she shook her head almost sadly  some day she went on as soon as our stay in monte carlo is finished if you like i will write and tell you the real reason in case you do not find it out before  he was silent looking downwards to where the gathering wind was driving the clouds before it to where the lights grew clearer and clearer at every moment  does it matter he asked abruptly that i am richvery rich  it does not matter at all she answered  doesnt it matter he demanded turning suddenly upon her and speaking with a new passion almost a passion of resentment doesnt it matter that without you life doesnt exist for me any longer doesnt it matter that a man has given you his whole heart however slight a thing it may seem to you what am i to do if you send me away there isnt anything left in life  there is what you have always found in it she reminded him  there isnt he replied fiercely thats just what there isnt i should go back to a world that was like a dead city  he suddenly felt her hand upon his  dear mr lane she begged wait for a little time before you nurse these sad thoughts and when you know how impossible what you ask is it will seem easier but if you really care to hear something if it would really please you sometimes to think of it when you are alone and you remember this little foolishness of yours let me tell you if i may that i am sorryi am very sorry  his hand was suddenly pressed and then before he could stop her she had glided away he moved a step to follow her and almost at once he was surrounded lady hunterleys patted him on the shoulder  really she exclaimed you and henry were our salvation i havent felt so thrilled for ages i only wish she added dropping her voice a little that it might bring you the luck you deserve  he answered vaguely she turned back to hunterleys she was busy tearing up her handkerchief  i am going to tie up your head she said please stoop down  he obeyed at once the side of his forehead was bleeding where a bullet from the revolver of the man he had captured had grazed his temple  too bad to trouble you he muttered  its the least we can do she declared laughing nervously forgive me if my fingers tremble it is the excitement of the last few minutes  hunterleys stood quite still words seemed difficult to him just then  you were very brave henry she said quietly whomwhom are you going down with  i am with richard lane he answered in his twoseated racer  she bit her lip  i did not mean to come alone with mr draconmeyer really she explained he thought up to the last moment that his wife would be well enough to come  did he really believe so do you think hunterleys asked  a voice intervened mr draconmeyer was standing by their side  well he said we might as well resume our journey we all look and feel i think as though we had been taking part in a scene from some op√©ra bouffe  lady hunterleys shivered she had drawn a little closer to her husband her coat was unfastened hunterleys leaned towards her and buttoned it with strong fingers up to her throat  thank you she whispered you wouldntyou couldnt drive down with us could you  have you plenty of room he enquired  plenty she declared eagerly mr draconmeyer and i are alone  for a moment hunterleys hesitated then he caught the smile upon the face of the man he detested  thank you he said i dont think i can desert lane  she stiffened at once her good night was almost formal hunterleys stepped into the car which richard had brought up there was just a slight mist around them but the whole country below though chaotic was visible and the lights on the hillside from la turbie down to the seaboard were in plain sight  our troubles hunterleys remarked as they glided off seem to be over  maybe lane replied grimly mine seem to be only just beginning     chapter x  signs of trouble   at ten oclock the next morning hunterleys crossed the sunlit gardens towards the english bank to receive what was perhaps the greatest shock of his life a few minutes later he stood before the mahogany counter his eyes fixed upon the half sheet of notepaper which the manager had laid before him the words were few enough and simple enough yet they constituted for him a message written in the very ink of tragedy the notepaper was the notepaper of the hotel de paris the date the night before the words few and unmistakable       to the manager of the english bank please hand my letters to      bearer       henry hunterleys  he read it over letter by letter word by word then at last he looked up his voice sounded even to himself unnatural  you were quite right he said this order is a forgery  the manager was greatly disturbed he threw open the door of his private office  come and sit down for a moment will you sir henry he invited this is a very serious matter and i should like to discuss it with you  they passed behind into the comfortable little sittingroom smelling of morocco leather and roses with its single high window its broad writingtable its carefully placed easychairs men had pleaded in here with all the eloquence at their command men of every rank and walk in life thieves nobles ruined men and pseudomillionaires always with the same crymoney money for the great pleasuremill which day and night drew in its own hunterleys sank heavily into a chair the manager seated himself in an official attitude before his desk  i am sorry to have distressed you with this letter sir henry he said however you must admit that things might have been worse it is fortunately our invariable custom when letters are addressed to one of our clients in our care to deliver them to no one else under any circumstances if you had been ill for instance i should have brought you your correspondence across to the hotel but i should not have delivered it to your own secretary that as i say is our invariable rule and we find that it has saved many of our clients from inconvenience in your case the manager concluded impressively your communications being in a sense official any such attempt as has been made would not stand the slightest chance of success we should be even more particular than in any ordinary case to see that by no possible chance could any correspondence addressed to you fall into other hands  hunterleys began to recover himself a little he drew towards himself the heap of letters which the manager had laid by his side  please make yourself quite comfortable here the latter begged read your letters and answer them if you like before you go out i always call this he added with a smile the one inviolable sanctuary of monte carlo  you are very kind hunterleys replied are you sure that i am not detaining you  not in the least personally i am not at all busy threequarters of our business you see is merely a matter of routine i was just going to shut myself up here and read the times have a cigarette heres an envelope opener and a wastepaper basket make yourself comfortable  hunterleys glanced through his correspondence rapidly reading and destroying the greater portion of it he came at last to two parchment envelopes marked on his majestys service these he opened and read their contents slowly and with great care when he had finished he produced a pair of scissors from his waistcoat pocket and cut the letters into minute fragments he drew a little sigh of relief when at last their final destruction was assured and rose shortly afterwards to his feet  i shall have to go on to the telegraph office he said to send these few messages thank you very much mr harrison for your kindness if you do not mind i should like to take this forged order away with me  the manager hesitated  i am not sure that i ought to part with it he observed doubtfully  could you recognise the person who presented ityou or your clerk  the manager shook his head  not a chance he replied it was brought in unfortunately before i arrived young parsons who was the only one in the bank explained that letters were never delivered to an order and turned away to attend to some one else who was in a hurry he simply remembers that it was a man and that is all  then the document is useless to you hunterleys pointed out you could never do anything in the matter without evidence of identification and that being so if you dont mind i should like to have it  mr harrison yielded it up  as you wish he agreed it is interesting if only as a curiosity the imitation of your signature is almost perfect  hunterleys took up his hat then for a moment with his hand upon the door he hesitated  mr harrison he said i am engaged just now as you have doubtless surmised in certain investigations on behalf of the usual third party whom we need not name those investigations have reached a pitch which might possibly lead me into a position of somewell i might almost say danger you and i both know that there are weapons in this place which can be made use of by persons wholly without scruples which are scarcely available at home i want you to keep your eyes open i have very few friends here whom i can wholly trust it is my purpose to call in here every morning at ten oclock for my letters and if i fail to arrive within halfanhour of that time without having given you verbal notice something will have happened to me you understand what i mean  you mean that you are threatened with assassination the manager asked gravely  practically it amounts to that hunterleys admitted i received a warning letter this morning there is a very important matter on foot here mr harrison a matter so important that to bring it to a successful conclusion i fancy that those who are engaged in it would not hesitate to face any risk i have wired to england for help if anything happens that it comes too late i want you when you find that i have disappeared even if my disappearance is only a temporary matter to let them know in londonyou know howat once  the manager nodded  i will do so he promised i trust however he went on that you are exaggerating the danger mr billson lived here for many years without any trouble  hunterleys smiled slightly  i am not a secret service man he explained billsons successor lives here now of course and is working with me under the usual guise of newspaper correspondent i dont think that he will come to any harm but i am here in a somewhat different position and my negotiations in the east during the last few weeks have made me exceedingly unpopular with some very powerful people however it is only an outside chance of course that i wish to guard against i rely upon you if i should fail to come to the bank any one morning without giving you notice to do as i have asked  hunterleys left the bank and walked out once more into the sunlight he first of all made his way down to the post office where he rapidly dispatched several cablegrams which he had coded and written out in mr harrisons private office afterwards he went on to the terrace and finding a retired seat at the further end sat down then he drew the forged order once more from his pocket word by word line by line he studied it and the more he studied it the more hopeless the whole thing seemed the handwriting with the exception of the signature which was a wonderful imitation of his own was the handwriting of his wife she had done this thing at draconmeyers instigation done this thing against her husband taken sides absolutely with the man whom he had come to look upon as his enemy what inference was he to draw he sat there looking out over the mediterranean soft and blue glittering with sunlight breaking upon the yellow stretch of sand in little foamflecked waves no higher than his hand he watched the sunlight glitter on the white houses which fringed the bay he looked idly up at the trim little vineyards on the brown hillside it was the beauty spot of the world there was no object upon which his eyes could rest which was not beautiful the whole place was like a feast of colour and form and sunshine yet for him the light seemed suddenly to have faded from life danger had only stimulated him had helped him to cope with the dull pain which he had carried about with him during the last few months he was face to face now with something else it was worse this than anything he had dreamed somehow or other notwithstanding the growing estrangement with his wife which had ended in their virtual separation he had still believed in her still had faith in her still had hope of an ultimate reconciliation and behind it all he had loved her it seemed at that moment that a nightmare was being formed around him a new horror was creeping into his thoughts he had felt from the first a bitter dislike of draconmeyer now however he realised that this feeling had developed into an actual and harrowing jealousy he realised that the man was no passive agent it was draconmeyer who with subtle purpose was drawing his wife away hunterleys sprang to his feet and walked angrily backwards and forwards along the few yards of terrace which happened at that moment to be almost deserted vague plans of instant revenge upon draconmeyer floated into his mind it was simple enough to take the law into his own hands to thrash him publicly to make monte carlo impossible for him and then suddenly he remembered his duty they were trusting him in downing street chance had put into his hands so many threads of this diabolical plot it was for him to checkmate it he was the only person who could checkmate it this was no time for him to think of personal revenge no time for him to brood over his own broken life there was work still to be donehis countrys work  he felt the need of change of scene the sight of the place with its placid enervating beauty its constant appeal to the senses was beginning to have a curious effect upon his nerves he turned back upon the terrace and by means of the least frequented streets he passed through the town and up towards the hills he walked steadily reckless of time or direction he had lunch at a small inn high above the road from cannes and it was past three oclock when he turned homewards he had found his way into the main road now and he trudged along heedless of the dust with which the constant procession of automobiles covered him all the while the exercise had done him good he was able to keep his thoughts focussed upon his mission so far at any rate he had held his own his dispatches to london had been clear and vivid he had told them exactly what he had feared he had shown them the inside of this scheme as instinct had revealed it to him and he had begged for aid one man alone surrounded by enemies and in a country where all things were possible was in a parlous position if once the extent of his knowledge were surmised so far the plot had not yet matured so far though the clouds had gathered and the thunder was muttering the storm had not broken the reason for that he knewthe one person needed the one person for whose coming all these plans had been made had not yet arrived there was no telling however how long the respite might last at any moment might commence this conference whose avowed purpose was to break at a single blow a single treacherous but deadly blow the empire whose downfall selingman had once publicly declared was the one great necessity involved by his countrys expansion  hunterleys quenched his thirst at a roadside caf√© sitting out upon the pavement and drinking coarse red wine and sodawater then he bought a packet of black cigarettes and continued his journey he was within sight of monte carlo when for the twentieth time he had to step to the far side of the pathway to avoid being smothered in dust by an advancing automobile this time by some chance he glanced around attracted by the piercing character of its longdistance whistle a highpowered grey touring car came by travelling at a great pace hunterleys stood perfectly rigid one hand grasping the wall by the side of which he stood notwithstanding his spectacles and the thick coating of dust upon his clothes the solitary passenger of the car was familiar enough to him it was the man for whom this plot had been prepared it was paul douaille the great foreign minister into whose hands even the most cautious of premiers had declared himself willing to place the destinies of his country  hunterleys pursued the road no longer he took a ticket at the next station and hurried back to monte carlo he went first to his room bathed and changed and passing along the private passage made his way into the sporting club the first person whom he saw seated in her accustomed place at her favourite table was his wife she beckoned him to come over to her there was a vacant chair by her side to which she pointed  thank you he said i wont sit down i dont think that i care to play just now you are fortunate this afternoon i trust  something in his face and tone checked that rush of altered feeling of which she had been more than once passionately conscious since the night before  i am hideously out of luck she confessed slowly i have been losing all day i think that i shall give it up  she rose wearily to her feet and he felt a sudden compassion for her she was certainly looking tired her eyes were weary she had the air of an unhappy woman after all perhaps she too sometimes knew what loneliness was  i should like some tea so much she added a little piteously  he opened his lips to invite her to pass through into the restaurant with him then the memory of that forged order still in his pocket flashed into his mind he hesitated a cold familiar voice at his elbow intervened  are you quite ready for tea lady hunterleys i have been in and taken a table near the window  hunterleys moved at once on one side draconmeyer bowed pleasantly  cheerful time we had last night hadnt we he remarked glad to see your knock didnt lay you up  hunterleys disregarded his wifes glance he was suddenly furious  all monte carlo seems to be gossiping about that little contretemps draconmeyer continued it was a crude sort of holdup for a neighbourhood of criminals but it very nearly came off will you have some tea with us  do henry his wife begged  once again he hesitated somehow or other he felt that the moment was critical then a hand was laid quietly upon his arm a mans voice whispered in his ear  monsieur will be so kind as to step this way for a momenta little matter of business  who are you hunterleys demanded  the commissioner of police at monsieurs service     chapter xi  hints to hunterleys   hunterleys in accordance with his request followed the commissioner downstairs into one of the small private rooms on the ground floor the latter was very polite but very official  now what is it that you want hunterleys asked a little brusquely as soon as they were alone  the representative of the law was distinctly mysterious he had a brown moustache which he continually twirled and he was all the time dropping his voice to a whisper  my first introduction to you should explain my mission sir henry he said i hold a high position in the police here my business with you however is on behalf of a person whom i will not name but whose identity you will doubtless guess  very well hunterleys replied now what is the nature of this mission please in plain words what do you want with me  i am here with reference to the affair of last night the other declared  the affair of last night hunterleys repeated frowning well we all have to appear or be represented before the magistrates tomorrow morning i shall send a lawyer  quite so quite so but in the meantime something has transpired you and the young american mr richard lane were the only two who offered any resistance it was owing to you two in fact that the plot was frustrated i am quite sure sir henry that every one agrees with me in appreciating your courage and presence of mind  thank you hunterleys replied is that what you came to say  the other shook his head  unfortunately no monsieur i am here to bring you certain information the chief of the gang armand martin the man whom you attacked became suddenly worse a few hours ago the doctors suspect internal injuries injuries inflicted during his struggle with you  i am very sorry to hear it hunterleys said coolly on the other hand he asked for anything he got  unfortunately the commissioner continued the law of the state is curiously framed in such matters if the man should die as seems more than likely your legal position sir henry would be most uncomfortable your arrest would be a necessity and there is no law granting what i believe you call bail to a person directly or indirectly responsible for the death of another i am here therefore to give you what i may term an official warning your absence as a witness tomorrow morning will not be commented uponevents of importance have called you back to england you will thereby be saved a very large amount of annoyance and the authorities here will be spared the most regrettable necessity of having to deal with you in a manner unbefitting your rank  hunterleys became at once thoughtful the whole matter was becoming clear to him  i see he observed this is a warning to me to take my departure is that so  the commissioner beamed and nodded many times  you have a quick understanding sir henry he declared your departure tonight or early tomorrow morning would save a good deal of unpleasantness i have fulfilled my mission and i trust that you will reflect seriously upon the matter it is the wish of the high personage whom i represent that no inconvenience whatever should befall so distinguished a visitor to the principality good day monsieur  the official took his leave with a sweep of the hat and many bows hunterleys after a brief hesitation walked out into the sundappled street it was the most fashionable hour of the afternoon up in the square a band was playing outside two or three smart automobiles were discharging their freight of wonderfullydressed women and debonair men from the villas outside suddenly a hand fell upon his arm it was richard lane who greeted him  say where are you off to sir henry he inquired  hunterleys laughed a little shortly  really i scarcely know he replied back to london if i am wise i suppose  come into the club richard begged  i have just left hunterleys told him besides i hate the place  did you happen to notice whether mr grex was in there richard enquired  i didnt see him hunterleys answered neither he added significantly did i see miss grex  well i am going in to have a look round anyway richard decided you might come along theres nothing else to do in this place until dinnertime  hunterleys suffered himself to be persuaded and remounted the steps  tell me lane he asked curiously have you heard anything about any of the victims of our little struggle last nighti mean the two men we tackled  richard shook his head  i hear that mine has a broken wrist he said cant say i am feeling very badly about that  ive just been told that mine is going to die hunterleys continued  the young man laughed incredulously  why i went over the prison this morning he declared i never saw such a healthy lot of ruffians in my life that chap whom you tackledthe one with the revolverwas smoking cigarettes and using languagewell i couldnt understand it all but what i did understand was enough to melt the bars of his prison  thats odd hunterleys remarked drily according to the police commissioner who has just left me the man is on his deathbed and my only chance of escaping serious trouble is to get out of monte carlo tonight  are you going  hunterleys shook his head  it would take a great deal more than that to move me just now he said even if i had not suspected from the first that the man was lying  richard glanced at his companion a little curiously  i shouldnt have said that you were having such a good time sir henry he observed in fact i should have thought you would have been rather glad of an opportunity to slip away  hunterleys looked around them they had reached the top of the staircase and were in sight of the dense crowd in the rooms  come and have a drink he suggested a great many of these people will have cleared off presently  ill have a drink with pleasure richard answered but i still cant see why youre stuck on this place  they strolled into the bar and found two vacant places  my dear young friend hunterleys said as he ordered their drinks if you were an englishman instead of an american i think that i would give you a hint as to the reason why i do not wish to leave monte carlo just at present  cant see what difference that makes richard declared you know im all for the old country  i wonder whether you are hunterleys remarked thoughtfully i tell you frankly that if i thought you meant it i should probably come to you before long for a little help  if ever you do im your man richard assured him heartily any more scraps going  hunterleys sipped his whisky and soda thoughtfully there had been an exodus from the room to watch some heavy gambling at trente et quarante and for a moment they were almost alone  lane he said i am going to take you a little into my confidence in a way i suppose it is foolish but to tell you the truth i am almost driven to it you know that i am a member of parliament and you may have heard that if our party hadnt gone out a few years ago i was to have been foreign minister  ive heard that often enough lane assented ive heard you quoted too as an example of the curse of party politics just because you are forced to call yourself a member of one party you are debarred from serving your country in any capacity until that party is in power  thats quite true hunterleys admitted and to tell you the truth ridiculous though it seems i dont see how youre to get away from it in a practical manner anyhow when my people came out i made up my mind that i wasnt going to just sit still in opposition and find fault all the time especially as weve a real good man at the foreign office i was quite content to leave things in his hands but then you see politically that meant that there was nothing for me to do i thought matters over and eventually i paired for six months and was supposed to go off for the benefit of my health as a matter of fact i have been in the balkan states since christmas he added dropping his voice a little  what the dickens have you been doing there  i cant tell you that exactly hunterleys replied unfortunately my enemies are suspicious and they have taken to watching me closely they pretty well know what i am going to tell youthat i have been out there at the urgent request of the secret service department of the present government i have been in greece and servia and roumania and although i dont think theres a soul in the world knows i have also been in st petersburg  but whats it all about richard persisted what have you been doing in all these places  i can only answer you broadly hunterleys went on there is a perfectly devilish scheme afloat directed against the old country i have been doing what i can to counteract it at the last moment just as i was leaving sofia for london by the merest chance i discovered that the scene for the culmination of this little plot was to be monte carlo so i made my way round by trieste stayed at bordighera and san remo for a few days to put people off and finally turned up here  well im jiggered lane muttered and i thought you were just hanging about for your health or because your wife was here and were bored to death for want of something to do  on the contrary hunterleys assured him i was up all night sending reports homevery interesting reports too i got them away all right but theres no denying the fact that there are certain people in monte carlo at the present moment who suspect my presence here and who would go to any lengths whatever to get rid of me it isnt the actual harm i might do but they have to deal with a very delicate problem and to make a bargain with a very sensitive person and they are terribly afraid that my presence here and a meeting between me and that person might render all their schemes abortive  richards face was a study in astonishment  well he exclaimed this beats everything ive read of such things of course but one only half believes them right under our very noses too say what are you going to do about it sir henry  there is only one thing i can do hunterleys replied grimly i am bound to keep my place here theyll drive me out if they can i am convinced that the polite warning i have received to leave monaco this afternoon because of last nights affair is part of the conspiracy in plain words ive got to stick it out  but what good are you doing here anyway  hunterleys smiled and glanced carefully around the room they were still free from any risk of being overheard  well he said perhaps you will understand my meaning more clearly if i tell you that i am the brains of a counterplot the english secret service has a permanent agent here under the guise of a newspaper correspondent who is in daily touch with me and he in his turn has several spies at work i am however the dangerous person the others are only servants they make their reports but they dont understand their true significance if these people could remove me before any one else could arrive to take my place their chances of bringing off their coup here would be immensely improved  i suppose its useless for me to ask if theres anything i can do to help richard enquired  youve helped already hunterleys replied i have been nearly three months without being able to open my lips to a soul people call me secretive but i feel very human sometimes i know that not a word of what i have said will pass your lips  not a chance of it richard promised earnestly but look here cant i do something if i am not an englishman im all for the anglosaxons i hate these foreignersthat is to say the men he corrected himself hastily  hunterleys smiled  well i was coming to that he said i do feel hideously alone here and what i would like you to do is just this i would like you to call at my room at the hotel de paris number 189 every morning at a certain fixed hoursay halfpast ten just shake hands with methats all nothing shall prevent my being visible to you at that hour under no consideration whatever will i leave any message that i am engaged or have gone out if i am not to be seen when you make your call something has happened to me  and what am i to do then  that is the point hunterleys continued i dont want to bring you too deeply into this matter all that you need do is to make your way to the english bank see mr harrison the manager and tell him of your fruitless visit to me he will give you a letter to my wife and will know what other steps to take  is that all richard asked a little disappointed you dont anticipate any scrapping or anything of that sort  i dont know what to anticipate hunterleys confessed a little wearily things are moving fast now towards the climax i promise ill come to you for help if i need it you can but refuse  no fear of my refusing richard declared heartily not on your life sir  hunterleys rose to his feet with an appreciative little nod it was astonishing how cordially he had come to feel towards this young man during the last few hours  ill let you off now he said i know you want to look around the tables and see if any of our friends of last night are to be found i too have a little affair which i ought to have treated differently a few minutes ago well meet later  hunterleys strolled back into the rooms he came almost at once face to face with draconmeyer whom he was passing with unseeing eyes draconmeyer however detained him  i was looking for you sir henry he exclaimed can you spare me one moment  they stood a little on one side out of the way of the moving throng of people draconmeyer was fingering nervously his tie of somewhat vivid purple his manner was important  do you happen sir henry he asked to have had any word from the prison authorities today  hunterleys nodded  i have just received a message he replied i understand that the man with whom i had a struggle last night has received some internal injuries and is likely to die  draconmeyers manner became more mysterious he glanced around the room as though to be sure that they were not overheard  i trust sir henry he said that you will not think me in any way presumptuous if i speak to you intimately i have never had the privilege of your friendship and in this unfortunate disagreement between your wife and yourself i have been compelled to accept your wifes point of view owing to the friendship between mrs draconmeyer and herself i trust you will believe however that i have no feelings of hostility towards you  you are very kind hunterleys murmured  his face seemed set in graven lines for all the effect the others words had upon him he might have been wearing a mask  the law here in some respects is very curious draconmeyer continued some of the statutes have been unaltered for a thousand years i have been given to understand by a person who knows that if this man should die notwithstanding the circumstances of the case you might find yourself in an exceedingly awkward position if i might venture therefore to give you a word of disinterested advice i would suggest that you return to england at once if only for a week or so  his eyes had narrowed through his spectacles he was watching intently for the effect of his words hunterleys however only nodded thoughtfully as though to some extent impressed by the advice he had received  very likely you are right he admitted i will discuss the matter with my wife  she is playing over there draconmeyer pointed out and while we are talking in a more or less friendly fashion he went on earnestly might i give you just one more word of counsel for the sake of the friendship which exists between our wives i feel sure you will believe that i am disinterested  he paused hunterleys expression was now one of polite interest he waited however for the other to continue  i wish that you could persuade lady hunterleys to play for somewhat lower stakes  hunterleys was genuinely startled for a moment  do you mean that my wife is gambling beyond her means he asked  draconmeyer shrugged his shoulders  how can i tell that i dont know what her means are or yours i only know that she changes mille notes more often than i change louis and it seems to me that her luck is invariably bad i think perhaps just a word or two from you who have the right to speak might be of service  i am very much obliged to you for the hint hunterleys said smoothly i will certainly mention the matter to her  and if i dont see you again draconmeyer concluded watching him closely goodbye  hunterleys did not appear to notice the tentative movement of the others hand he was already on his way to the spot where his wife was sitting draconmeyer watched his progress with inscrutable face selingman who had been sitting near rose and joined him  will he go he whispered will our friend take this very reasonable hint and depart  draconmeyers eyes were still fixed upon hunterleys slim selfpossessed figure his forehead was contorted into a frown somehow or other he felt that during their brief interview he had failed to score he had felt a subtle underlying note of contempt in hunterleys manner in his whole attitude  i do not know he replied grimly i only hope that if he stays we shall find the means to make him regret it     chapter xii  i cannot go   hunterleys stood for several minutes watching his wifes play from a new point of view she was certainly playing high and with continued illfortune for the first time too he noticed symptoms which disturbed him she sat quite motionless but there was an unfamiliar glitter in her eyes and a hardness about her mouth it was not until he had stood within a few feet of her for nearly a quarter of an hour that she chanced to see him  did you want me she asked with a little start  there is no hurry he replied if you could spare me a few moments later i should be glad  she rose at once thrusting her notes and gold into the satchel which she was carrying and stood by his side she was very elegantly dressed in black and white but she was pale and watching her with a new intentness he discovered faint violet lines under her eyes as though she had been sleeping ill  i am rather glad you came she said i was having an abominable run of bad luck and yet i hated to give up my seat without an excuse what did you want henry  i should like he explained to talk to you for a quarter of an hour this place is rather crowded and it is getting on my nerves we seem to live here night and day would you object to driving with mesay as far as mentone and back  i will come if you wish it she answered looking a little surprised wait while i get my cloak  hunterleys hired an automobile below and they drove off as soon as they were out of the main street he thrust his hand into the breastpocket of his coat and smoothed out that halfsheet of notepaper upon his knee  violet he said please read that  she read the few lines instructing the english bank to hand over sir henry hunterleys letters to the bearer then she looked up at him with a puzzled frown  i dont understand  did you write that he enquired  she looked at him indignantly  what an absurd question she exclaimed your correspondence has no interest for me  her denial so natural so obviously truthful was a surprise to him he felt a sudden impulse of joy mingled with shame perhaps after all he had been altogether too censorious once more he directed her attention to the sheet of paper there was a marked change in his voice and manner  violet he begged please look at it accepting without hesitation your word that you did not write it doesnt it occur to you that the body of the letter is a distinct imitation of your handwriting and the signature a very clever forgery of mine  it is rather like my handwriting she admitted and as for the signature do you mean to say really that that is not yours  certainly not he assured her the whole thing is a forgery  but who in the world should want to get your letters she asked incredulously and why should you have them addressed to the bank  he folded up the paper then and put it in his pocket  violet he said earnestly for the disagreements which have resulted in our separation i may myself have been to some extent responsible but we have promised one another not to refer to them again and i will not break our compact all i can say is that there is much in my life which you know little of and for which you do not therefore make sufficient allowance  then you might have treated me she declared with more confidence  it was not possible he reminded her so long as you chose to make an intimate friend of a man whose every interest in life is in direct antagonism to mine  mr draconmeyer  mr draconmeyer he assented  she smiled contemptuously  you misunderstand mr draconmeyer completely she insisted he is your wellwisher and he is more than half an englishman it was he who started the league between english and german commercial men for the propagation of peace he formed one of the deputation who went over to see the emperor he has done more both by his speeches and letters to the newspaper to promote a good understanding between germany and england than any other person you are very much mistaken about mr draconmeyer henry why you cannot realise that he is simply an ordinary commercial man of high intelligence and most agreeable manners i cannot imagine  the fact remains my dear violet hunterleys said emphatically that it is not possible for me to treat you with the confidence i might otherwise have done on account of your friendship with mr draconmeyer  you are incorrigible she exclaimed can we change the subject please i want to know why you showed me that forged letter  i am coming to that he told her please be patient i want to remind you of something else so far as i remember my only request when i gave you your liberty and half my income was that your friendship with the draconmeyers should decrease almost the first persons i see on my arrival in monte carlo are you and mr draconmeyer i learn that you came out with them and that you are staying at the same hotel  your wish was an unreasonable one she protested linda and i were schoolgirls together she is my dearest friend and she is a hopeless invalid i think that if i were to desert her she would die  i have every sympathy with mrs draconmeyer he said slowly but you are my wife i am going to make one more effortplease dont be uneasynot to reestablish any relationship between us but to open your eyes as to the truth concerning mr draconmeyer you asked me a moment ago why i had shown you that forged letter i will tell you now it was draconmeyer who was the forger  she leaned back in her seat she was looking at him incredulously  you mean to say that mr draconmeyer wrote that orderthat he wanted to get possession of your letters  not only that hunterleys continued but he carried out the business in such a devilish manner as to make me for a moment believe that it was you who had helped him you are wrong about draconmeyer the man is a great schemer who under the pretence of occupying an important commercial position in the city of london is all the time a secret agent of germany he is there in her interests he studies the public opinion of the country he dissects our weaknesses he is there to point out the best methods and the opportune time for the inevitable struggle he is the worst enemy today england has you think that he is here in monte carlo on a visit of pleasurefor the sake of his wife perhaps nothing of the sort he is here at this moment associated with an iniquitous scheme the particulars of which i can tell you nothing of furthermore i repeat what i told you on our first meeting herethat in his still cold way he is in love with you  henry she cried  i cannot see how you can remain so wilfully blind hunterleys continued i know the man inside out i warned you against him in london i warn you against him now this forged letter was designed to draw us further apart the little brown man who has dogged your footsteps is a spy employed by him to make you believe that i was having you watched you are free still to act as you will violet but if you have a spark of regard for me or yourself you will go back to london at once and drop this odious friendship  she leaned back in the car they had turned round now and were on the way back to monte carlo by the higher road she sat with her eyes fixed upon the mountains her heart in a way had been touched her imagination stirred by her husbands words she felt a return of that glow of admiration which had thrilled her on the previous night when he and richard lane alone amongst that motley company had played the part of men a curious almost pathetic wistfulness crept into her heart if only he would lean towards her at that moment if she could see once more the light in his eyes that had shone there during the days of their courtship if only he could remember that it was still his part to play the lover if he could be a little less grave a little less hopelessly correct and fair despite her efforts to disbelieve there was something convincing about his words at any moment during that brief space of time a single tremulous word even a warm clasp of the hand would have brought her into his arms but so much of inspiration was denied him he sat waiting for her decision with an eagerness of which he gave no sign nevertheless the fates were fighting for him she thought gratefully even at that moment yet with less enthusiasm than ever before of the devout homage the delightful care for her happiness and comfort the atmosphere of security with which draconmeyer seemed always to surround her yet all this was cold and unsatisfying a poor substitute for the other things henry had been different once perhaps it was jealousy which had altered him perhaps his misconception of draconmeyers character had affected his whole outlook she turned towards him and her voice when she spoke was no longer querulous  henry she said i cannot admit the truth of all that you say concerning mr draconmeyer but tell me this if i were willing to leave this place tonight  she paused for some reason a sudden embarrassment had seized her the words seemed to come with difficulty she turned ever so slightly away from him there was a tinge of colour at last in her pale cheeks she seemed to him now as she leaned a little forward in her seat completely beautiful  if i make my excuses and leave monte carlo tonight she went on will you come with me  he gave a little start something in his eyes flashed an answer into her face and then the flood of memory came there was his mission he was tied hand and foot  it is good of you to offer that violet he declared if i couldif only i could  already her manner began to change the fear of his refusal was hateful her lips were trembling  you mean she faltered that you will not come listen dont misunderstand me i will order my boxes packed i will catch the eight oclock train either through to london or to parisanywhere i will do that if you will come there is my offer that is my reply to all that you have said about mr draconmeyer i shall lose a friend who has been gentleness and kindness and consideration itself i will risk that what do you say will you come  violet i cannot he replied hoarsely no dont turn away like that he begged dont change so quickly please it isnt fair listen i am not my own master  not your own master she repeated incredulously what do you mean  i mean that i am here in monte carlo not for my own pleasure i mean that i have work a purpose  absurd she interrupted him almost harshly there is nobody who has any better claim upon you than i have you are overconscientious about other things for once remember your duty as a husband  he caught her wrist  you must trust me a little he pleaded believe me that i really appreciate your offer if i were free to go i should not hesitate for a single second cant you trust me violet he implored his voice softening  the woman within her was fighting on his side she stifled her wounded feelings crushed down her disappointment that he had not taken her at once into his arms and answered her upon her lips  trust me then she replied if you refuse my offer dont hint at things you have to do tell me in plain words why it is not enough for you to say that you cannot leave monte carlo tell me why you cannot i have invited you to escort me anywhere you willi your wife shall we go  the woman had wholly triumphed her voice had dropped the light was in her eyes she swayed a little towards him his brain reeled she was once more the only woman in the world for him once more he fancied that he could feel the clinging of her arms the touch of her lips these things were promised in her face  i tell you that i cannot go he cried sharply believe medo believe me violet  she pulled down her veil suddenly he caught at her hand it lay passively in his he pleaded for her confidence but the moment of inspiration had gone she heard him with the air of one who listens no longer presently she stopped him  dont speak to me for several minutes please she begged tell him to put me down at the hotel i cant go back to the club just yet  you mustnt leave me like this he insisted  will you tell me why you refuse my offer she asked  i have a trust  the automobile had come to a standstill she rose to her feet  i was once your trust she reminded him as she passed into the hotel     chapter xiii  miss grex at home   richard lane as he made his way up the avenue towards the villa mimosa wondered whether he was not indeed finding his way into fairyland on either side of him were drooping mimosa trees heavy with the snaky orangecoloured blossom whose perfumes hung heavy upon the windless air in the background bordering the gardens which were themselves a maze of colour were great clumps of glorious purple rhododendrons drooping clusters of red and white roses a sudden turn revealed a long pergola smothered in pink blossoms and leading to the edge of the terrace which overhung the sea the villa itself which seemed indeed more like a palace was covered with vivid purple clematis and from the open door of the wintergarden which was built out from the front of the place in a great curve there came as he drew near a bewildering breath of exotic odours the frontdoor was wide open and before he could reach the bell a butler had appeared  is mr grex at home richard enquired  mr grex is not at home sir was the immediate reply  i should like to see miss grex then richard proceeded  the mans face was curiously expressionless but a momentary silence perhaps betrayed as much surprise as he was capable of showing  miss grex is not at home sir he announced  richard hesitated and just then she came out from the wintergarden she was wearing a pink linen morning gown and a floppy pink hat she had a book under her arm and a parasol swinging from her fingers when she saw lane she stared at him in amazement he advanced a step or two towards her his hat in his hand  i took the liberty of calling to see your father miss grex he explained as he was not at home i ventured to enquire for you  she was absolutely helpless it was impossible to ignore his outstretched hand very hesitatingly she held out her fingers which richard grasped and seemed in no hurry at all to release  this is quite the most beautiful place i have seen anywhere near monte carlo he remarked enthusiastically  i am glad she murmured that you find it attractive  he was standing by her side now his hat under his arm the butler had withdrawn a little into the background she glanced around  did my father ask you to call mr lane she enquired dropping her voice a little  he did not richard confessed i must say that i gave him plenty of opportunities but he did not seem to be what i should call hospitably inclined in any case it really doesnt matter i came to see you  she bit her lip struggling hard to repress a smile  but i did not ask you to call upon me either she reminded him gravely  well thats true lane admitted a little hesitatingly i dont quite know how things are done over here say are you english or french or what he asked point blank i have been puzzling about that ever since i saw you  i am not sure that my nationality matters she observed  well over on the other side he continuedi mean america of courseif we make up our minds that we want to see something of a girl and there isnt any real reason why one shouldnt then the initiative generally rests with the man of course if you are an only daughter i can quite understand your father being a bit particular not caring for men callers and that sort of thing but that cant go on for ever you know can it  cant it she murmured a little dazed  i have a habit he confided of making up my mind quickly and when i decide about a thing i am rather hard to turn well i made up my mind about you the first moment we met  about me she repeated  about you  she turned and looked at him almost wonderingly he was very big and very confident good to look upon less because of his actual good looks than because of a certain honesty and tenacity of purpose in his expression a strength of jaw modified and rendered even pleasant by the kindness and humour of his clear grey eyes he returned her gaze without embarrassment and he wondered less than ever at finding himself there her complexion in this clear light seemed more beautiful than ever her rich goldenbrown hair was waved becomingly over her forehead her eyebrows were silky and delicately straight her mouth delightful her figure was girlish but unusually dignified for her years  you know he said suddenly you look to me just like one of those beautiful plants you have in the conservatory there just as though youd stepped out of your little glass home and blossomed right here i am almost afraid of you  she laughed outright this timea low musical laugh which had in it something of foreign intonation  well really she exclaimed i had not noticed your fear i was just thinking that you were quite the boldest young man i have ever met  come thats something he declared couldnt we sit down somewhere in these wonderful gardens of yours and talk  she shook her head  but have i not told you already she protested that i do not receive callers neither does my father really your coming here is quite unwarrantable if he should return at this moment and find you here he would be very angry indeed i am afraid that he would even be rude and i too should suffer for having allowed you to talk with me  lets hope that he doesnt return just yet then richard observed smiling easily i am very goodtempered as a rule but i do not like people to be rude to me  fortunately he cannot return for at least an hour she began  then well sit down on that terrace if you please for just a quarter of that time he begged  she opened her lips and closed them again he was certainly a very stubborn young man  well she sighed perhaps it will be the easiest way of getting rid of you  she motioned him to follow her the butler from a discreet distance watched her as though he were looking at a strange thing round the corner of the villa remote from the wintergarden was a long stone terrace upon which many windows opened screened from the wind the sun here was of almost midsummer strength there was no sound the great house seemed asleep there was nothing but the droning of a few insects even the birds were songless the walls were covered with drooping clematis and roses roses that twined over the balustrades below them was a tangle of mimosa trees and rhododendrons and further below still the blue mediterranean she sank into a chair  you may sit here she said just long enough for me to convince you that your coming was a mistake indeed that is so i do not wish to seem foolish or unkind but my father and i are living here with one unbreakable rule and that is that we make no acquaintances whatsoever  that sounds rather queer he remarked dont you find it dull  if i do she went on it is only for a little time my father is here for a certain purpose and as soon as that is accomplished we shall go away for him to accomplish that purpose in a satisfactory manner it is necessary that we should live as far apart as possible from the ordinary visitors here  sounds like a riddle he admitted do you mind telling me of what nationality you are  i see no reason why i should tell you anything  you speak such correct english he continued but there is just a little touch of accent you dont know how attractive it sounds you dont know  he hesitated suddenly losing some part of his immense confidence  what else is there that i do not know she asked with a faintly amused smile  i have lost my courage he confessed simply i do not want to offend you i do not want you to think that i am hopelessly foolish but you see i have the misfortune to be in love with you  she laughed at him leaning back in her chair with halfclosed eyes  do people talk like this to casual acquaintances in your country she asked  they speak sometimes a language which is common to all countries he replied quickly the only thing that is peculiar to my people is that when we say it it is the sober and the solemn truth  she was silent for a moment she had plucked one of the blossoms from the wall and was pulling to pieces its purple petals  do you know she said that no young man has ever dared to talk to me as you have done  that is because no one yet has cared so much as i do he assured her i can quite understand their being frightened i am terribly afraid of you myself i am afraid of the things i say to you but i have to say them because they are in my heart and if i am only to have a quarter of an hour with you now you see i must make the best use of my time i must tell you that there isnt any other girl in the world i could ever look at again and if you wont promise to marry me some day i shall be the most wretched person on earth  i can never never marry you she told him emphatically there is nothing which is so impossible as that  well thats a pretty bad start he admitted  it is the end she said firmly  he shook his head there was a terrible obstinacy in his face she frowned at him  you do not mean that you will persist after what i have told you  he looked at her almost surprised  there isnt anything else for me to do that i know of he declared so long as you dont care for any one else tell me again you are sure that there is no one  certainly not she replied stiffly the subject has not yet been made acceptable to me you must forgive my adding that in my country it is not usual for a girl to discuss these matters with a man before her betrothal  say i dont understand that he murmured looking at her thoughtfully she cant get engaged before she is asked  the preliminaries she explained are always arranged by ones parents  he smiled pityingly  that sort of things no use he asserted confidently you must be getting past that in whatever corner of europe you live what you mean to say then is that your father has some one up his sleeve whom hell trot out for you before long  without doubt some arrangement will be proposed she agreed  and youll have to be amiable to some one youve never seen in your life before i suppose he persisted  not necessarily it sometimes happens in my position she went on raising her head that certain sacrifices are necessary  in your position he repeated quickly what does that mean you arent a queen are you or anything of that sort  she laughed  no she confessed i am not a queen and yet  and yet  you must go back she insisted rising abruptly to her feet the quarter of an hour is up i do not feel happy sitting here talking with you really if my father were to return he would be more angry with me than he has ever been in his life this sort of thing is not done amongst my people  little lady he said gently forcing her back into her place believe me its done all the world over and there isnt any girl can come to any harm by being told that a man is fond of her when its the truth when hed give his life for her willingly its just like that i feel about you ive never felt it before i could never feel it for any one else and i am not going to give you up  she was looking at him half fearfully there was a little colour in her cheeks her eyes were suddenly moist  i think she murmured that you talk very nicely i think i might even say that i like to hear you talk but it is so useless wont you go now wont you please go now  when may i come again he begged  never she replied firmly you must never come again you must not even think of it but indeed you would not be admitted they will probably tell my father of your visit as it is and he will be very angry  well when can i see you then and where he demanded i hope you understand that i am not in the least disheartened by anything you have said  i think she declared that you are the most persistent person i ever met  it is only he whispered leaning a little towards her because i care for you so much  she was suddenly confused conscious of a swift desire to get rid of him it was as though some one were speaking a new language all her old habits and prejudices seemed falling away  i cannot make appointments with you she protested her voice shaking i cannot encourage you in any way it is really quite impossible  if i go now will you be at the club tomorrow afternoon he pleaded  i am not sure she replied it is very likely that i may be there i make no promise  he took her hand abruptly and stooping down forced her to look into his eyes  you will be there tomorrow afternoon please he begged and you will give me the rose from your waistband  she laughed uneasily  if the rose will buy your departure she began  it may do that he interrupted as he drew it through his buttonhole but it will assuredly bring me back again                                       richard walked down the hill whistling softly to himself and with a curious light in his eyes as he reached the square in front of the casino he was accosted by a stranger who stood in the middle of the pavement and respectfully removed his hat  you are mr richard lane is it not so monsieur  youve guessed it in one richard admitted have i ever seen you before  never monsieur unless you happened to notice me on your visit to the prison i have an official position in the principality i am commissioned to speak to you with respect to the little affair in which you were concerned at la turbie  well i thought wed thrashed all that out lane replied anyway sir henry hunterleys and i have engaged a lawyer to look after our interests  just so the little man murmured a very clever man indeed is monsieur grisson still there is a view of the matter he continued which is perhaps hard for you englishmen and americans to understand assault of any description is very severely punished here especially when it results in bodily injury theft of all sorts on the other hand is very common indeed the man whom you injured is a native of monte carlo to a certain extent the principality is bound to protect him  why the fellow was engaged in a flagrant attempt at highway robbery richard declared genuinely astonished  his companion stretched out his hands  monsieur he replied every one robs here whether they are shopkeepers restaurant keepers or loafers upon the streets the people expect it at the adjourned trial next week there will be many witnesses who are also natives of monte carlo i have been commissioned to warn monsieur it would be best on the whole if he left monte carlo by the next train  why in the name of mischief should i do that richard demanded  in the first place the other pointed out because this man whom you treated a little roughly has many friends and associates they have sworn revenge you are even now being followed about and the police of the principality have enough to do without sparing an escort to protect you against violence in the second place i am not at all sure that the finding of the court next week will be altogether to your satisfaction  do you mean this richard asked incredulously  without a doubt monsieur  then all i can say richard declared is that your magistrate or judge or whatever he calls himself is a rotter and your laws absurd i shant budge  it is in your own interests monsieur this warning the other persisted even if you escape these desperadoes you still run some risk of discovering what the inside of a prison in monaco is like  i think not lane answered grimly if theres anything of that sort going about i shall board my yacht yonder and hoist the stars and stripes i shall take some getting into prison i can tell you and if i once get there youll hear about it  monsieur will be much wiser to avoid trouble the official advised  lane placed his hand upon the others shoulder  my friend he said not you or a dozen like you could make me stir from this place until i am ready and just now i am very far from ready see you can go and tell those who sent you what i say  the emissary of the law shrugged his shoulders his manner was stiff but resigned  i have delivered my message monsieur he announced monsieur naturally must decide for himself  he disappeared with a bow richard continued on his way and a few minutes later ran into hunterleys  say did you ever hear such cheek he exclaimed passing his arm through the latters a little bounder stopped me in the street and has been trying to frighten me into leaving monte carlo just because i broke that robbers wrist same johnny that came to you i expect what are they up to anyway what do they want to get rid of us for they ought to be jolly grateful  hunterleys shook his head  so far as i am concerned he said their reasons for wanting to get rid of me are fairly obvious i am afraid but i must say i dont know where you come in unless  he stopped short  well unless what richard interposed i should just like to know who it is trying to get me kicked out  cant you guess hunterleys asked there is one person who i think would be quite as well pleased to see the back of you  here in monte carlo  absolutely  richard was mystified  you are not very bright i am afraid hunterleys observed what about your friend mr grex  richard whistled softly  are you serious  of course i am hunterleys assured him  but has he any pull here this mr grex  hunterleys eyes twinkled for a moment  yes he replied i think that mr grex has very considerable influence in this part of the world and he is a man who i should say was rather used to having his own way  i gathered that i wasnt exactly popular with him this afternoon richard remarked meditatively ive been out there to call  hunterleys stopped short upon the pavement  what he exclaimed  i have been out to call at the villa mimosa richard repeated i dont see anything extraordinary in that  did you seemiss fedora  rather and thank you for telling me her name at any rate we sat on the terrace and chatted for a quarter of an hour she gave me to understand though that the old man was dead against me it all seems very mysterious anyway she gave me this rose i am wearing and i think shell be at the club tomorrow afternoon  hunterleys was silent for a moment he seemed much impressed  you know richard he declared there is something akin to genius in your methods  thats all very well the young man protested but can you give me a single solid reason why considering i am in love with the girl i shouldnt go and call upon her who is this mr grex anyway  ive a good mind to tell you hunterleys said meditatively  i dont care whether you do or not lane pronounced firmly as they parted i dont care whether mr grex is the sultan of turkey or the czar of russia im going to marry his daughter thats settled     chapter xiv  dinner for two   at a few minutes before eight oclock that evening lady hunterleys descended the steps of the casino and crossed the square towards the hotel de paris she walked very slowly and she looked neither to the right nor to the left she had the air of seeing no one she acknowledged mechanically the low bow of the commissionaire who opened the door for her a reception clerk who stood on one side to let her pass she ignored altogether she crossed the hall to the lift and pressed the bell draconmeyer who had been lounging in an easychair waiting for her watched her entrance and noticed her abstracted manner with kindling eyes he threw away his newspaper and hastily approaching her touched her arm  you are late he remarked  she started  yes i am late  i did not see you at the club  i have been to the casino instead she told him i thought that it might change my luck  successful i trust  she shook her head then she opened her gold satchel and showed him it was empty  the luck must turn sometime he reminded her soothingly how long will you be changing  i am tired she confessed i thought that tonight i would not dine i will have something sent up to my room  he was obviously disappointed  couldnt you dine as you are he begged you could change later if you wished to it is always such a disappointment when you do not appearand tonight he added especially  violet hesitated she was really longing only to be alone and to rest she thought however of the poor invalid to whom their meeting at dinnertime was the one break of the day  very well she promised i will be down in ten minutes  draconmeyer as the lift bore her upwards strolled away although the custom was a strange one to him he sought out the american bar and drank a cocktail then he lit a cigarette and made his way back into the lounge moving restlessly about his hands behind his back his forehead knitted in his way he had been a great schemer and in the crowded hall of the hotel that night surrounded by a wonderfully cosmopolitan throng of loungers and passersby he lived again through the birth and development of many of the schemes which his brain had conceived since he had left his mothercountry one and all they had been successful he seemed indeed to have been imbued with the gift of success he had floated immense loans where other men had failed he had sustained the credit of his country on a high level through more than one serious financial crisis he had pulled down or built up as his judgment or fancy had dictated and all the time the mans relaxations apart from the actual trend of great affairs had been few and slight then had come his acquaintance with lindas schoolfriend he looked back through the years at first he had scarcely noticed her visits gradually he had become conscious of a dim feeling of thankfulness to the woman who always seemed able to soothe his invalid wife then scarcely more than a year or so ago he had found himself watching her at unexpected moments admiring the soft grace of her movements the pleasant cadence of her voice the turn of her head the colour of her hair the elegance of her clothes her thin fashionable figure gradually he had begun to look for her to welcome her at his tableand from that the rest finally the birth of this last scheme of his he had very nearly made a fatal mistake at the very commencement had pulled himself right again only with a supreme effort his heart beat quicker even now as he thought of that moment they had been alone together one evening she had sat talking with him after linda had gone to bed worse than usual and in the dim light he had almost lost his head he had almost said those words let her see the things in his eyes for which the time was not yet ripe she had kept away for a while after that he had treated it as a mistake but he had been very careful not to err again by degrees she forgot the estrangement between husband and wife was part of his scheme largely his doing he was all the time working to make the breach wider the visit to monte carlo rather a difficult accomplishment he had arranged he had seen with delight the necessity for some form of excitement growing up in her had watched her losses and only wished that they had been larger he had encouraged her to play for higher stakes and found that she needed very little encouragement indeed tonight he felt that a crisis was at hand there was a new look upon her face she had probably lost everything he knew exactly how she would feel about asking her husband for help his eyes grew brighter as he waited for the lift  she came at last and they walked together into the diningroom when she reached their accustomed table it was empty and only their two places were laid she looked at him in surprise  but i thought you said that linda would be so disappointed she reminded him  he shook his head  i do not think that i mentioned lindas name he protested she went to bed soon after tea in an absolutely hopeless state i am afraid that tonight i was selfish i was thinking of myself i have had nothing in the shape of companionship all day i came and looked at the table and the thought of dining alone wearied me i have to spend a great deal of time alone unfortunately you and i are perhaps a little alike in that respect  she seated herself after a moments hesitation he moved his chair a little closer to hers the pinkshaded lamp seemed to shut them off from the rest of the room a waiter poured wine into their glasses  i ordered champagne tonight he remarked you looked so tired when you came in drink a glass at once  she obeyed him smiling faintly she was as a matter of fact craving for something of the sort  it was thoughtful of you she declared i am tired i have been losing all day and altogether i have had a most depressing time  it is not as it should be that he observed smiling this is a city of pleasure one was meant to leave ones cares behind here if any one in this world he added should be without them it should be you  he looked at her respectfully yet with an admiration which he made no effort to conceal there was nothing in the look overpersonal she accepted it with gratitude  you are always kind she murmured  this reminds me of some of our evenings in london he went on when we used to talk music before we went to the opera i always found those evenings so restful and pleasant wont you try and forget that you have lost a few pennies forget also your other worries whatever they may be i have had a letter today from the one great writer whom we both admire i shall read it to you and i have a list of the operas for next week i see that your husbands little prot√©g√©e felicia roche is here  my husbands prot√©g√©e she repeated i dont quite understand  he seemed for a moment embarrassed  i am sorry he said i had no idea but your husband will tell you if you ask him it was he who paid for her singing education and her triumph is his but the name must be known to you  i have never heard it in connection with my husband she declared frowning slightly henry does not always take me into his confidence  then i am sorry he continued penitently that i mentioned the matter it was clumsy of me i had an idea that he must have told you all about her another glass of wine please and you will find your appetite comes jules has prepared that salmon trout specially ill read you the letter from maurice if you like and afterwards there is a story i must tell you  the earlier stages of dinner slipped pleasantly away draconmeyer was a born conversationalista good talker and a keen tactician the food and the wine too did their part presently violet lifted her head the colour came back to her cheeks she too began to talk and laugh all the time he was careful not to press home his advantage he remembered that one night in the library at grosvenor square when she had turned her head and looked at him for a moment before leaving she must be different now he told himself fiercely it was impossible that she could continue to love a husband who neglected her a man whose mistaken sense of dignity kept him away from her  i want you he begged as they drew towards the close of the meal to treat me if you will just a little more confidentially  she glanced up at him quickly almost suspiciously  what do you mean  you have troubles of which you do not speak he went on if my friendship is worth anything it ought to enable me to share those troubles with you you have had a little further disagreement with your husband i think and bad luck at the tables you ought not to let either of these things depress you too much tell me do you think that i could help with sir henry  no one could help she replied her tone unconsciously hardening henry is obstinate and it is my firm conviction that he has ceased to care for me at all this afternoonthis very afternoon she went on leaning across the table her voice trembling a little her eyes very bright i offered to go away with him  to leave monte carlo  yes he refused he said that he must stay here for some mysterious reason i begged him to tell me what that reason was and he was silent it was the end he gives me no confidence he has refused the one effort i made at reconciliation i am convinced that it is useless we have parted finally  draconmeyer tried hard to keep the light from his eyes as he leaned towards her  dear lady he said if i do not admit that i am sorrywell there are reasons your husband did well to be mysterious i can tell you the reason why he will not leave monte carlo it is because felicia roche makes her d√©but at the opera house tomorrow night there i didnt mean to tell you but the whole world knows it even now i would not have told you but for other things it is best that you know the truth it is my firm belief that your husband does not deserve your interest much more your affection if only i dared  he paused for a moment every word he was compelled to measure  sometimes he continued your condition reminds me so much of my own i think that there is no one so lonely in life as i am for the last few years linda has been fading away physically and mentally i touch her fingers at morning and night we speak of the slight happenings of the day she has no longer any mind or any power of sympathy her lips are as cold as her understanding for that i know she is not to blame yet it has left me very lonely if i had had a child he went on even if there were one single soul of whom i was fond to whom i might look for sympathy even if you my dear friendyou see i am bold and i venture to call you my dear friendcould be a little kinder sometimes it would make all the difference in the world  she turned her head and looked at him his teeth came together hastily it seemed to him that already she was on her guard  you have something more to say havent you she asked  he hesitated her tone was noncommittal it was a moment when he might have risked everything but he feared to make a mistake  this is what i mean he declared with the appearance of great frankness i am going to speak to you upon the absurd question of money i have an income of which even if i were boundlessly extravagant i could not hope to spend half a speculation the week before i left england brought me a profit of a million marks but for the banking interests of my country and the feeling that i am the trustee for thousands of other people it would weary me to look for investments and youyou came in tonight looking worn out just because you had lost a handful or so of those wretched plaques there you see it is coming now i should like permission to do more than call myself your friend i should like permission to be also your banker  she looked at him quietly and searchingly his heart began to beat faster at least she was in doubt he had not wholly lost his chance even was good  my friend she said i believe that you are honest i do indeed recognise your point of view the thing is an absurdity but you know all conventions even the most foolish have some human and natural right beneath them i think that the convention which forbids a woman accepting money from a man however close a friend is like that frankly my first impulse a few minutes ago was to ask you to lend me a thousand pounds now i know that i cannot do it  do you really mean that he asked in a tone of deep disappointment if you do i am hurt it proves that the friendship which to me is so dear is to you a very slight thing  you mustnt think that she pleaded and please mr draconmeyer dont think that i dont appreciate all your kindness short of accepting your money i would do anything to prove it  there need be no question of a gift he reminded her in a low tone if i were a perfect stranger i might still be your banker you must have money from somewhere are you going to ask your husband  she bit her lip for a moment if indeed he had known her actual position his hopes would have been higher still  i cannot possibly ask henry for anything she confessed i had made up my mind to ask him to authorise the lawyers to advance me my next quarters allowance afterwhat has passed between us though andconsidering everything i dont feel that i can do it  then may i ask how you really mean to get more money he went on gently  she looked at him a little piteously  honestly i dont know she admitted i will be quite frank with you henry allows me two thousand five hundred a year i brought nine hundred pounds out with me and i have nothing more to come until june  and how much have you left of the nine hundred pounds he asked  not enough to pay my hotel bill she groaned  he smiled  circumstances are too strong for you he declared you must go to a banker i claim the right of being that banker i shall draw up a promissory noteno we neednt do thattwo or three cheques perhaps dated june august and october i shall charge you five per cent interest and i shall lend you a thousand pounds  her eyes sparkled the thought of the money was wonderful to her a thousand pounds in mille notes that very night she thought it all over rapidly she would never run such risks again she would play for small amounts each dayjust enough to amuse herself then if she were lucky she would plunge only she would choose the right moment very likely she would be able to pay the whole amount back in a day or two if henry minded well it was his own fault he should have been different  you put it so kindly she said gratefully that i am afraid i cannot refuse you are very very considerate mr draconmeyer it certainly will be nicer to owe you the money than a stranger  i am only glad that you are going to be reasonable he remarkedglad really for both our sakes and remember he went on cheerfully that one isnt young and at monte carlo too many times in ones life make up your mind to enjoy yourself if the luck goes against you for a little longer come again you are bound to win in the end now if you like well have our coffee outside ill go and fetch the money and you shall make out your cheques  he scribbled hastily on a piece of paper for a moment  these are the amounts he pointed out i have charged you five per cent per annum interest as i can deal with money at something under four i shall make quite a respectable profitmore than enough he added goodnaturedly to pay for our dinner  she seemed suddenly years younger the prospect of the evening before her was enchanting  you really are delightful she exclaimed you cant think how differently i shall feel when i go into the club tonight i am perfectly certain that its having plenty of money that helps one to win  he smiled  and plenty of courage he added dont waste your time trifling with small stakes bid up for the big things it is the only way in gambling and in life  he rose to his feet and their eyes met for a moment once more she felt vaguely troubled she put that disturbing thought away from her however it was foolish to think of drawing back now if he admired herwell so did most men     chapter xv  international politics   the villa mimosa flamed with lights from the top story to the groundfloor the entrance gates stood wideopen all along the drive lamps flashed from unsuspected places beneath the yellowflowering trees one room only seemed shrouded in darkness and mystery and around that one room was concentrated the tense life of the villa thick curtains had been drawn with careful hands the heavy door had been securely closed the frenchwindows which led out on to the balcony had been almost barricaded the four men who were seated around the oval table had certainly secured for themselves what seemed to be a complete and absolute isolation yet there was nevertheless a sense of uneasiness an indescribable air of tension in the atmosphere the quartette had somehow the appearance of conspirators who had not settled down to their work it was the last arrival the man who sat at mr grexs right hand who was responsible for the general unrest  mr grex moved a little nervously in the chair which he had just drawn up to the table he looked towards draconmeyer as he opened the proceedings  monsieur douaille he said has come to see us this evening at my own urgent request before we commence any sort of discussion he has asked me to make it distinctly understood to you bothto you mr draconmeyer and to you herr selingmanthat this is not in any sense of the word a formal meeting or convention we are all here as it happens by accident our friend selingman for instance who is a past master in the arts of pleasant living has not missed a season here for many years draconmeyer is also an habitu√© i myself it is true have spent my winters elsewhere for various reasons and am comparatively a stranger but my visit here was arranged many months ago you yourself monsieur douaille are a good parisian and no good parisian should miss his yearly pilgrimages to the mecca of the pleasureseeker we meet together this evening therefore purely as friends who have a common interest at heart  the man from whom this atmosphere of nervousness radiateda man of medium height inclined towards corpulence with small grey imperial a thin red ribbon in his buttonhole and slightly prominent featurespromptly intervened he had the air of a man wholly illatease all the time mr grex had been speaking he had been drumming upon the table with his forefinger  precisely precisely he exclaimed above all things that must be understood ours is a chance meeting my visit in these parts is in no way connected with the correspondence i have had with one of our friends here further monsieur douaille continued impressively it must be distinctly understood that any word i may be disposed to utter either in the way of statement or criticism is wholly and entirely unofficial i do not even know what the subject of our discussion is to be i approach it with the more hesitation because i gather from some slight hint which has fallen from our friend here that it deals with a scheme which if ever it should be carried into effect is to the disadvantage of a nation with whom we are at present on terms of the greatest friendship my presence here except on the terms i have stated he concluded his voice shaking a little would be an unpardonable offence to that country  monsieur douailles somewhat laboured explanation did little to lighten the atmosphere it was the genius of herr selingman which intervened he leaned back in his chair and he patted his waistcoat thoughtfully  i have things to say he declared but i cannot say them i have nothing to smokeno cigarette no cigar i arrive here choked with dust as yet the circumstance seems to have escaped our hosts notice ah what is that i see he added rising suddenly to his feet my host you are acquitted i look around the table here at which i am invited to seat myself and i perceive nothing but a few stumpy pens and unappetising blottingpaper by chance i lift my eyes i see the parting of the curtains yonder and behold  he rose and crossed the room throwing back a curtain at the further end in the recess stood a sideboard laden with all manner of liqueurs and wines glasses of every size and shape sandwiches pasties and fruit herr selingman stood on one side with outstretched hand in the manner of a showman he himself was wrapped for a moment in admiration  for you others i cannot speak he observed surveying the label upon a bottle of hock for myself here is nectar  with careful fingers he drew the cork at a murmured word of invitation from mr grex the others rose from their places and also helped themselves from the sideboard selingman took up his position in the centre of the hearthrug with a long tumbler of yellow wine in one hand and a sandwich in the other  for myself he continued taking a huge bite i wage war against all formality i have been through this sort of thing in berlin i have been through it in vienna i have been through it in rome i have sat at long tables with politicians have drawn little pictures upon the blottingpaper and been bored to death in wearisome fashion we have drafted agreements we have quarrelled and bickered we have yawned and made of ourselves men of parchment but tonight he added taking another huge bite from his sandwich tonight nothing of that sort is intended draconmeyer and i have an idea mr grex is favourably inclined towards it that idea isnt a bit of good to ourselves or any one else unless monsieur douaille here shares our point of view here we are then all met togetherlet us hope for a week or twos enjoyment little by little we must try and see what we can do towards instilling that idea into the mind of monsieur douaille we may succeed we may fail but let us always remember that our conversations are the conversations of four friends met together upon what is nothing more or less than a holiday i hate the sight of those sheets of blottingpaper and clean pens who wants to make notes especially of what we are going to talk about the man who cannot carry notes in his head is no statesman  monsieur douaille who had chosen champagne and was smoking a cigarette beamed approval much of his nervousness had departed  i agree he declared i like well the attitude of our friend selingman there is something much too formal about this table i am not here to talk treaties or to upset them to exchange views if you willno more meanwhile i appreciate this very excellent champagne the cigarettes are delicious and i remove myself to this easychair if any one would talk world politics i am ready why not why should we pretend that there is any more interesting subject to men like ourselves in whom is placed the trust of our country  mr grex nodded his head in assent  the fault is mine he declared but believe me it was not intentional it was never my wish to give too formal an air to our little meetingin fact i never intended to do more than dwell on the outside edge of great subjects tonight unfortunately monsieur douaille neither you nor i whatever our power or influence may be are directly responsible for the foreign affairs of our countries we can therefore speak with entire frankness our countriesyour country and mineare today bound together by an alliance you have something which almost approaches an alliance with another country i am going to tell you in plain words what i think you have been given to understand indirectly many times during the last few yearsthat understanding is not approved of in st petersburg  monsieur douaille knocked the ash from his cigarette he gazed thoughtfully into the fire of pine logs which was burning upon the open hearth  mr grex he said that is plainer speaking than we have ever received from any official source  i admit it mr grex replied such a statement on my part may sound a little startling but i make it advisedly i know the feelingyou will grant that my position entitles me to know the feelingof the men who count for anything in russian politics perhaps i do not mean the titular heads of my government there are others who have even more responsibilities who count for more i honestly and truthfully assure you that i speak for the powers that are behind the government of russia when i tell you that the english dream of a triple alliance between russia england and france will never be accepted by my country  monsieur douaille sipped his champagne  this is candour he remarked absolute candour one speaks quite plainly i imagine before our friend the enemy he added smiling towards selingman  why not selingman demanded why not indeed we are not fools here  then i would ask you mr grex monsieur douaille continued where in the name of all that is equitable are you to find an alliance more likely to preserve the status quo in europe both logically and geographically it absolutely dovetails russia is in a position to absorb the whole attention of austria and even to invade the north coast of germany the hundred thousand troops or so upon which we could rely from great britain would be invaluable for many reasonsfirst because a mixture of blood is always good secondly because the regular army which perforce they would have to send us is of very fine fighting material and thirdly because they could land to give away a very open secret to you my friend selingman in a westerly position and would very likely succeed thereby in making an outflanking movement towards the north i presume that at present the german fleet would not come out to battle in which case the english would certainly be able to do great execution upon the northern coast of germany all this of course has been discussed and written about and the next war been mapped out in a dozen different ways i must confess however that taking every known consideration into account i can find no other distribution of powers so reasonable or so favourable to my country  mr grex nodded  i find no fault with any word of what you have said he declared except that yours is simply the superficial and obvious idea of the man in the street as to the course of the next probable war now let us go a little further i grant all the points which you urge in favour of your suggested triple alliance i will even admit that your forecast of a war taking place under such conditions is a fairly faithful one we proceed then the war if it came to pass could never be decisive an immense amount of blood would be shed treasure recklessly poured out europe be rendered desolate for the sake most largely of whomof japan and america that is the weakness of the whole thing a war carried out on the lines you suggest would be playing the game of these two countries even the victors would be placed at a huge disadvantage with them to say nothing of the losers who must see slipping away from them forever their place under the sun it is my opinionand i have studied this matter most scientifically and with the help of the secret service of every country not excepting your own herr selingmanit is my opinion that this war must be indecisive the german fleet would be crippled and not destroyed the english fleet would retain its proportionate strength no french advance into germany would be successful no german advance into france is likely the war would languish for lack of funds through sheer inanition it would flicker out and the money of the world would flow into the treasuries of america russia would not be fighting for her living with her it could be at best but a halfhearted war she would do her duty to the alliance nothing more could be hoped from her you could not expect for instance that she would call up all her reserves leave the whole of her eastern frontier unprotected and throw into mideurope such a force as would in time subjugate germany this could be done but it will not be done we all know that  monsieur douaille smoked thoughtfully for several moments  very well he pronounced at last i am rather inclined to agree with all that you have said yet it seems to me that you evade the great point the status quo is what we desire peace is what the world wants if before such a war as you have spoken of is begun people realise what the end of it must be dont you think that that itself is the greatest help towards peace my own opinion is i tell you frankly that for many years to come at any rate there will be no war  herr selingman set down his glass and turned slowly around  then let me tell you that you are mistaken he declared solemnly listen to me my friend douaillemy friend mind and not the statesman douaille i am a german citizen and you are a french one and i tell you that if in three years time your country does not make up its mind to strike a blow for alsace and lorraine then in three years time germany will declare war upon you  monsieur douaille had the expression of a man who doubts selingman frowned he was suddenly immensely serious he struck the palm of one hand a great blow with his clenched fist  why is it that no one in the world understands he cried what germany wants i tell you monsieur douaille that we dont hate your country we love it we crowd to paris we expand there it is the holiday place of every good german who wants a ruined france not we yet unless there is a change in the international situation we shall go to war with you and i will tell you why there are no secrets about this sort of thing every politician who is worth his salt knows them the only difficulty is to know when a country is in earnest and how far it will go that is the value of our meeting that is what i am here to say we shall go to war with you monsieur douaille to get calais and when weve got calaisoh my god selingman almost reverently concluded then our solemn task will be begun  england monsieur douaille murmured  there was a brief pause selingman had seemed for a moment to have passed into the clouds there was a sort of gloomy rapture upon his face he caught up douailles last word and repeated it  england england and through her  he moved to the sideboard and filled his tumbler with wine when he came back to his place his expression had lightened  ah well dear monsieur douaille he exclaimed patting the others shoulder in friendly fashion tonight we merely chatter tonight we are here to make friends to gain each the confidence of the other to ourselves let us pretend that we are little boys playing the game of our nationfrance germany and russia germany and russia to be frank with you are waiting for one last word from germanys father something splendid and definite to offer what we would like france to do while france loses its money at roulette and flirts with the pretty ladies at ciros is to try and accustom itself not to an alliance with germanyno nothing so utopian as that the lion and the lamb may remain apart they may agree to be friends they may even wave paws at one another but i do not suggest that they march side by side what we ask of france is that she looks the other way it is very easy to look the other way she might look for instancetowards egypt  illustration what we ask of france is that she looks the other way  there was a sudden glitter in the eyes of monsieur douaille selingman saw it and pressed on  there are laurels to be won which will never fade he continued setting down his empty tumbler laurels to be won by that statesman of your country the little boy france who is big enough and strong enough to stand with his feet upon the earth and proclaimi am for france and my own people and my own people only and i will make them great through all the centuries by seeing the truth and leading them towards it singlepurposed singleminded  but these things are not to be disposed of so readily as this wonderful berncastleri beg its pardon berncastler doctorof our host for tonight i have said my say i have whims perhaps but with me serious affairs are finished for the night i go to the sporting club mademoiselle keeps my place at the baccarat table i feel in the vein it is a small place monte carlo let us make no appointments we shall drift together and monsieur he concluded laying his hand for a moment upon douailles shoulder let the thought sink into your brain wipe out that geographical and logical map of europe from your mind see things if you can in the new daylight then when the idea has been there for just a little timewell we speak again come draconmeyer i am relying upon your car to get me into monte carlo my bounteous host mr grex good night i touch your hand with reverence the man who possesses such wine and offers it to his friends is indeed a prince  mr grex rose a little unwillingly from his chair  it is of no use to protest he remarked smiling our friend selingman will have his way besides as he reminded us there is one last word to arrive come and breathe the odours of the riviera monsieur douaille this is when i realise that i am not at my villa on the black sea  they passed out into the hall and stood on the terrace while the cars drew up the light outside seemed faintly violet the perfume of mimosa and roses and oleander came to him in long waves subtle and yet invigorating below the lights of monte carlo clear and brilliant with no northern fog or mist to dull their radiance shone like gems in the mantle of night selingman sighed as he stepped into the automobile  we are men who deserve well from history he declared who in the midst of a present so wonderful can spare time to plan for the generations to come     chapter xvi  a bargain with jean coulois   selingman drew out his watch and held it underneath the electric light set in the back of the automobile  good he declared it is not yet halfpast eleven  too early for the austria draconmeyer murmured a little absently  selingman returned the watch to his pocket  by no means he objected mademoiselle is doubtless amusing herself well enough but if i go now and leave in an hour she will be peevish she might want to accompany us tonight it would not be convenient tell your chauffeur draconmeyer to take us direct to the rendezvous we can at least watch the people there one is always amused we will forget our nervous friend these little touches draconmeyer my man they mark the man of genius mind you did you notice how his eyes lit up when i whispered that one word egypt it is a great game when you bait your hook with men and fish for empires  draconmeyer gave an instruction to his chauffeur and leaned back  if we succeed he began  succeed selingman interrupted why man alive he is on our hooks already be at rest my friend the affair is half arranged it remains only with us to deal with one man  draconmeyers eyes sparkled beneath his spectacles a slow smile crept over his white face  you are right he agreed that man is best out of the way if he and douaille should meet  they shall not meet selingman thundered i selingman declare it we are here already good the aspect of the place pleases me  the two men arriving so early received the distinguished consideration of a bowing ma√Ætre dh√¥tel as they entered the austria they were ushered at once to a round table in a favourable position selingman surrendered his hat and coat to the obsequious vestiaire pulled down his waistcoat with a familiar gesture spread his pudgy hands upon the table and looked around him with a smile of benevolent approval  i shall amuse myself here he declared confidently pass the menu to me draconmeyer you have no more idea how to eat than a rabbit that is why you suffer from indigestion at this hourwhy it is not midnight yetone needs sustenancesustenance mark you intelligently selected something nourishing yet not heavy a sheet of paper waiter you see i like to write out my dishes it saves trouble and there are no disappointments nothing is forgotten as to the wine show me the vintage champagnes so you need not hurry with the meal we shall spend some time here  draconmeyer arrested the much impressed ma√Ætre dh√¥tel as he was hurrying away  is there dancing here tonight he enquired  but certainly monsieur the man replied a spanish lady altogether ravishing the equal of ot√©ro at her bestsignorina melita  she dances alone  by no means there is the young frenchman jean coulois who is engaged for the season a wonderful pair indeed when may comes they go to the musichalls in paris and london  draconmeyer nodded approval  coulois was the name he whispered to selingman as the man moved away  the place filled up slowly presently the supper was served selingman ate with appetite draconmeyer only sparingly the latter however drank more freely than usual the wine had nevertheless curiously little effect upon him save for a slight additional brightness of the eyes his cheeks remained pale his manner distrait he watched the people enter and pass to their places without any apparent interest selingman on the other hand easily absorbed the spirit of his surroundings as the night wore on he drank healths with his neighbours beamed upon the pretty little frenchwoman who was selling flowers ate and drank what was set before him with obvious enjoyment both men however showed at least an equal interest when mademoiselle melita in spanish costume accompanied by a slim darkvisaged man began to dance draconmeyer was no longer restless he sat with folded arms watching the performance with a strangely absorbed air one thing however was singular although selingman was confessedly a ladies man his eyes after her first few movements scarcely rested for a moment upon the girl both draconmeyer and he watched her companion steadfastly when the dance was over they applauded with spirit selingman sat up in his place a champagne bottle in his hand he beckoned to the man who with a little deprecating shrug of the shoulders swaggered up to their table with some show of condescension  a chair for monsieur jean coulois the great dancer selingman ordered a glass and another bottle of wine monsieur jean my congratulations but a word in your ear her steps do not match yours it is you who make the dance she has no initiative she can do nothing but imitate he added  the dancer looked at his host a little curiously he was slightly built and without an atom of colour his black hair was closely cropped his eyes of sombre darkness his demeanour almost sullen at selingmans words however he nodded rapidly and seated himself more firmly upon his chair it was apparent that although his face remained expressionless he was gratified  they notice nothing these others he remarked with a little wave of the hand it is always the woman who counts you are right monsieur she dances like a stick she has good calves and she rolls her eyes the canaille applaud it is always like that your health monsieur  he drank his wine without apparent enjoyment but he drank it like water selingman leaned across the table  coulois he whispered the wolves bay loudest at night is it not so  the man sat quite still if such a thing had been possible he might have grown a shade paler his eyes glittered he looked steadfastly at selingman  who are you he muttered  the wolves sleep in the daytime selingman replied  the dancer shrugged his shoulders he held out his glass to be replenished the double password had reassured him  pardon monsieur he said these have been anxious hours  the little affair at la turbie selingman suggested  coulois set down his glass for the first time half finished his mouth had taken an evil turn he leaned across the table  see you he exclaimed in a hoarse whisper what happened happened justly martin is responsible the whole thing was conducted in the spirit of a pantomime a great joke who are we the wolves to brandish empty firearms to shrink from letting a little blood bah  he finished his wine selingman nodded approvingly as he refilled his glass  my friend and i he confided were amongst those who were held up imagine it we stood against the wall like a row of dummies such treasure as i have never before seen was poured into that sack jewels my friend such as only the women of monte carlo wear packet after packet of mille notes wealth immeasurable oh coulois coulois it was an opportunity lost  lost the dancer echoed fiercely it was thrown into the gutter it was madness it was hellish such illfortune yet what could i do if i had been absent from herei coulois whom men know ofeven the police would have had no excuse so it was martin who must lead our armoury had never been fuller there were revolvers for every one ammunition for a thousand pardon monsieur but i cannot talk of this affair the anger rises so hot in my heart that i fear to betray myself to those who may be listening and besides you have not come here to talk with me of it  it is true selingman confessed  there was a brief silence the dancer was studying them both there was uneasiness in his expression  i do not understand he enquired hoarsely how you came by the passwords  make yourself wholly at ease my young friend selingman begged him reassuringly we are men of the world my friend and i we seek our own ends in life and we have often to make use of the nearest and the best means for the purpose of securing them martin has served me before a week ago i should have gone to him tonight as you know he lies in prison  martin indeed the dancer jeered you would have gone then to a man of sawdust a chickenlivered bungler what is it that you want done speak to me i am a man  the leader of the orchestra was essaying upon his violin the tentative strains of a popular air the girl had reappeared and was poising herself upon her toes the leader of the orchestra summoned coulois  i must dance he announced afterwards i will return  he leapt lightly to his feet and swung into the room with extended arms draconmeyer looked down at his plate  it is a risk this we are running he muttered i do not see selingman why you could not have hired this fellow through allen or one of the others  selingman shook his head  see here draconmeyer he explained this is one of the cases where agents are dangerous for allen to have been seen with jean coulois here would have been the same as though i had been seen with him myself i cannot alas in this place with my personality keep my identity concealed they know that i am selingman they know well that wherever i move i have with me men of my secret service i cannot use them against hunterleys too many are in the know here we are simply two visitors who talk to a dancer we depart we do not see him again until afterwards besides this is where fate is with us what more natural than that the wolves should revenge themselves upon the man who captured one of their leaders it was the young american richard lane who really started the debacle but it was hunterleys who seized martin what more natural than revenge these fellows hang by one another always  draconmeyer nodded with grim approval  it was devilish work he did in sofia he said softly but for him much of this would have been unnecessary  the dance was over both men joined enthusiastically in the applause coulois with an insolent nod to his admirers returned to his seat he threw himself back in his chair crossed his legs and held out his empty glass though he had been dancing furiously there was not a single bead of perspiration upon his forehead  you are in good condition my friend selingman observed admiringly  i need to be for my work coulois replied let us get to business there is no need to mince words what do you want with me who is the quarry  the man who ruined your little affair at la turbie and captured your comrade martin selingman whispered you see you have every provocation to start with  coulois eyes glittered  he was an englishman he muttered  quite true selingman assented his name is hunterleyssir henry hunterleys he lives at the hotel de paris his room is number 189 he spends his time upon the terrace at the caf√© de paris and in the sporting club every morning he goes to the english bank for his letters deals with them in his room calls at the postoffice and takes a walk often up into the hills  come come this is not so bad coulois exclaimed they laugh at us in the caf√©s and down in the wine shops of monaco those who know he went on frowning they say that the wolves have become sheep we shall see it is an affair this worth considering what do you pay monsieur le gros and for how long do you wish him out of the way  the pay selingman announced is two hundred louis and the man must be in hospital for at least a fortnight  draconmeyer leaned suddenly forward his eyes were bright his hands gripped the table  listen he whispered in coulois ear are the wolves sheep indeed that they can do no more than twist ankles and break heads that two hundred shall be five hundred jean coulois but it must be a cemetery to which they take him and not a hospital  illustration that two hundred shall be five hundred but it must be a cemetery to which they take him  there was a moments silence selingman sat back in his place he was staring at his companion with wideopen eyes jean coulois was moistening his lips with his tongue his eyes were brilliant  five hundred louis he repeated under his breath  is it not enough draconmeyer asked coldly i do not believe in half measures the man who is wounded may be well before he is welcome if five hundred louis is not enough name your price but let there be no doubt let me see what the wolves can do when it is their leader who handles the knife  the face of the dancer was curiously impassive he lifted his glass and drained it  an affair of death he exclaimed softly we wolveswe bite we wound we rob but deathugh there are ugly things to be thought of  and pleasant ones draconmeyer reminded him five hundred louis is not enough it shall be six hundred a man may do much with six hundred golden louis  selingman sat forward once more in his place  look here he intervened you go too far my friend you never spoke to me of this what have you against hunterleys  his nationality draconmeyer answered coolly i hate all englishmen  the gaiety had left selingmans face he gazed at his companion with a curious expression  my friend he murmured i fear that you are vindictive  perhaps draconmeyer replied quietly in these matters i like to be on the safe side  jean coulois struck the table lightly with his small feminine hand he showed all his teeth as though he had been listening to an excellent joke  it is to be done he decided there is no more to be said  some visitors had taken the next table coulois drew his chair a little closer to draconmeyer  i accept the engagement he continued we will talk no more monsieur desires my address it is herescribbling on a piece of paper but monsieur may be warned he added with a lightninglike flash in his eyes as he became conscious of the observation of some passersby i will not dance in england i will not leave monte carlo before may half that sumthree hundred louis mindmust come to me on trust the other three hundred afterwards never fear but that i will give satisfaction keep your part of the bargain he added under his breath and the wolves fangs are already in this mans throat  he danced again the two men watched him draconmeyers face was as still and colourless as ever in selingmans there was a shade of something almost like repulsion he poured himself out a glass of champagne  draconmeyer he exclaimed you are a coldblooded fish indeed you can sit there without blinking and think of this thing which we have done now as for me i have a heart i can never see the passing out of the game of even a bitter opponent without a shiver talk philosophy to me draconmeyer my nerves are shaken  draconmeyer turned his head he too raised his wine to his lips and drank deliberately  my friend he said there is no philosophy save one a child cries for the star he may not have the weak man comforts himself in privation by repeating to himself the dryasdust axioms conceived in an alien brain and weaving from them the miserable comfort of empty words the man who knows life and has found wisdom pays the price for the thing he desires and obtains it     chapter xvii  duty interferes again   hunterleys sat that night alone in a seat at the opera for a time and lost himself in a maze of recollections he seemed to find himself growing younger as he listened to the music the days of a more vivid and ardent sentimentality seemed to reassert themselves he thought of the hours when he had sat side by side with his wife the only woman to whom he had ever given a thought of the thrill which even the touch of her fingers had given him of the drive home together the little confidences and endearments the glamour which seemed to have been thrown over life before those unhappy misunderstandings he remembered so well the beginning of them allthe terrible pressure of work which was thrown upon his shoulders his engrossed days his disturbed nights her patience at first her subsequent petulance her final anger he was engaged often in departmental work which he could not even explain she had taken up with unhappy facility the r√¥le of a neglected wife she declared that he had ceased to care for the lighter ways there had certainly been a time when her complaints had been apparently justified when the opera had been banned theatres were impossible when she could not even rely upon his escort to a dinner or to a reception he had argued with her very patiently at first but very unsuccessfully it was then that her friendship with linda draconmeyer had been so vigorously renewed a friendship which seemed from the first to have threatened his happiness had it been his fault he wondered had he really been too much engrossed in his work his country had made large demands upon him in those days had he ever explained the matter fully and carefully enough to her perhaps not at any rate he was the sufferer he realised more than ever as the throbbing of the music stole into his blood the loneliness of his life and yet it seemed so hopeless supposing he threw up his work and let things take their course the bare thought chilled him he recognised it as unworthy the great song of mortification from the broken hero rang in his ears must every woman bring to every man the curse of delilah  he passed out of the building into the cool starlit night people were strolling about in evening clothes hatless the women in white opera cloaks and filmy gowns their silkstockinged feet very much in evidence resembling almost some strange kind of tropical birds with their little shrill laughter and graceful movements as they made their way towards the club or round to the rooms or to one of the restaurants for supper whilst hunterleys hesitated there was a touch upon his arm he glanced around  hullo david he exclaimed were you waiting for me  the young man fell into step by his side  i have been to the hotel he said in a low tone they thought you might be here can you come up latersay at one oclock  certainly hunterleys answered wheres sidney  hes working now hell be home by halfpast twelve unless anything goes wrong he thinks hell have something to tell you  ill come hunterleys agreed hows felicia  all right but working herself to death the young man replied she is getting anxious too give her a word of encouragement if you see her tonight she was hoping you might have been up to see her  i wont forget hunterleys promised  the young man drifted silently away and hunterleys after a moments hesitation and a glance at his watch turned towards the club he climbed the broad staircase surrendered his hat and turned in at the roulette room the magic of the music was still in his veins and he looked around him almost eagerly there was no sign of violet he strolled into the baccarat room but she was not there perhaps she too had been at the opera in the bar he found richard lane sitting moodily alone the young man greeted him warmly  come and have a drink sir henry he begged ive got the hump  hunterleys sat down by his side  whiskey and apollinaris he ordered whats the matter with you richard  she isnt here the young man declared ive been to the rooms and she isnt there either  what about the opera hunterleys asked  i started at the opera lane confessed took a box so as to be able to see the whole house i sat through the first act but there wasnt a sign of her then i took a spin out and had another look at the villa it was all lit up as though there were a party i very nearly marched in  just as well you didnt i think hunterleys remarked smiling i see youre feeling just the same about it  the young man did not even vouchsafe an answer  then youre not going to take advantage of your little warning and clear out hunterleys continued  dont you think im big enough to take care of myself lane asked with a little laugh besides theres an american consul here and plenty of english witnesses who saw the whole thing cant think why theyre trying on such a silly game  mr grex may have influence hunterleys suggested  who the mischief is my prospective fatherinlaw richard demanded almost testily theres an atmosphere about that house and the servants i cant understand a bit  you wouldnt hunterleys observed drily well in a day or two ill tell you who mr grex is id rather not tonight  by the way lane continued your wife was asking if you were here a few minutes ago  hunterleys rose quickly to his feet  where is she  she was at her usual place at the top roulette table but she gave it up just as i passed said she was going to walk about the young man replied i dont think she has left yet  hunterleys excused himself hastily in the little space between the restaurant and the roulette rooms he came suddenly upon violet she was leaning back in an obscure corner with her hands clasped helplessly in her lap before her she was sitting quite still and his heart sank when he saw her the lines under her eyes were unmistakable now her cheeks too seemed to have grown hollow her first look at him almost made him forget all their differences there was something piteous in the tremble of her lips he drew a chair to her side  richard told me that you wished to speak to me he began as lightly as he could  i asked if he had seen you a few minutes ago she admitted i am afraid that my interest was rather mercenary  you want to borrow some money he enquired taking out his pocketbook  she looked at it and though her eyes at first were listless they still seemed fascinated  i dont think i can play any more tonight she sighed  you have been losing  yes  come and have something he invited you look tired  she rose willingly enough they passed out side by side into the little bar  some champagne he suggested  she shook her head quickly the memory of the champagne at dinnertime came back to her with a sudden sickening insistence she thought of the loan she thought of draconmeyer with a new uneasiness it was as though she had admitted some new complication into her life  could i have some tea she begged  he ordered some and sat with her while she drank it  you know he declared if i might be permitted to say so i think you are taking the gaming here a little too seriously if you have been unlucky it is very easy to arrange an advance for you would you like some money if so i will see to it when i go to the bank tomorrow i can let you have a hundred pounds at once if you like  a hundred pounds if only she dared tell him that she had lost a thousand within the last two hours once more he was fingering his pocketbook  come he went on pleasantly you had better have a hundred from me for luck  he counted out the notes her fingers began to shake  i didnt mean to play any more tonight she faltered irresolutely  nor should i he agreed take my advice violet and go home now this will do for you tomorrow  she took the money and dropped it into her jewelled bag  very well she said i wont play any more but i dont want to go home yet it is early and i can never sleep here if i go to bed sit with me for halfanhour and then perhaps you could give me some supper  he shook his head  i am so sorry he answered but at one oclock i have an appointment  an appointment  such bad luck he continued it would have given me very great pleasure to have had supper with you violet  an appointment at one oclock she repeated slowly isnt that just a littleunusual  perhaps so he assented i can assure you that i am very sorry  she leaned suddenly towards him the aloofness had gone from her manner the barrier seemed for a moment to have fallen down once more she was the violet he remembered she smiled into his face and smiled with her eyes as well as her lips just the smile he had been thinking of an hour ago in the opera house  dont go please she begged i am feeling lonely tonight and i am so tired of everybody and everything take me to supper at the caf√© de paris then if you like we might come back here for halfanhour or  she hesitated  i am horribly sorry he declared in a tone which was full of real regret indeed violet i am but i have an appointment which i must keep and i cant tell exactly how long it may take me  the very fact that the nature of that appointment concerned things which from the first he had made up his mind must be kept entirely secret stiffened his tone her manner changed instantly she had drawn herself a little away she considered for a moment  are you inclined to tell me with whom your appointment is and for what purpose she asked coldly i dont want to be exacting but after the request i have made and your refusal  i cannot tell you he interrupted i can only ask you to take my word for it that it is one which i must keep  she rose suddenly to her feet  i forgot she exclaimed i havent the slightest right to your confidence besides when i come to think of it i dont believe that i am hungry at all i shall try my luck with your money  violet  she swept away with a little farewell nod half insolent half angry hunterleys watched her take her place at the table for several moments he stood by her side she neither looked up nor addressed him then he turned and left the place     chapter xviii  a midnight conference   hunterleys remained in the hotel only long enough to change his straw hat for a cap put on a long light overcoat and take an ash stick from his wardrobe he left the place by an unfrequented entrance and commenced at once to climb to the back part of the town once or twice he paused and looked around to be sure that he was not followed when he had arrived as far as the hotel de prince de galles he crossed the road from here he walked very quickly and took three turns in rapid succession finally he pushed open a little gate and passed up a tiled walk which led between a little border of rose trees to a small white villa covered with creepers a slim girlish figure came suddenly out from the porch and danced towards him with outstretched hands  at last she exclaimed at last tell me my coguardian how you are going to excuse yourself  he took her outstretched hands and looked down into her face she was very small and dark with lustrous brown eyes and a very sensitive mouth which just now was quivering with excitement  all the excuses have gone out of my head felicia he declared you look such a little elf in the moonlight that i cant do more than say that i am sorry but i have been busy  she was suddenly serious she clasped his arm with both her hands and turned towards the house  of course you have she sighed it seems too bad though in monte carlo sidney and david are like ghouls i dont ask what it is all abouti know betterbut i wish it were all over whatever it is  is sidney back hunterleys asked eagerly  she nodded  he came in halfanhour ago looking like a tramp david is writing as though he hadnt a moment to spare in life they are both waiting for you i think  and you he enquired how do the rehearsals go  the rehearsals are all right she admitted looking up at him almost pathetically its the night itself that seems so awful i know every word i know every note and yet i cant feel sure i cant sleep for thinking about it only last night i had a nightmare i saw all those rows and rows of faces and the lights and my voice went my tongue was dry and hard not a word would come and you were thereand the others  he laughed at her  little girl he said solemnly i shall have to speak to sidney one of those two young men must take you out for a day in the country tomorrow  they seem so busy she complained they dont seem to have time to think of me i suppose i had better let you go in theyd be furious if they thought i was keeping you  they passed into the villa and with a farewell pat of the hand hunterleys left her and opened a door on the lefthand side of the hall the young man who had met him coming out of the opera was standing with his hands in his pockets upon the hearthrug of an exceedingly untidylooking apartment there was a table covered with papers another piled with newspapers there were books upon the floor pipes and tobacco laid about haphazard a space had been swept clear upon the larger table for a typewriter a telephone instrument stood against the wall a man whose likeness to felicia was at once apparent swung round in his chair as hunterleys entered he had taken off his coat and waistcoat and his trousers seemed smothered with dust  regular newspaper correspondents den hunterleys remarked as he looked around him i never saw such a mess in my life i wonder felicia allows it  we dont let her come in her brother chuckled is the door closed  fast hunterleys replied moving away from it  things are moving the other went on i took the small car out today on the road to cannes and i expect i was the first to see douaille  i saw him myself hunterleys announced i was out on that road walking  douaille roche continued went direct to the villa mimosa grex was there waiting for him draconmeyer and selingman both kept out of the way  hunterleys nodded  reasonable enough that grex was the man to pave the way well  at ten oclock draconmeyer and selingman arrived the villa mimosa gets more difficult every day i have only one friend in the house although it is filled with servants threequarters of them only speak russian my mans reliable but he is in a terrible minority the conference took place in the library it lasted about an hour and a half selingman and draconmeyer came out looking fairly well satisfied halfanhour later douaille went on to mentone to the hotel splendide where his wife and daughters are staying no writing at all was done in the room  the conference has really begun then hunterleys observed moodily  without a doubt roche declared i imagine though that the meeting this evening was devoted to preliminaries i am hoping next time he went on to be able to pass on a little of what is said  if we could only get the barest idea as to the nature of the proposals hunterleys said earnestly of course one can surmise our people are already warned as to the long conferences which have taken place between grex and selingman they mean somethingtheres no doubt about that and then this invitation to douaille and his coming here so furtively everything points the same way but a few spoken words are better than all the surmises in the world it isnt that they are unreasonable at home but they must be convinced  its the devils own risk roche sighed but i am hard at it i was about the place yesterday as much as i dared my plans are all ready now but things looked pretty awkward at the villa tonight if they are going to have the grounds patrolled by servants every time they meet im done ive cut a pane of glass out of the dome over the library and ive got a windowcleaning apparatus round at the back and a ladder the passage along the roof is quite easy and theres a good deal of cover amongst the chimneys but if they get a hint it will be touch and go  hunterleys nodded he was busy now going through the long sheets of writing which the other young man had silently passed across to him for halfanhour he read making pencil notes now and then in the margin when at last he had finished he returned them and sitting down at the table drew a packet of press cable sheets towards him and wrote for some time steadily when he had finished he read through the result of his labours and leaned back thoughtfully in his chair  you will send this off from cannes with your own briston he asked  the young man assented  the car will be here at three he announced theyll be on their way by eight  press message mind to the daily post if the operator wants to know what number 1 means after daily post you can tell him that it simply indicates to which editorial room the message is to be delivered  thats a clever idea roche mused code dispatches to downing street might cause a little comment  they wouldnt do from here hunterleys declared they might be safe enough from cannes but its better to run no risks these will be passed on to downing street unopened be careful tomorrow sidney  i cant see that they can do anything but throw me out sir henry roche remarked i have my daily post authority in my pocket and my passport besides i got the man here to announce in the monte carlo news that i was the accredited correspondent for the district and that david briston had been appointed by a syndicate of illustrated papers to represent them out here thats in case we get a chance of taking photographs i had some idea of going out to interview monsieur douaille  hunterleys shook his head  i shouldnt the mans as nervous as he can be now i am pretty sure of that dont do anything that might put him on his guard mind for all we know he may be an honest man to listen to what these fellows have to say doesnt mean that hes prepared to fall in with their schemes by the by youve nothing about the place i suppose if you should be raided  not a thing was the confident reply we are two english newspaper correspondents and there isnt a thing to be found anywhere thats not in keeping except my rather large makeup outfit and my somewhat mixed wardrobe i am not the only newspaper correspondent who goes in for that though then theres felicia they all know who she is and they all know that shes my sister anyhow even if i do get into trouble up at the villa mimosa i cant see that i shall be looked upon as anything more than a prying newspaper correspondent they cant hang me for that  hunterleys accepted a cigarette and lit it  i neednt tell you fellows he said gravely that this place is a little unlike any other in europe you may think youre safe enough but all the same i wouldnt trust a living soul bytheby i saw felicia as i came in you dont want her to break down do you  good heavens no her brother exclaimed  break down david repeated dont suggest such a thing  it struck me that she was rather nervy hunterleys told them one of you ought to look after her for an hour or two tomorrow  i cant spare a moment her brother sighed  ill take her out briston declared eagerly theres nothing for me to do tomorrow till sidney gets back  well between you keep an eye on her hunterleys advised and sidney i dont want to make a coward of you and you and i both know that if theres danger ahead its our job to face it but have a care up at the villa mimosa i dont fancy the law of this principality would see you out of any trouble if they got an idea that you were an english secret service man  roche laughed shortly  exactly my own idea he admitted however weve got to see it through i shant consider ive done my work unless i hear something of what grex and the others have to say to douaille the next time they meet  hunterleys found felicia waiting for him outside he shook his head reproachfully  a future prima donna he said should go to bed at ten oclock  she opened the door for him and walked down the path her hands clasped in his arm  a future prima donna she retorted cant do always what she likes if i go to bed too early i cannot sleep tonight i am excited and nervous there isnt anything likely to bring trouble uponthem is there  certainly not he replied promptly your brother is full of enterprise as you know he runs a certain amount of risk in his eagerness to acquire news but i never knew a man so well able to take care of himself  andand mr briston  oh hes all right anyway hunterleys assured her his is the smaller part  she breathed a little sigh of relief they had reached the gate she still had something to say below them flared the lights of monte carlo she looked down at them almost wistfully  very soon she murmured i shall know my fate sir henry she added suddenly did i see lady hunterleys today on the terrace  lady hunterleys is here he replied  am iought i to go and see her she enquired you see you have done so much for me i should like to do what you thought best  just as you like child he replied a little carelessly  she clung to his arm she seemed unwilling to let him go  dear coguardian she murmured tonight i felt for a little time so happy as though all the good things in life were close at hand then i watched you come up and your step seemed so heavy and you stooped as though you had a load on your shoulders  he patted her hand  little girl he advised run away in and take care of your throat remember that everything depends upon the next few hours as for me perhaps i am getting a little old  oh la la she laughed thats what sidney says when i tease him i know i am only the mouse but i could gnaw through very strong cords look  her teeth gleamed white in the moonlight he swung open the gate  sing your way into the hearts of all these strange people he bade her smiling sing the envy and malice away from them sing so that they believe that england after all is the one desirable country  but i am going to sing in french she pouted  your name he reminded her that is english the little english prima donna that is what they will be calling you  she kissed his hands suddenly as he parted from her and swung off down the hill then she stood at the gate looking down at the glittering lights would they shine as brightly for her she wondered in twentyfour hours time it was so much to strive for so much to lose so wonderfully much to gain slowly her eyes travelled upwards the symbolism of those higher lights calmed her fear she drew a great sigh of happiness  felicia  she turned around with a soft little laugh  david     chapter xix  take me away   richard presented himself the next morning at the hotel de paris  cheero he exclaimed on being shown into hunterleys sittingroom all right up to date i see  hunterleys nodded he had just come in from the bank and held his letters in his hand richard seated himself on the edge of the table  i slept out on the yacht last night he said got up at six oclock and had a swim what about a round of golf at la turbie we can get down again by luncheontime before the people are about  afraid i cant hunterleys replied i have rather an important letter to go through carefully and a reply to think out  youre a queer chap you know richard went on you always seem to have something on but im hanged if i can see how you pass your time here in monte carlo this political business even if you do have to put in a bit of time at it now and then cant be going on all the while monte carlo too so far as the women are concerned they might as well be off the face of the earth and i dont think ive ever seen you make a bet at the tables how did your wife do last night i thought she seemed to be dropping it rather  i think that she lost hunterleys replied indifferently her gambling however is like mine i imagine on a fairly negligible scale  richard whistled softly  well i dont know he observed i saw her going for maximums yesterday pretty steadily a few thousands doesnt last very long at that little game  hunterleys smiled  a few thousands he repeated i dont suppose violet has ever lost or won a hundred pounds in her life  richard abandoned the subject quickly he was obliged to tell himself that it was not his business to interfere between husband and wife  say hunterleys he suggested do you think i could do something for the crowd on my little boata luncheon party or a cruise eh  i should think every one would enjoy it immensely hunterleys answered  i can count on you of course if i arrange anything  i am afraid not hunterleys regretted i am too much engrossed now to make any arrangements  im hanged if you dont get more mysterious every moment richard exclaimed vigorously whats it all about cant you even be safe in your room for five minutes without keeping one of those little articles under your newspaper while you read your letters he added lifting with his stick the sheet which hunterleys had hastily thrown over a small revolver whats it all about eh are you plotting to dethrone the prince of monaco and take his place  not exactly that hunterleys replied a little wearily lane old fellow youre much better off not to know too much i have told you that theres a kind of international conference going on about here and ive sort of been pitchforked into the affair over in your country you dont know much about this sort of thing but since ive been out of harness ive done a good deal of what really amounts to secret service work one must serve ones country somehow or other you know if one gets the chance  richard was impressed  gee he exclaimed the sort of thing that one reads about eh and only half believes whos the french johnny who arrived last night  douaille hes the coming president they say im thinking of paying him a visit of ceremony this afternoon  there was a knock at the door a waiter entered with a note upon a salver  from madame monsieur he announced presenting it to hunterleys  the latter tore it open and read the few lines hastily       dear henry       if you could spare a few minutes i should be glad if you would      come round to my apartment       yours      violet  hunterleys twisted the note up in his fingers  tell lady hunterleys that i will be round in a few moments he instructed the servant  richard took up his stick and hat  if you have an opportunity he said ask lady hunterleys what she thinks about a little party on the yacht if one could get the proper people together  ill tell her hunterleys promised youd better wait till i get back  he made his way to the other wing of the hotel for the first time since he had been staying there he knocked at the door of his wifes apartments her maid admitted him with a smile he found violet sitting in the little salon before a writingtable the apartment was luxuriously furnished and filled with roses somehow or other their odour irritated him she rose from her place and hastened towards him  how nice of you to come so promptly she exclaimed youre sure it didnt inconvenience you  not in the least he replied i was only talking to richard lane  you seem to have taken a great fancy to that young man all at once she remarked  hunterleys was sitting upon the arm of an easychair he had picked up one of violets slippers and was balancing it in his hand  oh i dont know he is rather refreshing after some of these people he still has enthusiasms and his love affair is quite a poem arent you up rather early this morning  i couldnt sleep she sighed i think it has come to me in the night that i am sick of this place i wondered  she hesitated he bent the slipper slowly back waiting for her to proceed  the draconmeyers dont want to go she went on they are here for another month at least linda would miss me terribly i suppose but i have really given her a lot of my time i have spent several hours with her every day since we arrived and i dont know what it isperhaps my bad luck for one thingbut i have suddenly taken a dislike to the place i wondered  she had picked up one of the roses from a vase close at hand and was twirling it between her fingers for some reason or other she seemed ill at ease hunterleys watched her silently she was very pale but since his coming a slight tinge of pink colour had stolen into her cheeks she had received him in a very fascinating garment of blue silk which was really only a dressinggown it seemed to him a long time since he had seen her in so intimate a fashion  i wondered she concluded at last almost abruptly whether you would care to take me away  he was for a moment bereft of words somehow or other he had been so certain that she had sent to him to ask for more money that he had never even considered any other eventuality  take you away he repeated do you really mean take you back to london violet  just anywhere you like she replied i am sick of this place and of everything i am weary to death of trying to keep linda cheerfulyou dont realise how depressing it is to be with her andand every one seems to have got a little on my nerves mr draconmeyer she added a little defiantly raising her eyes to his has been most kind and delightful butsomehow i want to get away  he sat down on the edge of a couch she seated herself at the further end of it  violet he said you have taken me rather by surprise  well you dont mind being taken by surprise once in a while do you she asked a little petulantly you know i am capriciousyou have told me so often enough here is a proof of it take me back to london or to paris or wherever you like  he was almost overwhelmed it was unfortunate that she had chosen that moment to look away and could not see therefore the light which glowed in his eyes  violet he assured her earnestly there is nothing in the world i should like so much i would beg you to have your trunks packed this morning but unfortunately i cannot leave monte carlo just now  cannot leave monte carlo she repeated derisively why my dear man you are a fish out of water here you dont gamble you do nothing but moon about and go to the opera and worry about your silly politics what on earth do you mean when you say that you cannot leave monte carlo  i mean just what i say he replied i cannot leave monte carlo for several days at any rate  she looked at him blankly a little incredulously  you have talked like this before henry she said and it is all too absurd you must tell me the truth now you can have no business here you are travelling for pleasure you can surely leave a place or not at your own will  it happens he sighed that i cannot will you please be very kind violet and not ask me too much about this if there is anything else i can do he went on hesitatingly if you will give me a little more of your time if you will wait with me for a few days longer  cant you understand she interrupted impatiently that it is just this very moment this instant that i want to get away something has gone wrong i want to leave monte carlo i am not sure that i ever want to see it again and i want you to take me please  she held out her hands swaying a little towards him he gripped them in his she yielded to their pressure until their lips almost met  youll take me away this morning she whispered  i cannot do that he replied but violet  she snatched herself away from him an ungovernable fit of fury seemed to have seized her she stood in the centre of the room and stamped her foot  you cannot she repeated and you will not give me a reason very well i have done my best i have made my appeal i will stay in monte carlo then i will  there was a knock at the door  come in she cried who is it  the door was softly opened draconmeyer stood upon the threshold he looked from one to the other in some surprise  i am sorry he murmured please excuse me  come in mr draconmeyer she called out to his retreating figure come in please how is linda this morning  draconmeyer smiled a little ruefully as he returned  complaining he replied as usual i am afraid that she has had rather a bad night she is going to try and sleep for an hour or two i came to see if you felt disposed for a motor ride this morning  i should love it she assented i should like to start as soon as possible henry was just going werent you she added turning to her husband  he stood his ground  there was something else i wished to say he declared glancing at draconmeyer  the latter moved at once towards the door but violet stopped him  not now she begged if there is really anything else henry you can send up a note or i dare say we shall meet at the club tonight now please both of you go away i must change my clothes for motoring in half an hour mr draconmeyer  the car will be ready he answered  hunterleys hesitated he looked for a moment at violet she returned his glance of appeal with a hard fixed stare then she turned away  susanne she called to her maid who was in the inner room i am dressing at once i will show you what to put out  she disappeared closing the connecting door behind her the two men walked out to the lift in silence draconmeyer rang the bell  you are not leaving monte carlo at present then sir henry he remarked  not at present hunterleys replied calmly  they parted without further speech hunterleys returned to his room where richard was still waiting  say have you got a valet here with you the young man enquired  hunterleys shook his head  never possessed such a luxury in my life he declared  chap came in here directly you were gonemumbled something about doing something for you i didnt altogether like the look of him so i sat on the table and watched he hung around for a moment and then when he saw that i was sticking it out he went off  was he wearing the hotel livery hunterleys asked quickly  plain black clothes richard replied he looked the valet right enough  hunterleys rang the bell it was answered by a servant in grey livery  are you the valet on this floor hunterleys enquired  yes sir  there was a man in here just now said he was my valet or something of the sort hung around for a minute or two and then went away who was he  the servant shook his head he was apparently a german and stupid  there are no valets on this floor except myself he declared  then who could this person have been hunterleys demanded  a tailor perhaps the man suggested but he would not come unless you had ordered him i have been on duty all the time i have seen no one about  very well hunterleys said ill report the matter in the office  some hotel thief i suppose lane remarked as soon as the door was closed he didnt look like it exactly though  hunterleys frowned  not much here to satisfy any ones curiosity he observed just as well you were in the room though  surrounded by mysteries arent you old chap richard yawned lighting a cigarette  i dont know exactly about that hunterleys replied but ill tell you one thing lane there are things going on in monte carlo at the present moment which would bring out the black headlines on the halfpenny papers if they had an inkling of them there are people here who are trying to draw up a new map of europe a new map of the world  richard shook his head  i cant get interested in anything hunterleys he declared you could tell me the most amazing things in the world and theyd pass in at one ear and out at the other kind of a blithering idiot eh you know what i did last night after dinner if youll believe me when i got to the villa i found the place patrolled as though they were afraid of dynamiters i skulked round to the back got on the beach and climbed a little way up towards the rock garden i hid there and waited to see if shed come out on the terrace she never came but i caught a glimpse of her passing from one room to another and i tell you im such a poor sort of an idiot that i felt repaid for waiting there all that time i shall go there again tonight the boys wanted me to dineeddy lanchester and montressor and that lota jolly party too i shant do it i shall have a mouthful alone somewhere and spend the rest of the evening on those rocks somethings got to come of this hunterleys  lets go into the lounge for a few moments hunterleys suggested i may as well hear all about it  they made their way downstairs and sat there talking or rather hunterleys listened while richard talked then draconmeyer strolled across the hall and waited by the lift presently he returned with violet by his side followed by her maid carrying rugs as they approached hunterleys rose slowly to his feet violet was looking up into her companions face talking and laughing she either did not see hunterleys or affected not to he stood for a moment irresolute then as she passed she glanced at him quite blankly and waved her hand to richard the two disappeared hunterleys resumed his seat he had somehow or other the depressing feeling of a man who has lost a great opportunity  lady hunterleys looks well this morning lane remarked absolutely unconscious of anything unusual  hunterleys watched the car drive off before he answered  she looks very well he assented gloomily     chapter xx  wily mr draconmeyer   they had skirted the wonderful bay and climbed the mountainous hill to the frontier before violet spoke all the time draconmeyer leaned back by her side perfectly content a man of varied subtleties he understood and fully appreciated the intrinsic value of silence whilst the customs officer however was making out the deposit note for the car she turned to him  will you tell me something mr draconmeyer  of course  it is about my husband she went on henry isnt your friendyou dislike one another i know you men seem to have a sort of freemasonry which compels you to tell falsehoods about one another but in this case i am going to remind you that i have the greater claim and i am going to ask you for the sober truth henry has once or twice during the last few days hinted to me that his presence in monte carlo just now has some sort of political significance he is very vague about it all but he evidently wants me to believe that he is staying here against his own inclinations now i want to ask you a plain question is it likely that he could have any business whatever to transact for the government in monte carlo what i mean is could there possibly be anything to keep him in this place which for political reasons he couldnt tell me about  i can answer your question finally so far as regards any government business mr draconmeyer assured her your husbands party is in opposition as a keen politician he would not be likely to interest himself in the work of his rival  you are quite sure she persisted you are quite sure that he could not have a mission of any sortthat there isnt any meeting of diplomatists here in which he might be interested  mr draconmeyer smiled with the air of one listening to a childs prattle  if i were not sure that you are in earnest he began however i will just answer your question nothing of the sort is possible besides people dont come to monte carlo for serious affairs you know  her face hardened a little  i suppose she said that you are quite sure of what you told me the other evening about this young singerfelicia roche  i should not allude to a matter of that sort he declared unless i had satisfied myself as to the facts it is true that i owe nothing to your husband and everything to you or i should have probably remained silent as it is all that i know is at your service felicia roche is to make her d√©but at the opera house tonight your husband has been seen with her repeatedly he was at her villa at one oclock this morning i have heard it said that he is a little infatuated  thank you she murmured that is quite enough  the formalities were concluded and the car drove on they paused at the last turn to gaze downward at the wonderful viewthe gorgeous bay of mentone a thousand feet below with its wealth of mimosaembosomed villas monte carlo glittering on the seaboard the sweep of monaco redroofed picturesque and behind the mountains further away still the dim snowcapped heights violet looked as she was bidden but her eyes seemed incapable of appreciation when the car moved on she leaned back in her seat and dropped her veil she was paler even than when they had started  i am going to talk to you very little he said gravely i want you just to rest and breathe this wonderful air if my reply to your question troubles you i am sorry but you had to know it some day it is a wrench of course but you must have guessed it your husband is a man of peculiar temperament but no man could have refused such an offer as you made him unless there had been some special reason for itno man in the world  there was a little tremble in his tone artistic and not overdone somehow she felt that his admiration ministered to her selfrespect she permitted his hand to remain upon hers the touch of her fingers very nearly brought the torrent from his lips he crushed the words down however it was too great a risk very soon things would be different he could afford to wait  they drove on to san remo and turned into the hotel  you are better away from monte carlo for a few hours he decided we will lunch here and drive back afterwards you will feel greatly refreshed  she accepted his suggestion without enthusiasm and with very little show of pleasure they found a table on the terrace in a retired corner surrounded with flowering cactus plants and drooping mimosa and overhung by a giant oleander tree he talked to her easily but in gossiping fashion only and always with the greatest respect it was not until the arrival of their coffee that he ventured to become at all personal  will you forgive me if i talk without reserve for a few moments he began leaning a little towards her you have your troubles i know may i not remind you that you are not alone in your sorrows linda as you know has no companionship whatever to offer she does nothing but indulge in fretful regrets over her broken health when i remember too how lonely your days are and think of your husband and what he might make of them then i cannot help realising with absolute vividness the supreme irony of fate here am i craving for nothing so much on earth as the sympathy the affection ofshall i say such a woman as you and your husband who might have the best remains utterly indifferent content with something far below the second best and there is so much in life too he went on regretfully i cannot tell you how difficult it is for me to sit still and see you worried about such a trifle as money fancy the joy of giving you money  she awoke a little from her lethargy she looked at him startled  you havent told me yet he added how the game went last night  i lost every penny of that thousand pounds she declared that is why i sent for my husband this morning and asked him to take me back to england i am getting afraid of the place my luck seems to have gone for ever  he laughed softly  that doesnt sound like you he observed besides what does it matter write me out some more cheques when we get back date them this year or next or the year afterit really doesnt matter a bit my fortune is at your disposal if it amuses you to lose a thousand pounds in the afternoon and twice as much at night pray do  she laughed at him there was a certain glamour about his words which appealed to her fancy  why you talk like a prince she murmured and yet you know how impossible it is  is it he asked quietly  she rose abruptly from her place there was something wrongshe felt it in the atmospheresomething that was almost choking her  let us go back she insisted  he ordered the car without another word and they started off homewards it was not until they were nearing monte carlo that he spoke of anything save the slightest topics  you must have a little more money he told her in a matteroffact tone that is a necessity there is no need to worry your husband i shall go and bring you a thousand pounds you can give me the cheques later  she sat looking steadfastly ahead of her she seemed to see her numbers spread out before her to hear the click of the ball the croupiers voice the thrill of victory  i have taken more money from you than i meant to already mr draconmeyer she protested does linda know how much you have lent me  he shrugged his shoulders  what is the use of telling her she does not understand she has never felt the gambling fever the joy of it the excitement she would not be strong enough you and i understand i have felt it in the moneymarkets of the world where one plays with millions where a mistake might mean ruin that is why the tables seem dull for me but all the same it comes home to me  she felt the fierce stimulus of anxious thought she knew very well that notwithstanding his quiet manner she had reason to fear the man who sat by her side she feared his selfrestraint she feared the light which sometimes gleamed in his eyes when he fancied himself unobserved he gave her no cause for complaint all the time his behaviour had been irreproachable and yet she felt somehow or other like a bird who is being hunted by a trapper a trapper who knows his business who goes about it with quiet confidence with absolute certainty there was something like despair in her heart  well i suppose i shall have to stay here she said and i cant stay here without playing i will take a thousand more if you will lend it to me  you shall have it directly we get to the hotel he told her dont hurry with the cheques and dont date them too soon remember that you must have something to live on when you get back  i am going to win she declared confidently i am going to win enough to pay you back every penny  i wont say that i hope not he observed for your sake but it will certainly give me no pleasure to have the money back again you are such a wonderful person he added dropping his voice that i rather like to feel that i can be a little useful to you  they had neared the end of their journey and mr draconmeyer touched her arm a faint smile was playing about his lips certainly the fates were befriending him he said nothing but her eyes followed the slight motion of his head coming down the steps from ciros were her husband and felicia roche violet looked at them for a moment then she turned her head away  most inopportune she sighed with a little attempt at gaiety shall we meet later at the club  assuredly mr draconmeyer replied i will send the money to your room  thank you once more she said and thank you too for my drive i have enjoyed it very much i am very glad indeed that i had the courage to make you tell me the truth  i hope he whispered as he handed her out that you will never lack the courage to ask me anything     chapter xxi  assassination   selingman a large cigar between his lips and a happy smile upon his face stood in the square before the casino watching the pigeons he had just enjoyed an excellent lunch he was exceedingly pleased with a new light grey suit which he was wearing and his one unsatisfied desire was for companionship draconmeyer was away motoring with lady hunterleys mr grex was spending the early part of the day in conclave with their visitor from france and mademoiselle nipon had gone to nice for the day selingman had been left to his own devices and was beginning to find time hang upon his hands conversation and companionship were almost as great necessities with him as wine he beamed upon the pigeons and looked around at the people dotted about in chairs outside the caf√© de paris hoping to find an acquaintance it chanced however that he saw nothing but strangers then his eyes fell upon a man who was seated with folded arms a short distance away a man of respectable but somewhat gloomy appearance dressed in dark clothes with pale cheeks and cavernous eyes selingman strolled towards him  how go things friend allen he enquired dropping his voice a little  the man glanced uneasily around there was however no one in his immediate vicinity  badly he admitted  still no success eh selingman asked drawing up a chair and seating himself  the man is secretive by nature was the gloomy reply one would imagine that he knew he was being watched everything which he receives in the way of a written communication is at once torn up he is the most difficult order of person to deal withhe is methodical he has only the hotel valet to look after his things but everything is always in its place yesterday i went through his wastepaper basket i took home the contents but the pieces were no larger than sixpences i was able to put together one envelope which he received yesterday morning which was franked on his majestys service and the postmark of which was downing street  selingman shook his head ponderously and then replied seriously  you must do better than that my sherlock holmesmuch better  i cant make bricks without straw allen retorted sullenly  there is always straw if one looks in the right place selingman insisted puffing away at his cigar what we want to discover is exactly how much does hunterleys know of certain operations of ours which are going on here he is on the watchthat i am sure of there is one known agent in the place and another suspected one and i am pretty certain that they are both working at his instigation what we want to get hold of is one of his letters to london  i have been in and out of his rooms at all hours the other said i have gone into the matter thoroughly so thoroughly that i have taken a situation with a firm of english tailors here and i am supposed to go out and tout for orders that gives me a free entr√©e to the hotel i have even had a commission from sir henry himself he gave me a coat to get some buttons sewn on i am practically free of his room but whats the good he doesnt even lead the monte carlo life he doesnt give one a chance of getting at him through a third person no notes from ladies no flower or jewelry bills not the shadow of an assignation the only photograph upon his table is a photograph of lady hunterleys  better not tell our friend draconmeyer that selingman observed smiling to himself well well you can do nothing but persevere allen we are not niggardly masters if a man fails through no fault of his own well we dont throw him into the street nothing parsimonious about us no need for you to sit about with a face as long as a fiddle because you cant succeed all at once we are the people to kick at it not you drink a little more wine my friend give yourself a liqueur after luncheon stick a cigar in your mouth and go and sit in the sunshine make friends with some of the ladies remember the sun will still shine and the music play in fifty years time but not for you come and see me when you want some more money  you are very kind sir the man replied i am going across to the hotel now sir henry has been about there most of the morning but he has just gone in to ciros to lunch so i shall have at least halfanhour  good luck to you selingman exclaimed heartily who knows but that the big things may come even this afternoon cheer up and try and make yourself believe that a letter may be lying on the table a letter he forgot to post or one sent round from the bank since he left i am hopeful for you this afternoon allen i believe you are going to do well come up and see me afterwards if you will i am going to my hotel to lie down for halfanhour i am not really tired but i have no friend here to talk with or anything to do and it is a wise economy of the human frame tonight mademoiselle will have returned just now every one has deserted me i will rest until six oclock au revoir friend allen au revoir  selingman climbed the hill and entered the hotel where he was staying he mounted to his room took off his coat at which he glanced admiringly for a moment and then hung up behind the door finally he pulled down the blinds and lay down to rest very soon he was asleep  the drowsy afternoon wore on through the open windows came the sound of carriages driven along the dusty way the shouts of the coachmen to their horses the jingling of bells the hooting of motor horns a lime tree whose leaves were stirred by the languorous breeze kept tapping against the window from a further distance came the faint muffled voices of promenaders and the echo of the guns from the tir du pigeons but through it all selingman lying on his back and snoring loudly slept he was awakened at last by the feeling that some one had entered the room he sat up and blinked  hullo he exclaimed  a man in the weird disguise of a motorcyclist was standing at the foot of the bed selingman continued to blink he was not wholly awake and his visitors appearance was unpleasant  who the devil are you he enquired  the visitor took off his disfiguring spectacles  jean couloisbehold was the soft reply  selingman raised himself and slid off the bed it had seemed rather like a dream he was wideawake now however  what do you want he asked what are you here for  jean coulois said nothing then very slowly from the inside pocket of his coat he drew a newspaper parcel it was long and narrow and in places there was a stain upon the paper selingman stared at it and stared back at jean coulois  what the mischief have you got there he demanded  coulois touched the parcel with his yellow forefinger selingman saw then that the stains were of blood  give me a towel his visitor directed i do not want this upon my clothes  selingman took a towel from the stand and threw it across the room  you mean he asked dropping his voice a little that it is finished  a quarter of an hour ago jean coulois answered triumphantly he had just come in from luncheon and was sitting at his writingtable it was cleverly donewonderfully it was all over in a momentnot a cry you came to the right place indeed and now i go to the country coulois continued i have a motorbicycle outside i make my way up into the hills to bury this little memento there is a farmhouse up in the mountains a lonely spot enough and a girl there who says what i tell her it may be as well to be able to say that i have been there for d√©jeuner these little things monsieurah well we who understand think of them and since i am here he added holding out his hand  selingman nodded and took out his pocketbook he counted out the notes in silence and passed them over the assassin dropped them into his pocket  au revoir monsieur le gros he exclaimed waving his hand we meet tonight i trust i will show you a new dancethe dance of death i shall call it i seem calm but i am on fire with excitement tonight i shall dance as though quicksilver were in my feet you must not miss it you must come monsieur  he closed the door behind him and swaggered off down the passage selingman stood for a moment perfectly still it was a strange thing but two big tears were in his eyes then he heaved a great sigh and shook his head  it is part of the game he said softly to himself all part of the game     chapter xxii  the wrong man   selingman came out into the sunlit streets very much as a man who leaves a dark and shrouded room the shock of tragedy was still upon him there was a little choke in his throat as he mingled with the careless pleasureloving throng mostly wending their way now towards the rooms or the terrace as he crossed the square towards the hotel de paris his steps grew slower and slower he looked at the building halffearfully beautifully dressed women men of every nationality were passing in and out all the time the commissionaire with his little group of satellites stood sunning himself on the lowest step a splendid complacent figure there was no sign there of the horror that was hidden within even while he looked up at the windows he felt a hand upon his arm draconmeyer had caught him up and had fallen into step with him  well dear philosopher he exclaimed why this subdued aspect has your solitary day depressed you  selingman turned slowly around draconmeyers eyes beneath his goldrimmed spectacles were bright he was carrying himself with less than his usual stoop he wore a red carnation in his buttonhole he was in spirits which for him were almost boisterous  have you been in there selingman asked in a low tone  draconmeyer glanced at the hotel and back again at his companion  in where he demanded in the hotel i left lady hunterleys there a short time ago i have been up to the bank since  you dont know yet then  know what  there was a momentary silence draconmeyer suddenly gripped his companion by the arm  go on he insisted tell me  its all over selingman exclaimed hoarsely jean coulois came to me a quarter of an hour ago it is finished damnation draconmeyer let go my arm  draconmeyer withdrew his fingers there was no longer any stoop about him at all he stood tall and straight his lips parted his face turned upwards upwards as though he would gaze over the roof of the hotel before which they were standing up to the skies  my god selingman he cried my god  the seconds passed then draconmeyer suddenly took his companion by the arm  come he said let us take that first seat in the gardens there let us talk somehow or other although i half counted upon this i scarcely believed let us sit down do you think it is known yet  very likely not selingman answered as they crossed the road and entered the gardens coulois found him in his rooms seated at the writingtable it was all over he declares in ten seconds he came to mewith the knife he was on his way to the mountains to hide it  they found a seat under a drooping lime tree they could still see the hotel and the level stretch of road that led past the postoffice and the club to monaco draconmeyer sat with his eyes fixed upon the hotel through which streams of people were still passing one of the undermanagers was welcoming the newcomers from a recently arrived train  you are right he murmured nothing is known yet very likely they will not know until the valet goes to lay out his clothes for dinner dead  selingman with one hand gripping the iron arm of the seat watched his companions face with a sort of fascinated curiosity there were beads of perspiration upon draconmeyers forehead but his expression in its way was curious there was no horror in his face no fear no shadow of remorse some wholly different sentiment seemed to have transformed the man he was younger more virile he seemed as though he could scarcely sit still  my friend selingman said i know that you are one of our children that you are one of those who have seen the truth and worked steadfastly for the great cause with the heart of a patriot and the unswerving fidelity of a strong man but tell me the honest truth there is something else in your lifeyou have some other feeling about this man hunterleys death  draconmeyer removed his eyes from the front of the hotel and turned slowly towards his companion there was a transfiguring smile upon his lips again he gave selingman the impression of complete rejuvenation of an elderly man suddenly transformed into something young and vigorous  there is something else selingman he confessed this is the moment when i dare speak of it i will tell you first of any living person there is a woman over there whom i have set up as an idol and before whose shrine i have worshipped there is a woman over there who has turned the dull paths of my life into a flowery way i am a patriot and i have worked for my country selingman as you have worked but i have worked also that i might taste for once before i die the great passion dont stare at me man remember i am not like you you can laugh your way through the world with a kiss here and a bow there a ribbon to your lips at night thrown to the winds in the morning i havent that sort of philosophy love doesnt come to me like that its set in my heart amongst the great things its set there side by side with the greatest of all  his wife selingman muttered  are you so colossal a fool as only to have guessed it at this moment draconmeyer continued contemptuously if he hadnt blundered across our path here if he hadnt been my political enemy i should still some day have taken him by the throat and killed him you dont know what risks i have been running he went on with a sudden hoarseness in her heart she half loves him still if he hadnt been a fool a prejudiced overconscientious stiffnecked fool i should have lost her within the last twentyfour hours i have had to fight and scheme as i have never fought and schemed before to keep them apart i have had to pick my way through shoals innumerable hold myself down when i have been burning to grip her by the wrists and tell her that all that a man could offer a woman was hers selingman this sounds like nonsense i suppose  no selingman murmured not nonsense but it doesnt sound like draconmeyer  well its finished draconmeyer declared with a great sigh of content you know now i enter upon the final stage i had only one fear jean coulois has settled that for me i wonder whether they know it seems peaceful enough no look over there he added gripping his companions arm peter the concierge is whispering with the others that is one of the managers there out on the pavement talking to them  selingman pointed down the road towards monaco  see he exclaimed there is a motorcar coming in a hurry i fancy that the alarm must have been given  a grey heavilybuilt car came along at a great pace and swung round in front of the hotel de paris the two men stood on the pavement and watched a tall officiallooking person with black upturned moustache in somber uniform and a peaked cap descended  the commissioner of police selingman whispered and that is a doctor who has just gone in he has been found  they crossed the road to the hotel the concierge removed his hat as they turned to enter to all appearances he was unchangedfat florid splendid draconmeyer stepped close to him  has anything happened here peter he asked i saw the commissioner of police arrive in a great hurry  the man hesitated it was obvious then that he was disturbed he looked to the right and to the left finally with a sigh of resignation he seemed to make up his mind to tell the truth  it is the english gentleman sir henry hunterleys he whispered he has been found stabbed to death in his room  dead draconmeyer demanded insistently  stone dead sir the concierge replied he was stabbed by some one who stole in through the bathroomthey say that he couldnt ever have moved again the commissioner of police is upstairs the ambulance is round at the back to take him off to the mortuary  selingman suddenly seized the man by the arm his eyes were fixed upon the topmost step violet stood there smiling down upon them she was wearing a black and white gown and a black hat with white ospreys it was the hour of five oclock tea and many people were passing in and out she came gracefully down the steps the two men remained speechless  i have been waiting for you mr draconmeyer she remarked smiling  draconmeyer remembered suddenly the packet of notes which he had been to fetch from the bank he tried to speak but only faltered selingman had removed his hat but he too seemed incapable of coherent speech she looked at them both astonished  whatever is the matter with you both she exclaimed who is coming with me to the club i decided to come this way round to see if i could change my luck that underground passage depresses me  draconmeyer moved up a couple of steps he was quite himself now grave but solicitous  lady hunterleys he said i am sorry but there has been a little accident i am afraid that your husband has been hurt if you will come back to your room for a minute i will tell you about it  all the colour died slowly from her face she swayed a little but when draconmeyer would have supported her she pushed him away  an accident she muttered i must go and see for myself  she turned and reentered the hotel swiftly draconmeyer caught her up in the hall  lady hunterleys he begged earnestly please take my advice i am your friend you know i want you to go straight to your room i will come with you i will explain to you then  i am going to henry she interrupted without even a glance towards him i am going to my husband at once i must see what has happened  she rang the bell for the lift which appeared almost immediately draconmeyer stepped in with her  lady hunterleys he persisted i beg of you to do as i ask let me take you to your rooms i will tell you all that has happened your husband will not be able to see you or speak with you  i shall not get out she declared when the lift boy in obedience to draconmeyers imperative order stopped at her floor if i may not go on in the lift i shall walk up the stairs i am going to my husband  he will not recognise you draconmeyer warned her i am very sorry indeed lady hunterleysi would spare you this shock if i couldbut you must be prepared for very serious things  they had reached the next floor now the boy opened the gate of the lift and she stepped out she looked pitifully at draconmeyer  you arent going to tell me that he is dead she moaned  i am afraid he is draconmeyer assented  she staggered across the landing pushing him away from her there were four or five people standing outside the door of hunterleys apartment she appealed to them  let me go in at once she ordered i am lady hunterleys  the door is locked one of the men declared  let me go in she insisted  she pushed them on one side and hammered at the door they could hear voices inside in a moment it was opened it was the commissioner of the police who stood theretall severe official  madame he exclaimed  i am his wife she cried let me inlet me in at once  she forced her way into the room something was lying on the bed covered with a sheet she looked at it and shrieked  madame the commissioner begged pray compose yourself a tragedy has happened in this roombut we are not sure can you be brave madame  i can she answered of what are you not sure  the commissioner turned down the sheet a few inches a mans face was visible a ghastly sight she looked at it and shrieked hysterically  is that your husband madame the commissioner asked quickly  thank god no she cried you are sure this is the man she went on her voice shaking with fierce excitement there is no one elsehurt no one else stabbed this is the man they told me was my husband  he was found there sitting at your husbands table madame the commissioner of police assured her there is no one else  she suddenly began to cry  it isnt henry she sobbed groping her way from the room take me downstairs please some one     chapter xxiii  trouble brewing   the ma√Ætre dh√¥tel had presented his bill the little luncheon party was almost over  so i take leave hunterleys remarked as he sat down his empty liqueur glass of one of my responsibilities in life  i think id like to remain a sort of half ward please felicia objected in case david doesnt treat me properly  if he doesnt hunterleys declared he will have me to answer to seriously i think you young people are very wise and very foolish and very much to be envied what does sidney say about it  felicia made a little grimace she glanced around but the tables near them were unoccupied  sidney is much too engrossed in his mysterious work to concern himself very much about anything she replied do you know that he has been out all night two nights this week already and he is making no end of preparations for today  hunterleys nodded  i know that he is very busy just now he assented gravely i must come up and talk to him this afternoon  we left him writing felicia said of course he declares that it is for his beloved newspaper but i am not sure he scarcely ever goes out in the daytime what can he have to write about davids work is strenuous enough and i have told him that if he turns war correspondent again i shall break it off  we all have our work to do in life hunterleys reminded her you have to sing in a√Øda tonight and you have to do yourself justice for the sake of a great many people your brother has his work to do also whatever the nature of it may be he has taken it up and he must go through with it it would be of no use his worrying for fear that you should forget your words or your notes tonight and there is no purpose in your fretting because there may be danger in what he has to do i promise you that so far as i can prevent it he shall take no unnecessary risks now if you like i will walk home with you young people if i shant be terribly in the way i know that sidney wants to see me  they left the restaurant a few minutes later and strolled up towards the town hunterleys paused outside a jewelers shop  and now for the important business of the day he declared i must buy you an engagement present on behalf of myself and all your guardians come in and help me choose both of you a girl who carries her gloves in her hand to show her engagement ring should have a better bag to hang from that little finger  you really are the most perfect person that ever breathed she sighed you know i dont deserve anything of the sort  they paid their visit to the jeweler and afterwards drove up to the villa in a little victoria sidney roche was hard at work in his shirtsleeves he greeted hunterleys warmly  glad youve come up he exclaimed the little girls told you the news i suppose  rather hunterleys replied i have been lunching with them on the strength of it  and look felicia cried holding out the gold bag which hung from her finger look how i am being spoiled  her brother sighed  awful nuisance for me he grumbled having to live with an engaged couple you couldnt clear out for a little time he suggested both of you i want to talk to hunterleys  well go and sit in the garden felicia assented i suppose i ought to rest david shall read my score to me  they passed out and roche closed the door behind them carefully  anything fresh hunterleys asked  nothing particular was the somewhat guarded reply that fellow frenhofer has been up here  frenhofer hunterleys repeated interrogatively  he is the only man i can rely upon at the villa mimosa roche explained i am afraid tonight its going to be rather a difficult job  i always feared it would be hunterleys agreed  frenhofer tells me roche continued that for some reason or other their suspicions have been aroused up there they are all on edge you know the house is cramfull of menservants and there are to be a dozen of them on duty in the grounds two or three of these fellows are nothing more or less than private detectives and they all of them know what theyre about or grex wouldnt have them  hunterleys looked grave  it sounds awkward he admitted  the general idea of the plot roche went on walking restlessly up and down the room you and i have already solved and by this time they know it in london but there are two things which i feel they may discuss tonight which are of vital importance the first is the date the second is the terms of the offer to douaille then of course more important perhaps than either of these is the matter of douailles general attitude towards the scheme  so far hunterleys remarked reflectively we havent the slightest indication of what that may be douaille came pledged to nothing he may after all stand firm  for the honour of his country let us hope so roche said solemnly yet i am sure of one thing they are going to make him a wonderful offer he may find himself confronted with a problem which some of the greatest statesmen in the world have had to face in their timeshall he study the material benefit of his country or shall he stand firm for her honour  its a great ethical question hunterleys declared too great for us to discuss now sidney tell me do you really mean to go on with this attempt of yours tonight  i must roche replied frenhofer wants me to give up the roof idea but there is nothing else worth trying he brought a fresh plan of the room with him there it lies on the table as you see the apartment where the meeting will take place is almost isolated from the rest of the house there is only one approach to it by a corridor leading from the hall the east and west sides will be patrolled on the south there is a little terrace but the approach to it is absolutely impossible there is a sheer drop of fifty feet on to the beach  you think they have no suspicion about the roof hunterleys asked doubtfully  not yet the pane of glass is cut out and my entrance to the house is arranged for frenhofer will tamper with the electric lights in the kitchen premises and i shall arrive in response to his telephonic message in the clothes of a workingman and with a bag of tools then he smuggles me on to the spiral stairway which leads out on to the roof where the flagstaff is i can crawl the rest of the way to my place the trouble is that notwithstanding the ledge around if it is a perfectly clear night just a fraction of my body however flat i lie might be seen from the ground  hunterleys studied the plan for a moment and shook his head  its a terrible risk this roche he said seriously  i know it the other admitted but what am i to do they keep sending me cipher messages from home to spare no effort to send further news as you know very well and two other fellows will be here the day after tomorrow to relieve me i must do what i can theres one thing felicias off my mind now bristons a good fellow and hell look after her  in the event of your capture hunterleys began  the tools i shall take with me roche interrupted are common housebreakers tools every shred of clothing i shall be wearing will be in keeping the ordinary garments of an ouvrier of the district if i am trapped it will be as a burglar and not as a spy of course if douaille opens the proceedings by declaring himself against the scheme i shall make myself scarce as quickly as i can  you were quite right when you said just now hunterleys observed that douaille will find himself in a difficult position there is no doubt but that he is an honest man on the other hand it is a political axiom that the first duty of any statesman is to his own people if they can make douaille believe that he is going to restore her lost provinces to france without the shedding of a drop of french blood simply at englands expense he will be confronted with a problem over which any man might hesitate he has had all day to think it over what he may decide is simply on the knees of the gods  roche sealed up the letter he had been writing and handed it to hunterleys  well he said i have left everything in order if theres any mysterious disappearance from here it will be the mysterious disappearance of a newspaper correspondent and nothing else  good luck then old chap hunterleys wished him if you pull through this time i think our job will be done ill tell them at headquarters that you deserve a years holiday  roche smiled a little queerly  dont forget he pointed out that it was you who scented out the whole plot ive simply done the scotland yard work the worst of our job is he added as he opened the door that we dont want holidays we are like drugged beings the thing gets hold of us i suppose if they gave me a holiday i should spend it in st petersburg thats where we ought to send our best men just now so long sir henry  they shook hands once more roches face was set in grim lines they were both silent for a moment it was the farewell of men whose eyes are fixed upon the great things  good luck to you hunterleys repeated fervently as he turned and walked down the tiled way     chapter xxiv  hunterleys scents murder   the concierge of the hotel de paris was a man of great stature and imposing appearance nevertheless when hunterleys crossed the road and climbed the steps to the hotel he seemed for a moment like a man reduced to pulp he absolutely forgot his usual dignified but courteous greeting with mouth a little open and knees which seemed to have collapsed he stared at this unexpected apparition as he came into sight and stared at him as he entered the hotel hunterleys glanced behind with a slight frown the incident inexplicable though it was would have passed at once from his memory but that directly he entered the hotel he was conscious of the very similar behaviour and attitude towards him of the chief reception clerk he paused on his way a little bewildered and called the man to him the clerk however was already rushing towards the office with his coattails flying behind him hunterleys crossed the floor and rang the bell for the lift directly he stepped in the lift man vacated his place and with his eyes nearly starting out of his head seemed about to make a rush for his life  come back here hunterleys ordered sternly take me up to my room at once  the man returned unsteadily and with marked reluctance he closed the gate touched the handle and the lift commenced to ascend  whats the matter with you all here hunterleys demanded irritably is there anything wrong with my appearance has anything happened  the man made a gesture but said absolutely nothing the lift had stopped he pushed open the door  monsieurs floor he faltered  hunterleys stepped out and made his way towards his room arrived there he was brought to a sudden standstill a gendarme was stationed outside  what the mischief are you doing here hunterleys demanded  the man saluted  by orders of the director of police monsieur  but that is my room hunterleys protested i wish to enter  no one is permitted to enter monsieur the man replied  hunterleys stared blankly at the gendarme  cant you tell me at least what has happened he persisted i am sir henry hunterleys that is my apartment why do i find it locked against me  by order of the director of the police monsieur was the parrotlike reply  hunterleys turned away impatiently at that moment the reception clerk who downstairs had fled at his approach returned bringing with him the manager of the hotel hunterleys welcomed the latter with an air of relief  monsieur picard he exclaimed what on earth is the meaning of this why do i find my room closed and this gendarme outside  monsieur picard was a tall man blackbearded immaculate in appearance and deportment with manners and voice of velvet yet he too had lost his wonderful imperturbability he waved away the floor waiter who had drawn near his manner was almost agitated  monsieur sir henry he explained an affair the most regrettable has happened in your room i have allotted to you another apartment upon the same floor your things have been removed there if you will come with me i will show it to you it is an apartment better by far than the one you have been occupying and the price is the same  but what on earth has happened in my room hunterleys demanded  monsieur the hotel manager replied some poor demented creature who has doubtless lost his all in your absence found his way there and committed suicide  found his way into my room hunterleys repeated but i locked the door before i went out i have the key in my pocket  he entered possibly through the bathroom the manager went on soothingly i am deeply grieved that monsieur should be inconvenienced in any way this is the apartment i have reserved for monsieur he added throwing open the door of a room at the end of the corridor it is more spacious and in every way more desirable monsieurs clothes are already being put away  hunterleys glanced around the apartment it was certainly of a far better type than the one he had been occupying and two of the floor valets were already busy with his clothes  monsieur will be well satisfied here i am sure the hotel manager continued may i be permitted to offer my felicitations and to assure you of my immense relief there was a rumourthe affair occurring in monsieurs apartmentthat the unfortunate man was yourself sir henry  hunterleys was thoughtful for a moment he began to understand the sensation which his appearance had caused other ideas too were crowding into his brain  look here monsieur picard he said of course i have no objection to the change of roomsthats all rightbut i should like to know a little more about the man who you say committed suicide in my apartment i should like to see him  monsieur picard shook his head  it would be a very difficult matter that monsieur he declared the laws of monaco are stringent in such affairs  that is all very well hunterleys protested but i cannot understand what he was doing in my apartment cant i go in just for a moment  impossible monsieur without the permission of the commissioner of police no one can enter that room  then i should like hunterleys persisted to see the commissioner of police  monsieur picard bowed  monsieur the commissioner is on the premises without a doubt i will instruct him of monsieur sir henrys desire  i shall be glad if you will do so at once hunterleys said firmly i will wait for him here  the manager made his escape and his relief was obvious hunterleys sat on the edge of the bed  do you know anything about this affair he asked the nearer of the two valets  the man shook his head  nothing at all monsieur he answered without pausing from his labours  how did the fellow get into my room  one knows nothing the other man muttered  hunterleys watched them for a few minutes at their labours  a nice intelligent couple of fellows you are he remarked pleasantly come heres a louis each now cant you tell me something about the affair  they came forward both looked longingly at the coins  monsieur the one he had first addressed regretted there is indeed nothing to be known at this hotel the wages are good it is the finest situation a man may gain in monte carlo or elsewhere but if anything like this happens there is to be silence one dares not break the rule  hunterleys shrugged his shoulders  all right he said i shall find out what i want to know in time  the men returned unwillingly to their tasks in a moment or two there was a knock at the door the commissioner of police entered accompanied by the hotel manager who at once introduced him  the commissioner of police is here sir henry he announced he will speak with you immediately  the official saluted  monsieur desires some information  i do hunterleys admitted i am told that a man has committed suicide in my room and i have heard no plausible explanation as to how he got there i want to see him it is possible that i may recognise him  the fellow is already identified the director of police declared i can satisfy monsieurs curiosity he was connected with a firm of english tailors here who sought business from the gentlemen in the hotel he had accordingly sometimes the entr√©e to their apartments the fellow is reported to have saved a little money and to have visited the tables he lost everything he came this morning about his business as usual but overcome by despair stabbed himself most regrettably in the apartments of monsieur  since you know all about him perhaps you can tell me his name hunterleys asked  james allen monsieur may recall him to his memory he was tall and of pale complexion respectablelooking but a man of discontented appearance the intention had probably been in his mind for some time  is there any objection to my seeing the body hunterleys enquired  the official shrugged his shoulders  but monsieur all is finished with the poor fellow the doctor has given his certificate he is to be removed at once he will be buried at nightfall  a very admirable arrangement without a doubt hunterleys observed and yet i should like as i remarked before to see the body you know who i amsir henry hunterleys i had a message from your department a day or two ago which i thought a little unfair  the commissioner sighed he ignored altogether the conclusion of hunterleys sentence  it is against the rules monsieur he regretted  then to whom shall i apply hunterleys asked because i may as well tell you at once that i am going to insist upon my request being granted i will tell you frankly my reason it is not a matter of curiosity at all i should like to feel assured of the fact that this man allen really committed suicide  but he is dead monsieur the commissioner protested  doubtless hunterleys agreed but there is also the chance that he was murdered isnt there  murdered  monsieur picard held up his hands in horror the commissioner of police smiled in derision  but monsieur the latter pointed out who would take the trouble to murder a povertystricken tailors assistant  and in my hotel too monsieur picard intervened  the thing is impossible the commissioner declared  beyond which it is ridiculous monsieur picard added  hunterleys sat quite silent for a moment  monsieur the commissioner he said presently and monsieur picard i recognise your point of view believe me that i appreciate it and that i am willing to a certain extent to acquiesce in it at the same time there are considerations in this matter which i cannot ignore i do not wish to create any disturbance or to make any statements likely to militate against the popularity of your wonderful hotel monsieur picard nevertheless for personal reasons only notwithstanding the verdict of your doctor i should like for one moment to examine the body  the commissioner of police was thoughtful for a moment  it shall be as monsieur desires he consented gravely bearing in mind what monsieur has said he added with emphasis  the three men left the room and passed down the corridor the gendarme in front of the closed door stood on one side the commissioner produced a key they all three entered the room and monsieur picard closed the door behind them underneath a sheet upon the bed was stretched the figure of a man hunterleys stepped up to it turned down the sheet and examined the prostrate figure then he replaced the covering reverently  yes he said that is the man who has called upon me for orders from the english tailors his name i believe was as you say allen but can you tell me monsieur the commissioner how it was possible for a man to stab himself from the shoulder downwards through the heart  the official extended his hands  monsieur he declared it is not for us the doctor has given his certificate  hunterleys smiled a little grimly  i have always understood he observed that things were managed like this you may have confidence in me monsieur the commissioner and you monsieur picard i shall not tell the world what i suspect but for your private information i will tell you that this man was probably murdered by an assassin who sought my life you observe that there is a certain resemblance  the hotel proprietor turned pale  murdered he exclaimed impossible a murder hereunheard of  the commissioner dismissed the whole thing airily with a wave of his hand  the doctor has signed the certificate he repeated  and i hunterleys added as he led the way out of the room am more than satisfiedi am grateful so there is nothing more to be said     chapter xxv  draconmeyer is desperate   draconmeyer stood before the window of his room looking out over the mediterranean there was no finer view to be obtained from any suite in the hotel and monte carlo had revelled all that day in the golden transfiguring sunshine yet he looked as a blind man his eyes saw nothing of the blue sea or the brownsailed fishing boats nor did he once glance towards the picturesque harbour he saw only his own future the shattered pieces of his carefullythoughtout scheme the first fury had passed his brain was working now in her room below lady hunterleys was lying on the couch half hysterical three times she had sent for her husband if he should return at that moment draconmeyer knew that the game was up there would be no bandying words between them no involved explanations no possibility of any further misunderstanding all his little tissue of lies and misrepresentations would crumble hopelessly to pieces the one feeling in her heart would be thankfulness she would open her arms he saw the end with fatal unerring truthfulness  his servant returned draconmeyer waited eagerly for his message  lady hunterleys is lying down sir the man announced she is very much upset and begs you to excuse her  draconmeyer waved the man away and walked up and down the apartment his hands behind his back his lips hardset he was face to face with a crisis which baffled him completely and yet which he felt to be wholly unworthy of his powers his brain had never been keener his sense of power more inspiring yet he had never felt more impotent it was womans hysteria against which he had to fight the ordinary weapons were useless he realised quite well her condition and the dangers resulting from it the heart of the woman was once more beating to its own natural tune if hunterleys should present himself within the next few minutes not all his ingenuity nor the power of his millions could save the situation  plans shaped themselves almost automatically in his mind he passed from his own apartments through a connecting door into a large and beautifullyfurnished salon a woman with grey hair and white face was lying on a couch by the window she turned her head as he entered and looked at him questioningly her face was fragile and her features were sharpened by suffering she looked at her husband almost as a cowed but still affectionate animal might look towards a stern master  do you feel well enough to walk as far as lady hunterleys apartment with the aid of my arm he asked  of course she replied does violet want me  she is still feeling the shock draconmeyer said i think that she is inclined to be hysterical it would do her good to have you talk with her  the nurse who had been sitting by her side assisted her patient to rise she leaned on her husbands arm in her other hand she carried a black ebony walkingstick they traversed the corridor knocked at the door of lady hunterleys apartment and in response to a somewhat hesitating invitation entered violet was lying upon the sofa she looked up eagerly at their coming  linda she exclaimed how dear of you i thought that it might have been henry she added as though to explain the disappointment in her tone  draconmeyer turned away to hide his expression  talk to her as lightly as possible he whispered to his wife but dont leave her alone i will come back for you in ten minutes  he left the two women together and descended into the hall he found several of the reception clerks whispering together the concierge had only just recovered himself but the place was beginning to wear its normal aspect he whispered an enquiry at the desk sir henry hunterleys had just come in and had gone upstairs he was told his new room was number 148  there was a note from his wife draconmeyer said trying hard to control his voice has he had it  it is here still sir the clerk replied i tried to catch sir henry as he passed through but he was too quick for me to tell you the truth he went on there has been a rumour through the hotel that it was sir henry himself who had been found dead in his room and seeing him come in was rather a shock for all of us  naturally draconmeyer agreed if you will give me the note i will take it up to him  the clerk handed it over without hesitation draconmeyer returned immediately to his own apartments and torn open the envelope there were only a few words scrawled across the halfsheet of notepaper       henry come to me dear at once i have had such a shock i want      to see you       vi  he tore the note viciously into small pieces then he went back to lady hunterleys apartments she was sitting up now in an easychair once more at the sound of the knock she looked towards the door eagerly her face fell when draconmeyer entered  have you heard anything about henry she asked anxiously  he came back a few minutes ago draconmeyer replied and has gone out again  gone out again  draconmeyer nodded  i think that he has gone round to the club he is a man of splendid nerve your husband he seemed to treat the whole affair as an excellent joke  a joke she repeated blankly  this sort of thing happens so often in monte carlo he observed in a matteroffact tone the hotel people seem all to look upon it as in the days work  i wonder if henry had my note she faltered  he was reading one in the hall when i saw him draconmeyer told her that would be yours i should think he left a message at the desk which was doubtless meant for you he has gone on to the sporting club for an hour and will probably be back in time to change for dinner  violet sat quite still for several moments something seemed to die slowly out of her face presently she rose to her feet  i suppose she said that i am very foolish to allow myself to be upset like this  it is quite natural draconmeyer assured her soothingly what you should try to do is to forget the whole circumstance you sit here brooding about it until it becomes a tragedy let us go down to the club together we shall probably see your husband there  she hesitated she seemed still perplexed  i wonder she murmured could i send another message to him perhaps he didnt quite understand  much better come along to the club draconmeyer advised goodhumouredly you can be there yourself before a message could reach him  very well she assented i will be ready in ten minutes  draconmeyer took his wife back to her room  did i do as you wished dear she asked him anxiously  absolutely he replied  he helped her back to her couch and stooped and kissed her she leaned back wearily it was obvious that she had found the exertion of moving even so far exhausting then he returned to his own apartments rapidly he unlocked his dispatch box and took out one or two notes from violet they were all of no importanceanswers to invitations or appointments he spread them out took a sheet of paper and a broad pen without hesitation he wrote       congratulations on your escape but why do you run such risks i      wish you would go back to england       violet  he held the sheet of notepaper a little away from him and looked at it critically the imitation was excellent he thrust the few lines into an envelope addressed them to hunterleys and descended to the hall he left the note at the office  send this up to sir henry will you he instructed let him have it as quickly as possible  once more he crossed the hall and waited close to the lift by which she would descend all the time he kept on glancing nervously around things were going his way but the great danger remainedif they should meet first by chance in the corridor or in the lift hunterleys might think it his duty to go at once to his wifes apartment in case she had heard the rumour of his death the minutes dragged by he had climbed the great ladder slowly more than once he had felt it sway beneath his feet yet to him those moments seemed almost the longest of his life then at last she came she was looking very pale but to his relief he saw that she was dressed for the club she was wearing a grey dress and black hat he remembered with a pang of fury that grey was her husbands favourite colour  i suppose there is no doubt that henry is at the club she asked looking eagerly around the hall  not the slightest he assured her we can have some tea there and we are certain to come across him somewhere  she made no further difficulty as they turned into the long passage he gave a sigh of relief every step they took meant safety he talked to her as lightly as possible ignoring the fact that she scarcely replied to him they mounted the stairs and entered the club she looked anxiously up and down the crowded rooms  i shall stroll about and look for henry she announced  very well he agreed i will go over to your place and see how the numbers are going  he stood by the roulette table but he watched her covertly she passed through the baccarat room came out again and walked the whole length of the larger apartment she even looked into the restaurant beyond then she came slowly back to where draconmeyer was standing she seemed tired she scarcely even glanced at the table  lady hunterleys he exclaimed impressively this is positively wicked your twentynine has turned up twice within the last few minutes do sit down and try your luck and i will go and see if i can find your husband  he pushed a handful of plaques and a bundle of notes into her hand at that moment the croupiers voice was heard  quatorze rouge pair et manque  another of my numbers she murmured with a faint show of interest i dont think i want to play though  try just a few coups he begged you see there is a chair here you may not have a chance again for hours  he was using all his will power somehow or other she found herself seated in front of the table the sight of the pile of plaques and the roll of notes was inspiring she leaned across and with trembling fingers backed number fourteen en plein with all the carr√©s and chevaux she was playing the game at which she had lost so persistently he walked slowly away every now and then from a distance he watched her she was winning and losing alternately but she had settled down now in earnest he breathed a great sigh of relief and took a seat upon a divan whence he could see if she moved richard lane who had been standing at the other side of the table crossed the room and came over to him  say do you know where sir henry is he enquired  draconmeyer shook his head  i have scarcely seen him all day  i think ill go round to the hotel and look him up lane decided carelessly im fed up with this  he stopped short he was no longer an exceedingly bored and discontentedlooking young man draconmeyer glanced at him curiously he felt a thrill of sympathy this stolid young man then was capable of feeling something of the same emotion as was tearing at his own heartstrings lane was gazing with transfigured face towards the open doorway     chapter xxvi  extraordinary lovemaking   fedora sauntered slowly around the rooms leaning over and staking a gold plaque here and there she was dressed as usual in white with an ermine turban hat and stole and an enormous muff her hair seemed more golden than ever beneath its snowwhite setting and her complexion more dazzling she seemed utterly unconscious of the admiration which her appearance evoked and she passed lane without apparently observing him a moment afterwards however he moved to her side and addressed her  quite a lucky coup of yours that last miss grex are you used to winning en plein like that  she turned her head and looked at him her eyebrows were ever so slightly uplifted her expression was chilling he remained however absolutely unconscious of any impending trouble  i was sorry not to find you at home this morning he continued i brought my little racing car round for you to see i thought you might have liked to try her  how absurd you are she murmured you must know perfectly well that it would have been quite impossible for me to come out with you alone  but why  she sighed  you are quite hopeless or you pretend to be  if i am he replied it is because you wont explain things to me properly the tables are much too crowded to play comfortably wont you come and sit down for a few minutes  she hesitated lane watched her anxiously he felt somehow that a great deal depended upon her reply presently with the slightest possible shrug of the shoulders she turned around and suffered him to walk by her side to the little antechamber which divided the gambling rooms from the restaurant  very well she decided i suppose after all one must remember that you did save us from a great deal of inconvenience the other night i will talk to you for a few minutes  he found her an easychair and he sat by her side  this is bully he declared  is what she asked once more raising her eyebrows  american slang he explained penitently i am sorry i meant that it was very pleasant to be here alone with you for a few minutes  you may not find it so after all she said severely i feel that i have a duty to perform  well dont lets bother about that yet if it means a lecture he begged you shall tell me how much better the young women of your country behave than the young women of mine  thank you she replied i am never interested in the doings of a democracy your country makes no appeal to me at all  come he protested thats a little too bad why russia may be a democracy some day you know you very nearly had a republic foisted upon you after the japanese war  you are quite mistaken she assured him russia would never tolerate a republic  russia will some day have to do like many other countries he answered firmlyobey the will of the people  russia has nothing in common with other countries she asserted there was never a nation yet in which the aristocracy was so powerful  its only a matter of time he declared nonchalantly  she shrugged her shoulders  you represent ideas of which i do not approve she told him  i dont care a fig about any ideas he replied i dont care much about anything in the world except you  she turned her head slowly and looked at him its angle was supercilious her tone frigid  that sort of a speech may pass for polite conversation in your country mr lane we do not understand it in mine  dont your men ever tell your women that they love them he asked bluntly  if they are of the same order she said if the thing is at all possible it may sometimes be done marriage however is more a matter of alliance with us our servants i believe are quite promiscuous in their lovemaking  he was silent for a moment she may perhaps have felt some compunction she spoke to him a little more kindly  we cannot help the ideas of the country in which we are brought up you know mr lane  of course not he agreed i understand that perfectly i was just thinking though what a lot i shall have to teach you  she was momentarily aghast she recovered herself quickly however  are all the men of your nation so selfconfident  we have to be he told her its the only way we can get what we want  and do you always succeed in getting what you want  always  then unless you wish to be an exception she advised let me beg you not to try for anything beyond your reach  there is nothing he declared firmly beyond my reach you are trying to discourage me it isnt any use i am not a prince or a duke or anything like that although my ancestors were honest enough i believe i havent any trappings of that sort to offer you if you are as sensible as i think you are you wont mind that when you come to think it over the only thing i am ashamed of is my money because i didnt earn it for myself you can live in palaces still if you want to and if you want to be a queen ill ferret out a kingdom somewhere and buy it but i am afraid youll have to be mrs lane behind it all you know  you really are the most intolerable person she exclaimed biting her lip how can i get these absurd ideas out of your mind  by telling me honestly looking in my eyes all the time that you could never care for me a little bit however devoted i was he answered promptly you wont be able to do it ive only one belief in life about these things and that is that when any one cares for a girl as i care for you its absolutely impossible for her to be wholly indifferent it isnt much to start with i know but the rest will come be honest with me is there any one of the men of your country whom you have met whom you want to marry  she frowned slightly she found herself at that moment comparing him with certain young men of her acquaintance she was astonished to realise that the comparison was all in his favour it was for her an extraordinary moment she had indeed been brought up in palaces and the men whom she had known had been reckoned the salt of the earth yet at that crisis she was most profoundly conscious that not all the glamour of those highsounding names the picturesque interest of those gorgeous uniforms nor the men themselves magnificent in their way were able to make the slightest appeal to her she remembered some of her own bitter words when an alliance with one of them had been suggested to her it was she then who had been the first to ignore the divine heritage of birth who had spoken of their drinking habits pointed to their life of idle luxury and worse than luxury the man who was at the present moment her suitor forced himself upon her recollection she knew quite well that he represented a type they were of the nobility and they seemed to her in that one poignant but unwelcome moment hatefully degenerate men no selfrespecting girl could ever think of family influence stern parental words the call of her order had half crushed these thoughts they came back now however with persistent force  you see richard lane went on it maynt be much that i have to offer you but in your heart i know you feel what it means to be offered the love of a man who doesnt want you just because you are of his order or because you are the daughter of a personage or for any other reason than because he cares for you as he has cared for no other woman on earth and because without knowing it he has waited for you  she moved restlessly in her chair their conversation was not going in the least along the lines which she had intended she suddenly remembered her own disquiet of the day before her curious longing to steal off on some excuse today a week ago she would have been content to have dawdled away the afternoon in the grounds of the villa something different had come from the moment she had entered the rooms although she had never acknowledged it she had been conscious pleasurably conscious of his presence she was suddenly uneasy  i am afraid she murmured that you are quite hopeless  if you mean that i am without hope you are wrong he answered sturdily from the moment i met you i have had but one thought and until the last day of my life i shall have but one thought and that thought is of you there may be no end of difficulties but i come of an obstinate race i have patience as well as other things  she was avoiding looking at him now she looked instead at her clasped hands  i wish i could make you understand she said in a low tone how impossible all this is in england and america i know that it is different there marriages of a certain sort are freely made between different classes but in russia these things are not thought of supposing that all you said were true supposing even that i had the slightest disposition to listen to you do you realise that there isnt one of my family who wouldnt cry out in horror at the thought of my marryingforgive memarrying a commoner of your rank in life  they can cry themselves hoarse as theyll have to some day he replied cheerfully as for you miss fedorayou dont mind my calling you miss fedora do youyoull be glad some day that you were born at the beginning of a new era you may be a pioneer in the new ways but you may take my word for it that you wont be the last please have courage please try and be yourself wont you  but how do you know what i am she protested or even what i am like we have spoken only a few words nothing has passed between us which could possibly have inspired you with such feelings as you speak of she added colouring slightly it is a fancy of yours quite too absurd a fancy now that i find myself discussing it with you as though indeed we were talking of it seriously i am inclined to laugh you are just a very foolish young man mr lane  he shook his head  look here he said i am very good at meaning things but its awfully hard for me to put my thoughts into words i cant explain how its all come about i dont know why amongst all the girls ive seen in my own country or england or paris or anywhere there hasnt been one who could bring me the things which you bring who could fill my mind with the thoughts you fill it with who could make my days stand still and start again who could upset the whole machinery of my life so that when you come i want to dance with happiness and when you go the day is over with me there is no chance of my being able to explain this to you because other fellows much cleverer than i have been in the same box and theyve had to come to the conclusion too that there isnt any explanation i have accepted it i want you to i love you fedora and i will be faithful to you all my life you shall live where you choose and how you choose but you must be my wife there isnt any way out of it for either of us  she sat quite still for several moments they were a little behind the curtain and it chanced that there was no one in their immediate vicinity she felt her fingers suddenly gripped they were released again almost at once but a queer sensation of something overmastering seemed to creep through her whole being at the touch of his hand she rose to her feet  i am going away she declared  i havent offended you he begged please sit down we havent half talked over things yet  we have talked too much she answered i dont know really what has come over me that i have let youthat i listen to you  it is because you feel the truth of what i say he insisted dont get up fedora dont go away dear let us have at least these few minutes together ill do exactly as you tell me ill come to your father or ill carry you off i have a sister here shell be your friend  dont the girl stopped him please dont  she sat down in her chair again her fingers were twisted together her slim form was tense with stifled emotions  have i been a brute he asked softly you must forgive me fedora i am not much used to girls and i am sort of carried away myself only i want you to believe that theres the real thing in my heart ill make you just as happy as a woman can be dont shake your head dear i want you to trust me and believe in me  i think youre a most extraordinary person she said at last do you know im beginning to be really afraid of you  youre not he insisted youre afraid of yourself youre afraid because you see the downfall of the old ideas youre afraid because you know that youre going to be a renegade you can see nothing but trouble ahead just now ill take you right away from that  there was the rustle of skirts a soft little laugh richard rose to his feet promptly he had never been so pleased in all his life to welcome his sister  flossie he exclaimed im ever so glad you came along i want to present miss grex to you this is my sister miss fedoralady weybourne i was just going to ask miss grex to have some tea with me he went on but i am not sure that she would have considered it proper do come along and be chaperone  lady weybourne laughed  i shall be delighted she declared i have seen you here once or twice before havent i miss grex and some one told me that you were russian i suppose you are not in the least used to the free and easy ways of us westerners but youll come and have some tea with us wont you  the girl hesitated fate was too strong for her  i shall be very pleased she agreed  they found a window table and lane ordered tea fedora was inclined to be silent at first but lady weybourne was quite content to chatter by degrees fedora too came back to earth and they had a very gay little teaparty at the end of it they all strolled back into the rooms together fedora glanced at the watch upon her wrist and held out her hand to lady weybourne  i am sorry she said but i must hurry away now it is very kind of you to ask me to come and see you lady weybourne i shall be charmed  richard ignored her fingers  i am going to see you down to your car if i may he begged  they left the room together she looked at him as they descended the stairs almost tremulously  this doesnt mean you know she said that ithat i agree to all you have been saying  it neednt mean anything at all dear he replied this is only the beginning i dont expect you to realise all that i have realised quite so quickly but i do want you to keep it in your mind that this thing has come and that it cant be got rid of i wont do anything foolish if it is necessary i will wait but i am your lover now as i always must be  he handed her into the car the footman in his long white livery standing somberly on one side as they drove off she gave him her fingers and he walked back up the steps with the smile upon his lips that comes to a man only once or twice in his lifetime     chapter xxvii  playing for high stakes   violet glanced at her watch with an exclamation of dismayed annoyance she leaned appealingly towards the croupier  but one coup more monsieur she pleaded indeed your clock is fast  the croupier shook his head he was a man of gallantry so far as his profession permitted and he was a great admirer of the beautiful englishwoman but the rules of the club were strict  madame he pointed out it is already five minutes past eight it is absolutely prohibited that we start another coup after eight oclock if madame will return at ten oclock the good fortune will without doubt be hers  she looked up at draconmeyer who was standing at her elbow  did you ever know anything more hatefully provoking she complained for two hours the luck has been dead against me but for a few of my carr√©s turning up i dont know what would have happened and now at last my numbers arrive i win en plein and with all the carr√©s and chevaux this time it was twentyseven i win two carr√©s and i move to twenty and he will not go on  it is the rule draconmeyer reminded her it is bad fortune though i have been watching the run of the table things have been coming more your way all the time i think that the end of your illluck has arrived tell me are you hungry  not in the least she answered pettishly i hate the very thought of dinner  then why do we not go on to the casino draconmeyer suggested we can have a sandwich and a glass of wine there and you can continue your vein  she rose to her feet with alacrity her face was beaming  my friend she exclaimed you are inspired it is a brilliant idea i know that it will bring me fortune to the cercle priv√© by all means i am so glad that you are one of those men who are not dependent upon dinner but what about linda  she is not expecting me as it happens draconmeyer lied smoothly i told her that i might be dining at the villa mimosa i have to be there later on  violet gathered up her money stuffed it into her gold bag and hurried off for her cloak she reappeared in a few moments and smiled very graciously at draconmeyer  it is quite a wonderful idea of yours this she declared i am looking forward immensely to my next few coups i feel in a winning vein very soon she added as they stepped out on to the pavement and she gathered up her skirts very soon i am quite sure that i shall be asking you for my cheques back again  he laughed as though she had been a child speaking of playthings  i am not sure that i shall wish you luck he said i think that i like to feel that you are a littlejust a very little in my debt do you think that i should be a severe creditor  something in his voice disturbed her vaguely but she brushed the thought away of course he admired her but then every woman must have admirers it only remained for her to be clever enough to keep him at arms length she had no fear for herself  i havent thought about the matter at all she answered carelessly but to me all creditors would be the same whether they were kind or unkind i hate the feeling of owing anything  it is a question he observed how far one can be said to owe anything to those who are really friends a husband for instance one cant keep a ledger account with him  a husband is a different matter altogether she asserted coldly now i wonder whether we shall find my favourite table full anyhow i am going to play at the one nearest the entrance on the righthand side there is a little croupier there whom i like  they passed up through the entrance and across the floor of the first suite of rooms to the cercle priv√© violet looked eagerly towards the table of which she had spoken to her joy there was plenty of room  my favourite seat is empty she exclaimed i know that i am going to be lucky  i think that i shall play myself for a change draconmeyer announced producing a great roll of notes  whenever you feel that you would like to go down and have something dont mind me will you she begged you can come back and talk to me at any time i am not in the least hungry yet  very well he agreed good luck to you they played at opposite sides of the table for an hour she won and he lost once she called him over to her side  i scarcely dare to tell you she whispered her eyes gleaming but i have won back the first thousand pounds i shall give it to you tonight here take it now  he shook his head and waved it away i havent the cheques with me he protested besides it is bad luck to part with any of your winnings while you are still playing  he watched her for a minute or two she still won  take my advice he said earnestly play higher you have had a most unusual run of bad luck the tide has turned make the most of it i have lost ten mille i am going to have a try your side of the table  he found a vacant chair a few places lower down and commenced playing in maximums from the moment of his arrival he began to win and simultaneously violet began to lose her goodfortune deserted her absolutely and for the first time she showed signs of losing her selfcontrol she gave vent to little exclamations of disgust as stake after stake was swept away her eyes were much too bright there was a spot of colour in her cheeks she spoke angrily to a croupier who delayed handing her some change draconmeyer although he knew perfectly well what was happening never seemed to glance in her direction he played with absolute recklessness for halfanhour when at last he rose from his seat and joined her his hands were full of notes he smiled ever so faintly as he saw the covetous gleam in her eyes  im nearly broken she gasped leave off playing please for a little time youve changed my luck  he obeyed standing behind her chair three more coups she played and lost then she thrust her hand into her bag and drew it out empty she was suddenly pale  i have lost my last louis she declared i dont understand it it seemed as though i must win here  so you will in time he assured her confidently how much will you haveten mille or twenty  she shrank back but the sight of the notes in his hand fascinated her she glanced up at him his pallor was unchanged there was no sign of exultation in his face only his eyes seemed a little brighter than usual beneath his goldrimmed spectacles  no give me ten she said  she took them from his hand and changed them quickly into plaques her first coup was partially successful he leaned closer over her  remember he pointed out that you only need to win once in a dozen times and you do well dont be in such a hurry  of course she murmured of course one forgets that it is all a matter of capital  he strolled away to another table when he came back she was sitting idle in her place restless and excited but still full of confidence  i am a little to the good she told him but i have left off for a few minutes the very low numbers are turning up and they are no use to me  come and have that sandwich he begged you really ought to take something  the place shall be kept for madame the croupier whispered i shall be here for another two hours  she nodded and rose they made their way out of the rooms and down into the restaurant on the groundfloor they found a little table near the wall and he ordered some p√¢t√© sandwiches and champagne whilst they waited she counted up her money making calculations on a slip of paper draconmeyer leaned back in his chair watching her his back was towards the door and they were at the end table he permitted himself the luxury of looking at her almost greedily of dropping for a few moments the mask which he placed always upon his features in her presence in his way the man was an artist a great collector of pictures and bronzes a real lover and seeker after perfection often he found himself wandering towards his little gallery content to stand about and gloat over some of his most treasured possessions yet the mans personality clashed often with his artistic pretensions he scarcely ever found himself amongst his belongings without realising the existence of a curious feeling wholly removed from the pure artistic pleasure of their contemplation it was the sense of ownership which thrilled him something of the same sensation was upon him now she was the sort of woman he had craved for alwaysslim elegant and what to him with his quick powers of observation counted for so much she was modish reflecting in her presence her dress and carriage even her speech the best type of the prevailing fashion she excited comment wherever she appeared people as he knew very well even now were envying him his companion and beneath it allshe the woman was there all his life he had fought for the big thingspolitical power immense wealth the confidence of his great masterall these had come to him easily and at that moment they were like baubles  she looked up at last and there was a slight frown upon her forehead  i am still a little down starting from where i had the ten mille she sighed i thought  she stopped short there was a curious change in her face her eyes were fixed upon some person approaching draconmeyer turned quickly in his chair almost as he did so hunterleys paused before their table violet looked up at him with quivering lips for a moment it seemed as though she were stepping out of her sordid surroundings  henry she exclaimed did you come to look for me did you know that we were here  how should i he answered calmly i was strolling around with david briston we are at the opera  at the opera she repeated  my little prot√©g√©e felicia roche is singing he went on in a√Øda if she does as well in the next act as she has done in this her future is made  he was on the point of adding the news of felicias engagement to the young man who had momentarily deserted him some evil chance changed his intention  why do you call her your little prot√©g√©e she demanded  it isnt quite correct is it he answered a little absently there are three or four of us who are doing what we can to look after her her father was a prominent member of the wigwam club the girl won the musical scholarship we have there she has more than repaid us for our trouble i am glad to say  i have no doubt that she has violet replied lifting her eyes  there was a moments silence the significance of her words was entirely lost upon hunterleys  isnt this rather a new departure of yours he asked glancing disdainfully towards draconmeyer i thought that you so much preferred to play at the club  so i do she assented but i was just beginning to win when the club closed at eight oclock and so we came on here  your good fortune continues i hope  it varies she answered hurriedly but it will come i am sure i have been very near a big win more than once  he seemed on the point of departure she leaned a little forward  you had my note henry  her tone was almost beseeching draconmeyer who was listening with stony face shivered imperceptibly  thank you yes hunterleys replied frowning slightly i am sorry but i am not at liberty to do what you suggest just at present i wish you good fortune  he turned around and walked back to the other end of the room where briston was standing at the bar she looked after him for a moment as though she failed to understand his words then her face hardened draconmeyer leaned towards her  shall we go he suggested  she rose with alacrity side by side they strolled through the rooms towards the cercle priv√©  i am sorry draconmeyer said regretfully but i am forced to leave you now i will take you back to your place and after that i must go to the hotel and change i have a reception to attend i wish you would take the rest of my winnings and see what you can do with them  she shook her head vigorously  no thank you she declared i have enough  he shrugged his shoulders  i have twentyfive mille here in my pocket he continued besides some smaller change i dont think it is quite fair to leave so much money about in ones room or to carry it out into the country keep it for me you wont need to play with iti can see that your luck is inbut it always gives one confidence to feel that one has a reserve stock something to fall back upon if necessary  he drew the notes from his pocket and held them towards her her eyes were fixed upon them covetously the thought of all that money actually in her possession was wildly exhilarating  i will take care of them for you if you like she said i shall not play with them though i owe you quite enough already and my losing days are over  he stuffed the notes carelessly into her bag  twentyfive mille he told her remember my advice if the luck stays with you stake maximums go for the big things  she looked at him curiously as she closed her gold bag with a snap  after all she declared with a little laugh i am not sure that you are not the greater gambler of the two to trust me with all this money     chapter xxviii  to the villa mimosa   with feet that seemed to touch nothing more substantial than air her eyes brilliant a wonderful colour in her cheeks violet passed through the heavy dingy rooms and out through the motley crowd into the portico of the casino she was right she knew that she had been right how wise she had been to borrow that money from mr draconmeyer instead of sitting down and confessing herself vanquished the last few hours had been hours of ecstatic happiness with calm confidence she had sat in her place and watched her numbers coming up with marvellous persistence it was the most wonderful thing in the world this she had had no time to count her winnings but at least she knew that she could pay back every penny she owed her little gold satchel was stuffed with notes and plaques she felt suddenly younger curiously lighthearted hungry too and thirsty she was in short experiencing almost a delirium of pleasure and just then on the steps of the casino she came face to face with her husband  henry she called out henry  he turned abruptly around he was looking troubled and in his hand were the fragments of a crushed up note  come across to the hotel with me she begged forgetful of everything except her own immense relief come and help me count i have been winning i have won back everything  he accepted the information with only a polite show of interest after all as she reflected afterwards he had no idea upon what scale she had been gambling  i am delighted to hear it he answered ill see you across the road if i may but i have only a few minutes to spare i have an appointment  she was acutely disappointed unreasonably furiously angry  an appointment she exclaimed at halfpast eleven oclock at night are you waiting for felicia roche  is there any reason why i should not he asked her gravely  she bit her lips hard they were crossing the road now after all it was only a few months since she had bidden him go his own way and leave her to regulate her own friendships  no reason at all she admitted only i cannot see why you choose to advertise yourself with an opera singeryou an ambitious politician who moves with his head in the clouds and to whom women are no more than a pastime why have you waited all these years to commence a flirtation under my very nose  he looked at her sternly  i think that you are a little excited violet he said you surely dont realise what you are saying  excited tell me once moreyou got my note the one i wrote this evening  certainly  his brief reply was convincing she remembered the few impulsive lines which she had written from her heart in that moment of glad relief there was no sign in his face that he had been touched even at that moment he had drawn out his watch and was looking at it  thank you for bringing me here she said as they stood upon the steps of the hotel dont let me keep you  after all he decided i think that i shall go up to my room for a minute good night  she looked after him a little amazed she was conscious of a feeling of slow anger his aloofness repelled her was utterly inexplicable for once it was she who was being badly treated her moment of exhilaration had passed she sat down in the lounge her satchel filled with mille franc notes lay upon her lap unheeded she sat there thinking seeing nothing of the crowds of fashionably dressed women and men passing in and out of the hotel of the gailylit square outside the cool green of the gardens the caf√© opposite the brilliantlylit casino she was back again for a moment in england the strain of all this life whipped into an artificial froth of pleasure by the constant excitement of the one accepted vice of the world had suddenly lost its hold upon her the inevitable question had presented itself she was counting values and realising  when at last she rose wearily to her feet hunterleys was passing through the hall of the hotel on his way out she looked at him with aching heart but she made no effort to stop him he had changed his clothes for a dark suit and he was also wearing a long travelling coat and tweed cap she watched him wistfully until he had disappeared then she turned away summoned the lift and went up to her rooms she rang at once for her maid she would take a bath she decided and go to bed early she would wash all the dust of these places away from her abjure all manner of excitement and for once sleep peacefully in the morning she would see henry once more deep in her heart there still lingered some faint shadow of doubt as to draconmeyer and his attitude towards her it was scarcely possible that he could have interfered in any way and yet she would talk to her husband face to face she would tell him the things that were in her heart  she rang the bell for the second time only the femme de chambre answered the summons madames maid was not to be found madame had not once retired so early it was possible that susanne had gone out could she be of any service violet looked at her and hesitated the woman was clumsyfingered and none too tidy she shook her head and sent her away for a moment she thought of undressing herself then instead she opened her satchel and counted the notes her breath came more quickly as she looked at the shower of gold and counted the many oblong strips of paper with their magic lettering at last she had it all in heaps there were the twentyfive mille he had left with her and the seventyfive mille she had borrowed from him then towards her own losses there was another mille and a matter of five hundred francs in gold and all this success her wonderful recovery had been done so easily it was just because she had had the pluck to go on because she had followed her vein she looked at the money and she walked to the window somewhere a band was playing in the distance little parties of men and women in evening dress were strolling by on their way to the club a woman was laughing as she clung to her escort on the opposite side of the road by the gardens across at the caf√© de paris the people were going in to supper the spirit of enjoyment seemed to be in the airthe lighthearted fascinating devilmaycare atmosphere she knew so well violet looked back into the bedroom and she no longer had the impulse to sleep her face had hardened a little every one was so happy and she was so lonely she stuffed the notes and gold back into her bag looked at her hat in the glass and touched her face for a moment with a powderpuff then she left the room rang for the lift and descended  i am going into the club for an hour or so if i am wanted she told the concierge as she passed out                                       hunterleys on leaving the hotel walked rapidly across the square and found david waiting for him on the opposite side  felicia will be late the latter explained she has to get all that beastly black stuff off her face she is horribly nervous about sidney and she doesnt want you to wait i think perhaps she is right too she told me to tell you that monsieur lafont himself came to her room and congratulated her after the curtain had gone down she is almost hysterical between happiness and anxiety about sidney wheres your man  i asked him to be a little higher up hunterleys replied there he is  they walked a few steps up the hill and found richard lane waiting for them in his car the long grey racer looked almost like some submarine monster with its flaring headlights and torpedoshaped body which scarcely cleared the ground  ready for orders sir the young man announced touching his cap  is there room for three of us in case of an emergency hunterleys asked  the third man has to sit on the floor richard pointed out but it isnt so comfortable as it looks  hunterleys clambered in and took the vacant place david briston lingered by a little wistfully  i feel rather a skunk he grumbled i dont see why i shouldnt come along  hunterleys shook his head  there isnt the slightest need for it he declared firmly you go back and look after felicia tell her well get sidney out of this all right get away with you lane now  where to  to the villa mimosa  richard whistled as he thrust in his clutch  so thats the game is it he murmured as they glided off  hunterleys leaned towards him  lane he said dont forget that i warned you there might be a little trouble about tonight if you feel the slightest hesitation about involving yourself  shut up richard interrupted whatever trouble youre ready to face im all for it too darned queer thing that we should be going to the villa mimosa though i am not exactly a popular person with mr grex i think  hunterleys smiled  i saw your sister this afternoon he remarked you are rather a wonderful young man  i knew it was all up with me richard replied simply when i first saw that girl now look here hunterleys we are almost there tell me exactly what it is you want me to do  i want you hunterleys explained to risk a smash if you dont mind i want you to run up to the boundaries of the villa gardens head your car back for monte carlo and while you are waiting there turn out all your lights  thats easy enough richard assented ill turn out the searchlight altogether and my others are electric worked by a button is this an elopement act or what  theres a meeting going on in that villa hunterleys told him between prominent politicians of three countries you dont have to bother much about secret service over in the states although theres more goes on than you know of in that direction but over here we have to make regular use of secret service menspies if you like to call them so the meeting tonight is inimical to england it is part of a conspiracy against which i am working sidney rochefelicia roches brotherwho lives here as a newspaper correspondent is in reality one of our best secret service men he is taking terrible chances tonight to learn a little more about the plans which these fellows are discussing we are here in case he needs our help to get away weve cleared the shrubs away close to the spot at which i am going to ask you to wait and taken the spikes off the fence its just a thousand to one chance that if hes hard pressed for it and heads this way they may think that they have him in a trap and take it quietly that is to say theyll wait to capture him instead of shooting  say you dont mean this seriously richard exclaimed they cant do more than arrest him as a trespasser or something of that sort surely  hunterleys laughed grimly  these men wouldnt stick at much he told his companion theyre hand in glove with the authorities here anything they did would be hushed up in the name of the law these things are never allowed to come out it doesnt do any one any good to have them gossiped about if they caught sidney and shot him we should never make a protest its all part of the game you know now that is the spot i want you to stop at exactly where the mimosa tree leans over the path but first of all id turn out your headlight  they slowed down and stopped richard extinguished the acetylene gaslamp and mounted again to his place then he swung the car round and crawled back upon the reverse until he reached the spot to which hunterleys had pointed  youre a good fellow richard hunterleys said softly we may have to wait an hour or two and it may be that nothing will happen but its giving the fellow a chance and it gives him confidence too to know that friends are at hand  im in the game for all its worth anyway lane declared heartily  he touched a button and the lights faded away the two men sat in silence both turned a little in their seats towards the villa     chapter xxix  for his country   the minutes glided by as the two men sat together in the perfumed shadowy darkness from their feet the glittering canopy of lights swept upwards to the mountainsides even to the stars but a chain of slowly drifting black clouds hung down in front of the moon and until their eyes became accustomed to their surroundings it seemed to both of them as though they were sitting in a very pit of darkness  it is possible hunterleys whispered after some time that we may have to wait for another hour yet  richard was suddenly tense he sat up and his foot reached for the selfstarter  i dont think you will he muttered listen  almost immediately they were conscious of some commotion in the direction of the villa followed by a shot and then a cry  start the engine hunterleys directed hoarsely standing up in his place im afraid theyve got him  there were two more shots but no further cry then they heard the sound of excited voices and immediately afterwards rapidly approaching footsteps a man came crashing through the shrubbery but when he reached the fence over which for a moment his white face gleamed he sank down as though powerless to climb hunterleys leapt to the ground and rushed to the fence  hold up sidney old fellow he called softly were here all right hold up for a moment and let me lift you  roche struggled to his feet his face was ghastly white the sweat stood out upon his forehead his lips moved but no words came hunterleys got him by the arms set his teeth and lifted the task would have been too much for him but richard springing from the car came to his help with an effort they hoisted him over the fence almost as they did so there was the sound of footsteps dashing through the shrubs and a shot the bullet of which tore the bark from the trunk of a tree close at hand the car leapt off in fourth speed sidney supported in hunterleys arms a loud shout from behind only brought richards foot down upon the accelerator  stoop low he cried to hunterleys get your legs in if you can  a bullet struck the back of the car and another whistled over their heads then they dashed around the corner and richard turning on the lights jammed down his accelerator  gee whiz thats a bloodthirsty crew the young man exclaimed his eyes fixed upon the road is he hurt  roche was lying back on the seat hunterleys was on his knees holding on to the framework of the car  theyve got me all right hunterleys roche faltered listen everything went well with me at first i could hearnearly everything the frenchman kept his mouth shuttight as wax grex did most of the talking russia sees nothing in the ententeengland has nothing to offer her shed rather keep friends with germany russia wants to move eastwardall persiaindia shes only lukewarm any way about the french alliance as things stand at present and dead off any truck with england theres talk of constantinople and germany to march three army corps through a weak french resistance to calais they talked of france acting to her pledges putting her recruits in the front taking a slight defeat making a peace on her own account with alsace and lorraine restored she can pay germany wants the money germanygermany  the words died away in a little groan the wounded mans head fell back hunterleys passed his arm around the limp figure  take the first turn to the right and second to the left richard he directed well drive straight to the hospital i made friends with the english doctor last night he promised to be there till three i paid him a fee on purpose  first to the right richard muttered swinging around second to the left eh  hunterleys was holding his brandy flask to roches lips as they swung through the white gates and pulled up outside the hospital the doctor was faithful to his promise and roche who was now unconscious was carried in in the hall he was laid upon an ambulance and borne off by two attendants hunterleys and lane sat down to wait in the hall after what seemed to them an interminable halfhour the doctor reappeared he came over to them at once  your friend may live he announced but in any case he will be unconscious for the next twentyfour hours there is no need for you to stay or for you to fetch the young lady you spoke of at present if he dies he will die unconscious i can tell you nothing more until the afternoon  hunterleys rose slowly to his feet  youll do everything you can doctor he begged money doesnt count  money never counts here the doctor replied gravely we shall save him if it is possible youve nothing to tell me i suppose as to how he met with his wound  nothing  they walked out together into the night the bank of clouds had drifted away now and the moon was shining below them barely a quarter of a mile away they could see the flare of lights from the casino a woman was laughing hysterically through the open windows of a house on the other side of the way some one was playing a violin in a caf√© at the corner of the street  richard hunterleys said will you see me through i have to get to cannes as fast as i can to send a cable i darent send it from here even in code  ill drive you to cannes like a shot richard assented heartily just a brandy and soda on our way out and ill show you some pretty driving  they stopped at the caf√© de paris and left the car under the trees both men took a long drink and richard filled his pocket with cigarettes then they reentered the car lit up and glided off on the road for cannes richard had become more serious his boyish manner and appearance had temporarily gone he drove even with less than his usual recklessness  that was a fine fellow he remarked enthusiastically after a long pause that fellow roche  and weve many more like him hunterleys declared weve men in every part of the world doing what seems like dirty work illpaid work too doing it partly perhaps because the excitement grows on them and they love it but always they have to start in cold blood the papers dont always tell the truth you know theres many a death in foreign cities you read of as a suicide or the result of an accident when its really the sacrifice of a hero for his country its great work richard  makes me feel kind of ashamed richard muttered ive never done anything but play around all my life anyway those sort of things dont come to us in our country americas too powerful and too isolated to need help of that description we shouldnt have any use for politicians of your class or for secret service men  if youre in earnest hunterleys advised you go to washington and ask them about it some day the times coming if it hasnt already arrived when your country will have to develop a different class of politicians you see whether she wants it or not she is coming into touch through asia and south america with european interests and if she does shell have to adopt their methods more or less poor old roche there was something more he wanted to say and if its what ive been expecting your country was in it  i guess ill take fedora over for our honeymoon richard decided softly dont see why i shouldnt come into one of the embassies im a bit of a hulk to go about the world doing nothing  hunterleys laughed quietly  my young friend he said arent you taking your marriage prospects a little for granted may i be there when you ask augustus nicholas ivan peter grand duke of vassura prince of melinkoff cousin of his imperial majesty the czar for the hand of his daughter in marriage  so thats it is it lane murmured why didnt you tell me before  hunterleys shook his head he gazed steadfastly along the road in front of him  it wasnt to my interest to have it known too generally he said and i am afraid your little love affair didnt strike me as being of much importance by the side of the other things but youve earned the truth if its any use to you  well richard observed i wasnt counting on having any witnesses but you can come along if you like i suppose he added i shall have to do him the courtesy of asking his permission but  but what hunterleys asked curiously  they were on a long stretch of straight white road richard looked for a moment up to the sky and hunterleys watching him was amazed at the transformation  there isnt a grand duke or a prince or an imperial majesty alive he said who could rob me of fedora     chapter xxx  supposing i take this money   there was a momentary commotion in the club a woman had fainted at one of the roulette tables her chair was quickly drawn back she was helped out to the open space at the top of the stairs and placed in an easychair there lady weybourne who was on the point of leaving with her husband hastened back she stood there while the usual restoratives were being administered fanning the unconscious woman with a white ostrich fan which hung from her waist presently violet opened her eyes she recognised lady weybourne and smiled weakly  i am so sorry she murmured it was silly of me to stay in here so long i went without my dinner too which was rather idiotic  a man who had announced himself a doctor bent over her pulse and turned away  the lady will be quite all right now he said you can give her brandy and soda if she feels like it pardon  he hastened back to his place at the baccarat table lady hunterleys sat up  it was quite absurd of me she declared i dont know what  she stopped suddenly the weight was once more upon her heart the blankness before her eyes she remembered  i am quite able to go home now she added  her gold bag lay upon her lap it was almost empty she looked at it vacantly and then closed the snap  well see you back to the hotel lady weybourne said soothingly here comes harry with the brandy and soda  lord weybourne came hurrying from the bar a tumbler in his hand  how nice of you violet exclaimed gratefully really i feel that this is just what i need i wonder what time it is  half past four lord weybourne announced glancing at his watch  she laughed weakly  how stupid of me i have been between here and the casino for nearly twelve hours and had nothing to eat no i wont have anything here thanks she added as lord weybourne started back again for the bar muttering something about a sandwich ill have something in my room if you are going back to the hotel perhaps i could come with you  they all three left the place together passing along the private way  i havent seen your brother all day violet remarked to lady weybourne  richards gone off somewhere in the car tonight a most mysterious expedition his sister declared i began to think that it must be an elopement but i see the yachts there still and he would surely choose the yacht in preference to a motorcar if he were running off with anybody your husband doesnt come into the rooms much  violet shook her head  he hasnt the gambling instinct she said quietly perhaps he is just as well without it one gets a lot of amusement out of this playing for small stakes but it is irritating to lose thank you so much for looking after me she added as they reached the hall of the hotel i am quite all right now and my woman will be sitting up for me  she passed into the lift lady weybourne looked after her admiringly  say shes got some pluck harry she murmured they say she lost nearly a hundred mille tonight and she never even mentioned her losings irritating indeed i wonder what sir henry thinks of it they are only moderately well off  her husband shrugged his shoulders after the fashion of his sex  let us hope he said that it is sir henry who suffers                                       violet slipped out of her gown and dismissed her maid in her dressinggown she sat before the open window everywhere the place seemed steeped in the faint violet and purple light preceding the dawn away eastwards she could catch a glimpse of the mountains their peaks cut sharply against the soft deep sky a crystalline glow the first herald of the hidden sunrise hanging about their summits the gentle breeze from the mediterranean was cool and sweet there were many lights still gleaming upon the sea but their effect now seemed tawdry she sat there her head resting upon her hands she had the feeling of being somehow detached from the whole world of visible objects as though indeed she were on her deathbed surely it was not possible to pass any further through life than this in her thoughts she went back to the first days of estrangement between her husband and herself almost before she realised it she found herself struggling against the tenderness which still survived which seemed at that moment to be tearing at her heartstrings he had ceased to care she told herself it was all too apparent that he had ceased to care he was amusing himself elsewhere her little impulsive note had not won even a kind word from him her appeals on one excuse or another had been disregarded she had lost her place in his life thrown it away she told herself bitterly and in its steadwhat a new fear of draconmeyer was stealing over her he presented himself suddenly as an evil genius she went back through the last few days her brain seemed unexpectedly clear her perceptions unerring she saw with hateful distinctness how he had forced this money upon her how he had encouraged her all the time to play beyond her means she realised the cunning with which he had left that last bundle of notes in her keeping well there the facts were she owed him now four thousand pounds she had no money of her own she was already overdrawn with her allowance there was no chance of paying him she realised with a little shudder that he did not want payment a realisation which had come to her dimly from the first but which she had pushed away simply because she had felt sure of winning now there was the price to be paid she leaned further out of the window away to her left the glow over the mountains was becoming stained with the faintest of pinks she looked at it long with mute and critical appreciation she swept with her eyes the line of violet shadows from the mountaintops to the seaboard where the pale lights of bordighera still flickered she looked up again from the dark blue sea to the paling stars it was all wonderfultheatrical perhaps but wonderfuland how she hated it she stood up before the window and with her clenched fists she beat against the sills those long days and feverish nights through which she had passed slowly unfolded themselves in those few moments she seemed to taste again the dull pain of constant disappointment the hectic thrills of occasional winnings the strange dull inertia which had taken the place of resignation she looked into the street below how long would she live afterwards she wondered if she threw herself down she began even to realise the state of mind which breeds suicides the brooding over a morrow too hateful to be faced  as she still stood there the silence of the street below was broken a motorcar swung round the corner and swept past the side of the hotel she caught at the curtain as she recognised its occupants richard lane was driving and by his side sat her husband the car was covered with dust both men seemed weary as though they had been out all night she gazed after them with fastbeating heart she had pictured her husband at the villa on the hill where had he been with richard lane perhaps after all the things which she had imagined were not true the car had stopped now at the front door it returned a moment later on its way to the garage with only lane driving she opened her door and stood there silently hunterleys would have to pass the end of the corridor if he came up by the main lift she waited with fast beating heart the seconds passed then she heard the rattle of the lift ascending its click as it stopped and soon afterwards the footsteps of a man he was comingcoming past the corner at that moment she felt that the sound of his footsteps was like the beating of fate they came nearer and she shrank a little back there was something unfamiliar about them whoever it might be it was not henry and then suddenly draconmeyer came into sight he saw her standing there and stopped short then he came rapidly near  lady hunterleys he exclaimed softly you still up  she hesitated then she stood on one side still grasping the handle of the door  do you want to come in she asked you may i have something to say to you perhaps i shall sleep better if i say it now  he stepped quickly past her  close the door he whispered cautiously  she obeyed him deliberately  there is no hurry she said this is my sittingroom i receive whom i choose here  but it is nearly six oclock he exclaimed  that does not affect me she answered shrugging her shoulders sit down  he obeyed there was something changed about her something which he did not recognise she thrust her hands into a box of cigarettes took one out and lit it she leaned against the table facing him  listen she continued i have borrowed from you three thousand pounds you left with me tonighti dont know whether you meant to lend it to me or whether i had it on trust but you left it in my chargeanother thousand pounds i have lost it allall you understandthe four thousand pounds and every penny i have of my own  he sat quite still he was watching her through his goldrimmed spectacles there was the slightest possible frown upon his forehead the time for talking of money as though it were a trifle had passed  that is a great deal he said  it is a great deal she admitted i owe it to you and i cannot pay what are you going to do  he watched her eagerly there was a new note in her voice he paused to consider what it might mean a single false step now and he might lose all that he had striven for  how am i to answer that he asked softly i will answer it first in the way that seems most natural i will beg you to accept your losings as a little gift from meas a proof if you will of my friendship  he had saved the situation if he had obeyed his first impulse the affair would have been finished he realised it as he watched her face and he shuddered at the thought of his escape his words obviously disturbed her  it is not possible for me she protested to accept money from you  not from lindas husband  she threw her cigarette into the grate and stood looking at him  do you offer it to me as lindas husband she demanded  it was a crisis for which draconmeyer was scarcely prepared he was driven out of his pusillanimous compromise she was pressing him hard for the truth again the fear of losing her altogether terrified him  if i have other feelings of which i have not spoken he said quietly have i not kept them to myself do i obtrude them upon you even now i am content to wait  to wait for what she insisted  all that had been in his mind seemed suddenly miraged before himthe removal of hunterleys his own wifes failing health the way had seemed so clear only a little time ago and now the clouds were back again  until you appreciate the fact he told her that you have no more sincere friend that there is no one who values your happiness more than i do  supposing i take this money from you she asked after a moments pause are there any conditions  none whatever he answered  she turned away with a little sigh the tragedy which a few minutes ago she had seen looming up eluded her she had courted a d√©nouement in vain he was too clever  you are very generous she said we will speak of this tomorrow i called you in because i could not bear the uncertainty of it all please go now  he rose slowly to his feet she gave him her hand lifelessly he kept it for a moment she drew it away and looked at the place where his lips had touched it wonderingly it was as though her fingers had been scorched with fire  it shall be tomorrow he whispered as he passed out     chapter xxxi  nearing a crisis   from the wilds of scotland to monte carlo as fast as motorcars and train de luxe could bring him came the right honourable meredith simpson a very distinguished member of his majestys government hunterleys advised of his coming by telegram from marseilles met him at the station and together the two men made their way at once to hunterleys room across at the hotel de paris behind locked doors they spoke for the first time of important matters  its a great find this of yours hunterleys the minister acknowledged and it is corroborated too by what we know is happening around us we have had all the warning in the world just lately the russian ambassador is in st petersburg on leave of absencein fact for the last six months he has been taking his duties remarkably lightly tell me how you first heard of the affair  i got wind of it in sofia hunterleys explained i travelled from there quite quietly loitered about the italian riviera and came on here as a tourist the only help i could get hold of here was from sidney roche who as you know is one of our secret service men roche i am sorry to say was shot last night he may live but he wont be well enough to take any further hand in the game here and i have no one to take his place  roche shot mr simpson exclaimed in a shocked tone how did it happen  they found him lying on the roof of the villa mimosa just over the room where the meeting was taking place hunterleys replied they chased him round the grounds and we just got him off in a motorcar but not before hed been hit twice he was just able to tell me a little the first meeting was quite informal and very guarded douaille was most cautioushe was there only to listen the second meeting was last night grex was in the chair representing russia  you mean the grand duke augustus mr simpson interrupted  hunterleys nodded  grex is the name he is living under here he explained russias position poor roche was only able to falter a few words but what he said was enough to give us the keynote to the whole thing the long and short of it all is that russia turned her face westward so long as constantinople was possible now that this war has come about and ended as it has done russias chance has gone there is no longer any quid pro quo for her alliance with france there is no friendship of course between russia and germany but at any rate russia has nothing to fear from germany and she knows it grex is quite frank they must look eastward he said and when he says eastward he means manchuria china persia even india at the same time russia has a conscience even though it be a diplomatic conscience hence this conference she doesnt want france crushed germany has a proposition it has been enunciated up to a certain point she confers alsace and lorraine and possibly egypt upon france for her neutrality whilst she destroys the british fleet or failing her neutrality she wants her to place a weak army on the frontier which can fall back without much loss before a german advance germanys objective then will be calais and not paris and from there she will command the straits and deal with the british fleet at her leisure meanwhile she will conclude peace with france on highly advantageous terms dont you see what it means simpson the elementary part of the thing is as simple as a b c germany has nothing to gain from russia she has nothing to gain from france england is the only country who can give her what she wants that is about as far as they have got up to now but there is something further behind it all that selingman is to tell them tonight  the most important point about the whole matter so far as we are concerned mr simpson declared is douailles attitude you have received no indication of that i suppose  none whatever hunterleys answered i thought of paying my respects but after all you know i have no official standing and personally we are almost strangers  the minister nodded  its a difficult position he confessed have you copies of your reports to london  i have copies of them and full notes of everything that has transpired so far in a strong box up at the bank hunterleys assented we can stroll up there after lunch and i will place all the documents in your hands you can look them through then and decide what is best to be done  the minister rose to his feet  i shall go round to my rooms change my clothes he announced and meet you presently well lunch across at ciros eh i didnt mean to come to monte carlo this year but so long as i am here i may as well make the best of it you are not looking as though the change had done you much good hunterleys  the last few days hunterleys remarked a little drily have not been exactly in the nature of a holiday  are you here alone  i came alone i found my wife here by accident she came through with the draconmeyers they were supposed to stay at cannes but altered their plans of course draconmeyer meant to come here all the time  the minister frowned  draconmeyers one man i should be glad to see out of london he declared under the pretext of fostering goodwill and that sort of thing between the mercantile classes of our two countries i think that that fellow has done about as much mischief as it is possible for any single man to have accomplished well meet in an hour hunterleys my man is putting out some things for me and i must have a bath  hunterleys walked up to the hospital and to his surprise met selingman coming away the latter saluted him with a wave of the hat and a genial smile  calling to see our poor invalid he enquired blandly  hunterleys although he knew his man was a little taken aback  what share in him do you claim he asked  selingman sighed  alas he confessed i fear that my claim would sound a little coldblooded i think that i was the only man who held his gun straight yet after all roche would be the last to bear me any grudge he was playing the game taking his risks uncommonly bad marksmen grexs private police were or hed be in the morgue instead of the hospital  i gather that our friend is still alive hunterleys remarked  going on as well as could be expected selingman replied  conscious  selingman smiled  you see through my little visit of sympathy at once he exclaimed unable to converse i am assured and unable to share with his friends any little information he may have picked up last night by the way whom shall you send to report our little conference tonight you wouldnt care to come yourself would you  i should like to exceedingly hunterleys assured him if youd give me a safe conduct  selingman withdrew his cigar from his mouth and laid his hand upon the others shoulder  my dear friend he said earnestly your safe conduct if ever i signed it would be to the other world frankly we find you rather a nuisance we would be better pleased if your party were in office and you with your knees tucked under a desk at downing street attending to your official business in your official place who gave you this roving commission eh who sent you to talk common sense to the balkan states and how the mischief did you get wind of our little meeting here  ah hunterleys replied i expect you really know all these things  selingman with his feet planted firmly upon the pavement took a fresh cigar from his waistcoat pocket bit off the end and lit it  my friend hunterleys he continued i am enjoying this brief interchange of confidences circumstances have made me as you see a politician a schemer if you like nature meant me to be one of the frankest the most truthful the besthearted of men i detest the tortuous ways of the old diplomacy the spoken word pleases me best that is why i like a few minutes conversation with the enemy why i love to stand here and talk to you with the buttons off our foils we are scheming against you and your country and you know it and we shall win we cant help but winif not today tomorrow your country has had a marvellously long run of good luck but it cant last for ever  hunterleys smiled  well he observed theres nothing like confidence if you are so sure of success why couldnt you choose a cleaner way to it than by tampering with our ally  selingman patted his companion on the shoulder  listen my friend he said there are no such things as allies an alliance between two countries is a dead letter so soon as their interests cease to be identical now austria is our ally because she is practically germany we are both midcontinental powers we both need the same protection but england and france go back only fifty years my dear hunterleys and ask yourselfwould any living person living now and alive then believe in the lasting nature of such an unnatural alliance wherever you look in every quarter of the globe your interests are opposed you robbed france of egypt she cant have wholly forgotten you dominate the mediterranean through gibraltar malta and cyprus what does she think of that i wonder isnt a humiliation for her when she does stop to think of it youve a thousand years of quarrels of fighting and rapine behind you you cant call yourselves allies because the thing isnt natural it never could be it was only your mutual hysterical fear of germany which drove you into one anothers arms we fought france once to prove ourselves and for money just now we dont want either money or territory from france perhaps we dont even want my dear englishman what you think we want but all the same dont blame us for trying to dissolve an unnatural alliance was that simpson who came by the luxe this morning  it was hunterleys admitted  the right honourable john william meredith simpson selingman recited waving his cigar well well we certainly have made a stir with our little meetings here an inspired english cabinet minister travelstained and dusty arrives with his valet and a black dispatchbox to foil our schemes send him along my friend we are not at all afraid of mr simpson perhaps we may even ask him to join us this evening  i fancy hunterleys remarked grimly that the englishman who joins you this evening will find a home up on the hill here  or down in the morgue there selingman grunted pointing down to monaco take care hunterleystake care man one of us hates you it isnt i you are fighting a brave fight and a losing fight but you are good metal try and remember when you find that you are beaten that life has many consolations for the philosopher  he passed on and hunterleys entered the hospital whilst he was waiting in the little receptionroom felicia came in her face showed signs of her nights anxiety  sidney is still unconscious she announced her voice shaking a little the doctors seem hopefulbut oh sir henry it is terrible to see him lying there just as though he were dead  sidney will pull through all right hunterleys declared encouragingly he has a wonderful constitution and he is the luckiest fellow born he always gets out of trouble somehow or other  she came slowly up to him  sir henry she said piteously i know quite well that sidney was willing to take his risks he went into this thing knowing it was dangerous i want to be brave what happens must be but listen you wontyou wont rob me of everything in life will you you wont send david after him  hunterleys smiled reassuringly  i can promise you that he told her this isnt davids job at all he has to stick to his post and help out the bluff as a press correspondent dont be afraid felicia you shall have your david  she seized his hand and kissed it  you have been so kind to me always sir henry she sighed i cant tell you how thankful i am to think that you dont want david to go and run these horrible risks  no fear of that i promise you he assured her once more david will be busy enough pulling the strings another way  the doctor entered the room and shook hands with hunterleys there was no news he declared nothing to be done the patient must continue in his present condition for several more hours at least the symptoms were in their way favourable beyond that nothing could be said felicia and hunterleys left the hospital together  i wonder she began as they turned out of the white gates whether you would mind very much if i told you something  of course not  yesterday she continued slowly i met lady hunterleys you know i have seen her twice when i have been to your house to sing for your guests she recognised me i feel sure but she didnt seem to want to see me she looked surprised when i bowed i worried about it at first and then i wondered you are so very very secretive just now whatever this affair may be in which you three are all concerned you never open your lips about it lady hunterleys probably doesnt know that you have had to come up to the villa at all hours of the night just to see sidney you dont suppose that by any chance she imaginedthat you came to see me  hunterleys was struck by the thought he remembered several chance remarks of his wife he remembered too the coincidence of his recent visits to the villa having prevented him in each case from acceding to some request of violets  i am glad youve mentioned this child he said frankly now i come to think of it my wife certainly did know that i came up to the villa very late one night and she seemed upset about it of course she hasnt the faintest idea about your brother  well felicia declared with a sigh of relief i felt that i had to tell you it sounded horribly conceited in a way but then she wouldnt know that you came to see sidney or that i was engaged to david misunderstandings do come about so easily you know sometimes  this one shall be put right at any rate he promised her now if you will take my advice you will go home and lie down until the evening you are going to sing again arent you  if there is no change she replied i know that he would like me to you havent mindedwhat ive said  not a bit child he assured her in fact i think it was very good of you now ill put you in this carriage and send you home think of nothing except that sidney is getting better every hour and sing tonight as though your voice could reach his bedside au revoir  he waved his hand to her as she drove off and returned to the hotel de paris he found a refreshed and rejuvenated simpson smoking a cigarette upon the steps  to lunch the latter exclaimed afterwards i will tell you my plans     chapter xxxii  an interesting meeting   hunterleys leaned suddenly forward across the little round table  the question of whether or no you shall pay your respects to monsieur douaille he remarked is solved unless i am very much mistaken we are going to have an exceedingly interesting luncheonparty on our right  monsieur douaille mr simpson began a little eagerly  and the others hunterleys interrupted dont look around for a moment this is almost historical  monsieur ciro himself bowing and smiling was ushering a party of guests to a round table upon the terrace in the immediate vicinity of the two men mr grex with his daughter and lady hunterleys on one side and monsieur douaille on the other were in the van draconmeyer followed with lady weybourne and selingman brought up the rear with the comtesse dhausson one of the most prominent leaders of the french colony in monte carlo and a connection by marriage of monsieur douaille  illustration mr grex with his daughter and lady hunterleys on one side and monsieur douaille on the other were in the van  a luncheonparty for douaille hunterleys murmured as he bowed to his wife and exchanged greetings with some of the others i wonder what they think of their neighbours a little embarrassing for the chief guest i am afraid  i see your wife is in the enemys camp his companion observed draconmeyer is coming to speak to me this promises to be interesting  draconmeyer and selingman both came over to greet the english minister selingmans blue eyes were twinkling with humour his smile was broad and irresistible  this should send funds up in every capital of europe he declared as he shook hands when mr meredith simpson takes a holiday then the political barometer points to set fair  a tribute to my conscientiousness the minister replied smiling i am glad to see that i am not the only hardworked statesman who feels able to take a few days holiday  selingman glanced at the round table and beamed  it is true he admitted every country seems to have sent its statesmen holidaymaking and what a playground too he added glancing towards hunterleys with something which was almost a wink here political crises seem of little account by the side of the turning wheel this is where the world unbends and it is well that there should be such a place shall we see you at the club or in the rooms later  without a doubt mr simpson assented for what else does one live in monte carlo  how did you leave things in town mr draconmeyer enquired  soso the minister answered a little flat but then it is a dull season of the year  markets about the same i suppose mr draconmeyer asked  i am afraid mr simpson confessed that i only study the city column from the point of view of what herr selingman has just called the political barometer things were a little unsteady when i left consols fell several points yesterday  mr draconmeyer frowned  it is incomprehensible he declared a few months ago there was real danger one is forced to believe of a european war today the crisis is passed yet the moneymarkets which bore up so well through the critical period seem now all the time on the point of collapse it is hard for a banker to know how to operate these days i wish you gentlemen in downing street mr simpson would make it easier for us  mr simpson shrugged his shoulders  the real truth of the matter is he said that you allow your moneymarket to become too sensitive an affair a whisper will depress it a threatening word spoken in the reichstag or in the house of parliament magnified a hundredfold before it reaches its destination has sometimes a most unwarranted effect upon markets you mustnt blame us so much mr draconmeyer you jump at conclusions too easily in the city  sound common sense mr draconmeyer agreed you are perfectly right when you say that we are oversensitive the banker deplores it as much as the politician its the moneykings i suppose who find it profitable  they returned to their table a moment later as he passed douaille selingman whispered in his ear monsieur douaille turned around at once and bowed to simpson as he caught the latters eye he too left his place and came across mr simpson rose to his feet the two men bowed formally before shaking hands  monsieur simpson the frenchman exclaimed it is a pleasure to find that i am remembered  without a doubt monsieur was the prompt reply your last visit to london on the occasion when we had the pleasure of entertaining you at the guildhall is too recent and was too memorable an event altogether for us to have forgotten permit me to assure you that your speech on that occasion was one which no patriotic englishman is likely to forget  monsieur douaille inclined his head in thanks his manner was not altogether free from embarrassment  i trust that you are enjoying your holiday here he asked  i have only this moment arrived mr simpson explained i am looking forward to a few days rest immensely i trust that i shall have the pleasure of seeing something of you monsieur douaille a little conversation would be most agreeable  in monte carlo one meets ones friends all the time monsieur douaille replied i lunch today with my friendour mutual friend without a doubtwho calls himself here mr grex  mr simpson nodded  if it is permitted he suggested i should like to do myself the honour of paying my respects to you  monsieur douaille was flattered  my stay here is short he regretted but your visit will be most acceptable i am at the riviera palace hotel  it is one of my theories mr simpson remarked that politicians are at a serious disadvantage compared with business men inasmuch as with important affairs under their control they have few opportunities of meeting those with whom they have dealings it would be a great pleasure to me to discuss one or two matters with you  monsieur douaille departed with a few charming words of assent simpson looked after him with kindling eyes  this he murmured leaning across the table is a most extraordinary meeting there they sit those very men whom you suspect of this devilish scheme within a few feet of us positively thrilling hunterleys  hunterleys too seemed to feel the stimulating effect of a situation so dramatic as the meal progressed he drew his chair a little closer to the table and leaned over towards his companion  i think he said that we shall both of us remember the coincidence of this meeting as long as we live at that luncheontable within a few yards of us sits russia the new russia raising his head after a thousand years sleep watching the times weighing them realising his own immeasurable strength pointing his inevitable finger along the road which the russia of tomorrow must tread there isnt a man in that great country so much to be feared today from our point of view as the grand duke augustus and look too at the same table within a few feet simpson of you and of meselingman selingman who represents the real germany not the war party alone intoxicated with the clash of arms filled with bombastic desires for german triumphs on sea and land ever ready to spout in flowery and grandiloquent phrases the glory of germany and the heavensent genius of her leaders i tell you simpson selingman is a more dangerous man than that he sits with folded arms in realms of thought above these people he sits with a map of the world before him and he places his finger upon the inevitable spots which germany must possess to keep time with the march of the world to find new homes for her overflowing millions he has no military fervour no tinselly patriotism he knows what germany needs and he will carve her way towards it look at him with his napkin tucked under his chin broadvisaged podgy a slave you might think to the joys of the table and the grosser things of life you should see his eyes sometimes when the right note is struck watch his mouth when he sits and thinks he uses words for an ambush and a barricade he talks often like a gay fool a flood of empty verbiage streams from his lips and behind all the time his brain works  you seem to have studied these people hunterleys simpson remarked appreciatively  hunterleys smiled as he continued his luncheon  forgive me if i was a little prolix he said but after all what would you have i am out of office but i remain a servant of my country my interest is just as keen as though i were in a responsible position  you are well out of it simpson sighed if half what you suspect is true its the worst fix weve been in for some time  i am afraid there isnt any doubt about it hunterleys declared of course weve been at a fearful disadvantage roche was the only man out here upon whom i could rely now theyve accounted for him weve scarcely a chance of getting at the truth  mr simpson was gloomily silent for some moments he was thinking of the time when he had struck his pencil through a recent secret service estimate  anyhow hunterleys went on it will be all over in twentyfour hours something will be decided uponwhat i am afraid there is very little chance of our getting to know these men will separategrex to st petersburg selingman to berlin douaille to paris then i think we shall begin to hear the mutterings of the storm  i think mr simpson intervened his eyes fixed upon an approaching figure that there is a young lady talking to the ma√Ætre dh√¥tel who is trying to attract your attention  hunterleys turned around in his chair it was felicia who was making her way towards him he rose at once to his feet there was a little murmur of interest amongst the lunchers as she threaded her way past the tables it was not often that an english singer in opera had met with so great a success lady hunterleys recognising her as she passed paused in the middle of a sentence her face hardened hunterleys had risen from his place and was watching felicias approach anxiously  is there any news of sidney he asked quickly as he took her hand  nothing fresh she answered in a low voice i have brought you a messagefrom some one else  he held his chair for her but she shook her head  i mustnt stay she continued this is what i wanted to tell you as i was crossing the square just now i recognised the man frenhofer from the villa mimosa directly he saw me he came across the road he was looking for one of us he dared not come to the villa he declares for fear of being watched he has something to tell you  where can i find him hunterleys asked  he has gone to a little bar in the rue de chaussures the bar de montmartre it is called he is waiting there for you now  you must stay and have some lunch hunterleys begged i will come back  she shook her head  i have just been across to the opera house she explained to enquire about some properties for tonight i have had all the lunch i want and i am on my way to the hospital now again i came here on the chance of finding you they told me at the hotel de paris that you were lunching out  hunterleys turned and whispered to simpson  this is very important he said it concerns the affair in which we are interested linger over your coffee and i will return  mr simpson nodded and hunterleys left the restaurant with felicia his wife at whom he glanced for a moment kept her head averted she was whispering in the ear of the gallant monsieur douaille selingman catching draconmeyers eye winked at him solemnly  you have all the luck my silent friend he murmured     chapter xxxiii  the fates are kind   the bar de montmartre was many steps under the level of the street dark smelly and dilapidated its only occupants were a handful of drivers from the carriagestand opposite who stared at hunterleys in amazement as he entered and then rushed forward almost in a body to offer their services the man behind the bar however who had evidently been forewarned intervened with a few sharp words and lifting the flap of the counter ushered hunterleys into a little room beyond frenhofer was engaged there in amiable badinage with a young lady who promptly disappeared at hunterleys entrance frenhofer bowed respectfully  i must apologise he said for bringing monsieur to such a place it is near the end now and with monsieur roche in the hospital i ventured to address myself to monsieur direct here i have the right to enter i make my suit to the daughter of the proprietor in order to have a safe rendezvous when necessary it is well that monsieur has come quickly i have tidings i can disclose to monsieur the meetingplace for tonight if monsieur has fortune and the wit to make use of it the opportunity i shall give him is a great one but pardon me before we talk business we must order something  he touched the bell the proprietor himself thrust in his head bulletshaped with black moustache and unshaven chin he wore no collar and the remainder of his apparel was negligible  a bottle of your best brandy frenhofer ordered the best mind p√®re hanaut  the mans acquiescence was as amiable as nature would permit  monsieur will excuse me frenhofer went on as the door was once more closed but these people have their little ways to sell a whole bottle of brandy at five times its value is to monsieur le propri√©taire more agreeable than to offer him rent for the hire of his room he is outside all the things in which we are concerned he believespardon me monsieurthat we are engaged in a little smuggling transaction monsieur roche and i have used this place frequently  he can believe what he likes hunterleys replied so long as he keeps his mouth shut  the brandy was broughtand three glasses frenhofer promptly took the hint and filling one to the brim held it out to the landlord  you will drink our health p√®re hanautmy health and the health of monsieur here and the health of the fair annette incidentally you will drink also to the success of the little scheme which monsieur and i are planning  in such brandy the proprietor declared hoarsely i would drink to the devil himself  he threw back his head and the contents of his glass vanished he set it down with a little smack of the lips once more he looked at the bottle frenhofer filled up his glass but motioned to the door with his head  you will excuse us dear friend he begged laying his hand persuasively upon the others shoulder monsieur and i have little enough of time  the landlord withdrew frenhofer walked around the little apartment their privacy was certainly assured  monsieur he announced turning to hunterleys there has been a great discussion as to the next meetingplace between our friendsthe next which will be also the last they are safe enough in reality at the villa but monsieur douaille is nervous the affair of last night terrified him the reason for these things i of course know nothing of but it seems that monsieur douaille is very anxious indeed to keep his association with my august master and herr selingman as secret as possible he has declined most positively to set foot again within the villa mimosa many plans have been suggested this is the one adopted for some weeks a german down in monaco a shipping agent has had a yacht in the harbour for hire he has approached mr grex several times not knowing his identity ignorant indeed of the fact that the grand duke himself possesses one of the finest yachts afloat however that is nothing mr grex thought suddenly of the yacht he suggested it to the others they were enthusiastic the yacht is to be hired for a week or longer if necessary and used only tonight behold the wonderful goodfortune of the affair it is i who have been selected by my master to proceed to monaco to make arrangements with the german herr schwann i am on my way there at the moment  a yacht hunterleys repeated  there are wonderful things to be thought of frenhofer asserted eagerly consider monsieur the yacht of this man schwann has never been seen by my master consider too that aboard her there must be a dozen hidingplaces the crew has been brought together from anywhere they can be bought to a man there is only one point monsieur which should be arranged before i enter upon this last and for me most troublesome and dangerous enterprise  and that hunterleys enquired  my own position frenhofer declared solemnly i am not greedy or covetous my ambitions have long been fixed to serve an imperial russian nobleman has been no pleasure for me st petersburg has been a prison i have been moved to the right or to the left as a machine it is as a machine only i have lived always i have longed for paris so month by month i have saved after tonight i must leave my masters employ the risk will be too great if monsieur indeed accepts my proposition and carries it out i need but a matter of ten thousand francs to complete my savings  the mans white face shone eagerly in the dim light of the gloomy little apartment his eyes glittered he waited almost breathlessly  frenhofer hunterleys said slowly so far as i have been concerned indirectly in these negotiations with you my instructions to my agent have been simple and definite we have never haggled your name was known to me eight years ago when you served us in st petersburg and served us well you have done the same thing now and you have behaved with rare intelligence within the course of an hour i shall transfer ten thousand francs to the account of fran√ßois frenhofer at the english bank here  the eyes of the man seemed suddenly like pinpricks of fire  monsieur is a prince he murmured and now for the further details if monsieur would run the risk i would suggest that he accompanies me to the office of this man schwann  hunterleys made no immediate reply he was walking up and down the narrow apartment a brilliant idea had taken possession of him the more he thought of it the more feasible it became  frenhofer he said at last i have a scheme of my own you are sure that mr grex has never seen this yacht  he has never set eyes upon it monsieur save to try and single it out with his fieldglasses from the balcony of the villa  and he is to board it tonight  at ten oclock tonight monsieur it is to lie off the villa mimosa a pinnace is to fetch mr grex and his friends on board from the private landingstage of the villa mimosa  hunterleys nodded thoughtfully  frenhofer he explained my scheme is this a friend of mine has a yacht in the harbour i believe that he would lend it to me why should we not substitute it for the yacht your master imagines that he is hiring if so all difficulties as to placing whom i desire on board and secreting them are over  it is a great scheme frenhofer assented but supposing my master should choose to telephone some small detail to the office of the man schwann  you must hire the yacht of schwann just as you were instructed hunterleys pointed out you must give orders though that it is not to leave the harbour until telephoned for then it will be the yacht which i shall borrow which will lie off the villa mimosa tonight  it is admirable frenhofer declared the more one thinks of it the more one appreciates this yacht of schwannsthe christable he calls itwas fitted out by a millionaire my master will be surprised at nothing in the way of luxury  tell me again hunterleys asked at what hour is it to be off the villa mimosa  at ten oclock frenhofer replied a pinnace is to be at the landingstage of the villa at that time mr grex monsieur douaille herr selingman and mr draconmeyer will come on board  very good now go on your errand to the man schwann you had better meet me here later in the afternoonsay at four oclockand let me know that all is in order i will bring you some particulars about my friends boat so that you will know how to answer any questions your master may put to you  it is admirable frenhofer repeated enthusiastically monsieur had better perhaps precede me  hunterleys walked through the streets back to ciros restaurant filled with a new exhilaration his eyes were bright his brain was working all the time the luncheonparty at the next table were still in the midst of their meal mr simpson was smoking a meditative cigarette with his coffee hunterleys resumed his place and ordered coffee for himself  i have been to see a poor friend who met with an accident last night he announced speaking as clearly as possible i fear that he is very ill that was his sister who fetched me away  mr simpson nodded sympathetically their conversation for a few minutes was desultory then hunterleys asked for the bill and rose  i will take you round to the club and get your carte he suggested afterwards we can spend the afternoon as you choose  the two men strolled out of the place it was not until after they had left the arcade and were actually in the street that hunterleys gripped his companions arm  simpson he declared the fates have been kind to us douaille has a fit of the nerves he will go no more to the villa mimosa seeking about for the safest meetingplace grex has given us a chance the only one of his servants who belongs to us is commissioned to hire a yacht on which they meet tonight  a yacht mr simpson replied emptily  i have a friend hunterleys continued an american i am convinced that he will lend me his yacht which is lying in the harbour here we are going to try and exchange if we succeed i shall have the run of the boat the crew will be at our command and i shall get to that conference myself somehow or other  mr simpson felt himself left behind he could only stare at his companion  tell me sir henry he begged almost pathetically have i walked into an artificial world do you mean to tell me seriously that you a member of parliament an exminister are engaged upon a scheme to get the grand duke augustus and douaille and selingman on board a yacht and that you are going to be there concealed turned into a spy i cant keep up with it as fiction it seems to me to be in the clouds as truth why my understanding turns and mocks me you are talking fairytales  hunterleys smiled tolerantly  the man in the street knows very little of the real happenings in life he pronounced the truth has a queer way sometimes of spreading itself out into the realms of fiction come across here with me to the hotel i have got to move heaven and earth to find my friend  do with me as you like mr simpson sighed resignedly in a plain political discussion or an argument with monsieur douaillewell i am ready to bear my part but this sort of thing lifts me off my feet i can only trot along at your heels  they entered the hotel de paris hunterleys made a few breathless enquiries nothing alas was known of mr richard lane he came back frowning to the steps of the hotel  if he is up playing golf at la turbie hunterleys muttered we shall barely have time  a reception clerk tapped him on the shoulder he turned abruptly around  i have just made an enquiry of the floor waiter the clerk announced he believes that mr lane is still in his room  hunterleys thanked the man and hurried to the lift in a few moments he was knocking at the door of lanes rooms his heart gave a great jump as a familiar voice bade him enter he stepped inside and closed the door behind him richard in light blue pyjamas sat up in bed and looked at his visitor with a huge yawn  say old chap are you in a hurry or anything he demanded  do you know the time hunterleys asked  no idea the other replied the valet called me at eight i told him id shoot him if he disturbed me again  its nearly three oclock hunterleys declared impressively  cant help it richard yawned throwing off the bedclothes and sitting on the edge of the bed i am young and delicate and i need my rest seriously hunterleys he added you take a chap out and make him drive you at sixty miles an hour all through the night you keep him at it till nearly six in the morning and you seem to think it a tragedy to find him in bed at three oclock in the afternoon hang it ive only had eight hours sleep  i dont care how long youve had hunterleys rejoined i am only too thankful to find you now listen is your brain working can you talk seriously  i guess so  you remember our talk last night  every word of it  the time has come hunterleys continuedyour time i mean you said that if you could take a hand youd do it i am here to beg for your help  you neednt waste your breath doing that richard answered firmly im your man go on  listen hunterleys proceeded is your yacht in commission  ready to sail at ten minutes notice the young man assured him emphatically victualled and coaled to the eyelids to tell you the truth i have some idea of abducting fedora today or tomorrow  youll have to postpone that hunterleys told him i want to borrow the yacht  shes yours richard assented promptly ill give you a note to the captain  look here i want you to understand this clearly hunterleys went on if you lend me the minnehaha well you commit yourself a bit you see its like this ive one man of my own in grexs household he came to me this morning monsieur douaille objects to cross again the threshold of the villa mimosa he fears the english newspapers there has been a long discussion as to the next meetingplace grex suggested a yacht to that they all agreed there is a man named schwann down in monaco has a yacht for hire mr grex knows about it and he has sent the man i spoke of into monaco this afternoon to hire it they are all going to embark at ten oclock tonight they are going to hold their meeting in the cabin  lane whistled softly he was wide awake now  go on he murmured go on say this is great  i want hunterleys explained your yacht to take the place of the other i want it to be off the villa mimosa at ten oclock tonight your pinnace to be at the landingstage of the villa to bring mr grex and his friends on board i want you to haul down your american flag keep your american sailors out of sight cover up the stars and stripes in your cabin have only your foreign stewards on show schwanns yacht is a costly one no one will know the difference you must get up now and show me over the boat i have to scheme somehow or other how we can hide ourselves on it so that i can overhear the end of this plot  the face of richard lane was like the face of an ingenuous boy who sees suddenly a paradise of sport stretched out before him his mouth was open his eyes gleaming  gee but this is glorious he exclaimed im with you all the way why its wonderful man its a chapter from the arabian nights over again  he leapt to his feet and rang the bell furiously then he rushed to the telephone  blue serge clothes he ordered the valet get my bath ready  any breakfast monsieur  oh breakfast be hanged no wait a moment get me some coffee and a roll ill take it while i dress hurry up yes is that the enquiry office this is mr lane send round to my chauffeur at the garage at once and tell him that i want the car at the door in a quarter of an hour righto  sit down hunterleys smoke or do whatever you want to well be off to the yacht in no time  hunterleys clapped the young giant on the shoulders as he rushed through to the bathroom  youre a brick richard he declared ill wait for you down in the hall ive a pal there  ill be down in twenty minutes or earlier lane promised what a lark     chapter xxxiv  coffee for one only   the breaking up of mr grexs luncheonparty was the signal for a certain amount of manoeuvring on the part of one or two of his guests monsieur douaille for instance was anxious to remain the escort of lady hunterleys whose plans for the afternoon he had ascertained were unformed mr grex was anxious to keep apart his daughter and lady weybourne whose relationship to richard lane he had only just apprehended while he himself desired a little quiet conversation with monsieur douaille before they paid the visit which had been arranged for to the club and the casino in the end mr grex was both successful and unsuccessful he carried off monsieur douaille for a short ride in his automobile but was forced to leave his daughter and lady weybourne alone draconmeyer who had been awaiting his opportunity remained by lady hunterleys side  i wonder he asked whether you would step in for a few minutes and see linda  she had been looking at the table where her husband and his companion had been seated draconmeyers voice seemed to bring her back to a present not altogether agreeable  i am going back to my room for a little time she replied i will call in and see linda first if you like  they left the restaurant together and strolled across the square to the hotel de paris ascended in the lift and made their way to draconmeyers suite of rooms in a silence which was almost unbroken when they entered the large salon with its frenchwindows and balcony they found the apartment deserted violet looked questioningly at her companion he closed the door behind him and nodded  yes he admitted my message was a subterfuge i have sent linda over to mentone with her nurse she will not be back until late in the afternoon this is the opportunity for which i have been waiting  she showed no signs of anger or indeed disturbance of any sort she laid her tiny white silk parasol upon the table and glanced at him coolly  well she said you have your way then i am here  draconmeyer looked at her long and anxiously skilled though he was in physiognomy closely though he had watched for many months the lights and shades the emotional changes in her expression he was yet at that moment completely puzzled she was not angry her attitude seemed to be in a sense passive yet what did passivity mean was it resignation consent or was it simply the armour of normal resistance in which she had clothed herself was he wise after all to risk everything then as he looked at her as he realised her close and wonderful presence he suddenly told himself that it was worth while risking even heaven in the future for the joy of holding her for once in his arms she had never seemed to him so maddeningly beautiful as at that moment it was one of the hottest days of the season and she was wearing a gown of white muslin curiously simple enhancing somehow or other her fascinating slimness a slimness which had nothing to do with angularity but possessed its own soft and graceful curves her eyes were bluer even than her turquoise brooch or the gentians in her hat and while his heart was aching and throbbing with doubts and hopes she suddenly smiled at him  i am going to sit down she announced carelessly please say to me just what is in your mind without reserve it will be better  she threw herself into a low chair near the window her hands were folded in her lap her eyes for some reason were fixed upon her wedding ring swift to notice even her slightest action he frowned as he discerned the direction of her gaze  violet he said i think that you are right i think that the time has come when i must tell you what is in my mind  she raised her eyebrows slightly at the sound of her christian name he moved over and stood by her chair  for a good many years he began slowly i have been a man with a purpose when it first came into my mindnot willinglyits accomplishment seemed utterly hopeless still it was there strong man though i am i could not root it out i waited there was nothing else to do but wait from that moment my life was divided my wholesoul devotion to worldly affairs was severed i had one dream that was more wonderful to me even than complete success in the great undertaking which brought me to london that dream was connected with you violet  she moved a little uneasily as though the repetition of her christian name grated this time however he was rapt in his subject  i wont make excuses he went on you know what linda iswhat she has been for ten years i have tried to be kind to her as to love i never had any ours was an alliance between two great monied families arranged for us acquiesced in by both of us as a matter of course it seemed to me in those days the most natural and satisfactory form of marriage i looked upon myself as others have thought mea cold bloodless man of figures and ambition it is you who have taught me that i have as much sentiment and more than other men a heart and desires which have made life sometimes hell and sometimes paradise for two years i have struggled life with me has been a sort of passionate compromise for the joy of seeing you sometimes of listening to you and watching you i have borne the agony of having you leave me to take your place with another man you dont quite know what that meant and i am not going to tell you but always i have hoped and hoped  and now she said looking at him i owe you four thousand pounds and you think perhaps that your time has come to speak  he shivered as though she had struck him a blow  you think he exclaimed that i am a man of pounds shillings and pence is it my fault that you owe me money  he snatched her cheques from his inner pocket and ripped them in pieces lit a match and watched them while they smouldered away she too watched with emotionless face  do you think that i want to buy you he demanded there you are free from your money claims you can leave my room this moment if you will and owe me nothing  she made no movement yet he was vaguely disturbed by a sense of having made but little progress a terrible sense of impending failure his fingers began to tremble his face was the face of a man stretched upon the rack  perhaps those words of mine were false he went on perhaps in a sense i do want to buy you buy the little kindnesses that go with affection buy your kind words the touch sometimes of your fingers the pleasant sense of companionship i feel when i am with you i know how proud you are i know how virtuous you are i know that its there in your blood the puritan instinct the craving for the one man to whom you have given yourself the involuntary shrinking from the touch of any other good women are like thatwives or mistresses mind in a sense its narrow in a sense its splendid listen to me i dont want to declare war against that instinctyet i cant perhaps even now i have spoken too soon craved too soon for the little i do ask yet god knows i can keep the seal upon my lips no longer dont let us misunderstand one another for the sake of using plain words i am not asking you to be my mistress i ask you on my knees to take from me what makes life brighter for you i ask you for the other things onlyfor your confidence for your affection your companionship i ask to see you every day that it is possible to know that you are wearing my gifts surrounded by my flowers the rough places in your life made smooth by my efforts i am your suppliant violet i ask only for the crumbs that fall from your table so long as no other man sits by your side violet cant you give me as much as this  his hand hot and trembling sought hers touched and gripped it she drew her fingers away it was curious how in those few moments she seemed to be gifted with an immense clearsightedness she knew very well that nothing about the man was honest save the passion of which he did not speak she rose to her feet  well she said i have listened to you very patiently if i owe you any excuse for having appeared to encourage any one of those thoughts of which you speak here it is i am like thousands of other women i absolutely dont know until the time comes what sort of a creature i am how i shall be moved to act under certain circumstances i tried to think last night i couldnt i felt that i had gone halfway i had taken your money i had taken it too understanding what it means to be in a mans debt and still i waited and now i know i wont even question your sincerity i wont even suggest that you would not be content with what you ask for  i have sworn it he interrupted hoarsely to be your favoured friend to be allowed near youyour guardian if you will  the words failed him something in her face checked his eloquence  i can tell you this now and for always she continued i have nothing to give you what you ask for is just as impossible as though you were to walk in your picture gallery and kneel before your great masterpiece and beg beatrice herself to step down from the canvas i began to wonder yesterday she went on rising abruptly and moving across the room whether i really was that sort of woman with your money in my pocket and the gambling fever in my pulses i began even to believe it and now i know that i am not goodbye mr draconmeyer i dont blame you on the whole perhaps you have behaved quite well i think that you have chosen to behave well because that wonderful brain of yours told you that it gave you the best chance that doesnt really matter though  he took a quick almost a threatening step towards her his face was dark with all the passions which had preyed upon the man  there is a mans last resource he muttered thickly  and there is a womans answer to it she replied her finger suddenly resting upon an unsuspected bell in the wall  they both heard its summons footsteps came hurrying along the corridor draconmeyer turned his head away struggling to compose himself a waiter entered lady hunterleys picked up her parasol and moved towards the door the man stood on one side with a bow  here is the waiter you rang for mr draconmeyer she remarked looking over his shoulder wasnt it coffee you wanted tell linda ill hope to see her sometime this evening  she strolled away the waiter remained patiently upon the threshold  coffee for one or two sir he enquired  mr draconmeyer struggled for a moment against a torrent of words which scorched his lips in the end however he triumphed  for one with cream he ordered     chapter xxxv  a new map of the earth   selingman who was leaning back in a leatherpadded chair and smoking a very excellent cigar looked around at his companions with a smile of complete approval  our host he declared bowing to mr grex has surpassed himself for a hired yacht i have seen nothing more magnificent a cabinet moselle flor de cuba cigars the best of company and an isolation beyond all question what place could suit us better  there was a little murmur of assent the four men were seated together in the wonderfully decorated saloon of what was beyond doubt a most luxurious yacht through the open porthole were visible every few moments as the yacht rose and sank on the swell the long line of lights which fringed the shore between monte carlo and mentone the mountains beyond with tiny lights flickering like spangles in a black mantle of darkness and further round still the stream of light from the casino reflected far and wide upon the black waters  none mr grex asserted confidently we are at least beyond reach of these bungling english spies there is no further fear of eavesdroppers we are entirely alone each may speak his own mind there is nothing to be feared in the way of interruption i trust monsieur douaille that you appreciate the altered circumstances  monsieur douaille who was looking very much more at his ease assented without hesitation  i must confess he agreed that the isolation we now enjoy is to a certain extent reassuring here we need no longer whisper one may listen carefully one may weigh well what is said sooner or later we must come to the crucial point this if you like is a game of makebelieve then in makebelieve germany has offered to restore alsace and lorraine has offered to hold all french territory as sacred provided france allows her to occupy calais for one year what is your object herr selingman do you indeed wish to invade england  selingman poured himself out a glass of wine from the bottle which stood at his elbow  good he said we have come to plain questions i answer in plain speech i will tell you now in a few words all that remains to be told germany has no desire to invade great britain if one may believe the newspapers there is scarcely an englishman alive who would credit this simple fact but it is nevertheless true commercially england and a certain measure of english prosperity are necessary to germany geographically there are certain risks to be run in an invasion of that country which we do not consider worth while besides an invasion even a successful one would result in making an everlasting and a bitter enemy of great britain we learnt our lesson when we took territory from france we do not need to repeat it several hundred thousands of our most worthy citizens are finding an honest and prosperous living in london several thousands of our merchants are in business there and prospering several hundreds of our shrewdest men of affairs are making fortunes upon the london stock exchange therefore we do not wish to conquer england commercially that conquest is already affected i want you monsieur douaille to absolutely understand this because it may affect your views what we do require is to strike a long and lasting blow at the navy of great britain as a somewhat larger holland great britain is welcome to a peaceful existence when she lords it over the world talks of an empire upon which the sun never sets then the time arrives when we are forced to interfere great britain has possessions which she is not strong enough to hold germany is strong enough to wrest them from her and means to do so the english fleet must be destroyed south africa then will come to germany india to russia egypt to france the rest follows as a matter of course  and what is the rest monsieur douaille asked  herr selingman was content no longer to sit in his place he rose to his feet his face had fallen into different lines his eyes flashed his words were inspired  the rest he declared is the crux of the whole matter it is the one great and settled goal towards which we who have understood have schemed and fought our way with the british navy destroyed the monroe doctrine is not worth a sheet of writingpaper south america is germanys natural heritage by every right worth considering it is our peoples gold which founded the argentine republic the brains of our people which control its destinies our eldorado is there monsieur douaille that is the country which sooner or later germany must possess we look nowhere else we covet no other of our neighbours possessions only i say that the sooner america makes up her mind to the sacrifice the better her monroe doctrine is all very well for the northern states when she presumes to quote it as a pretext for keeping germany from her natural place in south america she crosses swords with us now you know the truth and the whole truth you know monsieur douaille what we require from you and you know your reward our host has already told you and will tell you again as often as you like the feeling of his own country the francorussian alliance is already doomed it falls to pieces through sheer lack of common interests the entente cordiale is simply a fetter and a dead weight upon you monsieur douaille i put it to you as a man of common sense do you think that you as a statesmanyou see i will put the burden upon your shoulders because if you choose you can speak for your countrydo you think that you have a right to refuse from germany the return of alsace and lorraine do you think that you can look your country in the face if you refuse on her behalf the greatest gift which has ever yet been offered to any nationthe gift of egypt the old alliances are out of date the balance of power has shifted i ask you monsieur douaille as you value the prosperity and welfare of your country to weigh what i have said and what our great russian friend has said word by word england has made no sacrifices for you why should you sacrifice yourself for her  monsieur douaille stroked his little grey imperial  that is well enough he muttered but without the english navy the balance of power upon the continent is entirely upset  the balance of power only according to the present grouping of interests mr grex pointed out selingman has shown us how these must change frankly although no one can fail to realise the immense importance of south america as a colonising centre it is my honest opinion that the nation who scores most by my friend selingmans plans is not germany but france think what it means to her instead of being a secondary power she will of her own might absolutely control the mediterranean egypt with its vast possibilities its everelastic boundary falls to her hand malta and cyprus follow it is a great price that germany is prepared to pay  monsieur douaille was silent for several moments it was obvious that he was deeply impressed  this is a matter he said which must be considered from many points of view supposing that france were willing to bury the hatchet with germany to remain neutral or to place calais at germanys disposal even then do you suppose herr selingman that it would be an easy matter to destroy the british navy  we have our plans selingman declared solemnly we know very well that they can be carried out only at a great loss both of men and ships it is a gloomy and terrible task that lies before us but at the other end of it is the glory that never fades  if america douaille remarked were to have an inkling of your real objective her own fleet would come to the rescue  why should america know of our ultimate aims selingman rejoined her politicians today choose to play the part of the ostrich in the desert they take no account or profess to take no account of european happenings they have no secret service their country is governed from within for herself only as for the rest the bogey of a german invasion has been flaunted so long in england that few people stop to realise the absolute futility of such a course london is already colonised by germanscolonised that is to say in urban and moneymaking fashion english gold is flowing in a neverending stream into our country it would be the most foolish dream an ambitious statesman could conceive to lay violent hands upon a land teeming with ones own children germany sees further than this there are richer prizes across the atlantic richer prizes from every point of view  you mentioned south africa monsieur douaille murmured  selingman shrugged his shoulders  south africa will make no nation rich he replied her own people are too stubborn and powerful too rooted to the soil  monsieur douaille for the first time stretched out his hand and drank some of the wine which stood by his side his cheeks were very pale he had the appearance of a man tortured by conflicting thoughts  i should like to ask you selingman he said whether you have made any definite plans for your conflict with the british navy i admit that the days of englands unique greatness are over she may not be in a position today as she has been in former years to fight the world at the same time her one indomitable power is still whatever people may say or think her navy only last month the cabinet of my country were considering reports from their secret agents and placing them side by side with known facts as to the relative strength of your navy and the navy of great britain on paper it would seem that a german success was impossible  selingman smiledthe convincing smile of a man who sees further than most men  not under the terms i should propose to you monsieur douaille he declared remember that we should hold calais and we should be assured at least of the amiable neutrality of your fleet we have spoken of matters so intimate that i do not know whether in this absolute privacy i should not be justified in going further and disclosing to you our whole scheme for an attack upon the english navy it would need only an expression of your sympathy with those views which we have discussed to induce me to do so  monsieur douaille hesitated for several moments before he replied  i am a citizen of france he said an envoy without powers to treat my own province is to listen  but your personal sympathies selingman persisted  i have sometimes thought monsieur douaille confessed that the present grouping of european powers must gradually change if your country for instance he added turning to mr grex indeed embraces the proposals of herr selingman france must of necessity be driven to reconsider her position towards england the anglosaxon race may have to battle then for her very existence yet it is always to be remembered that in the background are the united states of america possessing resources and wealth greater than any other country in the universe  and it must also be remembered selingman proclaimed in a tone of ponderous conviction that she possesses no adequate means of guarding them that she is not a military nation that she has not the strength to enforce the carrying out of the monroe doctrine things were all very well for her before the days of wireless telegraphy of aeroplanes and airships of superdreadnoughts and cruisers with the speed of express trains she was too far away to be concerned in european turmoils today science is annihilating distance america leaving out of account altogether her military impotence would need a fleet three times her present strength to enforce the monroe doctrine for the remaindernot of this century but of this decade  then the bombshell fell a strange voice suddenly intervened a voice whose american accent seemed more marked than usual the four men turned their heads selingman sprang to his feet mr grexs face was marble in its whiteness monsieur douaille with a nervous sweep of his right arm sent his glass crashing to the floor they all looked in the same direction up to the little music gallery leaning over in a careless attitude with his arms folded upon the rail was richard lane  say he begged can i take a hand in this little discussion     chapter xxxvi  checkmate   of the four men selingman was the first to recover himself  who the hell are you and how did you get up there he roared  i am richard lane the young man explained affably and theres a way up from the musicroom you probably didnt notice it and theres a way down as you may perceive he added pointing to the spiral staircase ill join you if i may  there was a dead silence as for a moment richard disappeared and was seen immediately afterwards descending the round staircase mr grex touched selingman on the arm and whispered in his ear selingman nodded there were evil things in the faces of both men as lane approached them  will you kindly explain your presence here at once sir mr grex ordered  i say richard protested a jokes a joke but when you ask a man to explain his presence on his own boat youre coming it just a little thick eh to tell you the truth i had some sort of an idea of asking you the same question  what do you meanyour own boat draconmeyer demanded  he was perhaps the first to realise the situation richard thrust his hands into his pockets and sat upon the edge of the table  seems to me he remarked that you gentlemen have made some sort of a mistake where do you think you are anyway  on board schwanns yacht the christabel selingman replied  richard shook his head  not a bit of it he assured them this is the steamyacht minnehaha which brought me over from new york and of which i am most assuredly the owner now i come to think of it he went on there was another yacht leaving the harbour at the same time cant have happened that you boarded the wrong boat eh  mr grex was icily calm but there was menace of the most dangerous sort in his look and manner  nothing of that sort was possible he declared as you are without doubt perfectly well aware it appears to me that this is a deliberate plot the yacht which i and my friends thought that we were boarding tonight was the christabel which my servant had instructions to hire from schwann of monaco i await some explanation from you sir as to your purpose in sending your pinnace to the landingstage of the villa mimosa and deliberately misleading us as to our destination  well i dont know that ive got much to say about that richard replied easily  you are offering us no explanation selingman demanded  none richard assented coolly  selingman suddenly struck the table with his clenched fist  you were not alone up in that gallery  getting warm arent you richard murmured  selingman turned to grex  this young man is hunterleys friend theyve fixed this up between them listen  a door slammed above their heads some one had left the music gallery  hunterleys himself selingman cried  sure richard assented bright fellow selingman he continued amiably i wouldnt try that on if i were you he added turning to mr grex whose hand was slowly stealing from the back of his coat that sort of thing doesnt do nowadays revolvers belong to the last decade of intrigue youre a bit out of date with that little weapon dont be foolish i am not angry with any of you i am willing to take this little joke pleasantly but  he raised a whistle to his lips and blew it the door at the further end of the saloon was opened as though by magic a steward in the yachts uniform appeared from outside was visible a very formidable line of sailors grex with a swift gesture slipped something back into his pocket something which glittered like silver  serve some champagne reynolds richard ordered the steward who had come hurrying in and bring some cigars  the man withdrew richard seated himself once more upon the table clasping one knee  look here he said ill be frank with you i came into this little affair for the sake of a pal it was only by accident that i found my way up yondermore to look after him than anything i never imagined that you would have anything to say that was interesting to me seems i was wrong though youve got things very nicely worked out mr selingman  selingman glared at the young man but said nothing the others too were all remarkably bereft of words  dont mind my staying for a little chat do you richard continued pleasantly you see i am an american and i am kind of interested in the latter portion of what you had to say i dare say youre quite right in some respects we are a trifle too commercial and a trifle too cocksure you see things have always gone our way all the same weve got the stuff you know just consider this if i thought there was any real need for it and i begin to think that perhaps there may be i should be ready to present the united states with a dreadnought tomorrow and i dont know that i should need to spend very much less myself and he went on there are thirty or forty others who could and would do the same tidy little fleet we should soon have you see without a penny of taxation of course i know we would need the men but weve a grand reserve to draw upon in the west they are not bothering about the navy in times of peace but theyd stream into it fast enough if there were any real need  the chief steward appeared followed by two or three of his subordinates a tray of wine was placed upon the table bottles were opened but no one made any attempt to drink richard filled his own glass and motioned the men to withdraw  prefer your own wine he remarked well now thats too bad hope im not boring you  no one spoke or moved richard settled himself a little more comfortably upon the table  i cant tell you all he proceeded how interested i have been listening up there quite a gift of putting things clearly if i may be allowed to say so you seem to possess mr selingman now heres my reply as one of the poor anglosaxons from the west whove got to make room in the best parts of the world for your lubberly german colonists if you make a move in the game youve been talking so glibly about if my word counts for anything if my persuasions count for anythingand ive facts to go on you knowyoull have the american fleet to deal with at the same time as the english and i fancy that will be a trifle more than you can chew up eh im going back to america a little earlier than i anticipated of course theyll laugh at me at first in washington they dont believe much in these roundtable conferences and european plots but all the same ive got some friends there well try and remember this amiable little statement of policy of yours mr selingman nothing like being warned you know  mr grex rose from his place  sir he said since we have been and are your unwilling guests will you be so good as to arrange for us at once to relieve you of our presence  well im not so sure about that richard remarked meditatively i think id contribute a good deal to the comfort and happiness of this generation if i took you all out to sea and dropped you overboard one by one  as i presume you have no such intention mr grex persisted i repeat that we should be glad to be allowed to land  richard abandoned his indolent posture and stood facing them  you came on board gentlemen without my invitation he reminded them you will leave my ship when i chooseand that he added is not just at present  do you mean that we are to consider ourselves your prisoners draconmeyer asked with an acid smile  certainly notmy guests richard replied with a bow i can assure you that it will only be a matter of a few hours  monsieur douaille hammered the table with his fist  young man he exclaimed i leave with you i insist upon it that i am permitted to leave i am not a party to this conference i am merely a guest a listener here wholly in my private capacity i will not be associated with whatever political scandal may arise from this affair i demand permission to leave at once  seems to me theres something in what you say richard admitted very well you can come along i dare say hunterleys will be glad to have a chat with you as for the rest of you he concluded as monsieur douaille rose promptly to his feet i have a little business to arrange on land which i think i could manage better whilst you are at sea i shall therefore gentlemen wish you good evening pray consider my yacht entirely at your disposal my stewards will be only too happy to execute any orderssupper breakfast or dinner you have merely to say the word  he turned towards the door closely followed by douaille who in a state of great excitement refused to listen to selingmans entreaties  no no the former objected shaking his head i will not stay i will not be associated with this meeting you are bunglers all of you i came only to listen on your solemn assurance of entire secrecy we are spied upon at the villa mimosa we are made fools of on board this yacht no more unofficial meetings for me  quite right old fellow richard declared as they passed out and on to the deck set of wrong uns those chaps even though mr grex is a grand duke you know sir henry hunterleys dont you  hunterleys came forward from the gangway at the foot of which the pinnace was waiting  we are taking monsieur douaille ashore richard explained as the two men shook hands he really doesnt belong to that gang and he wants to cut adrift you understand my orders exactly captain he asked as they stepped down the iron gangway  perfectly sir was the prompt reply you may rely upon me i am afraid they are beginning to make a noise downstairs already  the little pinnace shot out a stream of light across the dark placid sea douaille was talking earnestly to hunterleys  pleasantest few minutes i ever spent in my life richard murmured as he took out his cigarette case     chapter xxxvii  an amazing elopement   the sun was shining brilliantly and the sky was cloudless as richard turned his automobile into the grounds of the villa mimosa soon after nine oclock on the following morning the yellowblossomed trees slightly stirred by the west wind formed a golden arch across the winding avenue the air was sweet almost faint with perfume on the terrace holding a pair of fieldglasses in her hand and gazing intently out to sea was fedora at the sound of the motorhorn she turned quickly she looked at the visitor in surprise a shade of pink was in her face lane brought the car to a standstill jumped out and climbed the steps of the terrace  what has brought you here she asked in surprise  i have just come to pay you a little visit he remarked easily i was only afraid you mightnt be up so early  she bit her lip  you have no right to come here at all she said severely and to present yourself at this hour is unheard of  i came early entirely out of consideration for your father he assured her  she frowned  my father she repeated please explain at once what you mean my father is on that yacht and i cannot imagine why he does not return  i can tell you he answered standing by her side and looking out seawards they are waiting for my orders before they let him off  she turned her head and looked at him incredulously  explain yourself please she insisted  with pleasure he assented you see i just had to make sure of being allowed to have a few minutes conversation with you free from any interruption somehow or other he added thoughtfully i dont believe your father likes me  i do not think she replied coldly that my father has any feelings about you at all except that he thinks you are abominably presumptuous  because i want to marry you  she stamped with her foot upon the ground  please do not say such absurd things explain to me at once what you mean by saying that my father is being kept there by your orders  ill try lane answered he boarded that yacht last night in mistake he thought that it was a hired one but it isnt its mine i found him there last night entertaining a little party of his friends in the saloon they seemed quite comfortable so i begged them to remain on as my guests for a short time  to remain she murmured bewildered for how long  until youve just read this through and thought it over  he passed her a document which he had drawn from his pocket she took it from him wonderingly when she had read a few lines the colour came streaming into her cheeks she threw it to the ground he picked it up and replaced it in his pocket  but it is preposterous she cried that is a marriage license  thats precisely what it is he admitted i thought wed be married at nice my sister is waiting to go along with us i said wed pick her up at the hotel de paris  severe critics of her undoubted beauty had ventured at times to say that fedoras face lacked expression there was at that moment no room for any such criticism amazement struggled with indignation in her eyes her lips were quivering her breath was coming quickly  do you meanhave you given her or any one to understand that there was any likelihood of my consenting to such an absurd scheme  i only told her what i hoped he said quietly that is all i dared say even to myself but i want you to listen to me  his voice had grown softer she turned her head and looked at him he was much taller than she was and in his grey tweed suit his head a little thrown back his straw hat clasped in his hands behind him his clear grey eyes full of serious purpose he was certainly not an unattractive figure to look upon unconsciously she found herself comparing him once more with the men of her world found herself realising even against her will the charm of his na√Øve and dogged honesty his youth his tenacity of purpose she had never been made love to like this before  please listen he begged i am afraid that your father must be in a tearing rage by now but it cant be helped he is out there and he hasnt got an earthly chance of getting back until i give the word weve got plenty of time to reach nice before he can land i just want you to realise fedora that you are your own mistress you can make or spoil your own life no one else has any right to interfere have you ever seen any one yet back in your own country amongst your own people whom you really felt that you cared forwho you really believed would be willing to lay down his life to make you happy  no she confessed simply i do not know that i have our men are not like that  it is because he went on there is no one back there who cares as i do i have spent some years of my life lookingquite unconsciously but looking all the samefor some one like you now i have found you i am glad i have waited there couldnt be any one else there never could be fedora i love you just in the way a man does love once in his life if hes lucky its a queer sort of feeling you know he continued leaning a little towards her it makes me quite sure that i could make you happy it makes me quite sure that if youll give me your hand and trust me and leave everything to me youll have just the things in life that women want wont you be brave fedora there are some things to break through i know but they dont amount to muchthey dont really and i love you you know you cant imagine yet what a wonderful difference that makes youll find out and youll be glad  she stood quite still her eyes were still fixed seawards but she was looking beyond the yacht now to the dim line where sky and sea seemed to meet the vision of her past days seemed to be drawn out before her a little monotonous a little wearisome even in their splendour more than a little empty and underneath it all she was listening to the new music and her heart was telling her the truth  you dont need to make any plans he said softly go and put on your hat and something to wear motoring bring a dressingbag if you like flossie is waiting for us and she is rather a dear you can leave everything else to me  she looked timidly into his eyes a new feeling was upon her she gave him her hand almost shyly her voice trembled  if i come she whispered you are quite sure that you mean it all you are quite sure that you will not change  he raised her hand to his lips  not in this world dear he answered with sublime confidence nor any other  she stole away from him he was left alone upon the terrace alone but with the exquisite conviction of her return promised in that last halftremulous halfsmiling look over her shoulder then suddenly life seemed to come to him with a rush a new life filled with a new splendour he was almost humbly conscious of bigger things than he had ever realised a nearness to the clouds a wonderful thrilling sense of complete and absolute happiness reluctantly he came back to earth his thoughts became practical he went to the back of his car drew out a rocket on a stick and thrust it firmly into the lawn then he started his engine and almost immediately afterwards she came she was wearing a white silk motorcoat and a thick veil behind her came a bewildered french maid carrying wraps and a manservant with a heavy dressingcase in silence these things were stowed away she took her place in the car lane struck a match and stepped on to the lawn  dont be frightened he said here goes  a rocket soared up into the sky then he seated himself beside her and they glided off  that means he explained that theyll let your father and the others off in two hours give us plenty of time to get to nice have youleft any word for him  i have left a very short message she answered to say that i was going to marry you he will never forgive me and i feel very wicked and very ungrateful  anything else he whispered leaning a little towards her  she sighed  and very happy she murmured     chapter xxxviii  honeymooning   hunterleys saw the right honourable meredith simpson and monsieur douaille off to paris early that morning then he called round at the hospital to find that sidney roche was out of danger and went on to the villa with the good news on his way back he stayed chatting with the bank manager until rather later than usual and afterwards strolled on to the terrace where he looked with some eagerness towards a certain point in the bay the minnehaha had departed mr grex and his friends then had been set free hunterleys returned to the hotel thoughtfully at the entrance he came across two or three trunks being wheeled out which seemed to him somehow familiar he stopped to look at the initials they were his wifes  is lady hunterleys leaving today he asked the luggageporter  by the evening train sir the man announced she would have caught the c√¥te dazur this morning but there was no place on the train  hunterleys was perplexed some time after luncheon he enquired for lady hunterleys and found that she was not in the hotel a reception clerk thought that he had seen her go through on her way to the sporting club hunterleys after some moments of indecision followed her he was puzzled at her impending departure unable to account for it the draconmeyers he knew proposed to stay for another month he walked thoughtfully along the private way and climbed the stairs into the club he looked for his wife in her usual place she was not there he made a little promenade of the rooms and eventually he found her amongst the spectators around the baccarat table he approached her at once  you are not playing  she started at the sound of his voice she was dressed very simply in travelling clothes and there were lines under her eyes as though she were fatigued  no she admitted i am not playing  i understood in the hotel he continued that you were leaving today  i am going back to england she announced it does not amuse me here any longer  he realised at once that something had happened a curious sense of excitement stole into his blood  if you are not playing here will you come and sit down for a few moments he invited i should like to talk to you  she followed him without a word he led the way to one of the divans in the roulette room  your favourite place he remarked is occupied  she nodded  i have given up playing she told him  he looked at her in some surprise she drew a little breath and kept her eyes steadily averted  you will probably know sometime or other she continued so i will tell you now i have lost four thousand pounds to mr draconmeyer i am going back to england to realise my own money so as to be able to pay him at once  you borrowed four thousand pounds from mr draconmeyer he repeated incredulously  yes it was very foolish i know and i have lost every penny of it i am not the first woman i suppose who has lost her head at monte carlo she added a little defiantly  does mr draconmeyer know that you are leaving he asked  not yet she answered after a moments hesitation i had an interview with him yesterday and i realised at once that the money must be paid and without delay i realised too that it was better i should leave monte carlo and break off my association with these people for the present  in a sense it was a sordid story yet to hunterleys her words sounded like music  i am very pleased indeed he said quietly that you feel like that draconmeyer is not a man to whom i should like my wife to owe money for a moment longer than was absolutely necessary  your estimate of him was correct she confessed slowly i am sorry henry  he rose suddenly to his feet an inspiration had seized him  come he declared we will pay draconmeyer back without sending you home to sell your securities come and stand with me  she looked at him in amazement  henry she exclaimed you are not going to play dont take my advice and dont  he laughed  well see he replied confidently you wouldnt believe that i was a fatalist would you i am though everything that i had hoped for seems to be happening today you have found out draconmeyer we have checkmated mr grex i have drunk the health of felicia and david briston  felicia and david briston she interrupted quickly what do you mean  you knew of course that they were engaged he explained i called round at the villa this morning after i had been to the hospital and found them busy fixing the wedding day  she looked at him vaguely  engaged she murmured why i thought  a spot of colour suddenly burned in her cheeks she was beginning to understand it was draconmeyer who had put those ideas into her head her heart gave a little leap  henry she whispered  he was already at the table however he changed five mille notes deliberately counted his plaques and turned to her  i am going to play on your principle he declared i have always thought it an interesting one see the last number was twentytwo i am going to back twenty and all the carr√©s  he covered the board around number twenty there were a few minutes of suspense then the click as the ball fell into the little space  vingthuit noir passe et pair the croupier announced  hunterleys stake was swept away he only smiled  our numbers are going to turn up he insisted cheerfully i am certain of it now do you know that this is the first time i have played since i have been in monte carlo  she watched him half in fear this time he staked on twentynine with the maximum en plein and all the carr√©s and chevaux again the few moments of suspense the click of the ball the croupiers voice  vingtneuf noir impair et passe  she clutched at his arm  henry she gasped  he laughed  open your bag he directed well soon fill it  he left his stake untouched thirtyone turned up he won two carr√©s and let the table go once without staking ten was the next number immediately he placed the maximum on number fourteen carr√©s and chevaux again the pause again the croupiers voice  quatorze rouge pair et manque  hunterleys showed no exultation and scarcely any surprise he gathered in his winnings and repeated his stake this time he won one of his carr√©s the next time quatorze turned up again for halfanhour he continued following his few chosen numbers according to the run of the table at the end of that time violets satchel was full and he was beginning to collect mille notes for his plaques he made a little calculation in his mind and decided that he must already have won more than the necessary amount  our last stake he remarked coolly  the preceding number had been twentysix he placed the maximum on twentynine the carr√©s chevaux the column colour and last dozen he felt violets fingers clutching his arm there was a little buzz of excitement all round the table as the croupier announced the number  vingtneuf noir impair et passe  they took their winnings into the anteroom beyond where hunterleys ordered tea there was a little flush in violets cheeks they counted the money there was nearly five thousand pounds  henry she exclaimed i think that that last coup was the most marvellous win i ever saw  a most opportune one at any rate he replied grimly look who is coming  draconmeyer had entered the room and was peering everywhere as though in search of some one he suddenly caught sight of them hesitated for a moment and then approached he addressed himself to violet  i have just seen linda he said she is brokenhearted at the thought of your departure  i am sorry to leave her violet replied but i feel that i have stayed quite long enough in monte carlo by the bye mr draconmeyer there is that little affair of the money you were kind enough to advance to me  draconmeyer stood quite still he looked from husband to wife  four thousand pounds my wife tells me hunterleys remarked coolly as he began to count out the notes it is very good of you indeed to have acted as my wifes banker do you mind being paid now our movements are a little uncertain and it will save the trouble of sending you a cheque  draconmeyer laughed it was not a pleasant laugh nor was it in the least mirthful  dear me he exclaimed i had forgotten that little matter as you will certainly  he accepted the notes and stuffed them into his pocket  by the bye he continued i think that i ought to congratulate you sir henry that last little affair of yours was wonderfully stagemanaged your country owes you more than it is ever likely to pay you have succeeded at any rate in delaying the inevitable  i trust hunterleys enquired politely that you were not detained upon the yacht for very long  we landed at the villa at twelve oclock this morning draconmeyer replied you know of course of the little surprise our young american friend had prepared for mr grex  hunterleys shook his head  i have heard nothing definite  he was married to the daughter of the grand duke augustus at midday at nice draconmeyer announced his serene highness received a telephone message only a short time ago  violet gave a little cry she leaned across the table eagerly  you mean that they have eloped  draconmeyer assented  all monte carlo will be talking about it tomorrow he declared the grand duke has been doing all he can to get it hushed up but it is useless i will not detain you any longer i see that you are about to have tea  we shall meet perhaps in london hunterleys remarked as draconmeyer prepared to depart  draconmeyer shook his head  i think not he replied the doctors have advised me that the climate of england is bad for my wifes health and i feel that my own work there is finished i have received an offer to go out to south america for a time very likely i shall accept  he passed on with a final bow violet looked across their table and her eyes shone  it seems like a fairy tale henry she whispered you dont know what a load on my mind that money has been and how i was growing to detest mr draconmeyer  he smiled  i was rather hating the beast myself he admitted tell me what are your plans really  i hadnt made any she confessed except to get away as quickly as i could  he leaned a little across the table  elopements are rather in the fashion he said what do you think couldnt we have a little dinner at ciros and catch the last train to nice have a look at richard and his wife and then go on to cannes and make our way back to england later  she looked at him and his face grew younger there was something in her eyes which reminded him of the days which for so many weary months he had been striving to forget  henry she murmured i have been very foolish if you can trust me once more i think i can promise that ill never be half so idiotic again  he rose to his feet blithely  it has been my fault just as much he declared and the fault of circumstances i couldnt tell you the whole truth but there has been a villainous conspiracy going on here draconmeyer selingman and the grand duke were all in it and i have been working like a slave now its all over finished this morning on richards yacht weve done what we could im a free lance now and well spend the holidays together  she gave him her fingers across the table and he held them firmly in his then she too rose and they passed out together there was a wonderful change in hunterleys he seemed to have grown years younger  come he exclaimed they call this the city of pleasure but these are the first happy moments i have spent in it well gamble in fivefranc pieces for an hour or so then well go back to the hotel and have our trunks sent down to the station dine at ciros and wire richard where are you going to stake your money  i think i shall begin with number twentynine she laughed                                       they lunched with richard and his wife a few days later at the casino at cannes the change in the two young people was most impressive fedora had lost the dignified aloofness of monte carlo she seemed as though she had found her girlhood she was brilliantly supremely happy richard on the other hand was more serious he took hunterleys on one side as they waited for the cars  we are on our way to biarritz he said by easy stages the yacht will meet us there and we are going to sail at once for america  fedora doesnt mind hunterleys asked  not in the least richard declared exultantly she knows what my duty is and hunterleys i am going to try and do it the people over there may need a lot of convincing but they are going to hear the truth from me and have it drummed into them its going to be wake up america as well as wake up england  stick at it richard hunterleys advised dont mind a little discouragement men who see the truth and arent afraid to keep on calling attention to it get laughed at a great deal people speak of them tolerantly listen to what they say doubt its reasonableness and put it at the back of their heads but in the end it does good your people and mine are slow to believe and slow to understand but the truth sinks in if one proclaims it often enough and loudly enough we are going through it in our own country just now with regard to national service for one thing here come your cars you travel in state richard  the young man laughed goodnaturedly  theres nothing in life which i could give her that fedora shant have he asserted we spent the first two days absolutely alone now her maid and my man come along with the luggage in the heavy car and we take the little racer jolly hard work they have to keep anywhere near us i can tell you say may i make a rather impertinent
