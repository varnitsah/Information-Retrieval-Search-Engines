11043881	aunt janes nieces in the red cross  by  edith van dyne  author of aunt janes nieces series flying girl series etc  the reilly  britton co chicago  1915        illustration     foreword   this is the story of how three brave american girls sacrificed the comforts and luxuries of home to go abroad and nurse the wounded soldiers of a foreign war  i wish i might have depicted more gently the scenes in hospital and on battlefield but it is well that my girl readers should realize something of the horrors of war that they may unite with heart and soul in earnest appeal for universal lasting peace and the future abolition of all deadly strife  except to locate the scenes of my heroines labors no attempt has been made to describe technically or historically any phase of the great european war  the character of doctor gys is not greatly exaggerated but had its counterpart in real life as for the little belgian who had no room for scruples in his active brain his story was related to me by an american war correspondent who vouched for its truth the other persona in the story are known to those who have followed their adventures in other books of the aunt janes nieces series

the news uncle asked miss patricia doyle as she entered the cosy breakfast room of a suite of apartments in willing square even as she spoke she pecked a little kiss on the forehead of the chubby man addressed as unclenone other if you please than the famous and eccentric multimillionaire known in wall street as john merrickand sat down to pour the coffee  there was energy in her method of doing this simple duty an indication of suppressed vitality that conveyed the idea that here was a girl accustomed to action and she fitted well into the homely scene short and somewhat squatty of form redhaired frecklefaced and pugnosed wholesome rather than beautiful was patsy doyle but if you caught a glimpse of her dancing blue eyes you straightway forgot her lesser charms  quite different was the girl who entered the room a few minutes later hers was a dark olive complexion face of exquisite contour great brown eyes with a wealth of hair to match them and the flush of a rose in her rounded cheeks the poise of her girlish figure was gracious and dignified as the bearing of a queen  morning cousin beth said patsy cheerily  good morning my dear and then with a trace of anxiety in her tone what is the news uncle john  the little man had ignored patsys first question but now he answered absently his eyes still fixed upon the newspaper  why theyre going to build another huge skyscraper on broadway at eleventh and i see the political pot is beginning to bubble all through the bronx although  stuff and nonsense uncle exclaimed patsy beth asked for news not for gossip  the news of the war uncle john added beth buttering her toast  oh the war of course he said turning over the page of the morning paper it ought to be the allies day for the germans won yesterday noby cracky beththe germans triumph again theyve captured maubeuge what do you think of that  patsy gave a little laugh  not knowing where maubeuge is she remarked my only thought is that something is wrong with the london press bureau perhaps the cables got crossedor short circuited or something they dont usually allow the germans to win two days in succession  dont interrupt please said beth earnestly this is too important a matter to be treated lightly read us the article uncle i was afraid maubeuge would be taken  patsy accepted her cousins rebuke with her accustomed good nature indeed she listened as intently as beth to the thrilling account of the destruction of maubeuge and her blue eyes became quite as serious as the brown ones of her cousin when the tale of dead and wounded was recounted  isnt it dreadful cried beth clasping her hands together impulsively  yes nodded her uncle the horror of it destroys the interest we naturally feel in any manly struggle for supremacy  this great war is no manly struggle observed patsy with a toss of her head it is merely wholesale murder by a band of selfish diplomats  tuttut warned mr merrick we americans are supposed to be neutral my dear we must not criticize  that does not prevent our sympathizing with the innocent sufferers however said beth quietly my heart goes out uncle to those poor victims of the wars cruelty the wounded and dying i wish i could do something to help them  uncle john moved uneasily in his chair then he laid down his paper and applied himself to his breakfast but his usual merry expression had faded into one of thoughtfulness  the wounded haunt me by day and night went on beth there are thousands upon thousands of them left to suffer terrible painperhaps to dieon the spot where they fell and each one is dear to some poor woman who is ignorant of her loved ones fate and can do nothing but moan and pray at home  thats the hard part of it said patsy her cousin i think the mothers and wives and sweethearts are as much to be pitied as the fallen soldiers the men know what has happened but the women dont it isnt so bad when theyre killed outright the family gets a medal to indicate that their hero has died for his country but the wounded are lost sight of and must suffer in silence with no loving hands to soothe their agony  my dears pleaded uncle john plaintively why do you insist upon flavoring our breakfast with these horrors iithere take it away i cant eat  the conversation halted abruptly the girls were likewise unnerved by the mental pictures evolved by their remarks and it was now too late to restore cheerfulness to the morning meal they sat in pensive silence for a while and were glad when mr merrick pushed back his chair and rose from the table  as beth and patsy followed their uncle into the cosy library where he was accustomed to smoke his morning cigar the little man remarked  lets see this is the seventh of september  quite right uncle said patsy  isnt this the day maud stanton is due to arrive  no replied beth she will come tomorrow morning its a good four days trip from california to new york you know  i wonder why she is coming here at this time of year said patsy reflectively and i wonder if her aunt jane or her sister flo are with her  she did not mention them in her telegram answered beth all she said was to expect her wednesday morning it seems quite mysterious that telegram for i had no idea maud thought of coming east  well we will know all about it when she arrives observed uncle john i will be glad to see maud again for she is one of my especial favorites  shes a very dear girl exclaimed patsy with emphasis it will be simply glorious to  the doorbell rang sharply there was a moments questioning pause for it was too early for visitors the pattering feet of the little maid mary approached the door and next moment a boyish voice demanded  is mr merrick at home or the young ladies or  why its ajo shouted patsy springing to her feet and making a dive for the hallway  jones said mr merrick looking incredulous  it must be declared beth for now patsys voice was blended with that of the boy in a rapid interchange of question and answer then in she came dragging him joyously by the arm  this is certainly a surprise said mr merrick shaking the tall slender youth by the hand with evident pleasure  when did you get to town asked beth greeting the boy cordially and why didnt you let us know you were on the way from faroff los angeles  well said jones seating himself facing them and softly rubbing his lean hands together to indicate his satisfaction at this warm reception its a long long story and i may as well tell it methodically or youll never appreciate the adventurous spirit that led me again to new yorkthe one place i heartily detest  oh ajo protested patsy is this the way to retain the friendship of new yorkers  isnt honesty appreciated here he wanted to know  go ahead with your story said uncle john we left you some months ago at the harbor of los angeles wondering what you were going to do with that big ship of yours that lay anchored in the pacific if i remember aright you were considering whether you dared board it to return to that mysterious island home of yours atat  sangoa said patsy  thank you for giving me a startingpoint returned the boy with a smile you may remember that when i landed in your country from sangoa i was a miserable invalid the voyage had ruined my stomach and wrecked my constitution i crossed the continent to new york and consulted the best specialistsand they nearly put an end to me i returned to the pacific coast to die as near home as possible andand there i met you  and patsy saved your life added beth  she did first however maud stanton saved me from drowning then patsy doyle doctored me and made me well and strong and now  and now you look like a modern hercules asserted patsy gazing with some pride at the bronzed cheeks and clear eyes of the former invalid and ignoring his slight proportions whatever have you been doing with yourself since then  taking a sea voyage he affirmed  really  an absolute fact for months i dared not board the arabella my sea yacht for fear of a return of my old malady but after you deserted me and came to thisthis artificial dreary bewildering  never mind insulting my birthplace sir  oh were you born here patsy then ill give the town credit so after you deserted me at los angeles  you still had mrs montrose and her nieces maud and flo stanton  i know and i love them all but they became so tremendously busy that i scarcely saw them and finally i began to feel lonely those stanton girls are chock full of business energy and they hadnt the time to devote to me that you people did so i stood on the shore and looked at the arabella until i mustered up courage to go aboard surviving that i made captain carg steam slowly along the coast for a few miles nothing dreadful happened so i made a days voyage and still ate my three squares a day that was encouraging  i knew all the time it wasnt the voyage that wrecked your stomach said patsy confidently  what was it then  ptomaine poisoning or something like that  well anyhow i found i could stand ocean travel again so i determined on a voyage the panama canal was just opened and i passed through it came up the atlantic coast andthe arabella is at this moment safely anchored in the north river  and how do you feel inquired uncle john  gloriousmagnificent the trip has sealed my recovery for good  but why didnt you go home to your island of sangoa asked beth  he looked at her reproachfully  you were not there beth nor was patsy or uncle john on the other hand there is no one in sangoa who cares a rap whether i come home or not im the last of the joneses of sangoa and while it is still my island and the entire population is in my employ the life there flows on just as smoothly without me as if i were present  but dont they need the shipthe arabella questioned beth  not now i sent a cargo of supplies by captain carg when he made his last voyage to the island and there will not be enough pearls found in the fisheries for four or five months to come to warrant my shipping them to market even then they would keep so im a free lance at present and i had an idea that if i once managed to get the boat around here you folks might find a use for it  in what way inquired patsy with interest  we might all make a trip to barbadoes bermuda and cuba brazil is said to be an interesting country id prefer europe were it not for the war  oh ajo isnt this war terrible  no other word expresses it yet it all seems like a fairy tale to me for ive never been in any other country than the united states since i made my first voyage here from sangoathe island where my eyes first opened to the world  it isnt a fairy tale said beth with a shudder its more like a horrible nightmare  i cant bear to read about it any more he returned musingly in fact ive only been able to catch rumors of the progress of the war in the various ports at which ive touched and i came right here from my ship but ive no sympathy with either side the whole thing annoys me somehowthe utter uselessness and folly of it all  maubeuge has fallen said beth and went on to give him the latest tidings finding that the war was the absorbing topic in this little household the boy developed new interest in it and the morning passed quickly away  jones stayed to lunch and then mr merricks automobile took them all to the river to visit the beautiful yacht arabella which was already they found attracting a good deal of attention in the harbor where beautiful yachts are no rarity  the arabella was intended by her builders for deep sea transit and as patsy admiringly declared looked like a baby liner while she was yachtbuilt in all her lines and fittings she was far from being merely a pleasure craft but had been designed by the elder jones the boys father to afford communication between the island of sangoa in the lower south seas and the continent of america  sangoa is noted for its remarkable pearl fisheries which were now owned and controlled entirely by this youth but his father an experienced man of affairs had so thoroughly established the business of production and sale that little remained for his only son and heir to do more than to invest the profits that steadily accrued and to care for the great fortune left him whether he was doing this wisely or not no onenot even his closest friendscould tell but he was frank and friendly about everything else  they went aboard the arabella and were received by that grim and grizzled old salt captain carg with the same wooden indifference he always exhibited but patsy detected a slight twinkle in the shrewd gray eyes that made her feel they were welcome carg a seaman of vast experience was wholly devoted to his young master indeed the girls suspected that young jones was a veritable autocrat in his island as well as aboard his ship everyone of the sangoans seemed to accept his dictation however imperative it might be as a matter of course and the gray old captainwho had seen much of the worldwas not the least subservient to his young master  on the other hand jones was a gentle and considerate autocrat unconsciously imitating his lately deceased father in his kindly interest in the welfare of all his dependents these had formerly been freeborn americans for when the island of sangoa was purchased it had no inhabitants  this fortunateor perhaps unfortunateyouth had never been blessed with a given name more than the simple initial a the failure of his mother and father to agree upon a baptismal name for their only child had resulted in a deadlock and as the family claimed a direct descent from the famous john paul jones the proud father declared that to be a jones was sufficient honor for any boy hence he should be known merely as a jones the mother called her child by the usual endearing pet names until her death after which the islanders dubbed the masters sonthen toddling around in his first trousersajo and the name had stuck to him ever since for want of a better one  with the bohemian indifference to household routine so characteristic of new yorkers the party decided to dine at a downtown restaurant before returning to willing square and it was during this entertainment that young jones first learned of the expected arrival of maud stanton on the following morning but he was no wiser than the others as to what mission could have brought the girl to new york so suddenly that a telegram was required to announce her coming  you see i left los angeles weeks ago the boy explained and at that time mrs montrose and her nieces were busy as bees and much too occupied to pay attention to a drone like me there was no hint then of their coming east but of course many things may have happened in the meantime  the young fellow was so congenial a companion and the girls were so well aware of his loneliness through lack of acquaintances that they carried him home with them to spend the evening when he finally left them at a late hour it was with the promise to be at the station next morning to meet maud stanton on her arrival     chapter ii  the arrival of the girl   a sweetfaced girl very attractive but with a sad and anxious expression descended from the pullman and brightened as she found her friends standing with outstretched arms to greet her  oh maud cried patsy usurping the first hug how glad i am to see you again  beth looked in maud stantons face and forbore to speak as she embraced her friend then jones shook both hands of the new arrival and uncle john kissed her with the same tenderness he showed his own nieces  this reception seemed to cheer maud stanton immensely she even smiled during the drive to willing squarea winning gracious smile that would have caused her to be instantly recognized in almost any community of our vast country for this beautiful young girl was a famous motion picture actress possessing qualities that had endeared her to every patron of the better class photodramas  at first she had been forced to adopt this occupation by the stern necessity of earning a livelihood and under the careful guidance of her auntmrs jane montrose a widow who had at one time been a favorite in new york social circlesmaud and her sister florence had applied themselves so intelligently to their art that their compensation had become liberal enough to enable them to save a modest competence  one cause of surprise at mauds sudden journey east was the fact that her services were in eager demand by the managers of the best producing companies on the pacific coast where nearly all the american pictures are now made another cause for surprise was that she came alone leaving her aunt jane and her sister flousually her inseparable companionin los angeles  but they did not question her until the cosy home at willing square was reached luncheon served and maud installed in the guest room then the three girls had a good long talk and presently came trooping into the library to enlighten uncle john and ajo  oh uncle what do you think cried patsy maud is going to the war  the war echoed mr merrick in a bewildered voice what on earth can  she is going to be a nurse explained beth a soft glow of enthusiasm mantling her pretty face isnt it splendid uncle  hm said uncle john regarding the girl with wonder it is certainly aasurprising venture  butsee here maudits mighty dangerous protested young jones its a tremendous undertaking andwhat can one girl do in the midst of all those horrors  maud seated herself quietly between them her face was grave and thoughtful  i have had to answer many such arguments before now as you may suspect she began in even tones but the fact that i am here well on my journey is proof that i have convinced my aunt my sister and all my western friends that i am at least determined on my mission whether it be wise or foolish i do not think i shall incur danger by caring for the wounded the red cross is highly respected everywhere these days  the red cross quoth uncle john  yes i shall wear the red cross she continued you know that i am a trained nurse it was part of my education beforebefore  i had not known that until now said mr merrick but i am glad you have had that training beth began a course at the school here but i took her away to europe before she graduated however i wish more girls could be trained for nursing as it is a more useful and admirable accomplishment than most of them now acquire  foxtrots and bunnyhugs for instance said patricia with fine disdain  patsy is a splendid nurse declared ajo with a grateful look toward that chubby miss  but untrained she answered laughingly it was just common sense that enabled me to cure your malady ajo i couldnt bandage a cut or a bullet wound to save me  fortunately said maud i have a diploma which will gain for me the endorsement of the american red cross society i am counting on that to enable me to get an appointment at the seat of war where i can be of most use  where will you go asked the boy to germany austria russia belgium or  i shall go to france she replied i speak french but understand little of german although once i studied the language  are you fully resolved upon this course maud asked mr merrick in a tone of regret  fully decided sir i am going to washington tomorrow to get my credentials and then i shall take the first steamer to europe  there was no use arguing with maud stanton when she assumed that tone it was neither obstinate nor defiant yet it conveyed a quiet resolve that was unanswerable  for a time they sat in silence musing on the many phases of this curious project then beth came to mr merricks side and asked pleadingly  may i go with her uncle  great scott he exclaimed with a nervous jump you beth  yes uncle i so long to be of help to those poor fellows who are being so cruelly sacrificed and i know i can soothe much suffering if i have the opportunity  he stared at her not knowing what to reply this quaint little man was so erratic himself in his sudden resolves and eccentric actions that he could scarcely quarrel with his niece for imitating an example he had frequently set still he was shrewd enough to comprehend the reckless daring of the proposition  two unprotected girls in the midst of war and carnage surrounded by foreigners inspired to noble sacrifice through ignorance and inexperience and hardly old enough to travel alone from hoboken to brooklyn why the things absurd he said  quite impractical added ajo nodding wisely youre both too pretty my dears to undertake such an adventure why the wounded men would all fall in love with their nurses and follow you back to america in a flock and that might put a stop to the war for lack of men to fight it  dont be silly ajo said patsy severely ive decided to go with maud and beth and you know very well that the sight of my freckled face would certainly chill any romance that might arise  thats nonsense patsy  then you consider me beautiful uncle john  i mean its nonsense about your going with maud and beth i wont allow it  oh uncle you know i can twine you around my little finger if i choose so dont for goodness sake start a rumpus by trying to set your will against mine  then side with me dear im quite right i assure you  youre always right nunkie dear she cried giving him a resounding smack of a kiss on his chubby cheek as she sat on the arm of his chair but im going with the girls just the same and you may as well make up your mind to it  uncle john coughed he left his chair and trotted up and down the room a moment then he carefully adjusted his spectacles took a long look at patsys face and heaved a deep sigh of resignation  thank goodness thats settled said patsy cheerfully  uncle john turned to the boy saying dismally  ive done everything in my power for these girls and now they defy me theyve declared a thousand times they love me and yet theyd trot off to bandage a lot of unknown foreigners and leave me alone to worry my heart out  why dont you go along asked jones im going  you  of course ive a suspicion our girls have the right instinct sirthe tender womanly instinct that makes us love them at any rate im going to stand by them it strikes me as the noblest and grandest idea a girl ever conceived and if anything could draw me closer to these three young ladies who had me pretty well snared before it is this very proposition  i dont see why muttered uncle john wavering  ill tell you why sir for themselves they have all the good things of life at their command they could bask in luxury to the end of their days if they so desired yet their wonderful womanly sympathy goes out to the helpless and sufferingthe victims of the cruellest war the world has ever knownand they promptly propose to sacrifice their ease and brave whatever dangers may befall that they may relieve to some extent the pain and agony of those wounded and dying fellow creatures  foreigners said uncle john weakly  human beings said the boy  patsy marched over to ajo and gave him a sturdy whack upon the back that nearly knocked him over  the spirit of john paul jones still goes marching on she cried my boy youre the right stuff and im glad i doctored you  he smiled looking from one to another of the three girls questioningly  then im to go along he asked  we shall be grateful answered maud after a moments hesitation this is all very sudden to me for i had planned to go alone  that wouldnt do at all asserted uncle john briskly im astonished andand grievedthat my nieces should want to go with you but perhaps the trip will prove interesting tell me what steamer you want to catch maud and ill reserve rooms for our entire party  no said jones dont do it sir  why not  theres the arabella lets use her  to cross the ocean  she has done that before it will assist our enterprise im sure to have our own boat these are troublous times on the high seas  patsy clapped her hands gleefully  thats it a hospital ship she exclaimed  they regarded her with various expressions startled doubtful admiring approving presently with added thought on the matter the approval became unanimous  its an amazing suggestion said maud her eyes sparkling  think how greatly it will extend our usefulness said beth  uncle john was again trotting up and down the room this time in a state of barely repressed excitement  the very thing he cried clever practical andehehtremendously interesting now then listen carefullyall of you its up to you jones to accompany maud on the night express to washington get the red cross society to back our scheme and supply us with proper credentials the arabella must be rated as a hospital ship and our party endorsed as a distinct private branch of the red crosswhat they call a unit ill give you a letter to our senator and he will look after our passports and all necessary papers ii helped elect him you know and while youre gone it shall be my business to fit the ship with all the supplies we shall need to promote our mission of mercy  ill share the expense proposed the boy  no you wont youve done enough in furnishing the ship and crew ill attend to the rest  and beth and i will be uncle johns assistants said patsy we shall want heaps of lint and bandages drugs and liniments and  and above all a doctor advised ajo one of the mates on my yacht kelsey by name is a halfway physician having studied medicine in his youth and practiced it on the crew for the last dozen years but what we really need on a hospital ship is a bangup surgeon  this promises to become an expensive undertaking remarked maud with a sigh perhaps it will be better to let me go alone as i originally expected to do but if we take along the hospital ship do not be extravagant mr merrick in equipping it i feel that i have been the innocent cause of drawing you all into this venture and i do not want it to prove a hardship to my friends  all right maud returned uncle john with a cheerful grin ill try to economize now that youve warned me  ajo smiled and patsy doyle laughed outright they knew it would not inconvenience the little rich man in the slightest degree to fit out a dozen hospital ships     chapter iii  the decision of doctor gys   uncle john was up bright and early next morning and directly after breakfast he called upon his old friend and physician dr barlow after explaining the undertaking on which he had embarked mr merrick added  you see we need a surgeon with us a clever keen chap who understands his business thoroughly a sawbones with all the modern scientific discoveries saturating him to his fingertips tell me where to get him  dr barlow recovering somewhat from his astonishment smiled deprecatingly  the sort of man you describe said he would cost you a fortune for you would oblige him to abandon a large and lucrative practice in order to accompany you i doubt indeed if any price would tempt him to abandon his patients  isnt there some young fellow with these requirements  mr merrick you need a physician and surgeon combined wounds lead to fever and other serious ailments which need skillful handling you might secure a young man fresh from his clinics who would prove a good surgeon but to master the science of medicine experience and long practice are absolutely necessary  weve got a halfway medicine man on the ship nowa fellow who has doctored the crew for years and kept em pretty healthy so i guess a surgeon will about fill our bill  hm i know these ships doctors mr merrick and i wouldnt care to have you and your nieces trust your lives to one in case you become ill believe me a good physician is as necessary to you as a good surgeon do you know that disease will kill as many of those soldiers as bullets  no  it is true else the history of wars has taught us nothing we havent heard much of plagues and epidemics yet in the carefully censored reports from london but it wont be long before disease will devastate whole armies  uncle john frowned the thing was growing complicated  do you consider this a wild goose chase doctor he asked  not with your fortune your girls and your fine ship to back it i think miss stantons idea of venturing abroad unattended to nurse the wounded was quixotic in the extreme some american women are doing it i know but i dont approve of it on the other hand your present plan is worthy of admiration and applause for it is eminently practical if properly handled  dr barlow drummed upon the table with his fingers musingly then he looked up  i wonder said he if gys would go if you could win him over he would fill the bill  who is gys inquired uncle john  an eccentric a character but clever and competent he has just returned from yucatan where he accompanied an expedition of exploration sent out by the geographical societyand by the way nearly lost his life in the venture before that he made a trip to the frozen north with a rescue party between times he works in the hospitals or acts as consulting surgeon with men of greater fame than he has won but gys is a rolling stone erratic and whimsical and with all his talent can never settle down to a steady practice  seems like the very man i want said uncle john much interested where can i find him  ive no idea but ill call up collins and inquire  he took up the telephone receiver and got his number  collins say im anxious to find gys have you any ideaeh sitting with you now how lucky ask him if he will come to my office at once its important  uncle johns face was beaming with satisfaction the doctor waited the receiver at his ear  whats that collins he wont come why not absurd ive a fine proposition for him eh he isnt interested in propositions what in thunder is he interested in pshaw hold the phone a minute  turning to mr merrick he said  gys wants to go on a fishing trip he plans to start tonight for the maine woods but ive an idea if you could get him face to face you might convince him  see if hell stay where he is till i can get there  the doctor turned to the telephone and asked the question there was a long pause gys wanted to know who it was that proposed to visit him john merrick the retired millionaire all right gys would wait in collins office for twenty minutes  uncle john lost no time in rushing to his motor car where he ordered the driver to hasten to the address dr barlow had given him  the offices of dr collins were impressive mr merrick entered a luxurious reception room and gave his name to a businesslike young woman who advanced to meet him he had called to see dr gys  the young woman smothered a smile that crept to her lips and led uncle john through an examination room and an operating roomboth vacant just nowand so into a laboratory that was calculated to give a well person the shivers here was but one individual a man in his shirtsleeves who was smoking a corncob pipe and bending over a test tube  uncle john coughed to announce his presence for the woman had slipped away as she closed the door the mans back was turned partially toward his visitor he did not alter his position as he said  sit down theres a chair in the southwest corner  uncle john found the chair he waited patiently a few moments and then his choler began to rise  if youre in such a blamed hurry to go fishing why dont you get rid of me now he asked  the shoulders shook gently and there was a chuckling laugh the man laid down his test tube and swung around on his stool  for a moment mr merrick recoiled the face was seared with livid scars the nose crushed to one side the mouth crooked and set in a sneering grin one eye was nearly closed and the other round and wide open a more forbidding and ghastly countenance mr merrick had never beheld and in his surprise he muttered a low exclamation  exactly said gys his voice quiet and pleasant i dont blame you and im not offended do you wonder i hesitate to meet strangers  ii was notprepared stammered uncle john  that was barlows fault he knows me and should have told you and now ill tell you why i consented to see you no never mind your own proposition whatever it is listen to mine first i want to go fishing and i havent the money none of my brother physicians will lend me another sou for i owe them all you are john merrick to whom money is of little consequence may i venture to ask you for an advance of a couple of hundred for a few weeks when i return ill take up your proposition whatever it may be and recompense you in services  he refilled and relighted the corncob while mr merrick stared at him in thoughtful silence as a matter of fact uncle john was pleased with the fellow a whimsical irrational unconventional appeal of this sort went straight to his heart for the queer little man hated the commonplace most cordially  ill give you the money on one condition he said  i object to the condition said gys firmly conditions are dangerous  my proposition went on uncle john wont wait for weeks when you hear it if you are not anxious to take it up i dont want you indeed im not sure i want you anyhow  ah youre frightened by my features most people with propositions are im an unlucky dog sir they say its good luck to touch a hunchback to touch me is the reverse way up north in a frozen sea a poor fellow went overboard i didnt get him and he drowned but i got caught between two cakes of floating ice that jammed my nose out of its former perfect contour in yucatan i tumbled into a hedge of poisoned cactus and had to operate on myselfquickly tooto save my life wild with pain i slashed my face to get the poisoned tips of thorn out of the flesh parts of my body are like my face but fortunately i can cover them it was bad surgery on another i could have operated without leaving a scar but i was frantic with pain dont stare at that big eye sir its glass i lost that optic in pernambuco and couldnt find a glass substitute to fit my face indeed this was the only one in town made for a fat spanish lady who turned it down because it was not exactly the right color  you certainly have beenehunfortunate murmured uncle john  see here said gys taking a leather book from an inside pocket of the coat that hung on a peg beside him and proceeding to open it here is a photograph of me taken before i embarked upon my adventures  uncle john put on his glasses and examined the photograph curiously it was a fine face cleancut manly and expressive the eyes were especially frank and winning  how old were you then he asked  twentyfour  and now  thirtyeight a good deal happened in that fourteen years as you may guess and now reaching for the photograph and putting it carefully back in the book state your proposition and ill listen to it because you have listened so patiently to me  mr merrick in simple words explained the plan to take a hospital ship to europe relating the incidents that led up to the enterprise and urging the need of prompt action his voice dwelt tenderly on his girls and the loyal support of young jones  dr gys smoked and listened silently then he picked up the telephone and called a number  tell hawkins ive abandoned that fishing trip he said ive got another job then he faced mr merrick his smile was not pretty but it was a smile  thats my answer sir  but we havent talked salary yet  bother the salary im not mercenary  and im not sure  yes you are im going with you do you know why  its a novel project very appealing from a humanitarian standpoint and  i hadnt thought of that im going because youre headed for the biggest war the world has ever known because i foresee danger ahead for all of us but mainly because  well  because im a cowarda natural born cowardand i can have a lot of fun forcing myself to face the shell and shrapnel thats the truth im not a liar and for a long time ive been wonderingwondering his voice died away in a murmur  well sir  dr gys roused himself  oh do you want a full confession for a long time then ive been wondering whats the easiest way for a man to die no im not morbid im simply ruined physically for the practice of a profession i love a profession i have fully mastered andill be happier when i can shake off this horrible envelope of disfigurement     chapter iv  the hospital ship   the energy of doctor gys was marvelous he knew exactly what supplies would be needed to fit the arabella thoroughly for her important mission and with unlimited funds at his command to foot the bills he quickly converted the handsome yacht into a model hospital ship gys from the first developed a liking for kelsey the mate whom he found a valuable assistant and the two came to understand each other perfectly kelsey was a quiet man more thoughtful than experienced in medical matters but his common sense often guided him aright when his technical knowledge was at fault  captain carg accepted the novel conditions thrust upon him without a word of protest he might secretly resent the uses to which his ship was being put but his young masters commands were law and his duty was to obey the same feeling prevailed among the other members of the crew all of whom were sangoans  in three days jones and maud stanton returned from washington they were jubilant over their success  weve secured everything we wanted the boy told uncle john beth and patsy with evident enthusiasm not only have we the full sanction of the american red cross society but i have letters to the different branches in the war zone asking for us every consideration not only that but your senator proved himself a brick what do you think heres a letter from our secretary of stateanother from the french charge daffairshalf a dozen from prominent ambassadors of other countries weve a free field in all europe practically that will enable us to work to the best advantage  its wonderful cried patsy  mr merrick is so well known as a philanthropist that his name was a magic talisman for us said maud moreover our enterprise commands the sympathy of everyone we had numerous offers of financial assistance too  i hope you didnt accept them said uncle john nervously  no answered the boy i claimed this expedition to be our private and individual property we can now do as we please being under no obligations to any but ourselves  thats right said uncle john we dont want to be hampered by the necessity of advising with others  by the way have you found a doctor  yes  a good one asked maud quickly  highly recommended but homely as a rail fence continued patsy as her uncle hesitated  thats nothing said ajo lightly  nothing eh well wait till you see him she replied youll never look doctor gys in the face more than once i assure you after that youll be glad to keep your eyes on his vest buttons  i like him immensely though said beth he is clever honest and earnest the poor man cant help his mutilations which are the result of many unfortunate adventures  sounds like just the man we wanted declared ajo and afterward he had no reason to recall that assertion  a week is a small time in which to equip a big ship but money and energy can accomplish much and the news from the seat of war was so eventful that they felt every moment to be precious and so they worked with feverish haste the tide of german success had turned and their great army from paris to vitry was now in full retreat fighting every inch of the way and leaving thousands of dead and wounded in its wake  how long will it take us to reach calais they asked captain carg eagerly  eight or nine days said he  we are not as fast as the big passenger steamers explained young jones but with good weather the arabella may be depended upon to make the trip in good shape and fair time  on the nineteenth of september fully equipped and with her papers in order the beautiful yacht left her anchorage and began her voyage the weather proved exceptionally favorable during the voyage the girls busied themselves preparing their modest uniforms and pumping dr gys for all sorts of information from scratches to amputations he gave them much practical and therefore valuable advice to guide them in whatever emergencies might arise and this was conveyed in the whimsical half humorous manner that seemed characteristic of him at first gys had shrunk involuntarily from facing this bevy of young girls but they had so frankly ignored his physical blemishes and exhibited so true a comradeship to all concerned in the expedition that the doctor soon felt perfectly at ease in their society  during the evenings he gave them practical demonstrations of the application of tourniquets bandages and the like while uncle john and ajo by turns posed as wounded soldiers gys was extraordinarily deft in all his manipulations and although maud stanton was a graduate nursewith little experience howeverand beth de graf had studied the art for a year or more it was patsy doyle who showed the most dexterity in assisting the doctor on these occasions  i dont know whether ill faint at the sight of real blood she said but i shall know pretty well what to do if i can keep my nerve  the application of anaesthetics was another thing fully explained by gys but this could not be demonstrated patsy however was taught the use of the hypodermic needle which maud and beth quite understood  weve a big stock of morphia in its various forms said the doctor and i expect it to prove of tremendous value in comforting our patients  im not sure i approve the use of that drug remarked uncle john  but think of the suffering we can allay by its use exclaimed maud if ever morphia is justifiable it is in war where it can save many a life by conquering unendurable pain i believe the discovery of morphine was the greatest blessing that humanity has ever enjoyed dont you doctor gys  the one good eye of gys had a queer way of twinkling when he was amused it twinkled as the girl asked this question  morphine he replied has destroyed more people than it has saved you play with fire when you feed it to anyone under any circumstances nevertheless i believe in its value on an expedition of this sort and that is why i loaded up on the stuff let me advise you never to tell a patient that we are administering morphine the result is all that he is concerned with and it is better he should not know what has relieved him  on a sunny day when the sea was calm they slung a scaffold over the bow and painted a big red cross on either side of the white ship everyone aboard wore the red cross emblem on an arm band even the sailors being so decorated uncle john was very proud of the insignia and loved to watch his girls moving around the deck in their sober uniforms and white caps  jones endured the voyage splendidly and by this time had convinced himself that he was not again to be subject to the maldemer of his first ocean trip as they drew near to their destination an atmosphere of subdued excitement pervaded the arabella for even the sailors had caught the infection of the girls eagerness and were anxious to get into action at the earliest moment  it was now that uncle john began to busy himself with his especial prize a huge motor ambulance he had purchased in new york and which had been fully equipped for the requirements of war indeed an enterprising manufacturer had prepared it with the expectation that some of the belligerent governments would purchase it and mr merrick considered himself fortunate in securing it it would accommodate six seriously wounded on swinging beds and twelve others slightly wounded who might be able to sit upon cushioned seats the motor was very powerful and the driver was protected from stray bullets by an armored hood  in addition to this splendid machine mr merrick had secured a smaller ambulance that had not the advantage of the swinging beds but could be rushed more swiftly to any desired location both ambulances were decorated on all sides with the emblem of the red cross and would be invaluable in bringing the wounded to the arabella the ship carried a couple of small motor launches for connecting the shore with her anchorage  they had purposely brought no chauffeurs with them as uncle john believed foreign drivers who were thoroughly acquainted with the country would prove more useful than the american variety and from experience he knew that a french chauffeur is the king of his profession  during the last days of the voyage mr merrick busied himself in carefully inspecting every detail of his precious vehicles and explaining their operation to everyone on board even the girls would be able to run an ambulance on occasion and the boy developed quite a mechanical talent in mastering the machines  i feel said young jones that i have had a rather insignificant part in preparing this expedition for all i have furnishedaside from the boat itselfconsists of two lots of luxuries that may or may not be needed  and what may they be asked dr gys who was standing in the group beside him  thermos flasks and cigarettes  cigarettes exclaimed beth in horror  the doctor nodded approvingly  capital said he next to our anodynes and anaesthetics nothing will prove so comforting to the wounded as cigarettes they are supplied by nurses in all the hospitals in europe how many did you bring  ten cases of about twentyfive thousand each  a quarter of a million cigarettes gasped beth  too few asserted the doctor in a tone of raillery but well make them go as far as possible and the thermos cases are also valuable cool water to parched lips means a glimpse of heaven hot coffee will save many from exhaustion youve done well my boy     chapter v  nearing the fray   on september twentyeighth they entered the english channel and were promptly signalled by a british warship so they were obliged to lay to while a party of officers came aboard the arabella was flying the american flag and the red cross flag but the english officer courteously but firmly persisted in searching the ship what he found seemed to interest him as did the papers and credentials presented for his perusal  and which side have you come to assist he asked  no side at all sir replied jones as master of the arabella the wounded the sick and helpless whatever uniform they chance to wear will receive our best attention but we are bound for calais and intend to follow the french army  the officer nodded gravely  of course said he you are aware that the channel is full of mines and that progress is dangerous unless you have our maps to guide you i will furnish your pilot with a diagram provided you agree to keep our secret and deliver the diagram to the english officer you will meet at calais  they agreed to this and after the formalities were concluded the officer prepared to depart  i must congratulate you he remarked on leaving on having the best equipped hospital ship it has been my fortune to see there are many in the service as you know but the boats are often mere tubs and the fittings of the simplest description the wounded who come under your care will indeed be fortunate it is wonderful to realize that you have come all the way from america and at so great an expense to help the victims of this sad war for the allies i thank you andgoodbye  they remembered this kindly officer long afterward for he proved more generous than many of the english they met  captain carg now steamed ahead watching his chart carefully to avoid the fields of mines but within two hours he was again hailed this time by an armored cruiser the first officer having vised the ships papers they were spared the delay of another search and after a brief examination were allowed to proceed they found the channel well patrolled by war craft and no sooner had they lost sight of one than another quickly appeared  at cherbourg a french dreadnaught halted them and an officer came aboard to give them a new chart of the mine fields between there and calais and full instructions how to proceed safely this officer who spoke excellent english asked a thousand questions and seemed grateful for their charitable assistance to his countrymen  you have chosen a dangerous post said he but the red cross is respected everywhereeven by the germans have you heard the latest news we have driven them back to the aisne and are holding the enemy well in check antwerp is under siege to be sure but it can hold out indefinitely the fighting will be all in belgium soon and then in germany our watchword is on to berlin  perhaps we ought to proceed directly to ostend said uncle john  the germans still hold it monsieur in a few days perhaps when belgium is free of the invaders you will find work enough to occupy you at ostend but i advise you not to attempt to go there now  in spite of the friendly attitude of this officer and of the authorities at cherbourg they were detained at this port for several days before finally receiving permission to proceed the delay was galling but had to be endured until the infinite maze of red tape was at an end they reached calais in the early evening and just managed to secure an anchorage among the fleet of warships in the harbor  again they were obliged to show their papers and passports now vised by representatives of both the english and french navies but this formality being over they were given a cordial welcome  uncle john and ajo decided to go ashore for the latest news and arrived in the city between nine and ten oclock that same evening they found calais in a state of intense excitement the streets were filled with british and french soldiery with whom were mingled groups of citizens all eagerly discussing the war and casting uneasy glances at the black sky overhead for signs of the dreaded german zeppelins  how about antwerp jones asked an englishman they found in the lobby of one of the overcrowded hotels  the man turned to stare at him he looked his questioner up and down with such insolence that the boys fists involuntarily doubled then he turned his back and walked away a bystander laughed with amusement he also was an englishman but wore the uniform of a subaltern  what can you expect without a formal introduction he asked young jones but ill answer your question sir antwerp is doomed  oh do you really think so inquired uncle john uneasily  its a certainty although i hate to admit it we at the rear are not very well posted on what is taking place over in belgium but its said the bombardment of antwerp began yesterday and its impossible for the place to hold out for long perhaps even now the city has fallen under the terrific bombardment  there was something thrilling in the suggestion  and then asked jones almost breathlessly  the man gave a typical british shrug  then we fellows will find work to do he replied but it is better to fight than to eat our hearts out by watching and waiting were the reserves you know and weve hardly smelled powder yet  after conversing with several of the soldiers and civiliansthe latter being mostly too unnerved to talk coherentlythe americans made their way back to the quay with heavy hearts they threaded lanes filled with sobbing women many of whom had frightened children clinging to their skirts passed groups of old men and boys who were visibly trembling with trepidation and stood aside for ranks of brisk soldiery who marched with an alertness that was in strong contrast with the terrified attitude of the citizens there was war in the airfierce relentless war in every word and action they encounteredand it had the effect of depressing the newcomers  that night an earnest conference was held aboard the arabella  as i understand it here is the gist of the situation began ajo the line of battle along the aisne is stationaryfor the present at least both sides are firmly entrenched and its going to be a long hard fight antwerp is being bombarded and although its a powerful fortress the general opinion is that it cant hold out for long if it falls there will be a rush of germans down this coast first to capture dunkirk a few miles above here and then calais itself  in other words continued uncle john this is likely to be the most important battleground for the next few weeks now the question to decide is this shall we disembark our ambulances and run them across to arras beginning our work behind the french trenches or go on to dunkirk where we are likely to plunge into the thickest of the war were not fighters you know but noncombatants bent on an errand of mercy there are wounded everywhere  they considered this for a long time without reaching a decision for there were some in the party to argue on either side of the question uncle john continued to favor the trenches as the safest position for his girls to work but the girls themselves realizing little of the dangers to be encountered preferred to follow the fortunes of the belgians  theyve been so brave and noble these people of belgium said beth that i would take more pleasure in helping them than any other branch of the allied armies  but my dear theres a mere handful of them left protested her uncle im told that at dunkirk there is still a remnant of the belgian armyvery badly equippedbut most of the remaining force is with king albert in antwerp if the place falls they will either be made prisoners by the germans or they may escape into holland where their fighting days will be ended for the rest of the war however there is no need to decide this important question tonight tomorrow i am to see the french commandant and i will get his advice  the interview with the french commandant of calais which was readily accorded the americans proved very unsatisfactory the general had just received reports that antwerp was in flames and the greater part of the city already demolished by the huge fortytwocentimetre guns of the germans the fate of king alberts army was worrying him exceedingly and he was therefore in little mood for conversation  the american consul could do little to assist them after the matter was explained to him he said  i advise you to wait a few days for your decision perhaps a dayan hourwill change the whole angle of the war strange portents are in the air no one knows what will happen next come to me from time to time and i will give you all the information i secure  dr gys had accompanied jones and mr merrick into calais today and while he had little to say during the various interviews his observations were shrewd and comprehensive when they returned to the deck of the arabella gys said to the girls  there is nothing worth while for us to do here the only wounded i saw were a few frenchmen parading their bandaged heads and hands for the admiration of the women the hospitals are well organized and quite full it is true but im told that no more wounded are being sent here the sisters of mercy and the regular french red cross force seem very competent to handle the situation and there are two government hospital ships already anchored in this port we would only be butting in to offer our services but down the line from arras south there is real war in the trenches and many are falling every day arras is less than fifty miles from herea two or three hours run for our ambulancesand we could bring the wounded here and care for them as we originally intended  fifty miles is a long distance for a wounded man to travel objected maud  true said the doctor but the roads are excellent  remember those swinging cots said ajo  we might try it said patsy anxious to be doing something couldnt we start tomorrow for arras uncle  it occurs to me that we must first find a chauffeur answered mr merrick and from my impressions of the inhabitants of calais that will prove a difficult task  why  every man jack of em is scared stiff said ajo with a laugh but we might ask the commandant to recommend someone the old boy seems friendly enough  the next day however brought important news from antwerp the city had surrendered the belgian army had made good its escape and was now retreating toward ostend closely followed by the enemy  this news was related by a young orderly who met them as they entered the hotel de ville they were also told that the commandant was very busy but would try to see them presently this young frenchman spoke english perfectly and was much excited by the mornings dispatches  this means that the war is headed our way at last he cried enthusiastically the germans will make a dash to capture both dunkirk and calais and already large bodies of reinforcements are on the way to defend these cities  english or french asked uncle john  this is french territory was the embarrassed reply but we are glad to have our allies the english to support us their general french is now at dunkirk and it is probable the english will join the french and belgians at that point  they didnt do much good at antwerp it seems remarked ajo  ah they were naval reserves monsieur and not much could be expected of them but do not misunderstand me i admire the english privatethe fighting manexceedingly were the officers as clever as their soldiers are brave the english would be irresistible  as this seemed a difficult subject to discuss uncle john asked the orderly if he knew of a good chauffeur to drive their ambulancean able careful man who might be depended upon in emergencies  the orderly reflected  we have already impressed the best drivers he said but it may be the general will consent to spare you one of them your work is so important that we must take good care of you  but when they were admitted to the general they found him in a more impatient mood than before he really could not undertake to direct red cross workers or advise them they were needed everywhere everywhere they would be welcome and now he regretted to state that he was very busy if they had other business with the department captain meroux would act as its representative  before accepting this dismissal uncle john ventured to ask about a chauffeur rather brusquely the general stated that they could ill afford to spare one from the service a desperate situation now faced the allies in flanders captain meroux must take care of the americans doubtless he could find a driver for their ambulanceperhaps a belgian  but in the outer office the orderly smiled doubtfully  a driver to be sure but such as he could furnish would not be of the slightest use to them all the good chauffeurs had been impressed and the general was not disposed to let them have one  he mentioned a belgian suggested uncle john  i know but the belgians in calais are all fugitives terrorstricken and unmanned he grew thoughtful a moment and then continued my advice would be to take your ship to dunkirk it is only a little way through a good channel and you will be as safe there as at calais for if dunkirk falls calais will fall with it from there moreover the roads are better to arras and peronne and it is there you stand the best chance of getting a clever belgian chauffeur if you wish he hesitated looking at them keenly  well sir  if you are really anxious to get to the firing line and do the most good dunkirk is your logical station if you are merely seeking the notoriety of being charitably inclined remain here  they left the young man reflecting upon his advice and gravely considering its value they next visited one of the hospitals where an overworked but friendly english surgeon volunteered a similar suggestion dunkirk he declared would give them better opportunities than calais  the remainder of the day they spent in getting whatever news had filtered into the city and vainly seeking a competent man for chauffeur on the morning of october eleventh they left calais and proceeded slowly along the buoyed channel that is the only means of approaching the port of dunkirk by water the coast line is too shallow to allow ships to enter from the open sea  on their arrival at the flemish citytwelve miles nearer the front than calaisthey found an entirely different atmosphere no excitement no terror was visible anywhere the people quietly pursued their accustomed avocations and the city was as orderly as in normal times  the town was full of belgians however both soldiers and civilians while french and british troops were arriving hourly in regiments and battalions general french the english commander in chief had located his headquarters at a prominent hotel and a brisk and businesslike air pervaded the place with an entire lack of confusion most of the belgians were reservists who were waiting to secure uniforms and arms they crowded all the hotels cafés and inns and seemed as merry and lighthearted as if no news of their kings defeat and precipitate retreat had arrived not until questioned would they discuss the war at all yet every man was on the qui vive expecting hourly to hear the roar of guns announcing the arrival of the fragment of the belgian army that had escaped from antwerp  today the girls came ashore with the men of their party all three wearing their red cross uniforms and caps and it was almost pathetic to note the deference with which all those warriorsboth bronzed and fairremoved their caps until the angels of mercy had passed them by  they made the rounds of the hospitals which were already crowded with wounded and gys stopped at one long enough to assist the french doctor in a delicate operation patsy stood by to watch this surgery her face white and drawn for this was her first experience of the sort but maud and beth volunteered their services and were so calm and deft that doctor gys was well pleased with them     chapter vi  little maurie   it was nearly evening when the americans finally returned to the quay close to which the arabella was moored as they neared the place a great military automobile came tearing along scattering pedestrians right and left made a sudden swerve caught a man who was not agile enough to escape and sent him spinning along the dock until he fell headlong a crumpled heap  ah here is work for us exclaimed doctor gys running forward to raise the man and examine his condition the military car had not paused in its career and was well out of sight but a throng of indignant civilians gathered around  there are no severe injuries but he seems unconscious reported gys let us get him aboard the ship  the launch was waiting for them and with the assistance of jones the doctor placed the injured man in the boat and he was taken to the ship and placed in one of the hospital berths  our first patient is not a soldier after all remarked patsy a little disappointed i shall let beth and maud look after him  well he is wounded all right answered ajo and without your kind permission beth and maud are already below looking after him im afraid he wont require their services long poor fellow  why didnt he get out of the way inquired patsy with a shudder  cant say preoccupied perhaps there wasnt much time to jump anyhow i suppose that car carried a messenger with important news for it isnt like those officers to be reckless of the lives of citizens  no they seem in perfect sympathy with the people she returned i wonder what the news can be ajo  for answer a wild whistling sounded overhead a cry came from those ashore and the next instant there was a loud explosion everyone rushed to the side where captain carg was standing staring at the sky  what was it captain gasped patsy  carg stroked his grizzled beard  a german bomb miss patsy but i think it did no damage  a bomb then the germans are on us  not exactly an aeroplane dropped the thing  oh where is it  the aeroplane pretty high up i reckon answered the captain i had a glimpse of it for a moment then it disappeared in the clouds  we must get our ambulances ashore said jones  no hurry sir plenty of time asserted the captain i think i saw the airship floating north so it isnt likely to bother us again just now  what place is north of us inquired the girl trembling a little in spite of her efforts at control  i think it is nieuportor perhaps dixmude answered carg i visited belgium once when i was a young man but i cannot remember it very well were pretty close to the belgian border at dunkirk  theres another cried ajo as a second whistling shriek sounded above them this time the bomb fell into the sea and raised a small waterspout some half mile distant they could now see plainly a second huge aircraft circling above them but this also took flight toward the north and presently disappeared  uncle john came hurrying on deck with an anxious face and together the group of americans listened for more bombs but that was all that came their way that night  well said patsy when she had recovered her equanimity were at the front at last uncle how do you like it  i hadnt thought of bombs he replied but were in for it and i suppose well have to take whatever comes  now came the doctor supporting the injured man on one side while maud stanton held his opposite arm gys was smiling broadlya rather ghastly expression  no bones broken sir he reported to mr merrick only a good shakeup and plenty of bruises he cant be induced to stay in bed  bed when the germans come exclaimed the invalid scornfully speaking in fair english it is absurd we can sleep when we have driven them back to their dirty faderlandwe can sleep then and rest now it is a crime to rest  they looked at him curiously he was a small manalmost a tiny manlean and sinewy and with cheeks the color of bronze and eyes the hue of the sky his head was quite bald at the top his face wrinkled he had a bushy mustache and a halfgrown beard his clothing was soiled torn and neglected but perhaps his accident accounted for much of its condition his age might be anywhere from thirty to forty years he looked alert and shrewd  you are belgian said uncle john  he leaned against the rail shaking off the doctors support as he replied  yes monsieur belgian born and american trained there was a touch of pride in his voice it was in america that i made my fortune  indeed  it is true i was waiter in a new york restaurant for five years then i retired i came back to belgium i married my wife i bought land it is near ghent i am as you have guessed a person of great importance  ah an officer perhaps civil or military inquired ajo with mock deference  of better rank than either i am a citizen  now i like that spirit said uncle john approvingly what is your name my good man  maurie monsieur jakob maurie perhaps you have met mein new york  i do not remember it but if you live in ghent why are you in dunkirk  he cast an indignant glance at his questioner but uncle johns serene expression disarmed him  monsieur is not here long  we have just arrived  you cannot see belgium from here if you are therein my countryyou will find that the german is everywhere i have my home at brussels crushed by a shell which killed my baby girl my land is devastatemy crop is taken to feed german horse and german thief there is no home left so my wife and my boy and girl i take away i take them to ostend where i hope to get ship to england at ostend i am arrested by germans not my wife and children only myself i am put in prison for three weeks they keep me and then i am put out they push me into the street no one apologize i ask for my family they laugh and turn away i search everywhere for my wife a friend whom i meet thinks she has gone to ypres for now no belgian can take ship from ostend to england so i go to ypres the wandering people have all been sent to nieuport and dunkirk still i search my wife is not in nieuport i come here three days ago i cannot find her in dunkirk she has vanished perhapsbut i will not trouble you with that this is my story ladies and gentlemen behold in mea wealthy landowner of liegethe outcast from home and country  it is dreadful cried patsy  it is fierce said the man only an american can understand the horror of that word  your fate is surely a cruel one maurie declared mr merrick  perhaps ventured beth we may help you to find your wife and children  the belgian seemed pleased with these expressions of sympathy he straightened up threw out his chest and bowed very low  that is my story he repeated but you must know it is also the story of thousands of belgians always i meet men searching for wives always i meet wives searching for husbands well it is our fatethe fate of conquered belgium  maud brought him a deck chair and made him sit down  you will stay here tonight she said  thats right said dr gys he cant resume his search until morning thats certain such a tumble as he had would have killed an ordinary man but the fellow seems made of iron  to be a waitera good waiterdevelops the muscles said maurie  ajo gave him a cigarette which he accepted eagerly after a few puffs he said  i heard the german bombs that means the enemy grows insolent first they try to frighten us with bombs then they attack  how far away do you think the germans are asked beth  nieuport les bains but they will get no nearer  no  surely not mamselle our soldiers are there awaiting them our soldiers and the french  and you think the enemy cannot capture dunkirk inquired jones  dunkirk the germans capture dunkirk it is impossible  why impossible  dunkirk is fortified it is the entrance to calais to dover and london look you msieur we cannot afford to lose this place we cannot afford to lose even nieuport which is our last stand on belgian soil therefore the germans cannot take it for there are still too many of us to kill before kitchener comes to save us he spoke thoughtfully between puffs of his cigarette and added but of course if the great english army does not come and they kill us all then it will not matter in the least what becomes of our country  mauries assertion did not wholly reassure them the little belgian was too bombastic to win their confidence in his judgment yet jones declared that maurie doubtless knew the country better than anyone they had yet met and the doctor likewise defended his patient indeed gys seemed to have taken quite a fancy to the little man and long after the others had retired for the night he sat on deck talking with the belgian and getting his views of the war  you say you had land at ghent he once asked  it is true doctor  but afterward you said brussels  maurie was not at all confused  ah i may have done so you see i traded my property  and if i am not mistaken you spoke of a home at liege  maurie looked at him reproachfully  is there not much land in belgium he demanded and is a rich man confined to one home liege was my summer home in the winter i removed to antwerp  you said ghent  ghent it was doctor misfortune has dulled my brain i am not the man i was he added with a sigh  nevertheless said gys you still possess the qualities of a good waiter whatever happens here maurie you can always go back to america     chapter vii  on the firing line   next morning they were all wakened at an early hour by the roar of artillery dimly heard in the distance the party aboard the arabella quickly assembled on deck where little maurie was found leaning over the rail  theyre at it he remarked wagging his head the germans are at nieuport now and some of them are over against pervyse i hear sounds from dixmude too the rattle of machine guns it will be a grand battle this i wonder if our albert is there  who is he asked patsy  the king they told me yesterday he had escaped  we must get the ambulances out at once said beth  ill attend to that replied uncle john partaking of the general excitement warp up to the dock captain carg and ill get some of those men to help us swing the cars over the side  how about a chauffeur asked dr gys who was already bringing out bandages and supplies for the ambulances  if we cant find a man ill drive you myself declared ajo  but you dont know the country  gys turned to the little belgian  cant you find us a driver he asked we want a steady competent man to run our ambulance  where are you going asked maurie  to the firing line  good i will drive you myself  you do you understand a car  i am an expert monsieur  a waiter in a restaurant  pah that was five years ago i will show you i can drive any car ever madeand i know every inch of the way  then youre our man exclaimed mr merrick much relieved  as the yacht swung slowly alongside the dock the belgian said  while you get ready i will go ashore for news when i come backvery quickthen i will know everything  before he ran down the ladder patsy clasped around his arm a band bearing the insignia of the red cross he watched her approvingly with little amused chuckles and then quickly disappeared in the direction of the town  he doesnt seem injured in the least by his accident said the girl looking after him as he darted along  no returned gys he is one of those fellows who must be ripped to pieces before they can feel anything but let us thank heaven he can drive a car  mr merrick had no difficulty in getting all the assistance required to lower the two ambulances to the dock they had already been set up and put in order so the moment they were landed they were ready for use  a few surgical supplies were added by dr gys and then they looked around for the belgian although scarce an hour had elapsed since he departed he came running back just as he was needed puffing a little through haste his eyes shining with enthusiasm  albert is there he cried the king and his army are at nieuport they will open the dykes and flood all the country but the main road and then we can hold the enemy in check they will fight those germans but they cannot advance for we will defend the road and the sand dunes  arent they fighting now asked jones  oh yes some of the big guns are spitting but what is that a few will fall but we have yet thousands to face the german horde  let us start at once pleaded maud  maurie began to examine the big ambulance he was spry as a cat in ten minutes he knew all that was under the hood had tested the levers looked at the oil and gasoline supply and started the motor  ill sit beside you to help in case of emergency said ajo taking his place dr gys dr kelsey and the three girls sat inside patsy had implored uncle john not to go on this preliminary expedition and he had hesitated until the last moment but the temptation was too strong to resist and even as the wheels started to revolve he sprang in and closed the door behind him  you are my girls he said and wherever you go ill tag along  maurie drove straight into the city and to the north gate jones clanging the bell as they swept along every vehicle gave them the right of way and now and then a cheer greeted the glittering new red cross ambulance which bore above its radiator a tiny fluttering american flag  they were not stopped at the gate for although strict orders had been issued to allow no one to leave dunkirk the officer in charge realized the sacred mission of the americans and merely doffed his cap in salutation as the car flashed by  the road to furnes was fairly clear but as they entered that town they found the streets cluttered with troops military automobiles supply wagons artillery ammunition trucks and bicycles the boy clanged his bell continuously and as if by magic the way opened before the red cross and cheers followed them on their way  the eyes of the little belgian were sparkling like jewels his hands on the steering wheel were steady as a rock he drove with skill and judgment just now the road demanded skill for a stream of refugees was coming toward them from nieuport and a stream of military motors bicycles and wagons with now and then a horseman flowed toward the front a mile or two beyond furnes they came upon a wounded soldier one leg bandaged and stained with blood while he hobbled along leaning upon the shoulder of a comrade whose left arm hung helpless  maurie drew up sharply and beth sprang out and approached the soldiers  get inside she said in french  no replied one smiling we are doing nicely thank you hurry forward for they need you there  who dressed your wounds she inquired  the red cross there are many there hard at work but more are needed hurry forward for some of our boys did not get off as lightly as we  she jumped into the ambulance and away it dashed but progress became slower presently the road was broad and high great hillocks of sandthe duneslay between it and the ocean on the other side the water from the opened dykes was already turning the fields into an inland sea in some places it lapped the edges of the embankment that formed the roadway  approaching nieuport they discovered the dunes to be full of soldiers who had dug pits behind the sandy hillocks for protection and in them planted the dogartillery and one or two large machine guns these were trained on the distant line of germans who were also entrenching themselves all along the edge of the village the big guns were in action and there was a constant interchange of shot and shell from both sides  as maurie dodged among the houses with the big car a shell descended some two hundred yards to the left of them exploded with a crash and sent a shower of brick and splinters high into the air a little way farther on the ruins of a house completely blocked the street and they were obliged to turn back and seek another passage thus partially skirting the town they at last left the houses behind them and approached the firing line halting scarcely a quarter of a mile distant from the actual conflict  as far as the eye could reach from nieuport to the sea at the left and on toward ypres at the right of them the line of belgians french and british steadily faced the foe close to where they halted the ambulance stood a detachment that had lately retired from the line their places having been taken by reserves one of the officers told mr merrick that they had been facing bullets since daybreak and the men seemed almost exhausted their faces were blackened by dust and powder and their uniforms torn and disordered many stood without caps or coats despite the chill in the air and yet these fellows were laughing together and chatting as pleasantly as children just released from school even those who had wounds made light of their hurts clouds of smoke hovered low in the air the firing was incessant  our girls were thrilled by this spectacle as they had never been thrilled beforeperhaps never might be again while they still kept their seats maurie started with a sudden jerk made a sharp turn and ran the ambulance across a ridge of solid earth that seemed to be the only one of such character amongst all that waste of sand it brought them somewhat closer to the line but their driver drew up behind a great dune that afforded them considerable protection  fifty yards away was another ambulance with its wheels buried to the hubs in the loose sand red cross nurses and men wearing the emblem on their arms and caps were passing here and there assisting the injured with first aid temporarily bandaging heads arms and legs or carrying to the rear upon a stretcher a more seriously injured man most of this corps were french a few were english some were belgian our friends were the only americans on the field  uncle johns face was very grave as he alighted in the wake of his girls who paid no attention to the fighting but at once ran to assist some of the wounded who came staggering toward the ambulance some even creeping painfully on hands and knees in all mr merricks conceptions of the important mission they had undertaken nothing like the nature of this desperate conflict had even dawned upon him he had known that the red cross was respected by all belligerents and that knowledge had led him to feel that his girls would be fairly safe but never had he counted on spent bullets stray shells or the mad rush of a charge  very good cried maurie briskly here we see what no one else can see the red cross is a fine passport to the grand stand of war  come with mequick shouted ajo his voice sounding shrill through the din i saw a fellow knocked outthereover yonder  as he spoke he grabbed a stretcher and ran forward maurie following at his heels uncle john saw the smoke swallow them up saw beth and maud each busy with lint plasters and bandages saw patsy supporting a tall grizzled warrior who came limping toward the car then he turned and saw doctor gys crouching low against the protecting sand his disfigured face working convulsively and every limb trembling as with an ague     chapter viii  the coward   great heavens gasped mr merrick running toward the doctor are you hit  gys looked up at him appealingly and nodded  where did it strike you was it a bulletor what  the doctor wrung his hands moaning pitifully uncle john bent over him  tell me he said tell me gys  iim scared sirssscared stiff its that yellow sssstreak in me iicant help it sir then he collapsed crouching lifelessly close to the sand  uncle john was amazed he drew back with such an expression of scorn that gys lying with face upward rolled over to hide his own features in the sand but his form continued to twist and shake convulsively  patsy came up with her soldier whose gaudy uniform proclaimed him an officer he had a rugged worn face gray hair and mustache stern eyes his left side was torn and bleeding where a piece of shell had raked him from shoulder to knee no moan did he utter as mr merrick and the girl assisted him to one of the swinging beds and then patsy with white set face but steady hands began at once to cut away the clothing and get at the wound this was her first practical experience and she meant to prove her mettle or perish in the attempt  uncle john skipped over to the sand bank and clutched gys savagely by the collar  get up he commanded heres a man desperately wounded who needs your best skilland at once  gys pulled himself free and sat up seeming dazed for the moment then he rubbed his head briskly with both hands collected his nerve and slowly rose to his feet he cast fearful glances at the firing line but the demand for his surgical skill was a talisman that for a time enabled him to conquer his terror with frightened backward glances he ran to the ambulance and made a dive into it as if a pack of wolves was at his heels  safely inside one glance at the wounded man caused gys to stiffen suddenly he became steady and alert and noting that patsy had now bared a portion of the gaping wound the doctor seized a thermos flask of hot water and in a moment was removing the clotted blood in a deft and intelligent manner  now came jones and maurie bearing the man they had picked up as they set the stretcher down uncle john came over  shall we put him inside asked mr merrick  no use i think panted the belgian  wheres the doctor asked ajo  kelsey who had been busy elsewhere now approached and looked at the soldier on the stretcher  the man is dead he said he doesnt need us now  off with him then cried maurie and they laid the poor fellow upon the sand and covered him with a cloth come then urged the little chauffeur excitedly lots more out there are still alive we get one quick  they left in a run in one direction while kelsey who had come to the ambulance for supplies went another way mr merrick looked around for the other two girls only maud stanton was visible through the smoky haze uncle john approached her just as a shell dropped into the sand not fifty feet away it did not explode but plowed a deep furrow and sent a shower of sand in every direction  maud had just finished dressing a bullet wound in the arm of a young soldier who smiled as he watched her then as she finished the work he bowed low muttered his thanks and catching up his gun rushed back into the fray it was a flesh wound and until it grew more painful he could still fight  where are the germans asked uncle john i havent seen one yet  as he spoke a great cheer rose from a thousand throats the line before them wavered an instant and then rushed forward and disappeared in the smoke of battle  is it a charge do you think asked maud as they stood peering into the haze  ii dont know he stammered this is soso bewilderingthat it all seems like a dream wheres beth  i dont know  are you looking for a young ladya nurse asked a voice beside them shes over yonder he swung one arm toward the distant sand dunes the other was in a sling she has just given me first aid and sent me to the reargod bless her then he trailed on a british tommy atkins while with one accord maud and uncle john moved in the direction he had indicated  she mustnt be so reckless said beths uncle nervously its bad enough back here but every step nearer the firing line doubles the danger  i do not agree with you sir answered maud quietly a man was killed not two paces from me a little while ago  he shuddered and wiped the sweat from his forehead with a handkerchief but made no reply they climbed another line of dunes and in the hollow beyond came upon several fallen soldiers one of whom was moaning with pain maud ran to kneel beside him and in a twinkling had her hypodermic needle in his arm  bear it bravely she said in french the pain will stop in a few minutes and then ill come and look after you  he nodded gratefully still moaning and she hurried to rejoin mr merrick  beth must be in the next hollow said uncle john as she overtook him and his voice betrayed his nervous tension i do wish you girls would not be so reckless  yes they found her in the next hollow where several men were grouped about her she was dressing the shattered hand of a soldier while two or three others were patiently awaiting her services just beside her a sweetfaced sister of mercy was bending over a dying man comforting him with her prayers over the ridge of sand could be heard the ping of small arms mingled with the hoarse roar of machine guns another great shoutlong and enthusiasticwas borne to their ears  that is good said a tall man standing in the group about beth i think from the sound we have captured their guns  im sure of it your majesty replied the one whom beth was attending there that will do for the present i thank you and now let us get forward  as they ran toward the firing uncle john exclaimed  his majesty i wonder who they are  that said a private soldier an accent of pride in his voice is our albert  the king  yes monsieur he is the tall one the other is general mays im sure we have driven the germans back and that is lucky for before our charge they had come too close for comfort  the king gave me a ring said beth displaying it he seemed glad i was here to help his soldiers but warned me to keep further away from the line king albert speaks english perfectly and told me he loves america better than any other country except his own  he has traveled in your country explained the soldier but then our albert has traveled everywherebefore he was king  betwixt them maud and beth quickly applied first aid to the others in the group and then uncle john said  let us take the kings advice and get back to the ambulance we left only patsy and dr gys there and im sure you girls will be needed  on their return they came upon a man sitting in a hollow and calmly leaning against a bank of sand smoking a cigarette he wore a gray uniform  ah a german exclaimed maud she ran up to him and asked are you hurt  he glanced at her uniform nodded and pointed to his left foot it had nearly all been torn away below the ankle a handkerchief was twisted about the leg forming a rude tourniquet just above the wound and this had served to stay the flow of blood  run quickly for the stretcher said maud to uncle john i will stay with him until your return  without a word he hurried away beth following they found on reaching the ambulance that maurie and jones had been busy five of the swinging beds were already occupied  save the other one said beth maud has found a german then she hurried to assist patsy as the two doctors had their hands full  jones and maurie started away with the stretcher uncle john guiding them to the dunes where maud was waiting and presently they had the wounded german comfortably laid in the last bed  now then back to the ship said gys we have in our care two lives at least that can only be saved by prompt operations  maurie got into the drivers seat  careful now cautioned jones beside him  of course replied the belgian starting the motor there are many sores inside but if they get a jolt now and then it will serve to remind them that they are suffering for their country  he began to back up for the sand ahead was too deep for a turn and the way he managed the huge car along that narrow ridge aroused the admiration of ajo who alone was able to witness the marvelous performance slowly with many turns they backed to the road where maurie swung the ambulance around and then stopped with a jerk that drew several groans from the interior of the car  whats wrong asked mr merrick sticking his head from a window  we nearly ran over a man answered jones climbing down from his seat our front wheels are right against him but maurie stopped in time  lying flat upon his face diagonally across the roadway was the form of a man in the blueandred uniform of the belgian army maurie backed the ambulance a yard or so as maud sprang out and knelt beside the prostrate form  the firing which had lulled for a few minutes suddenly redoubled in fury there rose a wild exultant shout gradually drawing nearer  quick shouted gys trembling and wringing his hands the germans are charging drive on mandrive on  but maurie never moved  the germans are charging sure enough he answered as the line of retreating belgians became visible but they must stop here for weve blocked the road  all eyes but those of maud were now turned upon the fray which was practically a hand to hand conflict nearer and nearer came the confused mass of warriors and then scarce a hundred yards away it halted and the belgians stood firm  he isnt dead said maud coming to the car help me to put him inside  there is no room protested gys  the girl looked at him scornfully  we will make room she replied  a bullet shattered a pane of glass just beside the crouching doctor but passed on through an open window without injuring anyone in fact bullets were singing around them with a freedom that made others than dr gys nervous it was chubby little uncle john who helped jones carry the wounded man to the ambulance where they managed to stretch him upon the floor this arrangement sent patsy to the front seat outside with maurie and ajo although her uncle strongly protested that she had no right to expose her precious life so wantonly  there was little time for argument however even as the girl was climbing to her seat the line of belgians broke and came pouring toward them maurie was prompt in starting the car and the next moment the ambulance was rolling swiftly along the smooth highway in the direction of dunkirk and the sounds of fray grew faint behind them     chapter ix  courage or philosophy   i never realized said maud delightedly what a strictly modern professional hospital ship uncle john has made of this until we put it to practical use i am sure it is better than those makeshifts we observed at calais and more comfortable than those crowded hospitals on land every convenience is at our disposal and if our patients do not recover rapidly it will be because their condition is desperate  she had just come on deck after a long and trying session in assisting doctors gys and kelsey to care for the injured a session during which beth and patsy had also stood nobly to their gruesome task there were eleven wounded altogether in their care and although some of these were in a critical condition the doctors had insisted that the nurses needed rest  it is dr gys who deserves credit for fitting the ship replied mr merrick modestly to mauds enthusiastic comment and ajo is responsible for the ship itself which seems admirably suited to our purpose by the way how is gys behaving now is he still shaking with fear  no he seems to have recovered his nerve isnt it a terrible affliction  cowardice well my dear it is certainly an unusual affliction in this country and in these times i have been amazed today at the courage i have witnessed these belgians are certainly a brave lot  but no braver than the german we brought with us replied maud thoughtfully one would almost think he had no sensation yet he must be suffering terribly the doctor will amputate the remnants of his foot in an hour or so but the man positively refuses to take an anaesthetic  does he speak english or french  no only german but captain carg understands german and so he has been acting as our interpreter  how about the belgian we picked up on the road  he hasnt recovered consciousness yet he is wounded in the back and in trying to get to the rear became insensible from loss of blood  from what i saw i wouldnt suppose any belgian could be wounded in the back remarked uncle john doubtfully  it was a shell she said and perhaps exploded behind him its a bad wound dr gys says but if he regains strength he may recover  during this conversation patsy doyle was lying in her stateroom below and crying bitterly while her cousin beth strove to soothe her all unused to such horrors as she had witnessed that day the girl had managed to retain her nerve by sheer force of will until the red cross party had returned to the ship and extended first aid to the wounded but the moment dr gys dismissed her she broke down completely  beth was no more accustomed to bloodshed than her cousin but she had anticipated such scenes as they had witnessed inasmuch as her year of training as nurse had prepared her for them she had also been a close student of the daily press and from her reading had gleaned a knowledge of the terrible havoc wrought by this great war had patsy not given way perhaps beth might have done so herself and really it was maud stanton who bore the ordeal with the most composure  after a half hour on deck maud returned to the hospital section quite refreshed and proceeded to care for the patients she alone assisted gys and kelsey to amputate the germans foot an operation the man bore splendidly quite unaware however that they had applied local anaesthetics to dull the pain dr gys was a remarkably skillful surgeon and he gave himself no rest until every one of the eleven had received such attention as his wounds demanded even kelsey felt the strain by that time and as maud expressed her intention of remaining to minister to the wants of the crippled soldiers the two doctors went on deck for a smoke and a brief relaxation  by this time beth had quieted patsy mainly by letting her have her cry out and now brought her on deck to join the others and get the fresh air so quickly had events followed one another on this fateful day that it was now only four oclock in the afternoon none of them had thought of luncheon so the ships steward now brought tea and sandwiches to those congregated on deck  as they sat together in a group drinking tea and discussing the exciting events of the day little maurie came sauntering toward them and removed his cap  your pardon said he butare the wounded all cared for  as well as we are able to care for them at present answered beth and let me thank you jakob maurielet us all thank youfor the noble work you did for us today  pah it was nothing said he shifting from one foot to another i enjoyed it mamselle it was such fun to dive into the battle and pull out the wounded it helped them you see and it gave us a grand excitement otherwise had i not gone with you i would be as ignorant as all in dunkirk still are for the poor people do not yet know what has happened at the front  we hardly know ourselves what has happened said uncle john we can hear the boom of guns yet even at this distance and we left the battle line flowing back and forth like the waves of the ocean have a cup of tea maurie  the man hesitated  i do not like to disturb anyone he said slowly but if one of the young ladies is disengaged i would be grateful if she looks at my arm  your arm exclaimed beth regarding him wonderingly as he stood before her  maurie smiled  it is hardly worth mentioning mamselle but a bullet  take off your coat she commanded rising from her seat to assist him  maurie complied his shirt was stained with blood beth drew out her scissors and cut away the sleeve of his left arm a bullet had passed directly through the flesh but without harming bone or muscle  why didnt you tell us before she asked reproachfully  it amounted to so little beside the other hurts you had to attend he answered i am shamed mamselle that i came to you at all a little water and a cloth will make it all right  patsy had already gone for the water and in a few minutes beth was deftly cleansing the wound  how did it happen maurie asked jones i was with you most of the time and noticed nothing wrong besides you said nothing about it  it was on the road just as we picked up that fallen soldier with the hole in his back the fight jumped toward us pretty quick you remember and while i sat at the wheel the bullet came i knew when it hit me but i also knew i could move my arm so what did it matter i told myself to wait till we got to the ship had we stayed there longer we might all have stopped bulletsand some bullets might have stopped us he grinned as if the aphorism amused him and added to know when to run is the perfection of courage  does it hurt asked uncle john as beth applied the lint and began winding the bandage  it reminds me it is there monsieur but i will be ready for another trip tomorrow thank you mamselle instead of the tea i would like a little brandy  give him some in the tea suggested gys noting that maurie swayed a little sit down man and be comfortable thats it id give a million dollars for your nerve  have you so much money asked maurie  no  then i cannot see that you lack nerve said the little belgian thoughtfully i was watching you today msieur doctor and i believe what you lack is courage  gys stared so hard at him with the one good eye that even maurie became embarrassed and turned away his head sipping his tea and brandy he presently resumed in a casual tone  never have i indulged in work of more interest than this we go into the thick of the fight yet are we safe from harm we do good to both sides because the men who do the fighting are not to blame for the war at all the leaders of politics say to the generals we have declared war go and fight the generals say to the soldiers we are told to fight so come on we do not know why but it is our duty because it is our profession so go and die or get shot to pieces or lose some arms and legs as it may happen the business of the soldiers is to obey they must back up the policies of their country right or wrong but do those who send them into danger ever get hurt not to the naked eye  why youre quite a philosopher maurie said patsy  it is true agreed the belgian but philosophy is like courageeasy to assume we strut and talk big we call the politicians sharks the soldiers fools but does it do any good the war will go on the enemy will destroy our homes separate our families take away our bread and leave us to starve but we have the privilege to philosophize if we like for myself i thank them for nothing  i suppose you grieve continually for your wife said patsy  not so much that mamselle but i know she is grieving for me he replied  as soon as we find time continued the girl we intend to search for your wife and children i am sure we can find them for you  maurie moved uneasily in his chair  i beg you to take no trouble on my account said he with the red cross you have great work to accomplish what is the despair of one poor walloon to you  it is a great deal to us maurie returned the girl earnestly you have been a friend in need without you we could not have made our dash to the front today we shall try to repay you by finding your wife  he was silent but his troubled look told of busy thoughts  what does she look like inquired beth have you her photograph  no she would not make a good picture mamselle he answered with a sigh clarette is large she is fat she has a way of scowling when one does not bring in more wood than the fire can eat up and she is very religious  with that description i am sure we can find her cried patsy enthusiastically  he seemed disturbed  if you please said he plaintively clarette is quite able to take care of herself she has a strong will  but if you know she is safe it will relieve your anxiety suggested beth you told us yesterday you had been searching everywhere for her  if i said everywhere i was wrong for poor clarette must be somewhere and since yesterday i have been thinking with more deliberation and i have decided he added his tone becoming confidential that it is better i do not find clarette just now it might destroy my usefulness to the red cross  but your children protested patsy surely you cannot rest at ease with your two dear children wandering about in constant danger  to be frank mamselle said he they are not my children i had a baby but it was killed as i told you the boy and girl i have mentioned were born when clarette was the wife of another mana blacksmith at dinantwho had a sad habit of beating her  but you love the little ones i am sure  he shook his head  they have somewhat the temper of their father the blacksmith i took them when i took clarettejust as i took the silver spoons and the checkered tablespread she brought with herbut now that a cruel fate has separated me from the children perhaps it is all for the best  the doctor gave a snort of disgust while ajo smiled the girls were too astonished to pursue the conversation but now realized that mauries private affairs did not require their good offices to untangle uncle john was quite amused at the belgians confession and was the only one to reply  fate often seems cruel when she is in her happiest mood said he perhaps maurie your clarette will come to you without your seeking her for all belgium seems headed toward france just now what do you think will the germans capture dunkirk  the man brightened visibly at this turn in the conversation  not today sir not for days to come he replied the french cannot afford to lose dunkirk and by tomorrow they will pour an irresistible horde against the german invader if we stay here we are sure to remain in the rear of the firing line     chapter x  the wars victims   while the others were conversing on deck maud stanton was ministering to the maimed victims of the wars cruelty who tossed and moaned below the main cabin and its accompanying staterooms had been fitted with all the conveniences of a modern hospital twentytwo could easily be accommodated in the rooms and a dozen more in the cabin so that the eleven now in their charge were easily cared for of these only three had been seriously injured one was the german who however was now sleeping soundly under the influence of the soothing potion that followed his operation the mans calmness and iron nerve indicated that he would make a rapid recovery another was the young belgian soldier picked up in the roadway near the firing line who had been shot in the back and had not yet recovered consciousness dr gys had removed several bits of exploded shell and dressed the wound shaking his head discouragingly but since the young man was still breathing with a fairly regular respiration no attempt was made to restore him to his senses  the third seriously injured was a french sergeant whose body was literally riddled with shrapnel a brief examination had convinced gys that the case was hopeless  he may live until morning was the doctors report as he calmly looked down upon the moaning sergeant but no longer meanwhile we must prevent his suffering  this he accomplished by means of powerful drugs the soldier soon lay in a stupor awaiting the end and nothing more could be done for him  of the others two belgians with bandaged heads were playing a quiet game of écarté in a corner of the cabin while another with a slight wound in his leg was stretched upon a couch reading a book a young french officer who had lost three fingers of his hand was cheerfully conversing with a comrade whose scalp had been torn by a bullet and who declared that in two days he would return to the front the others maud found asleep in their berths or lying quietly to ease their pain it was remarkable however how little suffering was caused these men by flesh wounds once they were properly dressed and the patients made comfortable with food and warmth and the assurance of proper care  so it was that maud found her duties not at all arduous this evening indeed the sympathy she felt for these brave men was so strong that it wearied her more than the actual work of nursing them a sip of water here a cold compress there the administration of medicines to keep down or prevent fever little attentions of this character were all that were required speaking french fluently she was able to converse with all those under her charge and all seemed eager to relate to their beautiful nurse their experiences hopes and griefs soon she realized she was beginning to learn more of the true nature of war than she had ever gleaned from the correspondents of the newspapers  when dinner was served in the forward cabin beth relieved maud and after the evening meal dr gys made another inspection of his patients all seemed doing well except the young belgian the condition of the french sergeant was still unchanged some of those with minor injuries were ordered on deck for a breath of fresh air  patsy relieved beth at midnight and maud came on duty again at six oclock having had several hours of refreshing sleep she found patsy trembling with nervousness for the sergeant had passed away an hour previous and the horror of the event had quite upset the girl  oh it is all so unnecessary she wailed as she threw herself into mauds arms  we must steel ourselves to such things dear said maud soothing her for they will be of frequent occurrence i fear and we must be grateful and glad that we were able to relieve the poor mans anguish and secure for him a peaceful end  i know answered patsy with a little sob but its so dreadful oh what a cruel hateful thing war is  from papers found on the sergeant uncle john was able to notify his relatives of his fate his home was in a little village not fifty miles away and during the day a brother arrived to take charge of the remains and convey them to their last resting place  the following morning captain carg was notified by the authorities to withdraw the arabella to an anchorage farther out in the bay and thereafter it became necessary to use the two launches for intercourse between the ship and the city continuous cannonading could be heard from the direction of nieuport dixmude and ypres and it was evident that the battle had doubled in intensity at all points owing to heavy reinforcements being added to both sides but as maurie had predicted the allies were able to hold the foe at bay and keep them from advancing a step farther  uncle john had not been at all satisfied with that first days experience at the front he firmly believed it was unwise to the verge of rashness to allow the girls to place themselves in so dangerous a position during a serious consultation with jones kelsey captain carg and dr gys the men agreed upon a better plan of procedure  the three nurses have plenty to do in attending to the patients in our hospital said gys and when the ship has its full quota of wounded they will need assistance or they will break down under the strain our young ladies are different from the professional nurses they are so keenly sensitive that they suffer from sympathy with every patient that comes under their care  i do not favor their leaving the ship remarked dr kelsey the mate there seems to be plenty of field workers at the front supplied by the governments whose troops are fighting  therefore added jones we men must assume the duty of driving the ambulances and bringing back the wounded we are able to pick up as maurie is too stiff from his wound to drive today i shall undertake the job myself i know the way now and am confident i shall get along nicely who will go with me  i will of course replied kelsey quietly  doctor gys will be needed on the ship asserted uncle john  yes it will be best to leave me here said gys im too great a coward to go near the firing line again it destroys my usefulness and kelsey can administer first aid as well as i  in that case i think i shall take the small ambulance today decided ajo with dr kelsey and one of the sailors we shall manage very well  a launch took them ashore where the ambulances stood upon the dock maurie had admitted his inability to drive but asked to be allowed to go into the town so he left the ship with the others and disappeared for the day  ajo took the same route he had covered before in the direction of nieuport but could not get within five miles of the town which was now held by the germans from furnes to the front the roads were packed with reinforcements and wagon trains bearing ammunition and supplies and further progress with the ambulance was impossible  however a constant stream of wounded flowed to the rear some with first aid bandages covering their injuries others as yet uncared for kelsey chose those whom he considered most in need of surgical care or skillful nursing and by noon the ambulance was filled to overflowing it was jones who advised taking none of the fatally injured as the army surgeons paid especial attention to these the americans could be of most practical use the boy considered by taking in charge such as had a chance to recover so nine more patients were added to the ships colony on this occasion all being delivered to the care of dr gys without accident or delaya fact that rendered ajo quite proud of his skillful driving  while the ambulance was away the girls quietly passed from berth to berth encouraging and caring for their wounded it was surprising how interested they became in the personality of these soldiers for each man was distinctive either in individuality or the character of his injury and most of them were eager to chat with their nurses and anxious for news of the battle  during the morning the young belgian who had lain until now in a stupor recovered consciousness he had moaned once or twice drawing maud to his side but hearing a different sound from him she approached the berth where he lay to find his eyes wide open gradually he turned them upon his nurse as if feeling her presence and after a moment of observation he sighed and then smiled wanly  still on earth he said in french  i am so glad she replied you have been in dreamland a long time  he tried to move and it brought a moan to his lips  dont stir she counseled warningly you are badly wounded  he was silent for a time staring at the ceiling she held some water to his lips and he drank eagerly finally he said in a faint voice  i remember now i had turned to reload and it hit me in the back a bullet mademoiselle  part of a shell  ah i understand i tried to get to the rear the pain was terrible no one seemed to notice me at last i fell andthen i slept i thought it was the end  she bathed his forehead saying  you must not talk any more at present here comes the doctor to see you  gys busy in the cabin had heard their voices and now came to look at his most interesting patient the soldier seemed about twenty years of age he was rather handsome with expressive eyes and features bearing the stamp of culture already they knew his name by means of an identification card found upon him as well as a small packet of letters carefully pinned in an inner pocket of his coat these last were all addressed in the same handwriting which was undoubtedly feminine to andrew denton the card stated that andrew denton private was formerly an insurance agent at antwerp  doctor gys had rather impatiently awaited the young mans return to consciousness that he might complete his examination he now devoted the next half hour to a careful diagnosis of dentons injuries by this time the patient was suffering intense pain and a hypodermic injection of morphine was required to relieve him when at last he was quietly drowsing the doctor called maud aside to give her instructions  watch him carefully said he and dont let him suffer keep up the morphine  there is no hope then she asked  not the slightest he may linger for dayseven weeks if we sustain his strengthbut recovery is impossible that bit of shell tore a horrible hole in the poor fellow and all we can do is keep him comfortable until the end without the morphine he would not live twelve hours  shall i let him talk  if he wishes to his lungs are not involved so it can do him no harm  but andrew denton did not care to talk any more that day he wanted to think and lay quietly until beth came on duty to her he gave a smile and a word of thanks and again lapsed into thoughtful silence  when ajo brought the new consignment of wounded to the ship the doctors and nurses found themselves pretty busy for a time with wounds to dress and one or two slight operations to perform the afternoon passed swiftly away the old patients must not be neglected either so captain carg said he would sit with the german and look after him as he was able to converse with the patient in his own tongue  the german was resting easily today but proved as glum and uncommunicative as ever that did not worry the captain who gave the man a cigarette and when it was nonchalantly accepted lighted his own pipe together they sat in silence and smoked the german occupying an easy chair and resting his leg upon a stool for he had refused to lie in a berth through the open window the dull boom of artillery could constantly be heard after an hour or so  a long fight remarked the captain in german  the other merely looked at him contemplatively carg stared for five minutes at the bandaged foot finally  hard luck said he  this time the german nodded looking at the foot also  in america resumed the captain puffing slowly they make fine artificial feet walk all right look natural  vienna said the german  yes i suppose so another pause  name asked the german with startling abruptness but the other never winked  carg im a sailor captain of this ship live in sangoa when ashore  sangoa  island in south seas  the wounded man reached for another cigarette and lighted it  carg he repeated musingly german  why my folks were i believe ive relations in germany yet munich visited them once when a boy mothers name was elbl the cargs lived next door to the elbls but theyve lost track of me and i of them nothing in common you see  the german finished his cigarette looking at the captain at times reflectively carg feeling his biography had not been appreciated had lapsed into silence at length the wounded man began feeling in his breast pocketan awkward operation because the least action disturbed the swathed limband presently drew out a leather card case with much deliberation he abstracted a card and handed it to the captain who put on his spectacles and read       otto elbl 12th uhlans  oh he said looking up to examine the german anew otto elbl of munich  yes  hm number 121 friedrichstrasse  yes  i didnt see you when i visited your family they said you were at college your father was william elbl my mothers brother  the german stretched out his hand and gripped the fist of the captain  cousins he said  carg nodded meditating  to be sure he presently returned cousins have another cigarette     chapter xi  patsy is defiant   that evening the captain joined dr gys on deck  that german lieutenant elbl he began  oh is that his name asked gys  yes will he get well  certainly what is a foot to a man like him but his soldiering days are past  perhaps thats fortunate returned the captain ruminatively when i was a boy his father was burgomastermayorin munich people said he was welltodo the germans are thrifty so i suppose theres still money in the elbl family  money will do much to help reconcile the man to the loss of his foot declared the doctor  will he suffer much pain while it is getting well  not if i can help it the fellow bears pain with wonderful fortitude when i was in yucatan and had to slash my face to get out the poisoned darts of the cactus i screamed till you could have heard me a mile and i had no anaesthetic to soothe me your lieutenant never whimpered or cringed with his mangled foot and he refused morphine when i operated on it but i fooled him i hate to see a brave man suffer i stuck a needle just above the wound when he wasnt looking and ive doped his medicine ever since  thank you said carg hes my cousin  in the small hours of the next morning while patsy was on duty in the hospital section the young belgian became wakeful and restless she promptly administered a sedative and sat by his bedside after a little his pain was eased and he became quiet but he lay there with wide open eyes  can i do anything more for you she asked  if you would be so kind replied andrew denton  well  please read to me some letters you will find in my pocket i cannot read them myself andthey will comfort me  patsy found the packet of letters  the top one first he said eagerly read them all  she opened the letter reluctantly it was addressed in a dainty female hand and the girl had the uncomfortable feeling that she was about to pry into personal relations of a delicate character  your sweetheart she asked gently  yes indeed my sweetheart and my wife  oh i see and have you been married long he seemed a mere boy  five months but for the last two i have not seen her  the letters were dated at charleroi and each one began my darling husband patsy read the packet through from first to last her eyes filling with tears at times as she noted the rare devotion and passionate longing of the poor young wife and realized that the boyish husband was even now dying a martyr to his countrys cause the letters were signed elizabeth in one was a small photograph of a sweet darkeyed girl whom she instantly knew to be the bereaved wife  and does she still live at charleroi patsy asked  i hope so mademoiselle with her mother the germans now occupy the town but you will notice the last letter states that all citizens are treated courteously and with much consideration so i do not fear for her  the reading of the letters in conjunction with the opiate seemed to comfort him for presently he fell asleep with a heavy heart the girl left him to attend to her other patients and at three oclock ajo came in and joined her to relieve the tedium of the next three hours the boy knew nothing of nursing but he could help patsy administer potions and change compresses and his presence was a distinct relief to her  the girl was supposed to sleep from six oclockat which time she was relieved from dutyuntil one in the afternoon but the next morning at eight she walked into the forward salon where her friends were at breakfast and sat down beside uncle john  i could not sleep said she because i am so worried over andrew denton  that is foolish my dear answered mr merrick affectionately patting the hand she laid in his the doctor says poor denton cannot recover if youre going to take to heart all the sad incidents we encounter on this hospital ship it will not only ruin your usefulness but destroy your happiness  exactly so agreed gys coming into the salon in time to overhear this remark a nurse should be sympathetic but impersonally so  denton has been married but five months said patsy i have seen his wifes pictureshes a dear little girland her letters to him are full of love and longing she doesnt know of course of hishis accidentor that hehe her voice broke with a sob she could not repress  mm purred uncle john where does she live this young wife  at charleroi  well the germans are there  yes uncle but dont you suppose they would let her come to see her dying husband  a young girl unprotected would it besafe  the germans remarked captain carg from his end of the table are very decent people  ahem said uncle john  some of them ive no doubt are quite respectable observed ajo but from all reports the rank and file in war time arerather unpleasant to meet  precisely agreed uncle john i think patsy dear it will be best to leave this belgian girl in ignorance of her husbands fate  i myself have a wife quoth little maurie with smug assurance but she is not worrying about me wherever she may be nor do i feel especial anxiety for clarette a woman takes what comesespecially if she is obliged to  patsy regarded him indignantly  there are many kinds of women she began  thank heaven exclaimed maurie and then she realized how futile it was to argue with him  a little later she walked on deck with uncle john and pleaded her cause earnestly it was said by those who knew him well that the kindly little gentleman was never able to refuse patsy anything for long and he was himself so well aware of this weakness that he made a supreme effort to resist her on this occasion  you and i said she would have no trouble in passing the german lines we are strictly neutral you know we americans and our passports and the red cross will take us anywhere in safety  it wont do my dear he replied youve already been in danger enough for one war i shudder even now as i think of those bullets and shells at nieuport  but we can pass through at some place where they are not fighting  show me such a place  and distances are very small in this part of the continent we could get to charleroi in a day and return the next day with mrs denton  impossible  the doctor says he may live for several days but it may be only for hours if you could see his face light up when he speaks of her you would realize what a comfort her presence would be to him  i understand that patsy but cant you see my dear that were not able to do everything for those poor wounded soldiers you have twenty in your charge now and by tonight there may be possibly a dozen more many of them have wives at home but  but all are not dying uncleand after only five months of married life three of which they passed together here at least is one brave heart we may comfort one poor woman who will be ever grateful for our generous kindness  mr merrick coughed he wiped his eyes and blew his nose on his pink bordered handkerchief but he made no promise  patsy left him and went to ajo  see here she said im going to charleroi in an hour  its a days journey patsy  i mean im going to start in an hour will you go with me  what does uncle john say he inquired cautiously  i dont care what he says im going she persisted her eyes blazing with determination  the boy whistled softly studying her face then he walked across the deck to mr merrick  patsy is rampant sir said he she wont be denied go and argue with her please  i have argued returned uncle john weakly  well argue again  the little man cast a half frightened half reproachful glance at his niece  lets go and consult the doctor he exclaimed and together uncle john and ajo went below  to their surprise gys supported patsys plea  hes a fine fellow this denton said he and rather above the average soldier moreover his case is a pitiful one ill agree to keep him alive until his wife comes  uncle john looked appealingly at ajo  how on earth can we manage to cross the lines he asked  take one of our launches said the boy  skim the coast to ostend and youll avoid danger altogether  thats the idea exclaimed the doctor approvingly why its the easiest thing in the world sir  uncle john began to feel slightly reassured  who will run the launch he inquired  ill give you the captain and one of the men said the boy cargs an old traveler and knows more than he appears to besides he speaks german we cant spare very many you understand and the ambulances will keep maurie and me pretty busy patsy will be missed too from the hospital ward so you must hurry back  two days ought to accomplish our object said uncle john  easily agreed gys ive arranged for a couple of girls from the town to come and help us today for i must save the strength of my expert nurses as much as possible and ill keep them with us until you return the french girls are not experienced in nursing but ill take miss patsys watch myself so we shall get along all right  mr merrick and jones returned to the deck  well demanded patsy  get ready said uncle john we leave in an hour  for charleroi  of course unless youve changed your mind  patsy flew to her stateroom     chapter xii  the other side   the launch in which they embarked bore the red cross on its sides and an american flag floated from the bow and a red cross flag from the stern its four occupants wore the red cross uniforms yet three miles out of dunkirk a shot came singing across their prow and they were obliged to lay to until a british manofwar could lower a boat to investigate their errand the coast is very shallow in this section which permits boats of only the lightest draught to navigate inshore but the launch was able to skim over the surface at twelve miles an hour  this is pleasant grumbled uncle john as they awaited the approach of the warships boat our very appearance ought to insure us safe conduct but i suppose that in these times every craft is regarded with suspicion  the boat came alongside  where are you going demanded an officer gruffly  to ostend  on what business  our own replied mr merrick  be respectful sir or ill arrest your entire outfit warned the officer  youll do nothing of the sort declared mr merrick youll examine our papers apologize for your interference and row back to your ship we have the authority of the red cross to go wherever our duty calls us and moreover were american citizens permit me to add that were in a hurry  the officer turned first white and then red but he appreciated the force of the argument  your papers he commanded  uncle john produced them and waited patiently for their inspection which was very deliberate finally the officer returned them and gave the order to his men to row back to the ship  one moment called uncle john you havent made the apology  there was no answer the boat moved swiftly away and at a gesture from captain carg the sailor started the launch again  i wonder why it is mused mr merrick that there is always this raspy feeling when the english meet americans on the surface were friendly enough and our governments always express in diplomatic relations the most cordial good will but ive always noticed in the english individual an undercurrent of antipathy for americans that cannot be disguised as a race the english hate us im positive and i wonder why  i believe youre wrong uncle remarked patsy a few of the british may individually dislike us but im sure the two nations are not antagonistic why should they be  yorktown muttered the captain  i dont believe it declared the girl theyre too good sportsmen to bear grudges  all the same persisted uncle john the english have never favored us as the french have or even the russians  from dunkirk to ostend by the coast line is only some twentyfive miles yet although they started at a little after eleven oclock it was three in the afternoon before they finally landed at the belgian seaport interruptions were numerous and although they were treated courteously in the main it was only after rigid questioning and a thorough examination that they were permitted to proceed a full hour was consumed at the harbor at ostend before they could even land  as they stepped upon the wharf a group of german soldiers met them and now captain carg became the spokesman of the party the young officer in command removed his helmet to bow deferentially to patsy and then turned to ask their business at ostend  he says we must go before the military governor said carg translating there if our papers are regular permits will be issued for us to proceed to charleroi  they left the sailor in charge of the launch which was well provisioned and contained a convertible bunk and followed the officer into the town ostend is a large city fortified and was formerly one of the most important ports on the north sea as well as a summer resort of prominence the city now being occupied by the germans our friends found few citizens on the streets of ostend and these hurried nervously on their way the streets swarmed with german soldiery  arriving at headquarters they found that the commandant was too busy to attend to the red cross americans he ordered them taken before colonel grau for examination  but why examine us at all protested mr merrick doesnt our sacred mission protect us from such annoying details  the young officer regretted that it did not they would find colonel grau in one of the upper rooms it would be a formal examination of course and brief but busy spies had even assumed the insignia of the red cross to mask their nefarious work and an examination was therefore necessary as a protective measure so they ascended a broad staircase and proceeded along a corridor to the colonels office  grau was at the head of the detective service at ostend and invested with the task of ferreting out the numerous spies in the service of the allies and dealing with them in a summary manner he was a very stout man and not very tall his eyes were light blue and his grizzled mustache was a poor imitation of that affected by the kaiser when grau looked up on their entrance patsy decided that their appearance had startled him but presently she realized that the odd expression was permanent  in a chair beside the colonels desk sat or rather lounged another officer encased in a uniform so brilliant that it arrested the eye before one could discover its contents these were a wizened weatherbeaten man of advanced age yet rugged as hickory his eyes had a periodical squint his brows wore a persistent frown there was a broad scar on his left cheek and another across his forehead a warrior who had seen service probably but whose surly physiognomy was somewhat disconcerting  the two officers had been in earnest conversation but when mr merricks party was ushered in the elder man leaned back in his chair squinting and scowling and regarded them silently  huh exclaimed the colonel in a brusque growl what is it von holtz  the young officer explained that the party had just arrived from dunkirk in a launch the commandant had asked colonel grau kindly to examine them uncle john proceeded to state the case captain carg interpreting they operated a red cross hospital ship at dunkirk and one of their patients a young belgian was dying of his wounds they had come to find his young wife and take her back with them to dunkirk in their launch that she might comfort the last moments of her husband the americans asked for safe conduct to charleroi and permission to take mrs denton with them to dunkirk then he presented his papers including the authority of the american red cross society the letter from the secretary of state and the recommendation of the german ambassador at washington  the colonel looked them all over he uttered little guttural exclamations and tapped the desk with his fingertips as he read and all the time his face wore that perplexing expression of surprise finally he asked  which is mr merrick  hearing his name uncle john bowed  huh but the description does not fit you  captain carg translated this  why not demanded uncle john  it says you are short stout blueeyed bald fortyfive years of age  of course  you are not short i think you are as tall as i am your eyes are not blue they are olive green you are not bald for there is still hair over your ears huh how do you explain that  its nonsense said uncle john scornfully  carg was more cautious in interpreting the remark he assured the colonel in german that the description of mr merrick was considered close enough for all practical purposes but grau was not satisfied he went over the papers again and then turned to face the other officer  what do you think general he asked hesitatingly  suspicious was the reply  i think so myself said the colonel mark you heres a man who claims to come from sangoa a place no one has ever heard of and the other has endorsements purporting to come from the highest officials in america huh what does it mean  papers may be forged or stolen from their proper owners suggested the squinting general this excuse of coming here to get the wife of a hurt belgian seems absurd if they are really red cross workers they are not attending to their proper business  when the captain interpreted this speech patsy said angrily  the general is an old fool  an idiot ill call him added uncle john i wish i could tell him so  you have told him said the general in good english squinting now more rapidly than ever and your manner of speech proves you to be impostors i have never known a respectable red cross nurse of any country who called a distinguished officer a fooland to his face  i didnt know you understood english she said  that is no excuse  but i did know she added that i had judged you correctly no one with a spark of intelligence could doubt the evidence of these papers  the papers are all right where did you get them  from the proper authorities  he turned to speak rapidly in german to colonel grau who had been uneasy during the conversation in english because he failed to understand it his expression of piquant surprise was intensified as he now turned to the americans  you may as well confess your imposture said he it will make your punishment lighter however if on further examination you prove to be spies your fate is beyond my power to mitigate  see here said uncle john when this was translated to him if you dare to interfere with us or cause us annoyance i shall insist on your being courtmartialed you are responsible to your superiors i suppose and they dare not tolerate an insult to the red cross nor to an american citizen you may have the sense to consider that if these papers and letters are genuine as i declare they are i have friends powerful enough to bring this matter before the kaiser himself in which case someone will suffer a penalty even if he is a general or a colonel  as he spoke he glared defiantly at the older officer who calmly proceeded to translate the speech to the colonel carg reported that it was translated verbatim then the general sat back and squinted at his companion who seemed fairly bewildered by the threat patsy caught the young officer smothering a smile but neither of them interrupted the silence that followed  once again the colonel picked up the papers and gave them a rigid examination especially that of the german ambassador which was written in his own language i cannot understand he muttered how one insignificant american citizen could secure such powerful endorsements it has never happened before in my experience  it is extraordinary said the general  mr merrick said patsy to him is a very important man in america he is so important that any indignity to him will be promptly resented  i will investigate your case further decided colonel grau after another sotto voce conference with the general spies are getting to be very clever these days and we cannot take chances however i assure you there is no disposition to worry you and until your standing is determined you will be treated with every consideration  do you mean that we are prisoners asked uncle john trying to control his indignation  no indeed you will be detained of course but you are not prisonersas yet i will keep your papers and submit them to the general staff it will be for that august body to decide  uncle john protested vigorously patsy faced the old general and told him this action was an outrage that would be condemned by the entire civilized world captain carg gravely assured both officers that they were making a serious mistake but nothing could move the stolid germans the general indeed smiled grimly and told them in english that he was in no way responsible whatever happened this was colonel graus affair but he believed nevertheless that the colonel was acting wisely  the young officer who had stood like a statue during the entire interview was ordered to accompany the americans to a hotel where they must be kept under surveillance but might follow to an extent their own devices they were not to mail letters nor send telegrams  the officer asked who should guard the suspects  why not yourself lieutenant you are on detached duty i believe  at the port colonel  there are too many officers at the port it is a sinecure i will appoint you to guard the americans you speak their language i believe  the young man bowed  very well i shall hold you responsible for their safety  they were then dismissed and compelled to follow their guard from the room  patsy was now wild with rage and uncle john speechless even carg was evidently uneasy  do not mind said the young lieutenant consolingly it is merely a temporary inconvenience you know for your release will come very soon and since you are placed in my care i beg you to accept this delay with good grace and be happy as possible ostend is full of life and i am conducting you to an excellent hotel     chapter xiii  tardy justice   the courtesy of lieutenant von holtz was beyond criticism he obtained for his charges a comfortable suite of rooms in an overcrowded hotel obliging the landlord to turn away other guests that mr merricks party might be accommodated the dinner that was served in their cosy sitting room proved excellent having been ordered by von holtz after he had requested that privilege when the young officer appeared to see that it was properly served patsy invited him to join them at the table and he laughingly consented  you are one of our party by force of circumstances said the girl and since weve found you goodnatured and polite and believe you are not to blame for our troubles we may as well be friendly while we are together  the young man was evidently well pleased  however evil your fortune may be said he i cannot fail to be impressed by my own good luck perhaps you may guess what a relief this pleasant commission is to one who for days has been compelled to patrol those vile smelling docks watching for spies and enduring all sorts of weather  to think said uncle john gloomily that we are accused of being spies  it is not for me returned von holtz to criticize the acts of my superiors i may say however that were it my province to decide the question you would now be free colonel grau has an excellent record for efficiency and seldom makes a mistake but i suspect his judgment was influenced by the general whose son was once jilted by an american girl  were going to get even with them both before this affair is ended declared patsy vindictively but although you are our actual jailer i promise that you will escape our vengeance  my instructions are quite elastic as you heard said the lieutenant i am merely ordered to keep you in ostend under my eye until your case has been passed upon by the commandant or the general staff since you have money you may enjoy every luxury save that of travel and i ask you to command my services in all ways consistent with my duty  what worries me said patsy to uncle john is the delay if we are kept here for long poor denton will die before we can find his wife and take her to him  how long are we liable to be detained uncle john asked the officer  i cannot say perhaps the council of the general staff will meet tomorrow morning perhaps not for several days was the indefinite reply  patsy wiped away the tears that began to well into her eyes she had so fondly set her heart on reuniting the dentons that her disappointment was very great  von holtz noticed the girls mood and became thoughtful captain carg had remained glum and solemn ever since they had left the colonels office uncle john sat in silent indignation wondering what could be done to influence these stupid germans presently the lieutenant remarked  that sailor whom you left with the launch seemed an intelligent fellow  patsy gave a start uncle john looked at the young man expectantly the captain nodded his head as he slowly replied  henderson is one of the picked men i brought from sangoa he is both intelligent and loyal  curiously enough said von holtz i neglected to place the man under arrest i even forgot to report him he is free  ah exclaimed patsy her eyes lighting  i know a civilian herea bright young belgianwho is my friend and will do anything i ask of him resumed von holtz still musingly i had the good fortune to protect his mother when our troops entered the city and he is grateful  patsy was thinking very fast now  could henderson get to charleroi do you imagine she asked he has a passport  we do not consider passports of much value said the officer but a red cross appointment  oh he has that too all our men carry them  in that case with my friend rondel to guide him i believe henderson could accomplish your errand  let us send for him at once exclaimed uncle john  carg scribbled on a card  he wouldnt leave the launch without orders unless forced by the germans asserted the captain and handed the card to von holtz  the young lieutenant took his cap bowed profoundly and left the room in ten minutes he returned saying i am not so fortunate as i had thought all our troops are on the move headed for the yser there will be fighting presently andi must remain here he added despondently  it wont be your last chance im sure said patsy will that dreadful colonel grau go too  no he is to remain but all regiments quartered here are now marching out and tomorrow a fresh brigade will enter ostend  they were silent a time until someone rapped upon the door von holtz admitted a slim goodlooking young belgian who grasped his hand and said eagerly in french  you sent for me  yes you may speak english here monsieur rondel then he presented his friend to the americans who approved him on sight  henderson came a few minutes later and listened respectfully to the plan miss doyle unfolded he was to go with monsieur rondel to charleroi find mrs denton explain that her husband was very ill and bring her back with him to ostend he would report promptly on his return and they would tell him what to do next  the man accepted the mission without a word of protest charleroi was in central belgium but that did not mean many miles away and rondel assured him they would meet with no difficulties the trains were reserved for soldiers but the belgian had an automobile and a german permit to drive it the roads were excellent  now remember said patsy the lady you are going for is mrs albert denton she lives with her mother or did the last we heard of her  and her mothers name and address inquired henderson  we are ignorant of either she confessed but its not a very big town and im sure youll easily find her  i know the place well said rondel and i have friends residing there who will give me information  uncle john supplied them liberally with money impressed upon them the necessity of haste and sent them away rondel declared the night time was best for the trip and promised to be on the way within the hour and in charleroi by next morning  notwithstanding the fact that they had succeeded in promoting by proxy the mission which had brought them to belgium the americans found the next day an exceedingly irksome one in the company of lieutenant von holtz they were permitted to walk about the city but they found little pleasure in that owing to the bustle of outgoing troops and the arrival of others to replace them nor did they care to stray far from their quarters for fear the council would meet and they might be sent for  however no sign from colonel grau was received that day patsy went to bed with a nervous headache and left uncle john and the captain to smoke more than was good for them both the men had now come to regard their situation as serious and as the american consul was at this time absent in brussels they could think of no way to secure their freedom no one knew when the consul would return mr merrick had been refused the privilege of using the telegraph or mails during one of their strolls they had met the correspondent of an american newspaper but when the man learned they were suspects he got away from them as soon as possible he did not know mr merrick and his own liberty was too precarious for him to argue with colonel grau  im beginning to think said uncle john that were up against a hard proposition letters and endorsements from prominent americans seem to have no weight with these germans id no idea our identity could ever be disputed  we must admit sir returned the captain reflectively that the spy system in this war is something remarkable spies are everywhere clever ones too who adopt every sort of subterfuge to escape detection i do not blame grau so much for caution as for lack of judgment  hes a blockhead cried mr merrick testily  he is im astonished they should place so much power in the hands of one so slow witted  he has insulted us continued uncle john he has dared to arrest three freeborn americans  who came into a troubled country occupied by a conquering army without being invited  wellthats true sighed the little millionaire but what are we going to do about it  wait counseled the captain  the next day dawned dark and rainy and the weather had a depressing effect upon the prisoners it was too damp to stir out of doors and the confinement of the hotel rooms became especially irksome not only were they anxious about their own fate but it was far past the time when they should have heard from henderson and rondel patsys nerves were getting beyond her control uncle john stumped around with his hands thrust deep in his pockets and a frown wrinkling his forehead the captain smoked innumerable pipes of tobacco and said not a word von holtz noting the uneasiness of his charges discreetly forbore conversation and retired to a far corner where he hid behind a book  it was nearing evening when a commotion was heard on the stairs followed by the heavy tramp of feet in the corridor a sharp rap sounded on the door of their sitting room uncle john stepped forward to open it when in stalked a group of german officers their swords and spurs clanking and their cloaks glistening with raindrops at sight of the young girl off came cap and helmet and with one accord they bowed low  the leader was a tall thin man with a leathern face hooked nose and piercing gray eyes his breast glittered with orders it was von kargenbrut the military governor  pardon our intrusion he said in english his harsh voice having a guttural accent which gentleman is mr john merrick  i am john merrick  the eagle eyes swept over him with a swift glance  we owe you our apology continued the governor speaking as fiercely as if he were ordering uncle john beheaded i have been too busy to take up your case before today when i discover that we have treated you discourteously you will consider our fault due to these troubled times when mistakes occur in spite of our watchfulness is it not so  your error has caused us great inconvenience responded mr merrick stiffly  the governor whirled around colonel grau he called and from the rear of the group the colonel stepped forward his face still wore the expression of comical surprise return to mr merrick his papers and credentials  the colonel drew the packet of papers from his breast pocket and handed it to uncle john then he glanced hesitatingly at his superior who glared at him  he cannot speak the english said the governor to mr merrick but he owes you reparation  graus stupidity has been very annoying to say the least was the ungracious reply we came here on important business and presented our papersall in proper orderon demand we had the right to expect decent treatment as respectable american citizens engaged in humanitarian work yet thisthisman pointing an accusing finger at the colonel ordered us detainedarrestedand kept our papers  the governor listened coldly and at the end of the speech inclined his head  colonel grau said he has been relieved of his duties here and transferred to another station to you i have personally apologized you will find my endorsement on your papers and in addition an order that will grant you safe conduct wherever you may wish to go if that is not enough make your demands and i will consider them  why that is all i can expect your excellency under the circumstances replied mr merrick i suppose i ought to thank you for your present act of justice  no it is your due good evening mr merrick  he swung around on his heel and every officer of the group turned with him like so many automatons all facing the door but mr merrick touched the governor upon the arm  one moment your excellency this young officer lieutenant von holtz has treated us kindly and courteously i want you to know that one of your men at least has performed his duty in a way to merit our thanksand yours  the governor scowled at lieutenant von holtz who stood like a statue with lowered eyes  lieutenant you are commissioned to guide mr merrick as long as he remains within our lines you will guard his safety and that of his party when he departs come to me personally with your report  the young officer bowed the governor tramped to the door and went out followed by his staff grau left the room last with hangdog look and patsy slammed the door in the hope of bumping his wooden head  so were free she said turning to von holtz  not only that fraulein but you are highly favored he replied all german territory is now open to you  its about time they came to their senses remarked uncle john with a return to his accustomed cheerfulness  and best of all said patsy exultantly theyve fired that awful colonel  the captain thoughtfully filled and lighted his pipe  i wonder said he how that happened was it the council do you think lieutenant  von holtz shook his head  i think it was the governor he replied he is a just man and had you been able to see him personally on your arrival you would have been spared any annoyance  perhaps said patsy doubtfully but your governors a regular bear  i believe that is merely his way asserted uncle john i didnt mind the mans tone when i found his words and deeds were all right but he  another rap at the door patsy opened it and admitted henderson he saluted the captain bowed to the others and said  weve got her sir  mrs denton cried patsy delightedly  henderson nodded  yes miss doyle mrs denton and the children  the children why there arent any  i beg your pardon miss there are two  two children she exclaimed in dismay there must be some mistake the young people have only been married five months  henderson stood stiff as a poker refusing to argue the point  a governess maybe suggested the captain  more likely said uncle john young denton married a widow withehehincumbrances  thats it sir said henderson earnestly  whats it  the incumbrances sir no other word could describe em  patsys heart sank she was greatly disappointed  and she so young and pretty she murmured  henderson started to smile but quickly suppressed it  shall i show them up miss he inquired  of course answered uncle john as the girl hesitated you should have brought her to us at once where is that belgianrondel  he is guarding the woman sir  guarding her  shes a little difficult to manage sir at times she left charleroi willingly enough but shes tricky and it is our duty to deliver her to you safely  get her at once henderson exclaimed patsy recovering her wits and the dear children too  presently there was a sound of shuffling on the stairs and through the corridor the door opened to admit the arrivals from charleroi  henderson first pushed in a big woman dressed in a faded bluechecked gown belted around the waist in a manner that made her look like a sack tied in the middle her head was bare her hair awry her face sullen and hard she was undeniably fleshy and not altogether clean she resisted henderson at every step and glared around her with shrewd and shifting eyes  following her came monsieur rondel leading a boy and a girl the latter being a small replica of the woman the boy was viciously struggling to bite the hand of the belgian who held him fast  ah well said rondel first sighing and then turning with a smile to face the lieutenant we have performed our mission but heaven guard us from another like it  patsy stared hard at the woman  this cannot be mrs denton she gasped bewildered  indeed answered rondel in english she declares that is her name question her in french or flemish miss doyle  patsy addressed the woman in french but could elicit no reply she stood impassive and silent  how did you make the mistake asked the girl looking reproachfully first at henderson and then at rondel both of whom were evidently astonished to find themselves at fault i have seen a photograph of mrs andrew denton taken recently and she is young and pretty andandrather small  monsieur rondel cleared his throat to answer  it happened in this way mademoiselle we searched one whole day in charleroi for mrs denton but could not find her my friends on whom i had relied for assistance had unfortunately moved away or joined the army the townspeople were suspicious of monsieur henderson who is a foreigner we could get no information whatever i appealed to the burgomaster and he said he would try to find mrs denton for us the next day in the morning came to us this woman who said she was the person we sought if we promised her safe conduct to dunkirk she would go with us she had wanted to go to dunkirk for some weeks but the germans would not let her pass the lines we suspected nothing wrong for she admitted she was aware that her husband is in dunkirk and she wanted to get to him so we brought her to you  patsy faced the woman resolutely and said in french  why did you wish to get to dunkirk  he has said it to find my husband replied the woman in a surly tone  what is your name  no reply  answer me  the woman eyed her obstinately and remained silent  very well release those children monsieur rondel madam you have imposed upon us you have tricked us in order to get to ostend at our expense now go and take your children with you  she pointed dramatically at the door but the woman retained her position only moving to cuff the boy who was kicking henderson on his shins then setting her hands on her hips she said defiantly  they promised me passage to dunkirk and they must take me there  who promised you  those men pointing to them and the burgomaster  yes admitted henderson we agreed with the burgomaster to take her out of the country we signed a paper to that effect  but she is a belgian and she is not the person she claimed to be  to this neither rondel nor henderson had an answer  see here said uncle john ill untangle this matter in a jiffy here is money give it to the woman and tell her to get outor well eject her by force  the woman grabbed the money eagerly but after placing it in an ample pocket she said i will go no place but dunkirk i will not leave you until you take me there  but here the lieutenant interfered he suddenly faced the woman who had not noticed his presence before and she shrank back in fear at sight of his uniform the boy and girl both began to cry  i know you said von holtz sternly you are the wife of a spy who has been condemned to death by both the belgians and the germans since he betrayed them both the last time you came to ostend to annoy us you were driven out of the city there is still an edict against you will you leave this room peaceably or shall i order you under arrest  dog of a german she hissed the day is coming when i will help to drive you out of belgium even as you now drive me brave soldiers are you to make war on women and children guh i would kill you where you standif i dared with venomous hate she spat upon the floor then seized her wailing children shook them and waddled out of the room  there was a general sigh of relief  you may return to the launch henderson said the captain  monsieur rondel said uncle john grasping the young belgians hand we are grateful to you for your kindness the failure of your mission was not your fault we thank you the governor has given us our liberty and permission to travel where we please so tomorrow we will go to charleroi ourselves to search for mrs denton  my motor car is at your disposal sir and my services  tomorrow oh let us go tonight uncle cried patsy  mr merrick looked inquiringly at the belgian  i am ready now said rondel with a bow  then said patsy we will start in half an hour you see we have wasted two whole daystwo precious days i hope dr gys will keep his promise and that we shall find poor denton alive on our return     chapter xiv  found at last   the pretty city of charleroi had suffered little damage from the german invasion yet many of the townspeople had gone away since the occupation and those who remained kept well within their houses or huddled in anxious groups upon the streets the civic affairs were still administered by the belgian burgomaster but the martial law of the germans prevailed over all  when patsy doyle escorted by uncle john and accompanied by captain carg lieutenant von holtz and monsieur rondel arrived in the early morning the streets were comparatively deserted the hotel royal received them hospitably and the landlord and his daughters prepared them an excellent breakfast  while eating patsy chatted with the belgian girls who were neat modest and intelligent she found that henderson and rondel had not stopped at this hotel while in charleroi but at a smaller inn at the other end of the town the girls remembered hearing of their visit and of their inquiries for a mrs denton but did not know whether they had succeeded in their quest or not  we have lived here all our lives said the eldest of the landlords three daughters but we have not known during that time any family of dentons in charleroi  patsy reflected  they were married only five months ago these dentons said she and the young man may have come from some other town do you remember that any of your young girls were married about five months ago  yes there was hildegarde bentel but she had married anthony mattison who was not a soldier could the american mamselle remember what the girls first name was  oh yes exclaimed patsy she signed her letters elizabeth  they shook their heads  my name is also elizabeth said one we have many elizabeths in charleroi but none has lately married  and her husband told me that she was now living here with her mother  ah let us see then responded another could she have been a lady of rank think you  ii do not know  is her husband an officer  no a private i believe  then we are on the wrong scent laughed the girl i had in mind the daughter of the countess voig whose name chances to be elizabeth she was educated at a convent in antwerp and the countess has lived in that city for several years in order to be nearer her daughter there was some gossip here that the young lady had married in antwerp just after leaving the convent but we know little of the life of the voigs because they are very reserved two or three months ago they returned to their castle which is four miles to the north of charleroi and there they are still living in retirement every day the old steward drives into town to visit the post office but we have not seen the countess nor her daughter since they came back  patsy related this news to uncle john who did not understand french  let us drive over to castle voig the first thing she said  but my dear its unreasonable he objected do you suppose a highborn young lady would marry a common soldier in america where we have no caste it would be quite probable but here  he wasnt a soldier five months ago said patsy hes just a volunteer who joined the army when his country needed him as many of the wealthy and aristocratic belgians did he may be highborn himself for all we know at any rate i mean to visit that castle tell rondel to bring around the automobile  they had no trouble in passing the guards owing to the presence of von holtz and in half an hour they were rolling through a charming peaceful country that as yet had suffered no blemish through the german conquest  at castle voig they were received by an aged retainer who was visibly nervous at their arrival he eyed the uniform of young von holtz with illconcealed terror and hurried away to carry their cards to the countess after a long wait they learned that the countess would receive the americans but it was a full half hour after that when they were ushered into a reception room where a lady sat in solitary state  under other circumstances patsy could have spent a day in admiring the quaint oldfashioned furniture and pictures and the wonderful carvings of the beamed ceiling but now she was so excited that she looked only at the countess the lady was not very imposing in form or dress but her features were calm and dignified and she met her guests with a grave courtesy that was impressive if rather chilly before patsy had summoned courage to explain her errand a younger womanalmost a girlhurriedly entered the room and took a position beside the other  oh its elizabethit really is cried patsy clapping her hands together joyfully  mother and daughter regarded the american girl wonderingly and somewhat haughtily but patsy was not in the least dismayed  isnt this mrs denton she asked stepping forward to lay a hand upon the other girls arm  yes was the quiet reply  patsys great eyes regarded her a moment with so sad and sympathetic a look that mrs denton shrank away then she noticed for the first time the red cross uniform and her hand went swiftly to her heart as she faltered  youyou have brought bad news of andrewof my husband  yes i am sorry to admit that it is bad news answered patsy soberly he has been wounded and is now lying ill in our hospital ship at dunkirk we came here to find you and to take you to him  mrs denton turned to her mother a passionate appeal in her eyes but it was some moments before the hard set look on the face of the countess softened it did soften at last however and she turned to patsy and said simply  we will prepare for the journey at once pray excuse us niklas will serve refreshments we will not detain you long  as they turned to leave the room elizabeth denton suddenly seized patsys hand  he will live she whispered tell me he will live  patsys heart sank but she summoned her wits by an effort  i am not a surgeon my dear and do not know how serious the wound may be she answered but i assure you it will gladden his heart to see you again he thinks and speaks only of you  the girlwife studied her face a moment and then dropped her hand and hurried after her mother  i fibbed uncle said patsy despondently i fibbed willfully buthow could i help it when she looked at me that way     chapter xv  dr gys surprises himself   henderson was waiting with the launch at the ostend docks lieutenant von holtz was earnestly thanked by patsy and uncle john for his kindness and in return he exacted a promise from them to hunt him up in germany some day when the war was ended the countess and mrs denton sad and blackrobed had been made comfortable in the stern seats of the boat and the captain was just about to order henderson to start the engine when up to them rushed the fat belgian woman and her two children  without an instants hesitation the two youngsters leaped aboard like cats and their mother would have followed but for the restraining hand of captain carg  what does this mean cried mr merrick angrily  the woman jabbered volubly in french  she says interpreted patsy that we promised to take her to dunkirk so she may find her husband  let her walk said uncle john  the germans wont allow her to cross the lines what does it matter uncle we have plenty of room in three hours we can be rid of them and doubtless the poor thing is really anxious to find her lost husband who was last seen in dunkirk  he is a spy and a traitor to both sides according to report  that isnt our affair is it and i suppose even people of that class have hearts and affections  well let her come aboard captain decided uncle john we cant waste time in arguing  they stowed her away in the bow under hendersons care and threatened the children with dire punishment if they moved from under her shadow then the launch sped out into the bay and away toward dunkirk  three days had brought many changes to the hospital ship arabella of the original batch of patients only lieutenant elbl the german and andrew denton now remained all the others had been sent home transferred to the government hospitals or gone back to the front according to the character of their injuries this was necessary because their places were needed by the newly wounded who were brought each day from the front little maurie was driving the ambulance again and with ajo beside him and dr kelsey and a sailor for assistants the belgian would make a dash to ypres or dixmude or furnes and return with a full load of wounded soldiers  these were the days of the severest fighting in flanders fighting so severe that it could not keep up for long there would come a lull presently when the overworked nurses and surgeons could get a bit of sleep and draw a long breath again  gys had elected to remain aboard the ship where with maud and beth he was kept busy night and day two french girlsyoung women of good birth and intelligencehad been selected by dr gys from a number of applicants as assistant nurses and although they were inexperienced their patriotic zeal rendered them valuable they now wore the red cross uniforms and it was decided to retain them as long as the ships hospital remained crowded  there was plenty of work for all and the worry and long hours might have broken down the health and strength of beth and maud had not the doctor instituted regular periods of duty for each member of the force and insisted on the schedule being carried out  this hospital ship was by no means so gloomy a place as the reader may imagine the soldiers were prone to regard their hurts lightly as a bit of hard luck and since many had slight injuries it was customary for them to gather in groups upon the deck where they would laugh and chat together play cards for amusement or smoke quantities of cigarettes they were mainly kindhearted and grateful fellows and openly rejoiced that the misfortunes of war had cast their lot on this floating hospital  under the probe of the surgeon today a fortnight hence back on the firing line was not very unusual with these brave men the ambulances had gathered in a few german soldiers who would become prisoners of war on their recovery and while these were inclined to be despondent and unsociable they were treated courteously by all the americans showing no preference for any nation the large majority of the patients however came from the ranks of the alliesfrench english and belgianand these were men who could smile and be merry with bandaged heads arms asling legs in splints bullet holes here and there such afflictions being regarded by their victims with a certain degree of pride  dr gys was in his element for now he had ample opportunity to display his skill and his patients were unable to jump to another doctor in case his ugly features revolted them his main interest however lay in the desperately wounded belgian private andrew denton whom he had agreed to keep alive until the return of miss doyle and her uncle  in making this promise gys had figured on a possible delay of several days but on the second day following patsys departure the sudden sinking of his patient aroused a defiant streak in the surgeon and he decided to adopt drastic measures in order to prevent denton from passing away before his wifes arrival  i want you to assist me in a serious operation he said to maud stanton by all the rules and precedents of human flesh that fellow denton ought to succumb to his wound within the next three hours the shell played havoc with his interior and i have never dared until now to attempt to patch things up but if were going to keep him alive until morning or until your cousins return we must accomplish the impossible  what is that she inquired  remove his vital organs tinker them up and put them back so they will work properly  can that be done doctor  i think not but im going to try it i am positive that if we leave him alone he has less than three hours of life remaining so if we fail miss stanton as it is reasonable to expect poor denton will merely be spared a couple of hours of pain get the anaesthetics please  with all her training and experience as a nurse maud was half terrified at the ordeal before her but she realized the logic of the doctors conclusion and steeled her nerves to do her part  an hour later she stood looking down upon the patient he was still upon the operating table but breathing quietly and as strongly as at any time since he had received his wound  this shows dr gys said to her his voice keen with elation what fools we are to take any human condition for granted man is a machine smash his mechanism and it cannot work make the proper repairs before it is too late andthere he goes ticking away as before not as good a machine as it was prior to the break but with care and caution it will run a long time  he will live then you think she asked softly marveling that after what she had witnessed the man was still able to breathe  gys leaned down and put his ear to the heart of the patient for two minutes he remained motionless then he straightened up and a smile spread over his disfigured features  i confidently believe miss stanton we have turned the trick luck let us call it for no sensible surgeon would have attempted the thing rest assured that andrew denton will live for the next ten days more than that with no serious setback he may fully recover and live for many years to come  he was so pleased that tears stood in his one good eye and he wiped them away sheepishly the girl took his hand and pressed it in both her own  you are wonderfulwonderful she said  dont pleasedont look in my face he pleaded  i wont she returned dropping her eyes i will think only of the clever brain the skillful hand and the stout heart  not even that he said think of the girl wifeof elizabeth it was she who steadied my hand today indeed miss stanton it was elizabeths influence that saved him but for her we would have let him die     chapter xvi  clarette   so it was toward evening of the fourth day that the launch finally sighted the ship arabella delays and difficulties had been encountered in spite of government credentials and laissezpasser and patsy had begun to fear they would not reach the harbor of dunkirk before dark  all through the journey the belgian woman and her children had sat sullenly in the bow the youngsters kept from mischief by the stern eye of henderson in the stern seats however the original frigid silence had been thawed by patsy doyles bright chatter she began by telling the countess and elizabeth all about herself and beth and maud and uncle john relating how they had come to embark upon this unusual mission of nursing the wounded of a foreign war and how they had secured the services of the clever but disfigured surgeon dr gys she gave the ladies a clear picture of the hospital ship and told how the girls had made their dash to the firing line during the battle of nieuport and brought back an ambulance full of woundedincluding andrew denton  patsy did not answer very fully elizabeth dentons eager questions concerning the nature of her husbands injuries but she tried to prepare the poor young wife for the knowledge that the wound would prove fatal this was a most delicate and difficult thing to do and patsy blundered and floundered until her very ambiguity aroused alarm  tell me the worst begged elizabeth denton her face pale and tensely drawn  why i cannot do that you see replied patsy because the worst hasnt happened yet nor can i tell you the best because a wound is such an uncertain thing it was a shell you know that exploded behind him and dr gys thought it made a rather serious wound mr denton was unconscious a long time and when he came to himself we eased his pain so he would not suffer  you came to get me because you thought he would die  i came because he asked me to read to him your letters and i found they comforted him so much that your presence would i knew comfort him more  there was a long silence presently the countess asked in her soft even voice  will he be alive when we get there  patsy thought of the days that had been wasted because of their detention at ostend through colonel graus stupidity  i hope so madam was all she could reply  conversation lagged after this episode elizabeth was weeping quietly on her mothers shoulder patsy felt relief in the knowledge that she had prepared them as well as she could for whatever might wait upon their arrival  the launch made directly for the ship and as she came alongside to the ladder the rail was lined with faces curious to discover if the errand had been successful doctor gys was there to receive them smiling horribly as he greeted the two women in black maud seeing that they recoiled from the doctors appearance took his place and said cheerfully  mr denton is asleep just now but by the time you have bathed and had a cup of tea i am quite sure he will be ready to receive you  tell me how is he are you his nurse asked the young wife with trembling lips  i am his nurse and i assure you he is doing very well answered maud with her pleasant winning smile when he finds you by his side i am sure his recovery will be rapid no nurse can take the place of a wife you know  patsy looked at her reproachfully thinking she was misleading the poor young wife but maud led the ladies away to a stateroom and it was dr gys who explained the wonderful improvement in the patient  well remarked uncle john if wed known he had a chance we wouldnt have worried so because we were held up in fact if wed known he would get well we neednt have gone at all  oh uncle john cried patsy reprovingly  it was your going that saved him declared the doctor i promised to keep him alive for that little wife of his and when he took a turn for the worse i had to assume desperate chanceswhich won out  meantime the big belgian woman and her children had been helped up the ladder by henderson who stood respectfully by awaiting orders for their disposal the mother had her eye on the shore and was scowling steadily upon it when little maurie came on deck and strolled toward mr merrick to greet him on his return indeed he had approached to within a dozen feet of the group when the woman at the rail suddenly turned and saw him  ahamon henri she cried and made a dash toward him with outstretched arms  clarette  maurie stopped short he grew pallid he trembled but he did not await her coming with a howl that would have shamed a wild indian he leaped upon the rail and made a dive into the water below  even as her engulfing arms closed around the spot where he had stood there was a splash and splutter that drew everyone to the side to watch the little belgian swim frantically to the docks  the woman grabbed a child with either arm and held them up  see she cried there is your fatherthe cowardthe traitorthe deserter of his loving family he thinks to escape but we shall capture him yet and when we do  hurry father screamed the little girl or shell get you  a slap on the mouth silenced her and set the boy wailing dismally the boy was accustomed to howl without provocation he kicked his mother until she let him down by this time they could discern only mauries head bobbing in the distant water presently he clambered up the dock and ran dripping toward the city disappearing among the buildings  madam said uncle john sternly you have cost us the best chauffeur we ever had  she did not understand english but she shook her fist in mr merricks face and danced around in an elephantine fashion and jabbered a stream of french  what does she say he asked patsy who was laughing merrily at the absurd scene  she demands to be put ashore at once but shall we do that and put poor maurie in peril of being overtaken  self preservation is the first law of nature my dear replied uncle john im sorry for maurie but he alone is responsible henderson he added turning to the sailor put this woman ashore as soon as possible weve had enough of her     chapter xvii  perplexing problems   although the famous battle of nieuport had come to an end the fighting in west flanders was by no means over all along the line fierce and relentless war waged without interruption and if neither side could claim victory neither side suffered defeat day after day hundreds of combatants fell hundreds of disabled limped to the rear hundreds were made prisoners and always a stream of reinforcements came to take the places of the missing ones towns were occupied today by the germans tomorrow by the allies from nieuport on past dixmude and beyond ypres the dykes had been opened and the low country was one vast lake the only approaches from french territory were half a dozen roads built high above the water line which rendered them capable of stubborn defence  dunkirk was thronged with reservesenglish belgian and french the turcos and east indians were employed by the british in this section and were as much dreaded by the civilians as the enemy uncle john noticed that military discipline was not so strict in dunkirk as at ostend but the germans had but one people to control while the french town was host to many nations and races  strange as it may appear the war was growing monotonous to those who were able to view it closely perhaps because nothing important resulted from all the desperate continuous fighting the people were pursuing their accustomed vocations while shells burst and bullets whizzed around them they must manage to live whatever the outcome of this struggle of nations might be  aboard the american hospital ship there was as yet no sense of monotony the three girls who had conceived and carried out this remarkable philanthropy were as busy as bees during all their waking hours and the spirit of helpful charity so strongly possessed them that all their thoughts were centered on their work no two cases were exactly alike and it was interesting to the verge of fascination to watch the results of various treatments of divers wounds and afflictions  the girls often congratulated themselves on having secured so efficient a surgeon as doctor gys who gloried in his work and whose judgment based on practical experience was comprehensive and unfailing the mans horribly contorted features had now become so familiar to the girls that they seldom noticed themunless a cry of fear from some newly arrived and unnerved patient reminded them that the doctor was exceedingly repulsive to strangers  no one recognized this grotesque hideousness more than doctor gys himself when one poor frenchman died under the operating knife staring with horror into the uncanny face the surgeon bent over him beth was almost sure the fright had hastened his end she said to gys that evening when they met on deck wouldnt it be wise for you to wear a mask in the operating room  he considered the suggestion a moment a deep flush spreading over his face then he nodded gravely  it may be an excellent idea he agreed once a couple of years ago i proposed wearing a mask wherever i went but my friends assured me the effect would be so marked that it would attract to me an embarrassing amount of attention i have trained myself to bear the repulsion involuntarily exhibited by all i meet and have taught myself to take a philosophic if somewhat cynical view of my facial blemishes yet in this work i can see how a mask might be merciful to my patients i will experiment a bit along this line if you will help me and well see what we can accomplish  you must not think she said quietly for she detected a little bitterness in his tone that you are in any way repulsive to those who know you well we all admire you as a man and are grieved at the misfortunes that marred your features after all doctor people of intelligence seldom judge one by appearances  however they may judge me said he im a failure you say you admire me as a man but you dont its just a bit of diplomatic flattery im a good doctor and surgeon ill admit but my face is no more repellent than my cowardly nature miss beth i hate myself for my cowardice far more than i detest my ghastly countenance yet i am powerless to remedy either defect  i believe that what you term your cowardice is merely a physical weakness declared the girl it must have been caused by the suffering you endured at the time of your various injuries i have noticed that suffering frequently unnerves one and that a person who has once been badly hurt lives in nervous terror of being hurt again  you are very kind to try to excuse my fault said he but the truth is i have always been a cowardfrom boyhood up  yet you embarked on all those dangerous expeditions  yes just to have fun with myself to sneer at the coward flesh so to speak i used to long for dangers and when they came upon me i would jeer at and revile the quaking i could not repress i pushed my shrinking body into peril and exulted in the punishment it received  beth looked at him wonderingly  you are a strange man indeed said she really i cannot understand your mental attitude at all  he chuckled and rubbed his hands together gleefully  i can he returned for i know what causes it and then he went away and left her still seeming highly amused at her bewilderment  in the operating room the next day gys appeared with a rubber mask drawn across his features the girls decided that it certainly improved his appearance odd as the masked face might appear to strangers it hid the dreadful nose and the scars and to an extent evened the size of the eyes for the holes through which he peered were made alike gys was himself pleased with the device for after that he wore the mask almost constantly only laying it aside during the evenings when he sat on deck  it was three days after the arrival of mrs denton and her motherwhose advent had accomplished much toward promoting the young belgians convalescencewhen little maurie suddenly reappeared on the deck of the arabella  oh said patsy finding him there when she came up from breakfast where is clarette  he shook his head sadly  we do not live together just now said he clarette is by nature temperamental you know she is highly sensitive and i alas do not always please her  did she find you in dunkirk asked the girl  almost mamselle but not quite it was this way i knew if i permitted her to follow me she would finally succeed in her quest for she and the dear children have six eyes among them while i have but two so i reposed within an ashbarrel until they had passed on and then i followed them keeping well out of their sight in that way i managed to escape but it proved a hard task for my clarette is very persistent as you may have noticed so i decided i would be more safe upon the ship than upon the shore she is not likely to seek me here and in any event she floats better than she swims  patsy regarded the little man curiously  did you not tell us when first we met you that you were heartbroken over the separation from your wife and children she inquired in severe tones  yes of course mamselle it was a good way to arouse your sympathy he admitted with an air of pride i needed sympathy at that time and my only fear was that you would find clarette as you threatened to do well with a deep sigh you did find her it was an unfriendly act mamselle  they told us in ostend that the husband of clarette is a condemned spy one who served both sides and proved false to each the husband of clarette is doomed to suffer death at the hands of the germans or the belgians if either is able to discover him  maurie removed his cap and scratched the hair over his left ear reflectively  ah yes the blacksmith said he i suspected that blacksmith fellow was not reliable  how many husbands has clarette  with the blacksmith there are two of us answered maurie brightly doubtless there would be more if anything happened to me for clarette is very fascinating when she divorced the blacksmith he was disconsolate and threatened vengeance so her life is quite occupied in avoiding her first husband and keeping track of her second who is too kindhearted to threaten her as the blacksmith did i really admire claretteat a distance she is positively charming when her mind is free from worryand the children are asleep  then you think said ajo who was standing by and listening to mauries labored explanations that it is the blacksmith who is condemned as a spy and not yourself  i am quite sure of it am i not here driving your ambulance and going boldly among the officers if it is jakob maurie they wish he is at hand to be arrested  but you are not jakob maurie  the belgian gave a start but instantly recovering he answered with a smile  then i must have mistaken my identity monsieur perhaps you will tell me who i am  your wife called you henri said patsy  ah yes a pet name i believe the blacksmith is named henri and poor clarette is so accustomed to it that she calls me henri when she wishes to be affectionate  patsy realized the folly of arguing with him  maurie said she or whatever your name may be you have been faithful in your duty to us and we have no cause for complaint but i believe you do not speak the truth and that you are shifty and artful i fear you will come to a bad end  sometimes mamselle he replied i fear so myself but peste why should we care if it is the end what matter whether it is good or bad  watching their faces closely he saw frank disapproval of his sentiments written thereon it disturbed him somewhat that they did not choose to continue the conversation so he said meekly  with your kind permission i will now go below for a cup of coffee and left them with a bow and a flourish of his cap when he had gone patsy said to ajo  i dont believe there is any such person as the blacksmith  nor i was the boys reply both those children are living images of maurie who claims the blacksmith was their father hes a crafty little fellow that chauffeur of ours and we must look out for him  if he is really a spy continued the girl after a brief period of thought i am amazed that he dared join our party and go directly to the front where he is at any time likely to be recognized  yes that is certainly puzzling returned ajo and hes a brave little man too fearless of danger and reckless in exposing himself to shot and shell indeed our maurie is something of a mystery and the only thing i fully understand is his objection to clarettes society  at le revue matin as the girls called the first inspection of the morning eight of their patients were found sufficiently recovered to be discharged some of these returned to their regiments and others were sent to their homes to await complete recovery the hospital ship could accommodate ten more patients so it was decided to make a trip to dixmude where an artillery engagement was raging with the larger ambulance  i think i shall go today announced gys who was wearing his mask dr kelsey can look after the patients and it will do me good to get off the ship  uncle john looked at the doctor seriously  there is hard fighting they say in the dixmude district the germans carried the british trenches yesterday and today the allies will try to retake them  i dont mind returned the doctor but he shuddered nevertheless  why dont you avoid thethe danger line suggested mr merrick  a man cant run away from himself sir and perhaps you can understand the fascination i find in taunting the craven spirit within me  no i cant understand it but suit yourself  i shall drive announced maurie  you may be recognized said patsy warningly  clarette will not be at the front and on the way i shall be driving have you noticed how people scatter at the sound of our gong  the authorities are watching for spies asserted ajo  mauries face became solemn  yes of course butthe blacksmith is not here and he added with assurance the badge of the red cross protects us from false accusations  when they had gone uncle john said thoughtfully to the girls  that remark about the red cross impressed me if that fellow maurie is really in danger of being arrested and shot he has cleverly placed himself in the safest service in the world he knows that none of our party is liable to be suspected of evil     chapter xviii  a question of loyalty   during the morning they were visited by a french official who came aboard in a government boat and asked to see mr merrick  the ship had been inspected several times by the commander of the port and the civil authorities and its fame as a model hospital had spread over all flanders some attempt had been made to place with the americans the most important of the woundedofficers of high rank or those of social prominence and wealthbut mr merrick and his aids were determined to show no partiality they received the lowly and humble as well as the high and mighty and the only requisite for admission was an injury that demanded the care of good nurses and the skill of competent surgeons  uncle john knew the french general and greeted him warmly for he appreciated his generous cooperation but beth had to be called in to interpret because her uncle knew so little of the native language  first they paid a visit to the hospital section where the patients were inspected then the register and records were carefully gone over and notes taken by the generals secretary finally they returned to the afterdeck to review the convalescents who were lounging there in their cushioned deckchairs  where is the german lieutenant elbl inquired the general looking around with sudden suspicion  in the captains room replied beth would you like to see him  if you please  the group moved forward to the room occupied by captain carg the door and windows stood open and reclining upon a couch inside was the maimed german with carg sitting beside him both were solemnly smoking their pipes  the captain rose as the general entered while elbl gave his visitor a military salute  so you are better asked the frenchman  beth repeated this in english to carg who repeated it in german to elbl yes the wounded man was doing very well  will you keep him here much longer was the next question directed to mr merrick  i think so was the reply he is still quite weak although the wound is healing nicely being a military prisoner there is no other place open to him where the man can be as comfortable as here  you will be responsible for his person you will guarantee that he will not escape  mr merrick hesitated  must we promise that he inquired  otherwise i shall be obliged to remove him to a government hospital  i dont like that not that your hospitals are not good enough for a prisoner but elbl happens to be a cousin of our captain which puts a different face on the matter what do you say captain carg shall we guarantee that your cousin will not try to escape  why should he sir he can never rejoin the army thats certain replied carg  true said the general when this was conveyed to him by beth nevertheless he is a prisoner of war and must not be allowed to escape to his own people  beth answered the frenchman herself looking him straight in the face  that strikes me as unfair sir said she the german must henceforth be a noncombatant he has been unable since he was wounded and brought here to learn any of your military secrets and at the best he will lie a helpless invalid for weeks to come therefore instead of making him a prisoner it would be more humane to permit him to return to his home and family in germany  the general smiled indulgently  it might be more humane mademoiselle but unfortunately it is against the military code did i understand that your captain will guarantee the germans safety  of course said carg if he escapes i will surrender myself in his place  ah but we moderns cannot accept pythias if damon runs away laughed the general but there it will be simpler to send a parole for him to sign when he may be left in your charge until he is sufficiently recovered to bear the confinement of a prison is that satisfactory  certainly sir replied the captain  elbl had remained silent during this conversation appearing not to understand the french and english spoken indeed since his arrival he had only spoken the german language and that mostly in his intercourse with carg but after the french officer had gone away beth began to reflect upon this reticence  isnt it queer she remarked to uncle john that an educated germanone who has been through college as captain carg says elbl hasshould be unable to understand either french or english i have always been told the german colleges are very thorough and you know that while at ostend we found nearly all the german officers spoke good english  it is rather strange come to think of it answered uncle john i believe the study of languages is a part of the german military education but i regret that the french are determined to keep the poor fellow a prisoner such a precaution is absurd to my mind  i think i can understand the french position said the girl reflectively these germans are very obstinate and much as i admire lieutenant elbl i feel sure that were he able he would fight the french again tomorrow after his recovery he might even get one of those mechanical feet and be back on the firing line  hes a uhlan  then he could ride a horse i believe uncle the french are justified in retaining him as a prisoner until the war is over  meantime in the captains room the two men were quietly conversing  he wants you to sign a parole said carg  not i  you may as well im responsible for your safety  i deny anyones right to be responsible for me if you have made a promise to that effect withdraw it said the german  if i do theyll put you in prison  not at present i am still an invalid in reality i am weak and suffering yet i am already planning my escape and that is why i insist that you withdraw any promise you have made otherwise  otherwise  instead of escaping by water as i had intended to ostend i must go to the prison and escape from there it will be more difficult the water route is best  of course agreed the captain smiling calmly  one of your launches would carry me to ostend and return here between dark and daylight  easily enough said carg it was five minutes before he resumed his speech then he said with quiet deliberation cousin i am an american and americans are neutral in this war  you are sangoan  my ship is chartered by americans which obliges the captain of the ship to be loyal to its masters i will do nothing to conflict with the interests of the americans not even to favor my cousin  quite right said elbl  if you have any plan of escape in mind do not tell me of it continued the captain i shall order the launches guarded carefully i shall do all in my power to prevent your getting away from this ship  thank you said the german you have my respect cousin pass the tobacco     chapter xix  the capture   there was considerable excitement when the ambulance returned part of the roof had been torn away the doors were gone the interior wrecked and not a pane of glass remained in the sides yet ajo drove it to the dock the motor working as smoothly as ever and half a dozen wounded were helped out and put into the launch to be taken aboard the hospital ship  when all were on deck young jones briefly explained what had happened a shell had struck the ambulance which had been left in the rear but without injuring the motor in any way fortunately no one was near at the time when they returned they cleared away the rubbish to make room for a few wounded men and then started back to the city  doctor gys hatless and coatless his hair awry and the mask making him look more hideous than ever returned with the party and came creeping up the ships ladder in so nervous a condition that his trembling knees fairly knocked together  the group around ajo watched him silently  what do you think that fool did asked the boy as gys slunk away to his room  tell us pleaded patsy who was one of the curious group surrounding him  we had gone near to where a machine gun was planted to pick up a fallen soldier when without warning the germans charged the gun maurie and i made a run for life but gys stood stock still facing the enemy a man at the gun reeled and fell just then and with a hail of bullets flying around him the doctor coolly walked up and bent over him the sight so amazed the germans that they actually stopped fighting and waited for him perhaps it was the red cross on the doctors arm that influenced them but imagine a body of soldiers in the heat of a charge suddenly stopping because of one man  well what happened asked mr merrick  i couldnt see very well for a battery that supported the charge was shelling the retreating allies and just then our ambulance was hit but maurie says he watched the scene and that when gys attempted to lift the wounded man up he suddenly turned weak as water the germans had captured the gun by this time and their officer himself hoisted the injured man upon the doctors shoulders and attended him to our ambulance when i saw the fight was over i hastened to help gys who staggered so weakly that he would have dropped his man a dozen times on the way had not the germans held him up they were laughing as if the whole thing was a joke when crack came a volley of bullets and with a great shout back rushed the french and belgians in a countercharge i admit i ducked crawling under the ambulance and the germans were so surprised that they beat a quick retreat  and now it was that gys made a fool of himself he tore off his cap and coat which bore the red cross emblem and leaped right between the two lines here were the germans firing as they retreated and the allies firing as they charged and right in the center of the fray stood gys the man ought to have been shot to pieces but nothing touched him until a frenchman knocked him over because he was in the way of the rush it was the most reckless suicidal act i ever heard of  uncle john looked worried he had never told any of them of dr gys strange remark during their first interview but he had not forgotten it ill be happier when i can shake off this horrible envelope of disfigurement the doctor had declared and in view of this the report of that days adventure gave the kindhearted gentleman a severe shock  he walked the deck thoughtfully while the girls hurried below to look after the new patients who had been brought not too comfortably in the damaged ambulance it was a bad fight ajo had reported and the wounded were thick but we could only bring a few of them before we left the field however an english ambulance and two french ones arrived and that gave us an opportunity to get away indeed i was so unnerved by the dangers we had miraculously escaped that i was glad to be out of it  uncle john tried hard to understand doctor gys but the mans strange abnormal nature was incomprehensible when half an hour later mr merrick went below he found the doctor in the operating room cool and steady of nerve and dressing wounds in his best professional manner  upon examination the next morning the large ambulance was found to be so badly damaged that it had to be taken to a repair shop in the city to undergo reconstruction it would take several weeks to put it in shape declared the french mechanics so the americans would be forced to get along with the smaller vehicle jones and dr kelsey made regular trips with this but the fighting had suddenly lulled and for several days no new patients were brought to the ship although many were given first aid in the trenches for slight wounds  so the colony aboard the arabella grew gradually less until on the twentysixth of november the girls found they had but two patients to care forelbl and andrew denton neither required much nursing and dentons young wife insisted on taking full charge of him but while the hospital ship was not in demand at this time there were casualties day by day in the trenches where the armies faced each other doggedly and watchfully and shots were frequently interchanged when a soldier carelessly exposed his person to the enemy so the girls took turns going with the ambulance and uncle john made no protest because so little danger attended these journeys  each day while one of the american girls rode to the front the other two would visit the city hospitals and render whatever assistance they could to the regular nurses gys sometimes accompanied them and sometimes went to the front with the ambulance but he never caused his friends anxiety on these trips because he could not endanger his life owing to the cessation of fighting  the only incident that enlivened this period of stagnation was the capture of maurie no the authorities didnt get him but clarette did ajo and patsy had gone into the city one afternoon and on their return to the docks where their launch was moored they found a street urchin awaiting them with a soiled scrap of paper clenched fast in his fist he surrendered it for a coin and patsy found the following words scrawled in english  she has me fast help be quick i cannot save myself so you must save me it is your maurie who is in distress  they laughed a little at first and then began to realize that the loss of their chauffeur would prove a hardship when fighting was resumed maurie might not be a good husband and he might be afraid of a woman but was valuable when bullets were flying patsy asked the boy  can you lead us to the man who gave you this paper  oui mamselle  then hurry and you shall have five centimes more  the injunction was unnecessary for the urchin made them hasten to keep up with him he made many turns and twists through narrow alleys and back streets until finally he brought them to a row of cheap plastered huts built against the old city wall there was no mistaking the place for in the doorway of one of the poorest dwellings stood clarette her ample figure fairly filling the opening her hands planted firmly on her broad hips  good evening said patsy pleasantly is maurie within  henri is within answered clarette with a fierce scowl and he is going to stay within  but we have need of his services said ajo sternly and the man is in our employ and under contract to obey us  i also need his services retorted clarette and i made a contract with him before you did as my marriage papers will prove  the little boy and girl had now crowded into the doorway on either side of their mother clinging to her skirts while they made faces at the americans clarette turned to drive the children away and in the act allowed patsy and ajo to glance past her into the hut  there stood little maurie sleeves rolled above his elbows bending over a battered dishpan where he was washing a mess of cracked and broken pottery he met their gaze with a despairing countenance and a gesture of appeal that scattered a spray of suds from big wet fingers next moment clarette had filled the doorway again  you may as well go away said the woman harshly  patsy stood irresolute  have you money to pay the rent and to provide food and clothing she presently asked  i have found a few francs in henris pockets was the surly reply  and when they are gone  clarette gave a shrug  when they are gone we shall not starve she said there is plenty of charity for the belgians these days one has but to ask and someone gives  then you will not let us have maurie  no mademoiselle then she unbent a little and added if my husband goes to you they will be sure to catch him some day and when they catch him they will shoot him  why  dont you know  no  clarette smiled grimly  when henri escapes me he always gets himself into trouble he is not so very bad but he is carelessand foolish he tries to help the germans and the french at the same time to be accommodating and so both have conceived a desire to shoot him well when they shoot him he can no longer earn money to support me and his children  are they really his children inquired young jones  who else may claim them monsieur  i thought they were the children of your first husband the blacksmith  clarette glared at him with lowering brow  blacksmith pah i have no husband but henri and heaven forsook me when i married him  come patsy said ajo to his companion our errand here is hopeless andperhaps clarette is right  they made their way back to the launch in silence patsy was quite disappointed in maurie he had so many admirable qualities that it was a shame he could be so untruthful and unreliable  as time passed on the monotony that followed their first exciting experiences grew upon them and became oppressive december weather in flanders brought cutting winds from off the north sea and often there were flurries of snow in the air they had steam heat inside the ship but the deck was no longer a practical lounging place  toward the last of the month lieutenant elbl was so fully recovered that he was able to hobble about on crutches the friendship between the two cousins continued and elbl was often found in the captains room no more had been said about a parole but the french officials were evidently keeping an eye on the german for one morning an order came to mr merrick to deliver elbl to the warden of the military prison at dunkirk on or before ten oclock the following day  while the german received this notification with his accustomed stolid air of indifference his american friends were all grieved at his transfer they knew the prison would be very uncomfortable for the invalid and feared he was not yet sufficiently recovered to be able to bear the new conditions imposed upon him there was no thought of protesting the order however for they appreciated the fact that the commandant had been especially lenient in leaving the prisoner so long in their care  the americans were all sitting together in the cabin that evening after dinner when to their astonishment little maurie came aboard in a skiff bearing an order from the french commandant to captain carg requesting him to appear at once at military headquarters  not only was carg puzzled by this strange summons but none of the others could understand it the belgian when questioned merely shook his head he was not the generals confidant but his fee as messenger would enable him to buy bread for his family and he had been chosen because he knew the way to the hospital ship  as there was nothing to do but obey the captain went ashore in one of the launches which towed the skiff in which maurie had come  when he had gone lieutenant elbl who had been sitting in the cabin bade the others good night and retired to his room most of the others retired early but patsy uncle john and doctor gys decided to sit up and await the return of the captain it was an exceptionally cool evening and the warmth of the forward cabin was very agreeable  midnight had arrived when the captains launch finally drew up to the side and carg came hastening into the cabin his agitated manner was so unusual that the three watchers with one accord sprang to their feet with inquiring looks  wheres elbl asked the captain sharply  gone to bed said uncle john  when  hours ago i think he missed your society and was rather broken up over the necessity of leaving us tomorrow  without hesitation carg turned on his heel and hastened aft they followed him in a wondering group reaching the germans stateroom the captain threw open the door and found it vacant  humph he exclaimed i suspected the truth when i found our launch was gone  which launch asked uncle john bewildered  the one i left with the ship on my return just now i discovered it was not at its moorings someone has stolen it  they stared at him in amazement  wasnt the deck patrolled asked patsy the first to recover  we dont set a watch till tenthirty it wasnt considered necessary but i had no suspicion of the trick elbl has played on me tonight he added with a groan their voices had aroused others ajo came out of his room enveloped in a heavy bathrobe and soon after maud and beth joined them  whats up demanded the boy  the german has tricked us and made his escape quietly answered dr gys for my part im glad of it  it was a conspiracy growled the captain that rascal maurie  oh was maurie in it  of course he was the decoy perhaps he arranged the whole thing  didnt the general want you then  carg was so enraged that he fairly snorted  want me of course he didnt want me that treacherous little belgian led me into the waiting room and said the general would see me in a minute then he walked away and i sat there like a bump on a log and waited finally i began to wonder how maurie who was always shy of facing the authorities had happened to be the generals messenger it looked queer officers and civilians were passing back and forth but no one paid any attention to me so after an hour or so i asked an officer who entered from an inner room when i could see the general he said the general was not there evenings but would be in his office tomorrow morning then i showed him my order and he glanced at it and said it was forged wasnt the generals signature and wasnt in proper form anyhow when i started to go he wouldnt let me said the affair was suspicious and needed investigation so he took me to a room full of officers and they asked me a thousand fool questions said they had no record of a belgian named maurie and had never heard of him before i couldnt figure the thing out and they couldnt so finally they let me come back to the ship  strange mused uncle john very strange  i was so stupid continued carg that i never thought of elbl being at the bottom of the affair until i got back and found our launch missing then i remembered that elbl was to have been turned over to the prison authorities tomorrow and like a flash i saw through the whole thing  im blamed if i do declared mr merrick  the others likewise shook their heads  he got me out of the way stole the launch and is half way to ostend by this time  alone and woundedstill an invalid  doubtless maurie is with him the rascal can run an automobile so i suppose he can run a launch  what puzzles me remarked patsy is how lieutenant elbl ever got hold of maurie and induced him to assist him without our knowing anything about it  i used to notice them talking together a good bit said jones  but clarette has kept maurie a prisoner she wouldnt let him come back to the ship  he was certainly at liberty tonight answered beth isnt this escape liable to be rather embarrassing to us uncle john  im afraid so was the reply we agreed to keep him safely until the authorities demanded we give him up and now at the last minute weve allowed him to get away  anxiety was written on every countenance as they considered the serious nature of this affair only gys seemed composed and unworried  is it too late to go in chase of the launch asked ajo breaking a long pause theyre headed for ostend without a doubt and theres a chance that they may run into a sandbank in the dark or break down or meet with some other accident to delay them  i believe its worth our while sir answered carg the launch we have is the faster and the trip will show our good faith if nothing more  then make ready to start at once said ajo and ill dress and go along  carg hurried away to give orders and the boy ran to his stateroom five minutes later they were away with four sailors to assist in the capture of the fugitives in case they were overtaken  it was a fruitless journey however at daybreak as they neared ostend they met their stolen launch coming back in charge of a sleepy belgian who had been hired to return it the man frankly stated that he had undertaken the task in order to get to dunkirk where he had friends and he had been liberally paid by a german on crutches who had one foot missing and a little belgian whom he had never seen before but who from the description given could be none other than maurie  they carried the man back with them to the arabella where further questioning added nothing to their information they now had proof however that elbl was safe with his countrymen at ostend and that maurie had been his accomplice  i would not believe said patsy when she heard the story that a belgian could be so disloyal to his country  every nation has its quota of black sheep replied uncle john and from what we have learned of mauries character he is not at all particular which side he serves     chapter xx  the dunes   the escape of a prisoner of war from the american hospital ship was made the subject of a rigid inquiry by the officials and proved extremely humiliating to all on board the arabella the commandant showed his irritation by severely reprimanding mr merrick for carelessness while captain carg had to endure a personal examination before a board of inquiry he was able to prove that he had been at headquarters during the evening of the escape but that did not wholly satisfy his inquisitors finally an order was issued forbidding the americans to take any more wounded germans or austrians aboard their ship and that seemed to end the unpleasant affair  however a certain friction was engendered that was later evidenced on both sides the american ambulance was no longer favored on its trips to the front pointed preference being given the english and french red cross emergency corps this resulted in few wounded being taken to the arabella as the americans confined their work largely to assisting the injured on the field of battle the girls were not to be daunted in their determined efforts to aid the unfortunate and every day one of them visited the trenches to assist the two doctors in rendering first aid to the wounded  the work was no longer arduous for often entire days would pass without a single casualty demanding their attention the cold weather resulted in much sickness among the soldiers however and gys found during this period of military inactivity that his medicine chest was more in demand than his case of surgical instruments  a slight diversion was created by clarette who came to the ship to demand her husband from the americans it seemed almost impossible to convince her that maurie was not hidden somewhere aboard but at last they made the woman understand he had escaped with the german to ostend they learned from her that maurieor henri as she insisted he was namedhad several times escaped from her house at night while she was asleep and returned at daybreak in the morning and this information led them to suspect he had managed to have several secret conferences with lieutenant elbl previous to their flight clarette announced her determination to follow her husband to ostend and perhaps she did so as they did not see her again  it was on sunday the twentieth of december that the battle of the dunes began and the flames of war burst out afresh the dunes lay between the north sea and the yser river in west flanders and consisted of a stretch of sandy hillocks reaching from coxyde to nieuport les bains the belgians had entrenched these dunes in an elaborate and clever manner shoveling the sand into a series of high lateral ridges with alternate hollows which reached for miles along the coast the hollows were from six to eight feet deep affording protection to the soldiers who could nevertheless fire upon the enemy by creeping up the sloping embankments until their heads projected sufficiently to allow them to aim when they could drop back to safety  in order to connect the hollows one with another that an advance or retreat might be made under cover narrow trenches had been cut at intervals diagonally through the raised mounds of sand military experts considered this series of novel fortifications to be practically impregnable for should the enemy defile through one of the cross passages into a hollow where the allies were gathered they could be picked off one by one as they appeared and be absolutely annihilated  realizing this the germans had not risked an attack but after long study of the defences had decided that by means of artillery they might shell the belgians who held the dunes and destroy them as they lay in the hollows so a heavy battery had been planted along the german lines for this work while in defence the belgians confronted them with their own famous dog artillery consisting of the deadly machine guns the battle of december twentieth therefore began with an artillery duel resulting in so many casualties that the red cross workers found themselves fully occupied  beth went with the ambulance the first day worked in the hollows of the dunes and returned to the ship at night completely worn out by the demands upon her services it was patsys turn next and she took with her the second day one of the french girls as assistant  when the ambulance reached the edge of the dunes where it was driven by ajo the battle was raging with even more vigor than the previous day the germans were dropping shells promiscuously into the various hollows hoping to locate the hidden belgian infantry while the belgian artillery strove to destroy the german gunners both succeeded at times and both sides were equally persistent  as it was impossible to take the ambulance into the dunes it was left in the rear in charge of jones while the others threaded their way in and out the devious passages toward the front they had covered fully a mile in this laborious fashion before they came upon a detachment of belgian infantry which was lying in wait for a call to action beyond this trench the doctors and nurses were forbidden to go and the officer in command warned the americans to beware of stray shells  under these circumstances they contented themselves by occupying some of the rear hollows to which the wounded would retreat to secure their services dr kelsey and nanette the french girl established themselves in one hollow at the right while dr gys and patsy took their position in another hollow further to the left there they opened their cases of lint plaster and bandages spreading them out upon the sand and were soon engaged in administering aid to an occasional victim of the battle  one man who came to patsy with a slight wound on his shoulder told her that a shell had exploded in a forward hollow and killed outright fifteen of his comrades his own escape from death was miraculous and the poor fellow was so unnerved that he cried like a baby  they directed him to the rear where he would find the ambulance and awaited the appearance of more patients gys crawled up the mound of sand in front of them and cautiously raised his head above the ridge next instant he ducked to escape a rain of bullets that scattered the sand about them like a mist  that was foolish said patsy reprovingly you might have been killed  no such luck he muttered in reply but the girl could see that he trembled slightly with nervousness neither realized at the time the fatal folly of the act for they were unaware that the germans were seeking just such a clew to direct them where to drop their shells  its getting rather lonely here and there are a couple of vacant hollows in front of us remarked the doctor suppose we move over to one of those a little nearer the soldiers  patsy approved the proposition so they gathered up their supplies and moved along the hollow to where a passage had been cut through they had gone barely a hundred yards when a screech like a buzzsaw when it strikes a nail sounded overhead looking up they saw a black disk hurtling through the air to drop almost where they had been standing a moment before there was a terrific explosion that sent debris to their very feet  after this well be careful how we expose ourselves said the doctor gravely they have got our range in a hurry here comes another wed better get away quickly  they progressed perhaps half a mile without coming upon any soldiers when at the brow of a hill slightly higher than the rest they became aware of unwonted activity a trench had been dug along the ridge with great pits here and there to serve as bombproof shelters every time a head projected above the ridge a storm of bullets showed that the enemy was well within rifle range in fact it was to dislodge the germans that the present intrenchments were being made machine guns would be mounted as soon as positions had been prepared  the german bullets had already taken their toll in the little valley a poor belgian pressed his hand against a bad wound in his side while another was nursing an arm roughly bandaged by his fellows in the trenches first aid made the two comfortable for the time being at least and the men were directed toward the ambulance as they left the man with the wounded arm pointed down the narrow valley to where a deep ravine cut through we were driven from there he said the big guns dropped shells on us and killed many there are many wounded beyondbut you cannot cross the ravine we lost ten in doing it  nevertheless the doctor and patsy strode off just within the shelter of the ridge they found another belgian desperately wounded and the doctor stopped to ease his pain with the hypodermic needle patsy looked across the narrow defile it was a bare fifty feet and seemed safe enough her red cross uniform would protect her she reasoned and boldly enough she stepped out into the open a cry from a wounded soldier ahead hastened her footsteps without heeding the warning shout of doctor gys she calmly stooped over the man who had called to her  and then there was a sudden rending blinding terrifying crash that sent the world into a thousand shrieking echoes a huge shell had fallen not fifty feet away plowing its way through the earthworks above its explosion sent timbers abandoned guncarriages everything flying through the air and one great piece of wood caught patsy a glancing blow on the back of her head as she crouched over the wounded belgian with a weak cry she toppled over not unconscious but unable to raise herself  another shell crashed down a hundred yards away and then one closer that sent the sand spouting high in a blinding cloud she raised herself slowly and glanced back toward doctor gys he stood his face ashen with fear hiding behind the shelter of the other hill he looked up as she stirred a cry of relief came to his lips  wait he called bracing up suddenly wait and i will get you  bending his head low he sprang across the unprotected space he stopped with a sudden jerk and then came on  you were hit cried patsy as he bent over her  it is nothing he answered brusquely hold tight around my neck now another shell scattered sand over themwe must get away from here  breathing thickly he staggered across the open dropping her with a great groan behind the protection of the ridge  the man you were helping he gasped i must bring him in  but you are wounded patsy cried  he straightened uphis hand clutched his sidethere came across his disfigured features a queer twisted smilehe sighed softly and slowly sank in a crumpled heap a clean little puncture in the breast of his coat told the whole story patsy felt herself slipping all grew dark                                       it was ajo who found her and carried her back to the ambulance where dr kelsey and nanette were presently able to restore her to consciousness then they returned to the arabella grave and silent and patsy was put to bed before morning beth and maud were anxiously nursing her for she had developed a high fever and was delirious  the days that succeed were anxious ones for patsys nerves had given away completely it was many weeks later that the rest of them met on deck  its the first of february said uncle john dont you suppose patsy could start for home pretty soon  perhaps so answered maud she is sitting up today and seems brighter and more like herself have we decided then to return to america  i believe so was the reply we cant keep ajos ship forever you know and without doctor gys we could never make it useful as a hospital ship again  that is true said the girl thoughtfully now that andrew denton with his wife and the countess have gone to charleroi our ship seems quite lonely  you see said ajo taking part in the discussion weve never been able to overcome the suspicious coldness of these frenchmen caused by elbls unfortunate escape we are not trusted fully and never will be again so im convinced our career of usefulness here is ended  aside from that returned uncle john you three girls have endured a long period of hard work and nervous strain and you need a rest im awfully proud of you all proud of your noble
