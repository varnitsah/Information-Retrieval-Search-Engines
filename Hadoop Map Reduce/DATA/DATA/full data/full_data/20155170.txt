liiilix      phase the first the maiden   i   on an evening in the latter part of may a middleaged man was walking homeward from shaston to the village of marlott in the adjoining vale of blakemore or blackmoor  the pair of legs that carried him were rickety and there was a bias in his gait which inclined him somewhat to the left of a straight line  he occasionally gave a smart nod as if in confirmation of some opinion though he was not thinking of anything in particular  an empty eggbasket was slung upon his arm the nap of his hat was ruffled a patch being quite worn away at its brim where his thumb came in taking it off presently he was met by an elderly parson astride on a gray mare who as he rode hummed a wandering tune  good night tee said the man with the basket  good night sir john said the parson  the pedestrian after another pace or two halted and turned round  now sir begging your pardon we met last marketday on this road about this time and i said good night and you made reply good night sir john as now  i did said the parson  and once before thatnear a month ago  i may have  then what might your meaning be in calling me sir john these different times when i be plain jack durbeyfield the haggler  the parson rode a step or two nearer  it was only my whim he said and after a moments hesitation it was on account of a discovery i made some little time ago whilst i was hunting up pedigrees for the new county history  i am parson tringham the antiquary of stagfoot lane  dont you really know durbeyfield that you are the lineal representative of the ancient and knightly family of the durbervilles who derive their descent from sir pagan durberville that renowned knight who came from normandy with william the conqueror as appears by battle abbey roll  never heard it before sir  well its true  throw up your chin a moment so that i may catch the profile of your face better  yes thats the durberville nose and china little debased  your ancestor was one of the twelve knights who assisted the lord of estremavilla in normandy in his conquest of glamorganshire  branches of your family held manors over all this part of england their names appear in the pipe rolls in the time of king stephen  in the reign of king john one of them was rich enough to give a manor to the knights hospitallers and in edward the seconds time your forefather brian was summoned to westminster to attend the great council there  you declined a little in oliver cromwells time but to no serious extent and in charles the seconds reign you were made knights of the royal oak for your loyalty  aye there have been generations of sir johns among you and if knighthood were hereditary like a baronetcy as it practically was in old times when men were knighted from father to son you would be sir john now  ye dont say so  in short concluded the parson decisively smacking his leg with his switch theres hardly such another family in england  daze my eyes and isnt there said durbeyfield  and here have i been knocking about year after year from pillar to post as if i was no more than the commonest feller in the parish  and how long hev this news about me been knowed pason tringham  the clergyman explained that as far as he was aware it had quite died out of knowledge and could hardly be said to be known at all his own investigations had begun on a day in the preceding spring when having been engaged in tracing the vicissitudes of the durberville family he had observed durbeyfields name on his waggon and had thereupon been led to make inquiries about his father and grandfather till he had no doubt on the subject  at first i resolved not to disturb you with such a useless piece of information said he  however our impulses are too strong for our judgement sometimes  i thought you might perhaps know something of it all the while  well i have heard once or twice tis true that my family had seen better days afore they came to blackmoor  but i took no notice ot thinking it to mean that we had once kept two horses where we now keep only one  ive got a wold silver spoon and a wold graven seal at home too but lord whats a spoon and seal   and to think that i and these noble durbervilles were one flesh all the time twas said that my grtgranfer had secrets and didnt care to talk of where he came from  and where do we raise our smoke now parson if i may make so bold i mean where do we durbervilles live  you dont live anywhere you are extinctas a county family  thats bad  yeswhat the mendacious family chronicles call extinct in the male linethat is gone downgone under  then where do we lie  at kingsberesubgreenhill rows and rows of you in your vaults with your effigies under purbeckmarble canopies  and where be our family mansions and estates  you havent any  oh  no lands neither  none though you once had em in abundance as i said for you family consisted of numerous branches  in this county there was a seat of yours at kingsbere and another at sherton and another in millpond and another at lullstead and another at wellbridge  and shall we ever come into our own again  ahthat i cant tell  and what had i better do about it sir asked durbeyfield after a pause  ohnothing nothing except chasten yourself with the thought of how are the mighty fallen  it is a fact of some interest to the local historian and genealogist nothing more  there are several families among the cottagers of this county of almost equal lustre good night  but youll turn back and have a quart of beer wi me on the strength ot pason tringham  theres a very pretty brew in tap at the pure dropthough to be sure not so good as at rollivers  no thank younot this evening durbeyfield  youve had enough already  concluding thus the parson rode on his way with doubts as to his discretion in retailing this curious bit of lore  when he was gone durbeyfield walked a few steps in a profound reverie and then sat down upon the grassy bank by the roadside depositing his basket before him  in a few minutes a youth appeared in the distance walking in the same direction as that which had been pursued by durbeyfield  the latter on seeing him held up his hand and the lad quickened his pace and came near  boy take up that basket  i want ee to go on an errand for me  the lathlike stripling frowned  who be you then john durbeyfield to order me about and call me boy  you know my name as well as i know yours  do you do you  thats the secretthats the secret now obey my orders and take the message im going to charge ee wi  well fred i dont mind telling you that the secret is that im one of a noble raceit has been just found out by me this present afternoon pm  and as he made the announcement durbeyfield declining from his sitting position luxuriously stretched himself out upon the bank among the daisies  the lad stood before durbeyfield and contemplated his length from crown to toe  sir john durbervillethats who i am continued the prostrate man  that is if knights were baronetswhich they be  tis recorded in history all about me  dost know of such a place lad as kingsberesubgreenhill  ees  ive been there to greenhill fair  well

immedately to carry me hwome  and in the bottom o the carriage they be to put a noggin o rum in a small bottle and chalk it up to my account  and when youve done that goo on to my house with the basket and tell my wife to put away that washing because she neednt finish it and wait till i come hwome as ive news to tell her  as the lad stood in a dubious attitude durbeyfield put his hand in his pocket and produced a shilling one of the chronically few that he possessed  heres for your labour lad  this made a difference in the young mans estimate of the position  yes sir john  thank ee  anything else i can do for ee sir john  tell em at hwome that i should like for supperwell lambs fry if they can get it and if they cant blackpot and if they cant get that well chitterlings will do  yes sir john  the boy took up the basket and as he set out the notes of a brass band were heard from the direction of the village  whats that said durbeyfield  not on account o i  tis the womens clubwalking sir john  why your dater is one o the members  to be sureid quite forgot it in my thoughts of greater things well vamp on to marlott will ye and order that carriage and maybe ill drive round and inspect the club  the lad departed and durbeyfield lay waiting on the grass and daisies in the evening sun  not a soul passed that way for a long while and the faint notes of the band were the only human sounds audible within the rim of blue hills    ii   the village of marlott lay amid the northeastern undulations of the beautiful vale of blakemore or blackmoor aforesaid an engirdled and secluded region for the most part untrodden as yet by tourist or landscapepainter though within a four hours journey from london  it is a vale whose acquaintance is best made by viewing it from the summits of the hills that surround itexcept perhaps during the droughts of summer  an unguided ramble into its recesses in bad weather is apt to engender dissatisfaction with its narrow tortuous and miry ways  this fertile and sheltered tract of country in which the fields are never brown and the springs never dry is bounded on the south by the bold chalk ridge that embraces the prominences of hambledon hill bulbarrow nettlecombetout dogbury high stoy and bubb down  the traveller from the coast who after plodding northward for a score of miles over calcareous downs and cornlands suddenly reaches the verge of one of these escarpments is surprised and delighted to behold extended like a map beneath him a country differing absolutely from that which he has passed through  behind him the hills are open the sun blazes down upon fields so large as to give an unenclosed character to the landscape the lanes are white the hedges low and plashed the atmosphere colourless  here in the valley the world seems to be constructed upon a smaller and more delicate scale the fields are mere paddocks so reduced that from this height their hedgerows appear a network of dark green threads overspreading the paler green of the grass  the atmosphere beneath is languorous and is so tinged with azure that what artists call the middle distance partakes also of that hue while the horizon beyond is of the deepest ultramarine  arable lands are few and limited with but slight exceptions the prospect is a broad rich mass of grass and trees mantling minor hills and dales within the major  such is the vale of blackmoor  the district is of historic no less than of topographical interest the vale was known in former times as the forest of white hart from a curious legend of king henry iiis reign in which the killing by a certain thomas de la lynd of a beautiful white hart which the king had run down and spared was made the occasion of a heavy fine in those days and till comparatively recent times the country was densely wooded  even now traces of its earlier condition are to be found in the old oak copses and irregular belts of timber that yet survive upon its slopes and the hollowtrunked trees that shade so many of its pastures  the forests have departed but some old customs of their shades remain  many however linger only in a metamorphosed or disguised form  the mayday dance for instance was to be discerned on the afternoon under notice in the guise of the club revel or clubwalking as it was there called  it was an interesting event to the younger inhabitants of marlott though its real interest was not observed by the participators in the ceremony  its singularity lay less in the retention of a custom of walking in procession and dancing on each anniversary than in the members being solely women  in mens clubs such celebrations were though expiring less uncommon but either the natural shyness of the softer sex or a sarcastic attitude on the part of male relatives had denuded such womens clubs as remained if any other did or this their glory and consummation  the club of marlott alone lived to uphold the local cerealia  it had walked for hundreds of years if not as benefitclub as votive sisterhood of some sort and it walked still  the banded ones were all dressed in white gownsa gay survival from old style days when cheerfulness and maytime were synonymsdays before the habit of taking long views had reduced emotions to a monotonous average  their first exhibition of themselves was in a processional march of two and two round the parish  ideal and real clashed slightly as the sun lit up their figures against the green hedges and creeperlaced housefronts for though the whole troop wore white garments no two whites were alike among them  some approached pure blanching some had a bluish pallor some worn by the older characters which had possibly lain by folded for many a year inclined to a cadaverous tint and to a georgian style  in addition to the distinction of a white frock every woman and girl carried in her right hand a peeled willow wand and in her left a bunch of white flowers  the peeling of the former and the selection of the latter had been an operation of personal care  there were a few middleaged and even elderly women in the train their silverwiry hair and wrinkled faces scourged by time and trouble having almost a grotesque certainly a pathetic appearance in such a jaunty situation  in a true view perhaps there was more to be gathered and told of each anxious and experienced one to whom the years were drawing nigh when she should say i have no pleasure in them than of her juvenile comrades  but let the elder be passed over here for those under whose bodices the life throbbed quick and warm  the young girls formed indeed the majority of the band and their heads of luxuriant hair reflected in the sunshine every tone of gold and black and brown  some had beautiful eyes others a beautiful nose others a beautiful mouth and figure few if any had all  a difficulty of arranging their lips in this crude exposure to public scrutiny an inability to balance their heads and to dissociate selfconsciousness from their features was apparent in them and showed that they were genuine country girls unaccustomed to many eyes  and as each and all of them were warmed without by the sun so each had a private little sun for her soul to bask in some dream some affection some hobby at least some remote and distant hope which though perhaps starving to nothing still lived on as hopes will they were all cheerful and many of them merry  they came round by the pure drop inn and were turning out of the high road to pass through a wicketgate into the meadows when one of the women said  the loadalord  why tess durbeyfield if there isnt thy father riding hwome in a carriage  a young member of the band turned her head at the exclamation she was a fine and handsome girlnot handsomer than some others possiblybut her mobile peony mouth and large innocent eyes added eloquence to colour and shape  she wore a red ribbon in her hair and was the only one of the white company who could boast of such a pronounced adornment  as she looked round durbeyfield was seen moving along the road in a chaise belonging to the pure drop driven by a frizzleheaded brawny damsel with her gownsleeves rolled above her elbows  this was the cheerful servant of that establishment who in her part of factotum turned groom and ostler at times durbeyfield leaning back and with his eyes closed luxuriously was waving his hand above his head and singing in a slow recitative  ivegotagrtfamilyvaultatkingsbereand knightedforefathersinleadcoffinsthere  the clubbists tittered except the girl called tessin whom a slow heat seemed to rise at the sense that her father was making himself foolish in their eyes  hes tired thats all she said hastily and he has got a lift home because our own horse has to rest today  bless thy simplicity tess said her companions  hes got his marketnitch  hawhaw  look here i wont walk another inch with you if you say any jokes about him tess cried and the colour upon her cheeks spread over her face and neck  in a moment her eyes grew moist and her glance drooped to the ground  perceiving that they had really pained her they said no more and order again prevailed  tesss pride would not allow her to turn her head again to learn what her fathers meaning was if he had any and thus she moved on with the whole body to the enclosure where there was to be dancing on the green  by the time the spot was reached she has recovered her equanimity and tapped her neighbour with her wand and talked as usual  tess durbeyfield at this time of her life was a mere vessel of emotion untinctured by experience  the dialect was on her tongue to some extent despite the village school the characteristic intonation of that dialect for this district being the voicing approximately rendered by the syllable ur probably as rich an utterance as any to be found in human speech  the poutedup deep red mouth to which this syllable was native had hardly as yet settled into its definite shape and her lower lip had a way of thrusting the middle of her top one upward when they closed together after a word  phases of her childhood lurked in her aspect still  as she walked along today for all her bouncing handsome womanliness you could sometimes see her twelfth year in her cheeks or her ninth sparkling from her eyes and even her fifth would flit over the curves of her mouth now and then  yet few knew and still fewer considered this  a small minority mainly strangers would look long at her in casually passing by and grow momentarily fascinated by her freshness and wonder if they would ever see her again but to almost everybody she was a fine and picturesque country girl and no more  nothing was seen or heard further of durbeyfield in his triumphal chariot under the conduct of the ostleress and the club having entered the allotted space dancing began  as there were no men in the company the girls danced at first with each other but when the hour for the close of labour drew on the masculine inhabitants of the village together with other idlers and pedestrians gathered round the spot and appeared inclined to negotiate for a partner  among these onlookers were three young men of a superior class carrying small knapsacks strapped to their shoulders and stout sticks in their hands  their general likeness to each other and their consecutive ages would almost have suggested that they might be what in fact they were brothers  the eldest wore the white tie high waistcoat and thinbrimmed hat of the regulation curate the second was the normal undergraduate the appearance of the third and youngest would hardly have been sufficient to characterize him there was an uncribbed uncabined aspect in his eyes and attire implying that he had hardly as yet found the entrance to his professional groove  that he was a desultory tentative student of something and everything might only have been predicted of him  these three brethren told casual acquaintance that they were spending their whitsun holidays in a walking tour through the vale of blackmoor their course being southwesterly from the town of shaston on the northeast  they leant over the gate by the highway and inquired as to the meaning of the dance and the whitefrocked maids  the two elder of the brothers were plainly not intending to linger more than a moment but the spectacle of a bevy of girls dancing without male partners seemed to amuse the third and make him in no hurry to move on  he unstrapped his knapsack put it with his stick on the hedgebank and opened the gate  what are you going to do angel asked the eldest  i am inclined to go and have a fling with them  why not all of usjust for a minute or twoit will not detain us long  nono nonsense said the first  dancing in public with a troop of country hoydenssuppose we should be seen  come along or it will be dark before we get to stourcastle and theres no place we can sleep at nearer than that besides we must get through another chapter of a counterblast to agnosticism before we turn in now i have taken the trouble to bring the book  all rightill overtake you and cuthbert in five minutes dont stop i give my word that i will felix  the two elder reluctantly left him and walked on taking their brothers knapsack to relieve him in following and the youngest entered the field  this is a thousand pities he said gallantly to two or three of the girls nearest him as soon as there was a pause in the dance where are your partners my dears  theyve not left off work yet answered one of the boldest theyll be here by and by  till then will you be one sir  certainly  but whats one among so many  better than none  tis melancholy work facing and footing it to one of your own sort and no clipsing and colling at all  now pick and choose  sshdont be so forard said a shyer girl  the young man thus invited glanced them over and attempted some discrimination but as the group were all so new to him he could not very well exercise it  he took almost the first that came to hand which was not the speaker as she had expected nor did it happen to be tess durbeyfield  pedigree ancestral skeletons monumental record the durberville lineaments did not help tess in her lifes battle as yet even to the extent of attracting to her a dancingpartner over the heads of the commonest peasantry  so much for norman blood unaided by victorian lucre  the name of the eclipsing girl whatever it was has not been handed down but she was envied by all as the first who enjoyed the luxury of a masculine partner that evening  yet such was the force of example that the village young men who had not hastened to enter the gate while no intruder was in the way now dropped in quickly and soon the couples became leavened with rustic youth to a marked extent till at length the plainest woman in the club was no longer compelled to foot it on the masculine side of the figure  the church clock struck when suddenly the student said that he must leavehe had been forgetting himselfhe had to join his companions as he fell out of the dance his eyes lighted on tess durbeyfield whose own large orbs wore to tell the truth the faintest aspect of reproach that he had not chosen her  he too was sorry then that owing to her backwardness he had not observed her and with that in his mind he left the pasture  on account of his long delay he started in a flyingrun down the lane westward and had soon passed the hollow and mounted the next rise he had not yet overtaken his brothers but he paused to get breath and looked back  he could see the white figures of the girls in the green enclosure whirling about as they had whirled when he was among them  they seemed to have quite forgotten him already  all of them except perhaps one  this white shape stood apart by the hedge alone  from her position he knew it to be the pretty maiden with whom he had not danced  trifling as the matter was he yet instinctively felt that she was hurt by his oversight  he wished that he had asked her he wished that he had inquired her name  she was so modest so expressive she had looked so soft in her thin white gown that he felt he had acted stupidly  however it could not be helped and turning and bending himself to a rapid walk he dismissed the subject from his mind    iii   as for tess durbeyfield she did not so easily dislodge the incident from her consideration  she had no spirit to dance again for a long time though she might have had plenty of partners but ah they did not speak so nicely as the strange young man had done  it was not till the rays of the sun had absorbed the young strangers retreating figure on the hill that she shook off her temporary sadness and answered her wouldbe partner in the affirmative  she remained with her comrades till dusk and participated with a certain zest in the dancing though being heartwhole as yet she enjoyed treading a measure purely for its own sake little divining when she saw the soft torments the bitter sweets the pleasing pains and the agreeable distresses of those girls who had been wooed and won what she herself was capable of in that kind  the struggles and wrangles of the lads for her hand in a jig were an amusement to herno more and when they became fierce she rebuked them  she might have stayed even later but the incident of her fathers odd appearance and manner returned upon the girls mind to make her anxious and wondering what had become of him she dropped away from the dancers and bent her steps towards the end of the village at which the parental cottage lay  while yet many score yards off other rhythmic sounds than those she had quitted became audible to her sounds that she knew wellso well  they were a regular series of thumpings from the interior of the house occasioned by the violent rocking of a cradle upon a stone floor to which movement a feminine voice kept time by singing in a vigorous gallopade the favourite ditty of the spotted cow      i saw her lie doown in yonder green groove         come love and ill tell you where   the cradlerocking and the song would cease simultaneously for a moment and an exclamation at highest vocal pitch would take the place of the melody  god bless thy diment eyes  and thy waxen cheeks  and thy cherry mouth  and thy cubits thighs  and every bit o thy blessed body  after this invocation the rocking and the singing would recommence and the spotted cow proceed as before  so matters stood when tess opened the door and paused upon the mat within it surveying the scene  the interior in spite of the melody struck upon the girls senses with an unspeakable dreariness  from the holiday gaieties of the fieldthe white gowns the nosegays the willowwands the whirling movements on the green the flash of gentle sentiment towards the strangerto the yellow melancholy of this onecandled spectacle what a step  besides the jar of contrast there came to her a chill selfreproach that she had not returned sooner to help her mother in these domesticities instead of indulging herself outofdoors  there stood her mother amid the group of children as tess had left her hanging over the monday washingtub which had now as always lingered on to the end of the week  out of that tub had come the day beforetess felt it with a dreadful sting of remorsethe very white frock upon her back which she had so carelessly greened about the skirt on the damping grasswhich had been wrung up and ironed by her mothers own hands  as usual mrs durbeyfield was balanced on one foot beside the tub the other being engaged in the aforesaid business of rocking her youngest child  the cradlerockers had done hard duty for so many years under the weight of so many children on that flagstone floor that they were worn nearly flat in consequence of which a huge jerk accompanied each swing of the cot flinging the baby from side to side like a weavers shuttle as mrs durbeyfield excited by her song trod the rocker with all the spring that was left in her after a long days seething in the suds  nickknock nickknock went the cradle the candleflame stretched itself tall and began jigging up and down the water dribbled from the matrons elbows and the song galloped on to the end of the verse mrs durbeyfield regarding her daughter the while  even now when burdened with a young family joan durbeyfield was a passionate lover of tune  no ditty floated into blackmoor vale from the outer world but tesss mother caught up its notation in a week  there still faintly beamed from the womans features something of the freshness and even the prettiness of her youth rendering it probable that the personal charms which tess could boast of were in main part her mothers gift and therefore unknightly unhistorical  ill rock the cradle for ee mother said the daughter gently or ill take off my best frock and help you wring up  i thought you had finished long ago  her mother bore tess no illwill for leaving the housework to her singlehanded efforts for so long indeed joan seldom upbraided her thereon at any time feeling but slightly the lack of tesss assistance whilst her instinctive plan for relieving herself of her labours lay in postponing them  tonight however she was even in a blither mood than usual  there was a dreaminess a preoccupation an exaltation in the maternal look which the girl could not understand  well im glad youve come her mother said as soon as the last note had passed out of her  i want to go and fetch your father but whats moren that i want to tell ee what have happened  yll be fess enough my poppet when thst know  mrs durbeyfield habitually spoke the dialect her daughter who had passed the sixth standard in the national school under a londontrained mistress spoke two languages the dialect at home more or less ordinary english abroad and to persons of quality  since ive been away tess asked  ay  had it anything to do with fathers making such a mommet of himself in thik carriage this afternoon  why did er  i felt inclined to sink into the ground with shame  that wer all a part of the larry  weve been found to be the greatest gentlefolk in the whole countyreaching all back long before oliver grumbles timeto the days of the pagan turkswith monuments and vaults and crests and scutcheons and the lord knows what all  in saint charless days we was made knights o the royal oak our real name being durberville   dont that make your bosom plim  twas on this account that your father rode home in the vlee not because hed been drinking as people supposed  im glad of that  will it do us any good mother  o yes  tis thoughted that great things may come ot  no doubt a mampus of volk of our own rank will be down here in their carriages as soon as tis known  your father learnt it on his way hwome from shaston and he has been telling me the whole pedigree of the matter  where is father now asked tess suddenly  her mother gave irrelevant information by way of answer he called to see the doctor today in shaston  it is not consumption at all it seems  it is fat round his heart a says  there it is like this  joan durbeyfield as she spoke curved a sodden thumb and forefinger to the shape of the letter c and used the other forefinger as a pointer  at the present moment he says to your father your heart is enclosed all round there and all round there this space is still open a says  as soon as it do meet somrs durbeyfield closed her fingers into a circle completeoff you will go like a shadder mr durbeyfield a says you mid last ten years you mid go off in ten months or ten days  tess looked alarmed  her father possibly to go behind the eternal cloud so soon notwithstanding this sudden greatness  but where is father she asked again  her mother put on a deprecating look  now dont you be bursting out angry  the poor manhe felt so rafted after his uplifting by the pasons newsthat he went up to rollivers half an hour ago  he do want to get up his strength for his journey tomorrow with that load of beehives which must be delivered family or no  hell have to start shortly after twelve tonight as the distance is so long  get up his strength said tess impetuously the tears welling to her eyes  o my god  go to a publichouse to get up his strength and you as well agreed as he mother  her rebuke and her mood seemed to fill the whole room and to impart a cowed look to the furniture and candle and children playing about and to her mothers face  no said the latter touchily i be not agreed  i have been waiting for ee to bide and keep house while i go fetch him  ill go  o no tess  you see it would be no use  tess did not expostulate  she knew what her mothers objection meant  mrs durbeyfields jacket and bonnet were already hanging slily upon a chair by her side in readiness for this contemplated jaunt the reason for which the matron deplored more than its necessity  and take the compleat fortuneteller to the outhouse joan continued rapidly wiping her hands and donning the garments  the compleat fortuneteller was an old thick volume which lay on a table at her elbow so worn by pocketing that the margins had reached the edge of the type  tess took it up and her mother started  this going to hunt up her shiftless husband at the inn was one of mrs durbeyfields still extant enjoyments in the muck and muddle of rearing children  to discover him at rollivers to sit there for an hour or two by his side and dismiss all thought and care of the children during the interval made her happy  a sort of halo an occidental glow came over life then  troubles and other realities took on themselves a metaphysical impalpability sinking to mere mental phenomena for serene contemplation and no longer stood as pressing concretions which chafed body and soul  the youngsters not immediately within sight seemed rather bright and desirable appurtenances than otherwise the incidents of daily life were not without humorousness and jollity in their aspect there  she felt a little as she had used to feel when she sat by her now wedded husband in the same spot during his wooing shutting her eyes to his defects of character and regarding him only in his ideal presentation as lover  tess being left alone with the younger children went first to the outhouse with the fortunetelling book and stuffed it into the thatch  a curious fetishistic fear of this grimy volume on the part of her mother prevented her ever allowing it to stay in the house all night and hither it was brought back whenever it had been consulted between the mother with her fastperishing lumber of superstitions folklore dialect and orally transmitted ballads and the daughter with her trained national teachings and standard knowledge under an infinitely revised code there was a gap of two hundred years as ordinarily understood  when they were together the jacobean and the victorian ages were juxtaposed  returning along the garden path tess mused on what the mother could have wished to ascertain from the book on this particular day  she guessed the recent ancestral discovery to bear upon it but did not divine that it solely concerned herself  dismissing this however she busied herself with sprinkling the linen dried during the daytime in company with her nineyearold brother abraham and her sister elizalouisa of twelve and a half called lizalu the youngest ones being put to bed  there was an interval of four years and more between tess and the next of the family the two who had filled the gap having died in their infancy and this lent her a deputymaternal attitude when she was alone with her juniors  next in juvenility to abraham came two more girls hope and modesty then a boy of three and then the baby who had just completed his first year  all these young souls were passengers in the durbeyfield shipentirely dependent on the judgement of the two durbeyfield adults for their pleasures their necessities their health even their existence  if the heads of the durbeyfield household chose to sail into difficulty disaster starvation disease degradation death thither were these halfdozen little captives under hatches compelled to sail with themsix helpless creatures who had never been asked if they wished for life on any terms much less if they wished for it on such hard conditions as were involved in being of the shiftless house of durbeyfield  some people would like to know whence the poet whose philosophy is in these days deemed as profound and trustworthy as his song is breezy and pure gets his authority for speaking of natures holy plan  it grew later and neither father nor mother reappeared  tess looked out of the door and took a mental journey through marlott  the village was shutting its eyes  candles and lamps were being put out everywhere she could inwardly behold the extinguisher and the extended hand  her mothers fetching simply meant one more to fetch  tess began to perceive that a man in indifferent health who proposed to start on a journey before one in the morning ought not to be at an inn at this late hour celebrating his ancient blood  abraham she said to her little brother do you put on your hatyou baint afraidand go up to rollivers and see what has gone wi father and mother  the boy jumped promptly from his seat and opened the door and the night swallowed him up  half an hour passed yet again neither man woman nor child returned  abraham like his parents seemed to have been limed and caught by the ensnaring inn  i must go myself she said  lizalu then went to bed and tess locking them all in started on her way up the dark and crooked lane or street not made for hasty progress a street laid out before inches of land had value and when onehanded clocks sufficiently subdivided the day    iv   rollivers inn the single alehouse at this end of the long and broken village could only boast of an offlicence hence as nobody could legally drink on the premises the amount of overt accommodation for consumers was strictly limited to a little board about six inches wide and two yards long fixed to the garden palings by pieces of wire so as to form a ledge  on this board thirsty strangers deposited their cups as they stood in the road and drank and threw the dregs on the dusty ground to the pattern of polynesia and wished they could have a restful seat inside  thus the strangers  but there were also local customers who felt the same wish and where theres a will theres a way  in a large bedroom upstairs the window of which was thickly curtained with a great woollen shawl lately discarded by the landlady mrs rolliver were gathered on this evening nearly a dozen persons all seeking beatitude all old inhabitants of the nearer end of marlott and frequenters of this retreat not only did the distance to the the pure drop the fullylicensed tavern at the further part of the dispersed village render its accommodation practically unavailable for dwellers at this end but the far more serious question the quality of the liquor confirmed the prevalent opinion that it was better to drink with rolliver in a corner of the housetop than with the other landlord in a wide house  a gaunt fourpost bedstead which stood in the room afforded sittingspace for several persons gathered round three of its sides a couple more men had elevated themselves on a chest of drawers another rested on the oakcarved cwoffer two on the washstand another on the stool and thus all were somehow seated at their ease  the stage of mental comfort to which they had arrived at this hour was one wherein their souls expanded beyond their skins and spread their personalities warmly through the room  in this process the chamber and its furniture grew more and more dignified and luxurious the shawl hanging at the window took upon itself the richness of tapestry the brass handles of the chest of drawers were as golden knockers and the carved bedposts seemed to have some kinship with the magnificent pillars of solomons temple  mrs durbeyfield having quickly walked hitherward after parting from tess opened the front door crossed the downstairs room which was in deep gloom and then unfastened the stairdoor like one whose fingers knew the tricks of the latches well  her ascent of the crooked staircase was a slower process and her face as it rose into the light above the last stair encountered the gaze of all the party assembled in the bedroom  being a few private friends ive asked in to keep up clubwalking at my own expense the landlady exclaimed at the sound of footsteps as glibly as a child repeating the catechism while she peered over the stairs  oh tis you mrs durbeyfieldlardhow you frightened mei thought it might be some gaffer sent by goverment  mrs durbeyfield was welcomed with glances and nods by the remainder of the conclave and turned to where her husband sat  he was humming absently to himself in a low tone i be as good as some folks here and there  ive got a great family vault at kingsberesubgreenhill and finer skillentons than any man in wessex  ive something to tell ee thats come into my head about thata grand projick whispered his cheerful wife  here john dont ee see me  she nudged him while he looking through her as through a windowpane went on with his recitative  hush  dont ee sing so loud my good man said the landlady in case any member of the goverment should be passing and take away my licends  hes told ee whats happened to us i suppose asked mrs durbeyfield  yesin a way  dye think theres any money hanging by it  ah thats the secret said joan durbeyfield sagely  however tis well to be kin to a coach even if you dont ride in en  she dropped her public voice and continued in a low tone to her husband ive been thinking since you brought the news that theres a great rich lady out by trantridge on the edge o the chase of the name of durberville  heywhats that said sir john  she repeated the information  that lady must be our relation she said  and my projick is to send tess to claim kin  there is a lady of the name now you mention it said durbeyfield pason tringham didnt think of that  but shes nothing beside wea junior branch of us no doubt hailing long since king normans day  while this question was being discussed neither of the pair noticed in their preoccupation that little abraham had crept into the room and was awaiting an opportunity of asking them to return  she is rich and shed be sure to take notice o the maid continued mrs durbeyfield and twill be a very good thing  i dont see why two branches o one family should not be on visiting terms  yes and well all claim kin said abraham brightly from under the bedstead  and well all go and see her when tess has gone to live with her and well ride in her coach and wear black clothes  how do you come here child  what nonsense be ye talking  go away and play on the stairs till father and mother be ready   well tess ought to go to this other member of our family  shed be sure to win the ladytess would and likely enough twould lead to some noble gentleman marrying her  in short i know it  how  i tried her fate in the fortuneteller and it brought out that very thing   you should ha seen how pretty she looked today her skin is as sumple as a duchess  what says the maid herself to going  ive not asked her  she dont know there is any such ladyrelation yet  but it would certainly put her in the way of a grand marriage and she wont say nay to going  tess is queer  but shes tractable at bottom  leave her to me  though this conversation had been private sufficient of its import reached the understandings of those around to suggest to them that the durbeyfields had weightier concerns to talk of now than common folks had and that tess their pretty eldest daughter had fine prospects in store  tess is a fine figure o fun as i said to myself today when i zeed her vamping round parish with the rest observed one of the elderly boozers in an undertone  but joan durbeyfield must mind that she dont get green malt in floor  it was a local phrase which had a peculiar meaning and there was no reply  the conversation became inclusive and presently other footsteps were heard crossing the room below  being a few private friends asked in tonight to keep up clubwalking at my own expense  the landlady had rapidly reused the formula she kept on hand for intruders before she recognized that the newcomer was tess  even to her mothers gaze the girls young features looked sadly out of place amid the alcoholic vapours which floated here as no unsuitable medium for wrinkled middleage and hardly was a reproachful flash from tesss dark eyes needed to make her father and mother rise from their seats hastily finish their ale and descend the stairs behind her mrs rollivers caution following their footsteps  no noise please if yell be so good my dears or i mid lose my licends and be summonsd and i dont know what all  night tye  they went home together tess holding one arm of her father and mrs durbeyfield the other  he had in truth drunk very littlenot a fourth of the quantity which a systematic tippler could carry to church on a sunday afternoon without a hitch in his eastings or genuflections but the weakness of sir johns constitution made mountains of his petty sins in this kind  on reaching the fresh air he was sufficiently unsteady to incline the row of three at one moment as if they were marching to london and at another as if they were marching to bathwhich produced a comical effect frequent enough in families on nocturnal homegoings and like most comical effects not quite so comic after all  the two women valiantly disguised these forced excursions and countermarches as well as they could from durbeyfield their cause and from abraham and from themselves and so they approached by degrees their own door the head of the family bursting suddenly into his former refrain as he drew near as if to fortify his soul at sight of the smallness of his present residence  ive got a family vault at kingsbere  hushdont be so silly jacky said his wife  yours is not the only family that was of count in wold days  look at the anktells and horseys and the tringhams themselvesgone to seed amost as much as youthough you was bigger folks than they thats true thank god i was never of no family and have nothing to be ashamed of in that way  dont you be so sure o that  from you nater tis my belief youve disgraced yourselves more than any o us and was kings and queens outright at one time  tess turned the subject by saying what was far more prominent in her own mind at the moment than thoughts of her ancestryi am afraid father wont be able to take the journey with the beehives tomorrow so early  i i shall be all right in an hour or two said durbeyfield   it was eleven oclock before the family were all in bed and two oclock next morning was the latest hour for starting with the beehives if they were to be delivered to the retailers in casterbridge before the saturday market began the way thither lying by bad roads over a distance of between twenty and thirty miles and the horse and waggon being of the slowest  at halfpast one mrs durbeyfield came into the large bedroom where tess and all her little brothers and sisters slept  the poor man cant go she said to her eldest daughter whose great eyes had opened the moment her mothers hand touched the door  tess sat up in bed lost in a vague interspace between a dream and this information  but somebody must go she replied  it is late for the hives already  swarming will soon be over for the year and it we put off taking em till next weeks market the call for em will be past and theyll be thrown on our hands  mrs durbeyfield looked unequal to the emergency  some young feller perhaps would go  one of them who were so much after dancing with ee yesterday she presently suggested  o noi wouldnt have it for the world declared tess proudly and letting everybody know the reasonsuch a thing to be ashamed of  i think i could go if abraham could go with me to kip me company  her mother at length agreed to this arrangement  little abraham was aroused from his deep sleep in a corner of the same apartment and made to put on his clothes while still mentally in the other world meanwhile tess had hastily dressed herself and the twain lighting a lantern went out to the stable  the rickety little waggon was already laden and the girl led out the horse prince only a degree less rickety than the vehicle  the poor creature looked wonderingly round at the night at the lantern at their two figures as if he could not believe that at that hour when every living thing was intended to be in shelter and at rest he was called upon to go out and labour  they put a stock of candleends into the lantern hung the latter to the offside of the load and directed the horse onward walking at his shoulder at first during the uphill parts of the way in order not to overload an animal of so little vigour  to cheer themselves as well as they could they made an artificial morning with the lantern some bread and butter and their own conversation the real morning being far from come  abraham as he more fully awoke for he had moved in a sort of trance so far began to talk of the strange shapes assumed by the various dark objects against the sky of this tree that looked like a raging tiger springing from a lair of that which resembled a giants head  when they had passed the little town of stourcastle dumbly somnolent under its thick brown thatch they reached higher ground  still higher on their left the elevation called bulbarrow or bealbarrow wellnigh the highest in south wessex swelled into the sky engirdled by its earthen trenches  from hereabout the long road was fairly level for some distance onward  they mounted in front of the waggon and abraham grew reflective  tess he said in a preparatory tone after a silence  yes abraham  baint you glad that weve become gentlefolk  not particular glad  but you be glad that you m going to marry a gentleman  what said tess lifting her face  that our great relation will help ee to marry a gentleman  i  our great relation  we have no such relation  what has put that into your head  i heard em talking about it up at rollivers when i went to find father  theres a rich lady of our family out at trantridge and mother said that if you claimed kin with the lady shed put ee in the way of marrying a gentleman  his sister became abruptly still and lapsed into a pondering silence  abraham talked on rather for the pleasure of utterance than for audition so that his sisters abstraction was of no account  he leant back against the hives and with upturned face made observations on the stars whose cold pulses were beating amid the black hollows above in serene dissociation from these two wisps of human life  he asked how far away those twinklers were and whether god was on the other side of them  but ever and anon his childish prattle recurred to what impressed his imagination even more deeply than the wonders of creation  if tess were made rich by marrying a gentleman would she have money enough to buy a spyglass so large that it would draw the stars as near to her as nettlecombetout  the renewed subject which seemed to have impregnated the whole family filled tess with impatience  never mind that now she exclaimed  did you say the stars were worlds tess  yes  all like ours  i dont know but i think so  they sometimes seem to be like the apples on our stubbardtree  most of them splendid and sounda few blighted  which do we live ona splendid one or a blighted one  a blighted one  tis very unlucky that we didnt pitch on a sound one when there were so many more of em  yes  is it like that really tess said abraham turning to her much impressed on reconsideration of this rare information  how would it have been if we had pitched on a sound one  well father wouldnt have coughed and creeped about as he does and wouldnt have got too tipsy to go on this journey and mother wouldnt have been always washing and never getting finished  and you would have been a rich lady readymade and not have had to be made rich by marrying a gentleman  o aby dontdont talk of that any more  left to his reflections abraham soon grew drowsy  tess was not skilful in the management of a horse but she thought that she could take upon herself the entire conduct of the load for the present and allow abraham to go to sleep if he wished to do so  she made him a sort of nest in front of the hives in such a manner that he could not fall and taking the reins into her own hands jogged on as before  prince required but slight attention lacking energy for superfluous movements of any sort  with no longer a companion to distract her tess fell more deeply into reverie than ever her back leaning against the hives  the mute procession past her shoulders of trees and hedges became attached to fantastic scenes outside reality and the occasional heave of the wind became the sigh of some immense sad soul conterminous with the universe in space and with history in time  then examining the mesh of events in her own life she seemed to see the vanity of her fathers pride the gentlemanly suitor awaiting herself in her mothers fancy to see him as a grimacing personage laughing at her poverty and her shrouded knightly ancestry everything grew more and more extravagant and she no longer knew how time passed  a sudden jerk shook her in her seat and tess awoke from the sleep into which she too had fallen  they were a long way further on than when she had lost consciousness and the waggon had stopped  a hollow groan unlike anything she had ever heard in her life came from the front followed by a shout of hoi there  the lantern hanging at her waggon had gone out but another was shining in her facemuch brighter than her own had been  something terrible had happened  the harness was entangled with an object which blocked the way  in consternation tess jumped down and discovered the dreadful truth the groan had proceeded from her fathers poor horse prince  the morning mailcart with its two noiseless wheels speeding along these lanes like an arrow as it always did had driven into her slow and unlighted equipage  the pointed shaft of the cart had entered the breast of the unhappy prince like a sword and from the wound his lifes blood was spouting in a stream and falling with a hiss into the road  in her despair tess sprang forward and put her hand upon the hole with the only result that she became splashed from face to skirt with the crimson drops  then she stood helplessly looking on  prince also stood firm and motionless as long as he could till he suddenly sank down in a heap  by this time the mailcart man had joined her and began dragging and unharnessing the hot form of prince  but he was already dead and seeing that nothing more could be done immediately the mailcart man returned to his own animal which was uninjured  you was on the wrong side he said  i am bound to go on with the mailbags so that the best thing for you to do is bide here with your load  ill send somebody to help you as soon as i can  it is getting daylight and you have nothing to fear  he mounted and sped on his way while tess stood and waited  the atmosphere turned pale the birds shook themselves in the hedges arose and twittered the lane showed all its white features and tess showed hers still whiter  the huge pool of blood in front of her was already assuming the iridescence of coagulation and when the sun rose a hundred prismatic hues were reflected from it  prince lay alongside still and stark his eyes half open the hole in his chest looking scarcely large enough to have let out all that had animated him  tis all my doingall mine the girl cried gazing at the spectacle  no excuse for menone  what will mother and father live on now  aby aby  she shook the child who had slept soundly through the whole disaster  we cant go on with our loadprince is killed  when abraham realized all the furrows of fifty years were extemporized on his young face  why i danced and laughed only yesterday she went on to herself to think that i was such a fool  tis because we be on a blighted star and not a sound one isnt it tess murmured abraham through his tears  in silence they waited through an interval which seemed endless  at length a sound and an approaching object proved to them that the driver of the mailcar had been as good as his word  a farmers man from near stourcastle came up leading a strong cob  he was harnessed to the waggon of beehives in the place of prince and the load taken on towards casterbridge  the evening of the same day saw the empty waggon reach again the spot of the accident  prince had lain there in the ditch since the morning but the place of the bloodpool was still visible in the middle of the road though scratched and scraped over by passing vehicles  all that was left of prince was now hoisted into the waggon he had formerly hauled and with his hoofs in the air and his shoes shining in the setting sunlight he retraced the eight or nine miles to marlott  tess had gone back earlier  how to break the news was more than she could think  it was a relief to her tongue to find from the faces of her parents that they already knew of their loss though this did not lessen the selfreproach which she continued to heap upon herself for her negligence  but the very shiftlessness of the household rendered the misfortune a less terrifying one to them than it would have been to a thriving family though in the present case it meant ruin and in the other it would only have meant inconvenience  in the durbeyfield countenances there was nothing of the red wrath that would have burnt upon the girl from parents more ambitious for her welfare  nobody blamed tess as she blamed herself  when it was discovered that the knacker and tanner would give only a very few shillings for princes carcase because of his decrepitude durbeyfield rose to the occasion  no said he stoically i wont sell his old body  when we durbervilles was knights in the land we didnt sell our chargers for cats meat  let em keep their shillings  heve served me well in his lifetime and i wont part from him now  he worked harder the next day in digging a grave for prince in the garden than he had worked for months to grow a crop for his family when the hole was ready durbeyfield and his wife tied a rope round the horse and dragged him up the path towards it the children following in funeral train  abraham and lizalu sobbed hope and modesty discharged their griefs in loud blares which echoed from the walls and when prince was tumbled in they gathered round the grave the breadwinner had been taken away from them what would they do  is he gone to heaven asked abraham between the sobs  then durbeyfield began to shovel in the earth and the children cried anew  all except tess  her face was dry and pale as though she regarded herself in the light of a murderess    v   the haggling business which had mainly depended on the horse became disorganized forthwith  distress if not penury loomed in the distance  durbeyfield was what was locally called a slacktwisted fellow he had good strength to work at times but the times could not be relied on to coincide with the hours of requirement and having been unaccustomed to the regular toil of the daylabourer he was not particularly persistent when they did so coincide  tess meanwhile as the one who had dragged her parents into this quagmire was silently wondering what she could do to help them out of it and then her mother broached her scheme  we must take the ups wi the downs tess said she and never could your high blood have been found out at a more calledfor moment  you must try your friends  do ye know that there is a very rich mrs durberville living on the outskirts o the chase who must be our relation  you must go to her and claim kin and ask for some help in our trouble  i shouldnt care to do that says tess  if there is such a lady twould be enough for us if she were friendlynot to expect her to give us help  you could win her round to do anything my dear  besides perhaps theres more in it than you know of ive heard what ive heard goodnow  the oppressive sense of the harm she had done led tess to be more deferential than she might otherwise have been to the maternal wish but she could not understand why her mother should find such satisfaction in contemplating an enterprise of to her such doubtful profit  her mother might have made inquiries and have discovered that this mrs durberville was a lady of unequalled virtues and charity  but tesss pride made the part of poor relation one of particular distaste to her  id rather try to get work she murmured  durbeyfield you can settle it said his wife turning to where he sat in the background  if you say she ought to go she will go  i dont like my children going and making themselves beholden to strange kin murmured he  im the head of the noblest branch o the family and i ought to live up to it  his reasons for staying away were worse to tess than her own objections to going  well as i killed the horse mother she said mournfully i suppose i ought to do something  i dont mind going and seeing her but you must leave it to me about asking for help and dont go thinking about her making a match for meit is silly  very well said tess observed her father sententiously  who said i had such a thought asked joan  i fancy it is in your mind mother  but ill go  rising early next day she walked to the hilltown called shaston and there took advantage of a van which twice in the week ran from shaston eastward to chaseborough passing near trantridge the parish in which the vague and mysterious mrs durberville had her residence  tess durbeyfields route on this memorable morning lay amid the northeastern undulations of the vale in which she had been born and in which her life had unfolded  the vale of blackmoor was to her the world and its inhabitants the races thereof  from the gates and stiles of marlott she had looked down its length in the wondering days of infancy and what had been mystery to her then was not much less than mystery to her now  she had seen daily from her chamberwindow towers villages faint white mansions above all the town of shaston standing majestically on its height its windows shining like lamps in the evening sun  she had hardly ever visited the place only a small tract even of the vale and its environs being known to her by close inspection  much less had she been far outside the valley  every contour of the surrounding hills was as personal to her as that of her relatives faces but for what lay beyond her judgment was dependent on the teaching of the village school where she had held a leading place at the time of her leaving a year or two before this date  in those early days she had been much loved by others of her own sex and age and had used to be seen about the village as one of threeall nearly of the same yearwalking home from school side by side tess the middle onein a pink print pinafore of a finely reticulated pattern worn over a stuff frock that had lost its original colour for a nondescript tertiarymarching on upon long stalky legs in tight stockings which had little ladderlike holes at the knees torn by kneeling in the roads and banks in search of vegetable and mineral treasures her then earthcoloured hair hanging like pothooks the arms of the two outside girls resting round the waist of tess her arms on the shoulders of the two supporters  as tess grew older and began to see how matters stood she felt quite a malthusian towards her mother for thoughtlessly giving her so many little sisters and brothers when it was such a trouble to nurse and provide for them  her mothers intelligence was that of a happy child joan durbeyfield was simply an additional one and that not the eldest to her own long family of waiters on providence  however tess became humanely beneficent towards the small ones and to help them as much as possible she used as soon as she left school to lend a hand at haymaking or harvesting on neighbouring farms or by preference at milking or buttermaking processes which she had learnt when her father had owned cows and being deftfingered it was a kind of work in which she excelled  every day seemed to throw upon her young shoulders more of the family burdens and that tess should be the representative of the durbeyfields at the durberville mansion came as a thing of course in this instance it must be admitted that the durbeyfields were putting their fairest side outward  she alighted from the van at trantridge cross and ascended on foot a hill in the direction of the district known as the chase on the borders of which as she had been informed mrs durbervilles seat the slopes would be found  it was not a manorial home in the ordinary sense with fields and pastures and a grumbling farmer out of whom the owner had to squeeze an income for himself and his family by hook or by crook  it was more far more a countryhouse built for enjoyment pure and simple with not an acre of troublesome land attached to it beyond what was required for residential purposes and for a little fancy farm kept in hand by the owner and tended by a bailiff  the crimson brick lodge came first in sight up to its eaves in dense evergreens  tess thought this was the mansion itself till passing through the side wicket with some trepidation and onward to a point at which the drive took a turn the house proper stood in full view it was of recent erectionindeed almost newand of the same rich red colour that formed such a contrast with the evergreens of the lodge  far behind the corner of the housewhich rose like a geranium bloom against the subdued colours aroundstretched the soft azure landscape of the chasea truly venerable tract of forest land one of the few remaining woodlands in england of undoubted primaeval date wherein druidical mistletoe was still found on aged oaks and where enormous yewtrees not planted by the hand of man grew as they had grown when they were pollarded for bows  all this sylvan antiquity however though visible from the slopes was outside the immediate boundaries of the estate  everything on this snug property was bright thriving and well kept acres of glasshouses stretched down the inclines to the copses at their feet  everything looked like moneylike the last coin issued from the mint  the stables partly screened by austrian pines and evergreen oaks and fitted with every late appliance were as dignified as chapelsofease  on the extensive lawn stood an ornamental tent its door being towards her  simple tess durbeyfield stood at gaze in a halfalarmed attitude on the edge of the gravel sweep  her feet had brought her onward to this point before she had quite realized where she was and now all was contrary to her expectation  i thought we were an old family but this is all new she said in her artlessness  she wished that she had not fallen in so readily with her mothers plans for claiming kin and had endeavoured to gain assistance nearer home   the durbervillesor stokedurbervilles as they at first called themselveswho owned all this were a somewhat unusual family to find in such an oldfashioned part of the country  parson tringham had spoken truly when he said that our shambling john durbeyfield was the only really lineal representative of the old durberville family existing in the county or near it he might have added what he knew very well that the stokedurbervilles were no more durbervilles of the true tree then he was himself  yet it must be admitted that this family formed a very good stock whereon to regraft a name which sadly wanted such renovation  when old mr simon stoke latterly deceased had made his fortune as an honest merchant some said moneylender in the north he decided to settle as a county man in the south of england out of hail of his business district and in doing this he felt the necessity of recommencing with a name that would not too readily identify him with the smart tradesman of the past and that would be less commonplace than the original bald stark words  conning for an hour in the british museum the pages of works devoted to extinct halfextinct obscured and ruined families appertaining to the quarter of england in which he proposed to settle he considered that durberville looked and sounded as well as any of them and durberville accordingly was annexed to his own name for himself and his heirs eternally  yet he was not an extravagantminded man in this and in constructing his family tree on the new basis was duly reasonable in framing his intermarriages and aristocratic links never inserting a single title above a rank of strict moderation  of this work of imagination poor tess and her parents were naturally in ignorancemuch to their discomfiture indeed the very possibility of such annexations was unknown to them who supposed that though to be wellfavoured might be the gift of fortune a family name came by nature  tess still stood hesitating like a bather about to make his plunge hardly knowing whether to retreat or to persevere when a figure came forth from the dark triangular door of the tent  it was that of a tall young man smoking  he had an almost swarthy complexion with full lips badly moulded though red and smooth above which was a wellgroomed black moustache with curled points though his age could not be more than three or fourandtwenty  despite the touches of barbarism in his contours there was a singular force in the gentlemans face and in his bold rolling eye  well my beauty what can i do for you said he coming forward and perceiving that she stood quite confounded never mind me i am mr durberville  have you come to see me or my mother  this embodiment of a durberville and a namesake differed even more from what tess had expected than the house and grounds had differed she had dreamed of an aged and dignified face the sublimation of all the durberville lineaments furrowed with incarnate memories representing in hieroglyphic the centuries of her familys and englands history  but she screwed herself up to the work in hand since she could not get out of it and answered  i came to see your mother sir  i am afraid you cannot see hershe is an invalid replied the present representative of the spurious house for this was mr alec the only son of the lately deceased gentleman  cannot i answer your purpose what is the business you wish to see her about  it isnt businessit isi can hardly say what  pleasure  oh no  why sir if i tell you it will seem  tesss sense of a certain ludicrousness in her errand was now so strong that notwithstanding her awe of him and her general discomfort at being here her rosy lips curved towards a smile much to the attraction of the swarthy alexander  it is so very foolish she stammered i fear cant tell you  never mind i like foolish things  try again my dear said he kindly  mother asked me to come tess continued and indeed i was in the mind to do so myself likewise  but i did not think it would be like this  i came sir to tell you that we are of the same family as you  ho  poor relations  yes  stokes  no durbervilles  ay ay i mean durbervilles  our names are worn away to durbeyfield but we have several proofs that we are durbervilles  antiquarians hold we areandand we have an old seal marked with a ramping lion on a shield and a castle over him  and we have a very old silver spoon round in the bowl like a little ladle and marked with the same castle  but it is so worn that mother uses it to stir the peasoup  a castle argent is certainly my crest said he blandly  and my arms a lion rampant  and so mother said we ought to make ourselves beknown to youas weve lost our horse by a bad accident and are the oldest branch o the family  very kind of your mother im sure  and i for one dont regret her step  alec looked at tess as he spoke in a way that made her blush a little  and so my pretty girl youve come on a friendly visit to us as relations  i suppose i have faltered tess looking uncomfortable again  welltheres no harm in it  where do you live  what are you  she gave him brief particulars and responding to further inquiries told him that she was intending to go back by the same carrier who had brought her  it is a long while before he returns past trantridge cross supposing we walk round the grounds to pass the time my pretty coz  tess wished to abridge her visit as much as possible but the young man was pressing and she consented to accompany him  he conducted her about the lawns and flowerbeds and conservatories and thence to the fruitgarden and greenhouses where he asked her if she liked strawberries  yes said tess when they come  they are already here  durberville began gathering specimens of the fruit for her handing them back to her as he stooped and presently selecting a specially fine product of the british queen variety he stood up and held it by the stem to her mouth  nono she said quickly putting her fingers between his hand and her lips  i would rather take it in my own hand  nonsense he insisted and in a slight distress she parted her lips and took it in  they had spent some time wandering desultorily thus tess eating in a halfpleased halfreluctant state whatever durberville offered her  when she could consume no more of the strawberries he filled her little basket with them and then the two passed round to the rosetrees whence he gathered blossoms and gave her to put in her bosom she obeyed like one in a dream and when she could affix no more he himself tucked a bud or two into her hat and heaped her basket with others in the prodigality of his bounty  at last looking at his watch he said now by the time you have had something to eat it will be time for you to leave if you want to catch the carrier to shaston  come here and ill see what grub i can find  stoke durberville took her back to the lawn and into the tent where he left her soon reappearing with a basket of light luncheon which he put before her himself  it was evidently the gentlemans wish not to be disturbed in this pleasant têteàtête by the servantry  do you mind my smoking he asked  oh not at all sir  he watched her pretty and unconscious munching through the skeins of smoke that pervaded the tent and tess durbeyfield did not divine as she innocently looked down at the roses in her bosom that there behind the blue narcotic haze was potentially the tragic mischief of her dramaone who stood fair to be the bloodred ray in the spectrum of her young life  she had an attribute which amounted to a disadvantage just now and it was this that caused alec durbervilles eyes to rivet themselves upon her  it was a luxuriance of aspect a fulness of growth which made her appear more of a woman than she really was  she had inherited the feature from her mother without the quality it denoted  it had troubled her mind occasionally till her companions had said that it was a fault which time would cure  she soon had finished her lunch  now i am going home sir she said rising  and what do they call you he asked as he accompanied her along the drive till they were out of sight of the house  tess durbeyfield down at marlott  and you say your people have lost their horse  ikilled him she answered her eyes filling with tears as she gave particulars of princes death  and i dont know what to do for father on account of it  i must think if i cannot do something  my mother must find a berth for you  but tess no nonsense about durbervilledurbeyfield only you knowquite another name  i wish for no better sir said she with something of dignity  for a momentonly for a momentwhen they were in the turning of the drive between the tall rhododendrons and conifers before the lodge became visible he inclined his face towards her as ifbut no he thought better of it and let her go  thus the thing began  had she perceived this meetings import she might have asked why she was doomed to be seen and coveted that day by the wrong man and not by some other man the right and desired one in all respectsas nearly as humanity can supply the right and desired yet to him who amongst her acquaintance might have approximated to this kind she was but a transient impression half forgotten  in the illjudged execution of the welljudged plan of things the call seldom produces the comer the man to love rarely coincides with the hour for loving  nature does not often say see to her poor creature at a time when seeing can lead to happy doing or reply here to a bodys cry of where till the hideandseek has become an irksome outworn game  we may wonder whether at the acme and summit of the human progress these anachronisms will be corrected by a finer intuition a closer interaction of the social machinery than that which now jolts us round and along but such completeness is not to be prophesied or even conceived as possible  enough that in the present case as in millions it was not the two halves of a perfect whole that confronted each other at the perfect moment a missing counterpart wandered independently about the earth waiting in crass obtuseness till the late time came  out of which maladroit delay sprang anxieties disappointments shocks catastrophes and passingstrange destinies  when durberville got back to the tent he sat down astride on a chair reflecting with a pleased gleam in his face  then he broke into a loud laugh  well im damned  what a funny thing  hahaha  and what a crumby girl    vi   tess went down the hill to trantridge cross and inattentively waited to take her seat in the van returning from chaseborough to shaston she did not know what the other occupants said to her as she entered though she answered them and when they had started anew she rode along with an inward and not an outward eye  one among her fellowtravellers addressed her more pointedly than any had spoken before why you be quite a posy  and such roses in early june  then she became aware of the spectacle she presented to their surprised vision roses at her breasts roses in her hat roses and strawberries in her basket to the brim  she blushed and said confusedly that the flowers had been given to her  when the passengers were not looking she stealthily removed the more prominent blooms from her hat and placed them in the basket where she covered them with her handkerchief  then she fell to reflecting again and in looking downwards a thorn of the rose remaining in her breast accidentally pricked her chin like all the cottagers in blackmoor vale tess was steeped in fancies and prefigurative superstitions she thought this an ill omenthe first she had noticed that day  the van travelled only so far as shaston and there were several miles of pedestrian descent from that mountaintown into the vale to marlott  her mother had advised her to stay here for the night at the house of a cottagewoman they knew if she should feel too tired to come on and this tess did not descending to her home till the following afternoon  when she entered the house she perceived in a moment from her mothers triumphant manner that something had occurred in the interim  oh yes i know all about it  i told ee it would be all right and now tis proved  since ive been away  what has said tess rather wearily  her mother surveyed the girl up and down with arch approval and went on banteringly so youve brought em round  how do you know mother  ive had a letter  tess then remembered that there would have been time for this  they saymrs durberville saysthat she wants you to look after a little fowlfarm which is her hobby  but this is only her artful way of getting ee there without raising your hopes  shes going to own ee as kinthats the meaning ot  but i didnt see her  you zid somebody i suppose  i saw her son  and did he own ee  wellhe called me coz  an i knew it  jackyhe called her coz cried joan to her husband  well he spoke to his mother of course and she do want ee there  but i dont know that i am apt at tending fowls said the dubious tess  then i dont know who is apt  youve ben born in the business and brought up in it  they that be born in a business always know more about it than any prentice  besides thats only just a show of something for you to do that you midnt feel beholden  i dont altogether think i ought to go said tess thoughtfully who wrote the letter  will you let me look at it  mrs durberville wrote it  here it is  the letter was in the third person and briefly informed mrs durbeyfield that her daughters services would be useful to that lady in the management of her poultryfarm that a comfortable room would be provided for her if she could come and that the wages would be on a liberal scale if they liked her  ohthats all said tess  you couldnt expect her to throw her arms round ee an to kiss and to coll ee all at once  tess looked out of the window  i would rather stay here with father and you she said  but why  id rather not tell you why mother indeed i dont quite know why  a week afterwards she came in one evening from an unavailing search for some light occupation in the immediate neighbourhood  her idea had been to get together sufficient money during the summer to purchase another horse  hardly had she crossed the threshold before one of the children danced across the room saying the gentlemans been here  her mother hastened to explain smiles breaking from every inch of her person  mrs durbervilles son had called on horseback having been riding by chance in the direction of marlott  he had wished to know finally in the name of his mother if tess could really come to manage the old ladys fowlfarm or not the lad who had hitherto superintended the birds having proved untrustworthy  mr durberville says you must be a good girl if you are at all as you appear he knows you must be worth your weight in gold  he is very much interested in eetruth to tell  tess seemed for the moment really pleased to hear that she had won such high opinion from a stranger when in her own esteem she had sunk so low  it is very good of him to think that she murmured and if i was quite sure how it would be living there i would go anywhen  he is a mighty handsome man  i dont think so said tess coldly  well theres your chance whether or no and im sure he wears a beautiful diamond ring  yes said little abraham brightly from the windowbench and i seed it and it did twinkle when he put his hand up to his mistarshers  mother why did our grand relation keep on putting his hand up to his mistarshers  hark at that child cried mrs durbeyfield with parenthetic admiration  perhaps to show his diamond ring murmured sir john dreamily from his chair  ill think it over said tess leaving the room  well shes made a conquest o the younger branch of us straight off continued the matron to her husband and shes a fool if she dont follow it up  i dont quite like my children going away from home said the haggler  as the head of the family the rest ought to come to me  but do let her go jacky coaxed his poor witless wife  hes struck wi heryou can see that he called her coz  hell marry her most likely and make a lady of her and then shell be what her forefathers was  john durbeyfield had more conceit than energy or health and this supposition was pleasant to him  well perhaps thats what young mr durberville means he admitted and sure enough he mid have serious thoughts about improving his blood by linking on to the old line  tess the little rogue  and have she really paid em a visit to such an end as this  meanwhile tess was walking thoughtfully among the gooseberrybushes in the garden and over princes grave  when she came in her mother pursued her advantage  well what be you going to do she asked  i wish i had seen mrs durberville said tess  i think you mid as well settle it  then youll see her soon enough  her father coughed in his chair  i dont know what to say answered the girl restlessly  it is for you to decide  i killed the old horse and i suppose i ought to do something to get ye a new one  butbuti dont quite like mr durberville being there  the children who had made use of this idea of tess being taken up by their wealthy kinsfolk which they imagined the other family to be as a species of dolorifuge after the death of the horse began to cry at tesss reluctance and teased and reproached her for hesitating  tess wont gooo and be made a laady ofno she says she wooont they wailed with square mouths  and we shant have a nice new horse and lots o golden money to buy fairlings  and tess wont look pretty in her best cloze no mooore  her mother chimed in to the same tune a certain way she had of making her labours in the house seem heavier than they were by prolonging them indefinitely also weighed in the argument  her father alone preserved an attitude of neutrality  i will go said tess at last  her mother could not repress her consciousness of the nuptial vision conjured up by the girls consent  thats right  for such a pretty maid as tis this is a fine chance  tess smiled crossly  i hope it is a chance for earning money  it is no other kind of chance  you had better say nothing of that silly sort about parish  mrs durbeyfield did not promise  she was not quite sure that she did not feel proud enough after the visitors remarks to say a good deal  thus it was arranged and the young girl wrote agreeing to be ready to set out on any day on which she might be required  she was duly informed that mrs durberville was glad of her decision and that a springcart should be sent to meet her and her luggage at the top of the vale on the day after the morrow when she must hold herself prepared to start  mrs durbervilles handwriting seemed rather masculine  a cart murmured joan durbeyfield doubtingly  it might have been a carriage for her own kin  having at last taken her course tess was less restless and abstracted going about her business with some selfassurance in the thought of acquiring another horse for her father by an occupation which would not be onerous  she had hoped to be a teacher at the school but the fates seemed to decide otherwise  being mentally older than her mother she did not regard mrs durbeyfields matrimonial hopes for her in a serious aspect for a moment  the lightminded woman had been discovering good matches for her daughter almost from the year of her birth    vii   on the morning appointed for her departure tess was awake before dawnat the marginal minute of the dark when the grove is still mute save for one prophetic bird who sings with a clearvoiced conviction that he at least knows the correct time of day the rest preserving silence as if equally convinced that he is mistaken  she remained upstairs packing till breakfasttime and then came down in her ordinary weekday clothes her sunday apparel being carefully folded in her box  her mother expostulated you will never set out to see your folks without dressing up more the dand than that  but i am going to work said tess  well yes said mrs durbeyfield and in a private tone at first there mid be a little pretence ot   but i think it will be wiser of ee to put your best side outward she added  very well i suppose you know best replied tess with calm abandonment  and to please her parent the girl put herself quite in joans hands saying serenelydo what you like with me mother  mrs durbeyfield was only too delighted at this tractability first she fetched a great basin and washed tesss hair with such thoroughness that when dried and brushed it looked twice as much as at other times  she tied it with a broader pink ribbon than usual then she put upon her the white frock that tess had worn at the clubwalking the airy fulness of which supplementing her enlarged coiffure imparted to her developing figure an amplitude which belied her age and might cause her to be estimated as a woman when she was not much more than a child  i declare theres a hole in my stockingheel said tess  never mind holes in your stockingsthey dont speak  when i was a maid so long as i had a pretty bonnet the devil might ha found me in heels  her mothers pride in the girls appearance led her to step back like a painter from his easel and survey her work as a whole  you must zee yourself she cried  it is much better than you was tother day  as the lookingglass was only large enough to reflect a very small portion of tesss person at one time mrs durbeyfield hung a black cloak outside the casement and so made a large reflector of the panes as it is the wont of bedecking cottagers to do  after this she went downstairs to her husband who was sitting in the lower room  ill tell ee what tis durbeyfield said she exultingly hell never have the heart not to love her  but whatever you do dont zay too much to tess of his fancy for her and this chance she has got she is such an odd maid that it mid zet her against him or against going there even now  if all goes well i shall certainly be for making some return to pason at stagfoot lane for telling usdear good man  however as the moment for the girls setting out drew nigh when the first excitement of the dressing had passed off a slight misgiving found place in joan durbeyfields mind  it prompted the matron to say that she would walk a little wayas far as to the point where the acclivity from the valley began its first steep ascent to the outer world  at the top tess was going to be met with the springcart sent by the stokedurbervilles and her box had already been wheeled ahead towards this summit by a lad with trucks to be in readiness  seeing their mother put on her bonnet the younger children clamoured to go with her  i do want to walk a littleways wi sissy now shes going to marry our gentlemancousin and wear fine cloze  now said tess flushing and turning quickly ill hear no more o that  mother how could you ever put such stuff into their heads  going to work my dears for our rich relation and help get enough money for a new horse said mrs durbeyfield pacifically  goodbye father said tess with a lumpy throat  goodbye my maid said sir john raising his head from his breast as he suspended his nap induced by a slight excess this morning in honour of the occasion  well i hope my young friend will like such a comely sample of his own blood  and telln tess that being sunk quite from our former grandeur ill sell him the titleyes sell itand at no onreasonable figure  not for less than a thousand pound cried lady durbeyfield  tellnill take a thousand pound  well ill take less when i come to think ot  hell adorn it better than a poor lammicken feller like myself can  telln he shall hae it for a hundred  but i wont stand upon triflestelln he shall hae it for fiftyfor twenty pound  yes twenty poundthats the lowest  dammy family honour is family honour and i wont take a penny less  tesss eyes were too full and her voice too choked to utter the sentiments that were in her  she turned quickly and went out  so the girls and their mother all walked together a child on each side of tess holding her hand and looking at her meditatively from time to time as at one who was about to do great things her mother just behind with the smallest the group forming a picture of honest beauty flanked by innocence and backed by simplesouled vanity they followed the way till they reached the beginning of the ascent on the crest of which the vehicle from trantridge was to receive her this limit having been fixed to save the horse the labour of the last slope  far away behind the first hills the clifflike dwellings of shaston broke the line of the ridge nobody was visible in the elevated road which skirted the ascent save the lad whom they had sent on before them sitting on the handle of the barrow that contained all tesss worldly possessions  bide here a bit and the cart will soon come no doubt said mrs durbeyfield  yes i see it yonder  it had comeappearing suddenly from behind the forehead of the nearest upland and stopping beside the boy with the barrow  her mother and the children thereupon decided to go no farther and bidding them a hasty goodbye tess bent her steps up the hill  they saw her white shape draw near to the springcart on which her box was already placed  but before she had quite reached it another vehicle shot out from a clump of trees on the summit came round the bend of the road there passed the luggagecart and halted beside tess who looked up as if in great surprise  her mother perceived for the first time that the second vehicle was not a humble conveyance like the first but a spickandspan gig or dogcart highly varnished and equipped  the driver was a young man of three or fourandtwenty with a cigar between his teeth wearing a dandy cap drab jacket breeches of the same hue white neckcloth stickup collar and brown drivingglovesin short he was the handsome horsey young buck who had visited joan a week or two before to get her answer about tess  mrs durbeyfield clapped her hands like a child  then she looked down then stared again  could she be deceived as to the meaning of this  is dat the gentlemankinsman wholl make sissy a lady asked the youngest child  meanwhile the muslined form of tess could be seen standing still undecided beside this turnout whose owner was talking to her her seeming indecision was in fact more than indecision it was misgiving  she would have preferred the humble cart  the young man dismounted and appeared to urge her to ascend  she turned her face down the hill to her relatives and regarded the little group something seemed to quicken her to a determination possibly the thought that she had killed prince  she suddenly stepped up he mounted beside her and immediately whipped on the horse  in a moment they had passed the slow cart with the box and disappeared behind the shoulder of the hill  directly tess was out of sight and the interest of the matter as a drama was at an end the little ones eyes filled with tears  the youngest child said i wish poor poor tess wasnt gone away to be a lady and lowering the corners of his lips burst out crying  the new point of view was infectious and the next child did likewise and then the next till the whole three of them wailed loud  there were tears also in joan durbeyfields eyes as she turned to go home  but by the time she had got back to the village she was passively trusting to the favour of accident  however in bed that night she sighed and her husband asked her what was the matter  oh i dont know exactly she said  i was thinking that perhaps it would ha been better if tess had not gone  oughtnt ye to have thought of that before  well tis a chance for the maidstill if twere the doing again i wouldnt let her go till i had found out whether the gentleman is really a goodhearted young man and choice over her as his kinswoman  yes you ought perhaps to ha done that snored sir john  joan durbeyfield always managed to find consolation somewhere well as one of the genuine stock she ought to make her way with en if she plays her trump card aright  and if he dont marry her afore he will after  for that hes all afire wi love for her any eye can see  whats her trump card  her durberville blood you mean  no stupid her faceas twas mine    viii   having mounted beside her alec durberville drove rapidly along the crest of the first hill chatting compliments to tess as they went the cart with her box being left far behind  rising still an immense landscape stretched around them on every side behind the green valley of her birth before a gray country of which she knew nothing except from her first brief visit to trantridge  thus they reached the verge of an incline down which the road stretched in a long straight descent of nearly a mile  ever since the accident with her fathers horse tess durbeyfield courageous as she naturally was had been exceedingly timid on wheels the least irregularity of motion startled her  she began to get uneasy at a certain recklessness in her conductors driving  you will go down slow sir i suppose she said with attempted unconcern  durberville looked round upon her nipped his cigar with the tips of his large white centreteeth and allowed his lips to smile slowly of themselves  why tess he answered after another whiff or two it isnt a brave bouncing girl like you who asks that  why i always go down at full gallop  theres nothing like it for raising your spirits  but perhaps you need not now  ah he said shaking his head there are two to be reckoned with it is not me alone  tib has to be considered and she has a very queer temper  who  why this mare  i fancy she looked round at me in a very grim way just then  didnt you notice it  dont try to frighten me sir said tess stiffly  well i dont  if any living man can manage this horse i can i wont say any living man can do itbut if such has the power i am he  why do you have such a horse  ah well may you ask it  it was my fate i suppose tib has killed one chap and just after i bought her she nearly killed me  and then take my word for it i nearly killed her  but shes touchy still very touchy and ones life is hardly safe behind her sometimes  they were just beginning to descend and it was evident that the horse whether of her own will or of his the latter being the more likely knew so well the reckless performance expected of her that she hardly required a hint from behind  down down they sped the wheels humming like a top the dogcart rocking right and left its axis acquiring a slightly oblique set in relation to the line of progress the figure of the horse rising and falling in undulations before them  sometimes a wheel was off the ground it seemed for many yards sometimes a stone was sent spinning over the hedge and flinty sparks from the horses hoofs outshone the daylight  the aspect of the straight road enlarged with their advance the two banks dividing like a splitting stick one rushing past at each shoulder  the wind blew through tesss white muslin to her very skin and her washed hair flew out behind  she was determined to show no open fear but she clutched durbervilles reinarm  dont touch my arm  we shall be thrown out if you do  hold on round my waist  she grasped his waist and so they reached the bottom  safe thank god in spite of your fooling said she her face on fire  tessfie thats temper said durberville  tis truth  well you need not let go your hold of me so thanklessly the moment you feel yourself our of danger  she had not considered what she had been doing whether he were man or woman stick or stone in her involuntary hold on him  recovering her reserve she sat without replying and thus they reached the summit of another declivity  now then again said durberville  no no said tess  show more sense do please  but when people find themselves on one of the highest points in the county they must get down again he retorted  he loosened rein and away they went a second time  durberville turned his face to her as they rocked and said in playful raillery now then put your arms round my waist again as you did before my beauty  never said tess independently holding on as well as she could without touching him  let me put one little kiss on those holmberry lips tess or even on that warmed cheek and ill stopon my honour i will  tess surprised beyond measure slid farther back still on her seat at which he urged the horse anew and rocked her the more  will nothing else do she cried at length in desperation her large eyes staring at him like those of a wild animal  this dressing her up so prettily by her mother had apparently been to lamentable purpose  nothing dear tess he replied  oh i dont knowvery well i dont mind she panted miserably  he drew rein and as they slowed he was on the point of imprinting the desired salute when as if hardly yet aware of her own modesty she dodged aside  his arms being occupied with the reins there was left him no power to prevent her manoeuvre  now damn itill break both our necks swore her capriciously passionate companion  so you can go from your word like that you young witch can you  very well said tess ill not move since you be so determined but ithought you would be kind to me and protect me as my kinsman  kinsman be hanged  now  but i dont want anybody to kiss me sir she implored a big tear beginning to roll down her face and the corners of her mouth trembling in her attempts not to cry  and i wouldnt ha come if i had known  he was inexorable and she sat still and durberville gave her the kiss of mastery  no sooner had he done so than she flushed with shame took out her handkerchief and wiped the spot on her cheek that had been touched by his lips  his ardour was nettled at the sight for the act on her part had been unconsciously done  you are mighty sensitive for a cottage girl said the young man  tess made no reply to this remark of which indeed she did not quite comprehend the drift unheeding the snub she had administered by her instinctive rub upon her cheek  she had in fact undone the kiss as far as such a thing was physically possible  with a dim sense that he was vexed she looked steadily ahead as they trotted on near melbury down and wingreen till she saw to her consternation that there was yet another descent to be undergone  you shall be made sorry for that he resumed his injured tone still remaining as he flourished the whip anew  unless that is you agree willingly to let me do it again and no handkerchief  she sighed very well sir she said  ohlet me get my hat  at the moment of speaking her hat had blown off into the road their present speed on the upland being by no means slow  durberville pulled up and said he would get it for her but tess was down on the other side  she turned back and picked up the article  you look prettier with it off upon my soul if thats possible he said contemplating her over the back of the vehicle  now then up again  whats the matter  the hat was in place and tied but tess had not stepped forward  no sir she said revealing the red and ivory of her mouth as her eye lit in defiant triumph not again if i know it  whatyou wont get up beside me  no i shall walk  tis five or six miles yet to trantridge  i dont care if tis dozens  besides the cart is behind  you artful hussy  now tell medidnt you make that hat blow off on purpose  ill swear you did  her strategic silence confirmed his suspicion  then durberville cursed and swore at her and called her everything he could think of for the trick  turning the horse suddenly he tried to drive back upon her and so hem her in between the gig and the hedge  but he could not do this short of injuring her  you ought to be ashamed of yourself for using such wicked words cried tess with spirit from the top of the hedge into which she had scrambled  i dont like ee at all  i hate and detest you  ill go back to mother i will  durbervilles bad temper cleared up at sight of hers and he laughed heartily  well i like you all the better he said  come let there be peace  ill never do it any more against your will  my life upon it now  still tess could not be induced to remount  she did not however object to his keeping his gig alongside her and in this manner at a slow pace they advanced towards the village of trantridge  from time to time durberville exhibited a sort of fierce distress at the sight of the tramping he had driven her to undertake by his misdemeanour  she might in truth have safely trusted him now but he had forfeited her confidence for the time and she kept on the ground progressing thoughtfully as if wondering whether it would be wiser to return home  her resolve however had been taken and it seemed vacillating even to childishness to abandon it now unless for graver reasons  how could she face her parents get back her box and disconcert the whole scheme for the rehabilitation of her family on such sentimental grounds  a few minutes later the chimneys of the slopes appeared in view and in a snug nook to the right the poultryfarm and cottage of tess destination    ix   the community of fowls to which tess had been appointed as supervisor purveyor nurse surgeon and friend made its headquarters in an old thatched cottage standing in an enclosure that had once been a garden but was now a trampled and sanded square the house was overrun with ivy its chimney being enlarged by the boughs of the parasite to the aspect of a ruined tower  the lower rooms were entirely given over to the birds who walked about them with a proprietary air as though the place had been built by themselves and not by certain dusty copyholders who now lay east and west in the churchyard  the descendants of these bygone owners felt it almost as a slight to their family when the house which had so much of their affection had cost so much of their forefathers money and had been in their possession for several generations before the durbervilles came and built here was indifferently turned into a fowlhouse by mrs stokedurberville as soon as the property fell into hand according to law  twas good enough for christians in grandfathers time they said  the rooms wherein dozens of infants had wailed at their nursing now resounded with the tapping of nascent chicks  distracted hens in coops occupied spots where formerly stood chairs supporting sedate agriculturists  the chimneycorner and onceblazing hearth was now filled with inverted beehives in which the hens laid their eggs while out of doors the plots that each succeeding householder had carefully shaped with his spade were torn by the cocks in wildest fashion  the garden in which the cottage stood was surrounded by a wall and could only be entered through a door  when tess had occupied herself about an hour the next morning in altering and improving the arrangements according to her skilled ideas as the daughter of a professed poulterer the door in the wall opened and a servant in white cap and apron entered  she had come from the manorhouse  mrs durberville wants the fowls as usual she said but perceiving that tess did not quite understand she explained misess is a old lady and blind  blind said tess  almost before her misgiving at the news could find time to shape itself she took under her companions direction two of the most beautiful of the hamburghs in her arms and followed the maidservant who had likewise taken two to the adjacent mansion which though ornate and imposing showed traces everywhere on this side that some occupant of its chambers could bend to the love of dumb creaturesfeathers floating within view of the front and hencoops standing on the grass  in a sittingroom on the groundfloor ensconced in an armchair with her back to the light was the owner and mistress of the estate a whitehaired woman of not more than sixty or even less wearing a large cap  she had the mobile face frequent in those whose sight has decayed by stages has been laboriously striven after and reluctantly let go rather than the stagnant mien apparent in persons long sightless or born blind  tess walked up to this lady with her feathered chargesone sitting on each arm  ah you are the young woman come to look after my birds said mrs durberville recognizing a new footstep  i hope you will be kind to them  my bailiff tells me you are quite the proper person well where are they  ah this is strut  but he is hardly so lively today is he  he is alarmed at being handled by a stranger i suppose and phena tooyes they are a little frightenedarent you dears but they will soon get used to you  while the old lady had been speaking tess and the other maid in obedience to her gestures had placed the fowls severally in her lap and she had felt them over from head to tail examining their beaks their combs the manes of the cocks their wings and their claws her touch enabled her to recognize them in a moment and to discover if a single feather were crippled or draggled  she handled their crops and knew what they had eaten and if too little or too much her face enacting a vivid pantomime of the criticisms passing in her mind  the birds that the two girls had brought in were duly returned to the yard and the process was repeated till all the pet cocks and hens had been submitted to the old womanhamburghs bantams cochins brahmas dorkings and such other sorts as were in fashion just thenher perception of each visitor being seldom at fault as she received the bird upon her knees  it reminded tess of a confirmation in which mrs durberville was the bishop the fowls the young people presented and herself and the maidservant the parson and curate of the parish bringing them up at the end of the ceremony mrs durberville abruptly asked tess wrinkling and twitching her face into undulations can you whistle  whistle maam  yes whistle tunes  tess could whistle like most other countrygirls though the accomplishment was one which she did not care to profess in genteel company  however she blandly admitted that such was the fact  then you will have to practise it every day  i had a lad who did it very well but he has left  i want you to whistle to my bullfinches as i cannot see them i like to hear them and we teach em airs that way  tell her where the cages are elizabeth  you must begin tomorrow or they will go back in their piping they have been neglected these several days  mr durberville whistled to em this morning maam said elizabeth  he  pooh  the old ladys face creased into furrows of repugnance and she made no further reply  thus the reception of tess by her fancied kinswoman terminated and the birds were taken back to their quarters  the girls surprise at mrs durbervilles manner was not great for since seeing the size of the house she had expected no more  but she was far from being aware that the old lady had never heard a word of the socalled kinship she gathered that no great affection flowed between the blind woman and her son  but in that too she was mistaken  mrs durberville was not the first mother compelled to love her offspring resentfully and to be bitterly fond   in spite of the unpleasant initiation of the day before tess inclined to the freedom and novelty of her new position in the morning when the sun shone now that she was once installed there and she was curious to test her powers in the unexpected direction asked of her so as to ascertain her chance of retaining her post as soon as she was alone within the walled garden she sat herself down on a coop and seriously screwed up her mouth for the longneglected practice  she found her former ability to have degenerated to the production of a hollow rush of wind through the lips and no clear note at all  she remained fruitlessly blowing and blowing wondering how she could have so grown out of the art which had come by nature till she became aware of a movement among the ivyboughs which cloaked the gardenwall no less then the cottage  looking that way she beheld a form springing from the coping to the plot  it was alec durberville whom she had not set eyes on since he had conducted her the day before to the door of the gardeners cottage where she had lodgings  upon my honour cried he there was never before such a beautiful thing in nature or art as you look cousin tess cousin had a faint ring of mockery  i have been watching you from over the wallsitting like impatience on a monument and pouting up that pretty red mouth to whistling shape and whooing and whooing and privately swearing and never being able to produce a note  why you are quite cross because you cant do it  i may be cross but i didnt swear  ah  i understand why you are tryingthose bullies  my mother wants you to carry on their musical education  how selfish of her as if attending to these curst cocks and hens here were not enough work for any girl  i would flatly refuse if i were you  but she wants me particularly to do it and to be ready by tomorrow morning  does she  well thenill give you a lesson or two  oh no you wont said tess withdrawing towards the door  nonsense i dont want to touch you  seeill stand on this side of the wirenetting and you can keep on the other so you may feel quite safe  now look here you screw up your lips too harshly there tisso  he suited the action to the word and whistled a line of take o take those lips away  but the allusion was lost upon tess  now try said durberville  she attempted to look reserved her face put on a sculptural severity  but he persisted in his demand and at last to get rid of him she did put up her lips as directed for producing a clear note laughing distressfully however and then blushing with vexation that she had laughed  he encouraged her with try again  tess was quite serious painfully serious by this time and she triedultimately and unexpectedly emitting a real round sound the momentary pleasure of success got the better of her her eyes enlarged and she involuntarily smiled in his face  thats it  now i have started youyoull go on beautifully therei said i would not come near you and in spite of such temptation as never before fell to mortal man ill keep my word  tess do you think my mother a queer old soul  i dont know much of her yet sir  youll find her so she must be to make you learn to whistle to her bullfinches  i am rather out of her books just now but you will be quite in favour if you treat her livestock well  good morning  if you meet with any difficulties and want help here dont go to the bailiff come to me   it was in the economy of this régime that tess durbeyfield had undertaken to fill a place  her first days experiences were fairly typical of those which followed through many succeeding days  a familiarity with alec durbervilles presencewhich that young man carefully cultivated in her by playful dialogue and by jestingly calling her his cousin when they were aloneremoved much of her original shyness of him without however implanting any feeling which could engender shyness of a new and tenderer kind  but she was more pliable under his hands than a mere companionship would have made her owing to her unavoidable dependence upon his mother and through that ladys comparative helplessness upon him  she soon found that whistling to the bullfinches in mrs durbervilles room was no such onerous business when she had regained the art for she had caught from her musical mother numerous airs that suited those songsters admirably  a far more satisfactory time than when she practised in the garden was this whistling by the cages each morning  unrestrained by the young mans presence she threw up her mouth put her lips near the bars and piped away in easeful grace to the attentive listeners  mrs durberville slept in a large fourpost bedstead hung with heavy damask curtains and the bullfinches occupied the same apartment where they flitted about freely at certain hours and made little white spots on the furniture and upholstery  once while tess was at the window where the cages were ranged giving her lesson as usual she thought she heard a rustling behind the bed  the old lady was not present and turning round the girl had an impression that the toes of a pair of boots were visible below the fringe of the curtains  thereupon her whistling became so disjointed that the listener if such there were must have discovered her suspicion of his presence  she searched the curtains every morning after that but never found anybody within them  alec durberville had evidently thought better of his freak to terrify her by an ambush of that kind    x   every village has its idiosyncrasy its constitution often its own code of morality  the levity of some of the younger women in and about trantridge was marked and was perhaps symptomatic of the choice spirit who ruled the slopes in that vicinity  the place had also a more abiding defect it drank hard  the staple conversation on the farms around was on the uselessness of saving money and smockfrocked arithmeticians leaning on their ploughs or hoes would enter into calculations of great nicety to prove that parish relief was a fuller provision for a man in his old age than any which could result from savings out of their wages during a whole lifetime  the chief pleasure of these philosophers lay in going every saturday night when work was done to chaseborough a decayed markettown two or three miles distant and returning in the small hours of the next morning to spend sunday in sleeping off the dyspeptic effects of the curious compounds sold to them as beer by the monopolizers of the onceindependent inns  for a long time tess did not join in the weekly pilgrimages  but under pressure from matrons not much older than herselffor a fieldmans wages being as high at twentyone as at forty marriage was early heretess at length consented to go  her first experience of the journey afforded her more enjoyment than she had expected the hilariousness of the others being quite contagious after her monotonous attention to the poultryfarm all the week she went again and again  being graceful and interesting standing moreover on the momentary threshold of womanhood her appearance drew down upon her some sly regards from loungers in the streets of chaseborough hence though sometimes her journey to the town was made independently she always searched for her fellows at nightfall to have the protection of their companionship homeward  this had gone on for a month or two when there came a saturday in september on which a fair and a market coincided and the pilgrims from trantridge sought double delights at the inns on that account tesss occupations made her late in setting out so that her comrades reached the town long before her  it was a fine september evening just before sunset when yellow lights struggle with blue shades in hairlike lines and the atmosphere itself forms a prospect without aid from more solid objects except the innumerable winged insects that dance in it  through this lowlit mistiness tess walked leisurely along  she did not discover the coincidence of the market with the fair till she had reached the place by which time it was close upon dusk  her limited marketing was soon completed and then as usual she began to look about for some of the trantridge cottagers  at first she could not find them and she was informed that most of them had gone to what they called a private little jig at the house of a haytrusser and peatdealer who had transactions with their farm  he lived in an outoftheway nook of the townlet and in trying to find her course thither her eyes fell upon mr durberville standing at a street corner  whatmy beauty  you here so late he said  she told him that she was simply waiting for company homeward  ill see you again said he over her shoulder as she went on down the back lane  approaching the haytrussers she could hear the fiddled notes of a reel proceeding from some building in the rear but no sound of dancing was audiblean exceptional state of things for these parts where as a rule the stamping drowned the music  the front door being open she could see straight through the house into the garden at the back as far as the shades of night would allow and nobody appearing to her knock she traversed the dwelling and went up the path to the outhouse whence the sound had attracted her  it was a windowless erection used for storage and from the open door there floated into the obscurity a mist of yellow radiance which at first tess thought to be illuminated smoke  but on drawing nearer she perceived that it was a cloud of dust lit by candles within the outhouse whose beams upon the haze carried forward the outline of the doorway into the wide night of the garden  when she came close and looked in she beheld indistinct forms racing up and down to the figure of the dance the silence of their footfalls arising from their being overshoe in scroffthat is to say the powdery residuum from the storage of peat and other products the stirring of which by their turbulent feet created the nebulosity that involved the scene  through this floating fusty debris of peat and hay mixed with the perspirations and warmth of the dancers and forming together a sort of vegetohuman pollen the muted fiddles feebly pushed their notes in marked contrast to the spirit with which the measure was trodden out  they coughed as they danced and laughed as they coughed  of the rushing couples there could barely be discerned more than the high lightsthe indistinctness shaping them to satyrs clasping nymphsa multiplicity of pans whirling a multiplicity of syrinxes lotis attempting to elude priapus and always failing  at intervals a couple would approach the doorway for air and the haze no longer veiling their features the demigods resolved themselves into the homely personalities of her own nextdoor neighbours  could trantridge in two or three short hours have metamorphosed itself thus madly  some sileni of the throng sat on benches and haytrusses by the wall and one of them recognized her  the maids dont think it respectable to dance at the flowerdeluce he explained  they dont like to let everybody see which be their fancymen  besides the house sometimes shuts up just when their jints begin to get greased  so we come here and send out for liquor  but when be any of you going home asked tess with some anxiety  nowamost directly  this is all but the last jig  she waited  the reel drew to a close and some of the party were in the mind of starting  but others would not and another dance was formed  this surely would end it thought tess  but it merged in yet another  she became restless and uneasy yet having waited so long it was necessary to wait longer on account of the fair the roads were dotted with roving characters of possibly ill intent and though not fearful of measurable dangers she feared the unknown had she been near marlott she would have had less dread  dont ye be nervous my dear good soul expostulated between his coughs a young man with a wet face and his straw hat so far back upon his head that the brim encircled it like the nimbus of a saint whats yer hurry  tomorrow is sunday thank god and we can sleep it off in churchtime  now have a turn with me  she did not abhor dancing but she was not going to dance here  the movement grew more passionate the fiddlers behind the luminous pillar of cloud now and then varied the air by playing on the wrong side of the bridge or with the back of the bow  but it did not matter the panting shapes spun onwards  they did not vary their partners if their inclination were to stick to previous ones  changing partners simply meant that a satisfactory choice had not as yet been arrived at by one or other of the pair and by this time every couple had been suitably matched  it was then that the ecstasy and the dream began in which emotion was the matter of the universe and matter but an adventitious intrusion likely to hinder you from spinning where you wanted to spin  suddenly there was a dull thump on the ground a couple had fallen and lay in a mixed heap  the next couple unable to check its progress came toppling over the obstacle  an inner cloud of dust rose around the prostrate figures amid the general one of the room in which a twitching entanglement of arms and legs was discernible  you shall catch it for this my gentleman when you get home burst in female accents from the human heapthose of the unhappy partner of the man whose clumsiness had caused the mishap she happened also to be his recently married wife in which assortment there was nothing unusual at trantridge as long as any affection remained between wedded couples and indeed it was not uncustomary in their later lives to avoid making odd lots of the single people between whom there might be a warm understanding  a loud laugh from behind tesss back in the shade of the garden united with the titter within the room  she looked round and saw the red coal of a cigar alec durberville was standing there alone he beckoned to her and she reluctantly retreated towards him  well my beauty what are you doing here  she was so tired after her long day and her walk that she confided her trouble to himthat she had been waiting ever since he saw her to have their company home because the road at night was strange to her  but it seems they will never leave off and i really think i will wait no longer  certainly do not  i have only a saddlehorse here today but come to the flowerdeluce and ill hire a trap and drive you home with me  tess though flattered had never quite got over her original mistrust of him and despite their tardiness she preferred to walk home with the workfolk  so she answered that she was much obliged to him but would not trouble him  i have said that i will wait for em and they will expect me to now  very well miss independence  please yourself  then i shall not hurry  my good lord what a kickup they are having there  he had not put himself forward into the light but some of them had perceived him and his presence led to a slight pause and a consideration of how the time was flying  as soon as he had relit a cigar and walked away the trantridge people began to collect themselves from amid those who had come in from other farms and prepared to leave in a body  their bundles and baskets were gathered up and half an hour later when the clockchime sounded a quarter past eleven they were straggling along the lane which led up the hill towards their homes  it was a threemile walk along a dry white road made whiter tonight by the light of the moon  tess soon perceived as she walked in the flock sometimes with this one sometimes with that that the fresh night air was producing staggerings and serpentine courses among the men who had partaken too freely some of the more careless women also were wandering in their gaitto wit a dark virago car darch dubbed queen of spades till lately a favourite of durbervilles nancy her sister nicknamed the queen of diamonds and the young married woman who had already tumbled down  yet however terrestrial and lumpy their appearance just now to the mean unglamoured eye to themselves the case was different  they followed the road with a sensation that they were soaring along in a supporting medium possessed of original and profound thoughts themselves and surrounding nature forming an organism of which all the parts harmoniously and joyously interpenetrated each other  they were as sublime as the moon and stars above them and the moon and stars were as ardent as they  tess however had undergone such painful experiences of this kind in her fathers house that the discovery of their condition spoilt the pleasure she was beginning to feel in the moonlight journey  yet she stuck to the party for reasons above given  in the open highway they had progressed in scattered order but now their route was through a fieldgate and the foremost finding a difficulty in opening it they closed up together  this leading pedestrian was car the queen of spades who carried a wickerbasket containing her mothers groceries her own draperies and other purchases for the week  the basket being large and heavy car had placed it for convenience of porterage on the top of her head where it rode on in jeopardized balance as she walked with arms akimbo  wellwhatever is that acreeping down thy back car darch said one of the group suddenly  all looked at car  her gown was a light cotton print and from the back of her head a kind of rope could be seen descending to some distance below her waist like a chinamans queue  tis her hair falling down said another  no it was not her hair it was a black stream of something oozing from her basket and it glistened like a slimy snake in the cold still rays of the moon  tis treacle said an observant matron  treacle it was  cars poor old grandmother had a weakness for the sweet stuff  honey she had in plenty out of her own hives but treacle was what her soul desired and car had been about to give her a treat of surprise  hastily lowering the basket the dark girl found that the vessel containing the syrup had been smashed within  by this time there had arisen a shout of laughter at the extraordinary appearance of cars back which irritated the dark queen into getting rid of the disfigurement by the first sudden means available and independently of the help of the scoffers  she rushed excitedly into the field they were about to cross and flinging herself flat on her back upon the grass began to wipe her gown as well as she could by spinning horizontally on the herbage and dragging herself over it upon her elbows  the laughter rang louder they clung to the gate to the posts rested on their staves in the weakness engendered by their convulsions at the spectacle of car  our heroine who had hitherto held her peace at this wild moment could not help joining in with the rest  it was a misfortunein more ways than one  no sooner did the dark queen hear the soberer richer note of tess among those of the other workpeople than a longsmouldering sense of rivalry inflamed her to madness  she sprang to her feet and closely faced the object of her dislike  how darest th laugh at me hussy she cried  i couldnt really help it when tothers did apologized tess still tittering  ah thst think th beest everybody dostnt because th beest first favourite with he just now  but stop a bit my lady stop a bit  im as good as two of such look hereheres at ee  to tesss horror the dark queen began stripping off the bodice of her gownwhich for the added reason of its ridiculed condition she was only too glad to be free oftill she had bared her plump neck shoulders and arms to the moonshine under which they looked as luminous and beautiful as some praxitelean creation in their possession of the faultless rotundities of a lusty countrygirl she closed her fists and squared up at tess  indeed then i shall not fight said the latter majestically and if i had know you was of that sort i wouldnt have so let myself down as to come with such a whorage as this is  the rather too inclusive speech brought down a torrent of vituperation from other quarters upon fair tesss unlucky head particularly from the queen of diamonds who having stood in the relations to durberville that car had also been suspected of united with the latter against the common enemy  several other women also chimed in with an animus which none of them would have been so fatuous as to show but for the rollicking evening they had passed thereupon finding tess unfairly browbeaten the husbands and lovers tried to make peace by defending her but the result of that attempt was directly to increase the war  tess was indignant and ashamed  she no longer minded the loneliness of the way and the lateness of the hour her one object was to get away from the whole crew as soon as possible  she knew well enough that the better among them would repent of their passion next day they were all now inside the field and she was edging back to rush off alone when a horseman emerged almost silently from the corner of the hedge that screened the road and alec durberville looked round upon them  what the devil is all this row about workfolk he asked  the explanation was not readily forthcoming and in truth he did not require any  having heard their voices while yet some way off he had ridden creepingly forward and learnt enough to satisfy himself  tess was standing apart from the rest near the gate  he bent over towards her  jump up behind me he whispered and well get shot of the screaming cats in a jiffy  she felt almost ready to faint so vivid was her sense of the crisis at almost any other moment of her life she would have refused such proffered aid and company as she had refused them several times before and now the loneliness would not of itself have forced her to do otherwise  but coming as the invitation did at the particular juncture when fear and indignation at these adversaries could be transformed by a spring of the foot into a triumph over them she abandoned herself to her impulse climbed the gate put her toe upon his instep and scrambled into the saddle behind him  the pair were speeding away into the distant gray by the time that the contentious revellers became aware of what had happened  the queen of spades forgot the stain on her bodice and stood beside the queen of diamonds and the newmarried staggering young womanall with a gaze of fixity in the direction in which the horses tramp was diminishing into silence on the road  what be ye looking at asked a man who had not observed the incident  hohoho laughed dark car  heeheehee laughed the tippling bride as she steadied herself on the arm of her fond husband  heuheuheu laughed dark cars mother stroking her moustache as she explained laconically out of the fryingpan into the fire  then these children of the open air whom even excess of alcohol could scarce injure permanently betook themselves to the fieldpath and as they went there moved onward with them around the shadow of each ones head a circle of opalized light formed by the moons rays upon the glistening sheet of dew  each pedestrian could see no halo but his or her own which never deserted the headshadow whatever its vulgar unsteadiness might be but adhered to it and persistently beautified it till the erratic motions seemed an inherent part of the irradiation and the fumes of their breathing a component of the nights mist and the spirit of the scene and of the moonlight and of nature seemed harmoniously to mingle with the spirit of wine    xi   the twain cantered along for some time without speech tess as she clung to him still panting in her triumph yet in other respects dubious  she had perceived that the horse was not the spirited one he sometimes rose and felt no alarm on that score though her seat was precarious enough despite her tight hold of him  she begged him to slow the animal to a walk which alec accordingly did  neatly done was it not dear tess he said by and by  yes said she  i am sure i ought to be much obliged to you  and are you  she did not reply  tess why do you always dislike my kissing you  i supposebecause i dont love you  you are quite sure  i am angry with you sometimes  ah i half feared as much  nevertheless alec did not object to that confession  he knew that anything was better then frigidity why havent you told me when i have made you angry  you know very well why  because i cannot help myself here  i havent offended you often by lovemaking  you have sometimes  how many times  you know as well as itoo many times  every time i have tried  she was silent and the horse ambled along for a considerable distance till a faint luminous fog which had hung in the hollows all the evening became general and enveloped them  it seemed to hold the moonlight in suspension rendering it more pervasive than in clear air  whether on this account or from absentmindedness or from sleepiness she did not perceive that they had long ago passed the point at which the lane to trantridge branched from the highway and that her conductor had not taken the trantridge track  she was inexpressibly weary  she had risen at five oclock every morning of that week had been on foot the whole of each day and on this evening had in addition walked the three miles to chaseborough waited three hours for her neighbours without eating or drinking her impatience to start them preventing either she had then walked a mile of the way home and had undergone the excitement of the quarrel till with the slow progress of their steed it was now nearly one oclock  only once however was she overcome by actual drowsiness  in that moment of oblivion her head sank gently against him  durberville stopped the horse withdrew his feet from the stirrups turned sideways on the saddle and enclosed her waist with his arm to support her  this immediately put her on the defensive and with one of those sudden impulses of reprisal to which she was liable she gave him a little push from her  in his ticklish position he nearly lost his balance and only just avoided rolling over into the road the horse though a powerful one being fortunately the quietest he rode  that is devilish unkind he said  i mean no harmonly to keep you from falling  she pondered suspiciously till thinking that this might after all be true she relented and said quite humbly i beg your pardon sir  i wont pardon you unless you show some confidence in me  good god he burst out what am i to be repulsed so by a mere chit like you  for near three mortal months have you trifled with my feelings eluded me and snubbed me and i wont stand it  ill leave you tomorrow sir  no you will not leave me tomorrow  will you i ask once more show your belief in me by letting me clasp you with my arm  come between us two and nobody else now  we know each other well and you know that i love you and think you the prettiest girl in the world which you are  maynt i treat you as a lover  she drew a quick pettish breath of objection writhing uneasily on her seat looked far ahead and murmured i dont knowi wishhow can i say yes or no when  he settled the matter by clasping his arm round her as he desired and tess expressed no further negative  thus they sidled slowly onward till it struck her they had been advancing for an unconscionable timefar longer than was usually occupied by the short journey from chaseborough even at this walking pace and that they were no longer on hard road but in a mere trackway  why where be we she exclaimed  passing by a wood  a woodwhat wood  surely we are quite out of the road  a bit of the chasethe oldest wood in england  it is a lovely night and why should we not prolong our ride a little  how could you be so treacherous said tess between archness and real dismay and getting rid of his arm by pulling open his fingers one by one though at the risk of slipping off herself  just when ive been putting such trust in you and obliging you to please you because i thought i had wronged you by that push  please set me down and let me walk home  you cannot walk home darling even if the air were clear  we are miles away from trantridge if i must tell you and in this growing fog you might wander for hours among these trees  never mind that she coaxed  put me down i beg you  i dont mind where it is only let me get down sir please  very well then i willon one condition  having brought you here to this outoftheway place i feel myself responsible for your safeconduct home whatever you may yourself feel about it as to your getting to trantridge without assistance it is quite impossible for to tell the truth dear owing to this fog which so disguises everything i dont quite know where we are myself  now if you will promise to wait beside the horse while i walk through the bushes till i come to some road or house and ascertain exactly our whereabouts ill deposit you here willingly  when i come back ill give you full directions and if you insist upon walking you may or you may rideat your pleasure  she accepted these terms and slid off on the near side though not till he had stolen a cursory kiss  he sprang down on the other side  i suppose i must hold the horse said she  oh no its not necessary replied alec patting the panting creature  hes had enough of it for tonight  he turned the horses head into the bushes hitched him on to a bough and made a sort of couch or nest for her in the deep mass of dead leaves  now you sit there he said  the leaves have not got damp as yet just give an eye to the horseit will be quite sufficient  he took a few steps away from her but returning said by the bye tess your father has a new cob today  somebody gave it to him  somebody  you  durberville nodded  o how very good of you that is she exclaimed with a painful sense of the awkwardness of having to thank him just then  and the children have some toys  i didnt knowyou ever sent them anything she murmured much moved  i almost wish you had notyes i almost wish it  why dear  ithampers me so  tessydont you love me ever so little now  im grateful she reluctantly admitted  but i fear i do not the sudden vision of his passion for herself as a factor in this result so distressed her that beginning with one slow tear and then following with another she wept outright  dont cry dear dear one  now sit down here and wait till i come  she passively sat down amid the leaves he had heaped and shivered slightly  are you cold he asked  not verya little  he touched her with his fingers which sank into her as into down you have only that puffy muslin dress onhows that  its my best summer one  twas very warm when i started and i didnt know i was going to ride and that it would be night  nights grow chilly in september  let me see  he pulled off a light overcoat that he had worn and put it round her tenderly thats itnow youll feel warmer he continued  now my pretty rest there i shall soon be back again  having buttoned the overcoat round her shoulders he plunged into the webs of vapour which by this time formed veils between the trees she could hear the rustling of the branches as he ascended the adjoining slope till his movements were no louder than the hopping of a bird and finally died away  with the setting of the moon the pale light lessened and tess became invisible as she fell into reverie upon the leaves where he had left her  in the meantime alec durberville had pushed on up the slope to clear his genuine doubt as to the quarter of the chase they were in  he had in fact ridden quite at random for over an hour taking any turning that came to hand in order to prolong companionship with her and giving far more attention to tesss moonlit person than to any wayside object  a little rest for the jaded animal being desirable he did not hasten his search for landmarks  a clamber over the hill into the adjoining vale brought him to the fence of a highway whose contours he recognized which settled the question of their whereabouts  durberville thereupon turned back but by this time the moon had quite gone down and partly on account of the fog the chase was wrapped in thick darkness although morning was not far off  he was obliged to advance with outstretched hands to avoid contact with the boughs and discovered that to hit the exact spot from which he had started was at first entirely beyond him  roaming up and down round and round he at length heard a slight movement of the horse close at hand and the sleeve of his overcoat unexpectedly caught his foot  tess said durberville  there was no answer  the obscurity was now so great that he could see absolutely nothing but a pale nebulousness at his feet which represented the white muslin figure he had left upon the dead leaves everything else was blackness alike  durberville stooped and heard a gentle regular breathing  he knelt and bent lower till her breath warmed his face and in a moment his cheek was in contact with hers she was sleeping soundly and upon her eyelashes there lingered tears  darkness and silence ruled everywhere around  above them rose the primeval yews and oaks of the chase in which there poised gentle roosting birds in their last nap and about them stole the hopping rabbits and hares  but might some say where was tesss guardian angel where was the providence of her simple faith  perhaps like that other god of whom the ironical tishbite spoke he was talking or he was pursuing or he was in a journey or he was sleeping and not to be awaked  why it was that upon this beautiful feminine tissue sensitive as gossamer and practically blank as snow as yet there should have been traced such a coarse pattern as it was doomed to receive why so often the coarse appropriates the finer thus the wrong man the woman the wrong woman the man many thousand years of analytical philosophy have failed to explain to our sense of order  one may indeed admit the possibility of a retribution lurking in the present catastrophe  doubtless some of tess durbervilles mailed ancestors rollicking home from a fray had dealt the same measure even more ruthlessly towards peasant girls of their time  but though to visit the sins of the fathers upon the children may be a morality good enough for divinities it is scorned by average human nature and it therefore does not mend the matter  as tesss own people down in those retreats are never tired of saying among each other in their fatalistic way it was to be  there lay the pity of it  an immeasurable social chasm was to divide our heroines personality thereafter from that previous self of hers who stepped from her mothers door to try her fortune at trantridge poultryfarm   end of phase the first      phase the second maiden no more    xii   the basket was heavy and the bundle was large but she lugged them along like a person who did not find her especial burden in material things  occasionally she stopped to rest in a mechanical way by some gate or post and then giving the baggage another hitch upon her full round arm went steadily on again  it was a sunday morning in late october about four months after tess durbeyfields arrival at trantridge and some few weeks subsequent to the night ride in the chase  the time was not long past daybreak and the yellow luminosity upon the horizon behind her back lighted the ridge towards which her face was setthe barrier of the vale wherein she had of late been a strangerwhich she would have to climb over to reach her birthplace  the ascent was gradual on this side and the soil and scenery differed much from those within blakemore vale  even the character and accent of the two peoples had shades of difference despite the amalgamating effects of a roundabout railway so that though less than twenty miles from the place of her sojourn at trantridge her native village had seemed a faraway spot  the fieldfolk shut in there traded northward and westward travelled courted and married northward and westward thought northward and westward those on this side mainly directed their energies and attention to the east and south  the incline was the same down which durberville had driven her so wildly on that day in june  tess went up the remainder of its length without stopping and on reaching the edge of the escarpment gazed over the familiar green world beyond now halfveiled in mist  it was always beautiful from here it was terribly beautiful to tess today for since her eyes last fell upon it she had learnt that the serpent hisses where the sweet birds sing and her views of life had been totally changed for her by the lesson  verily another girl than the simple one she had been at home was she who bowed by thought stood still here and turned to look behind her she could not bear to look forward into the vale  ascending by the long white road that tess herself had just laboured up she saw a twowheeled vehicle beside which walked a man who held up his hand to attract her attention  she obeyed the signal to wait for him with unspeculative repose and in a few minutes man and horse stopped beside her  why did you slip away by stealth like this said durberville with upbraiding breathlessness on a sunday morning too when people were all in bed  i only discovered it by accident and i have been driving like the deuce to overtake you  just look at the mare  why go off like this  you know that nobody wished to hinder your going and how unnecessary it has been for you to toil along on foot and encumber yourself with this heavy load  i have followed like a madman simply to drive you the rest of the distance if you wont come back  i shant come back said she  i thought you wouldnti said so  well then put up your basket and let me help you on  she listlessly placed her basket and bundle within the dogcart and stepped up and they sat side by side  she had no fear of him now and in the cause of her confidence her sorrow lay  durberville mechanically lit a cigar and the journey was continued with broken unemotional conversation on the commonplace objects by the wayside  he had quite forgotten his struggle to kiss her when in the early summer they had driven in the opposite direction along the same road  but she had not and she sat now like a puppet replying to his remarks in monosyllables  after some miles they came in view of the clump of trees beyond which the village of marlott stood  it was only then that her still face showed the least emotion a tear or two beginning to trickle down  what are you crying for he coldly asked  i was only thinking that i was born over there murmured tess  wellwe must all be born somewhere  i wish i had never been bornthere or anywhere else  pooh  well if you didnt wish to come to trantridge why did you come  she did not reply  you didnt come for love of me that ill swear  tis quite true  if i had gone for love o you if i had ever sincerely loved you if i loved you still i should not so loathe and hate myself for my weakness as i do now   my eyes were dazed by you for a little and that was all  he shrugged his shoulders  she resumed  i didnt understand your meaning till it was too late  thats what every woman says  how can you dare to use such words she cried turning impetuously upon him her eyes flashing as the latent spirit of which he was to see more some day awoke in her  my god  i could knock you out of the gig  did it never strike your mind that what every woman says some women may feel  very well he said laughing i am sorry to wound you  i did wrongi admit it  he dropped into some little bitterness as he continued only you neednt be so everlastingly flinging it in my face  i am ready to pay to the uttermost farthing  you know you need not work in the fields or the dairies again  you know you may clothe yourself with the best instead of in the bald plain way you have lately affected as if you couldnt get a ribbon more than you earn  her lip lifted slightly though there was little scorn as a rule in her large and impulsive nature  i have said i will not take anything more from you and i will noti cannot  i should be your creature to go on doing that and i wont  one would think you were a princess from your manner in addition to a true and original durbervilleha ha  well tess dear i can say no more  i suppose i am a bad fellowa damn bad fellow i was born bad and i have lived bad and i shall die bad in all probability  but upon my lost soul i wont be bad towards you again tess  and if certain circumstances should ariseyou understandin which you are in the least need the least difficulty send me one line and you shall have by return whatever you require i may not be at trantridgei am going to london for a timei cant stand the old woman  but all letters will be forwarded  she said that she did not wish him to drive her further and they stopped just under the clump of trees  durberville alighted and lifted her down bodily in his arms afterwards placing her articles on the ground beside her  she bowed to him slightly her eye just lingering in his and then she turned to take the parcels for departure  alec durberville removed his cigar bent towards her and said  you are not going to turn away like that dear  come  if you wish she answered indifferently  see how youve mastered me  she thereupon turned round and lifted her face to his and remained like a marble term while he imprinted a kiss upon her cheekhalf perfunctorily half as if zest had not yet quite died out  her eyes vaguely rested upon the remotest trees in the lane while the kiss was given as though she were nearly unconscious of what he did  now the other side for old acquaintance sake  she turned her head in the same passive way as one might turn at the request of a sketcher or hairdresser and he kissed the other side his lips touching cheeks that were damp and smoothly chill as the skin of the mushrooms in the fields around  you dont give me your mouth and kiss me back  you never willingly do thatyoull never love me i fear  i have said so often  it is true  i have never really and truly loved you and i think i never can  she added mournfully perhaps of all things a lie on this thing would do the most good to me now but i have honour enough left little as tis not to tell that lie if i did love you i may have the best o causes for letting you know it  but i dont  he emitted a laboured breath as if the scene were getting rather oppressive to his heart or to his conscience or to his gentility  well you are absurdly melancholy tess  i have no reason for flattering you now and i can say plainly that you need not be so sad  you can hold your own for beauty against any woman of these parts gentle or simple i say it to you as a practical man and wellwisher  if you are wise you will show it to the world more than you do before it fades  and yet tess will you come back to me  upon my soul i dont like to let you go like this  never never  i made up my mind as soon as i sawwhat i ought to have seen sooner and i wont come  then good morning my four months cousingoodbye  he leapt up lightly arranged the reins and was gone between the tall redberried hedges  tess did not look after him but slowly wound along the crooked lane it was still early and though the suns lower limb was just free of the hill his rays ungenial and peering addressed the eye rather than the touch as yet  there was not a human soul near  sad october and her sadder self seemed the only two existences haunting that lane  as she walked however some footsteps approached behind her the footsteps of a man and owing to the briskness of his advance he was close at her heels and had said good morning before she had been long aware of his propinquity  he appeared to be an artisan of some sort and carried a tin pot of red paint in his hand  he asked in a businesslike manner if he should take her basket which she permitted him to do walking beside him  it is early to be astir this sabbath morn he said cheerfully  yes said tess  when most people are at rest from their weeks work  she also assented to this  though i do more real work today than all the week besides  do you  all the week i work for the glory of man and on sunday for the glory of god  thats more real than the otherhey  i have a little to do here at this stile  the man turned as he spoke to an opening at the roadside leading into a pasture  if youll wait a moment he added i shall not be long  as he had her basket she could not well do otherwise and she waited observing him  he set down her basket and the tin pot and stirring the paint with the brush that was in it began painting large square letters on the middle board of the three composing the stile placing a comma after each word as if to give pause while that word was driven well home to the readers heart         thy damnation slumbereth not                          2 pet ii 3   against the peaceful landscape the pale decaying tints of the copses the blue air of the horizon and the lichened stileboards these staring vermilion words shone forth  they seemed to shout themselves out and make the atmosphere ring  some people might have cried alas poor theology at the hideous defacementthe last grotesque phase of a creed which had served mankind well in its time but the words entered tess with accusatory horror  it was as if this man had known her recent history yet he was a total stranger  having finished his text he picked up her basket and she mechanically resumed her walk beside him  do you believe what you paint she asked in low tones  believe that tex  do i believe in my own existence  but said she tremulously suppose your sin was not of your own seeking  he shook his head  i cannot split hairs on that burning query he said  i have walked hundreds of miles this past summer painting these texes on every wall gate and stile the length and breadth of this district i leave their application to the hearts of the people who read em  i think they are horrible said tess  crushing  killing  thats what they are meant to be he replied in a trade voice but you should read my hottest onesthem i kips for slums and seaports  theyd make ye wriggle  not but what this is a very good tex for rural districts   ahtheres a nice bit of blank wall up by that barn standing to waste  i must put one thereone that it will be good for dangerous young females like yerself to heed  will ye wait missy  no said she and taking her basket tess trudged on a little way forward she turned her head  the old gray wall began to advertise a similar fiery lettering to the first with a strange and unwonted mien as if distressed at duties it had never before been called upon to perform  it was with a sudden flush that she read and realized what was to be the inscription he was now halfway through         thou shalt not commit   her cheerful friend saw her looking stopped his brush and shouted  if you want to ask for edification on these things of moment theres a very earnest good man going to preach a charitysermon today in the parish you are going tomr clare of emminster  im not of his persuasion now but hes a good man and hell expound as well as any parson i know  twas he began the work in me  but tess did not answer she throbbingly resumed her walk her eyes fixed on the ground  poohi dont believe god said such things she murmured contemptuously when her flush had died away  a plume of smoke soared up suddenly from her fathers chimney the sight of which made her heart ache  the aspect of the interior when she reached it made her heart ache more  her mother who had just come down stairs turned to greet her from the fireplace where she was kindling barkedoak twigs under the breakfast kettle  the young children were still above as was also her father it being sunday morning when he felt justified in lying an additional halfhour  wellmy dear tess exclaimed her surprised mother jumping up and kissing the girl how be ye  i didnt see you till you was in upon me  have you come home to be married  no i have not come for that mother  then for a holiday  yesfor a holiday for a long holiday said tess  what isnt your cousin going to do the handsome thing  hes not my cousin and hes not going to marry me  her mother eyed her narrowly  come you have not told me all she said  then tess went up to her mother put her face upon joans neck and told  and yet thst not got him to marry ee reiterated her mother any woman would have done it but you after that  perhaps any woman would except me  it would have been something like a story to come back with if you had continued mrs durbeyfield ready to burst into tears of vexation  after all the talk about you and him which has reached us here who would have expected it to end like this  why didnt ye think of doing some good for your family instead o thinking only of yourself  see how ive got to teave and slave and your poor weak father with his heart clogged like a drippingpan  i did hope for something to come out o this  to see what a pretty pair you and he made that day when you drove away together four months ago  see what he has given usall as we thought because we were his kin  but if hes not it must have been done because of his love for ee  and yet youve not got him to marry  get alec durberville in the mind to marry her  he marry her  on matrimony he had never once said a word  and what if he had  how a convulsive snatching at social salvation might have impelled her to answer him she could not say  but her poor foolish mother little knew her present feeling towards this man  perhaps it was unusual in the circumstances unlucky unaccountable but there it was and this as she had said was what made her detest herself  she had never wholly cared for him she did not at all care for him now  she had dreaded him winced before him succumbed to adroit advantages he took of her helplessness then temporarily blinded by his ardent manners had been stirred to confused surrender awhile had suddenly despised and disliked him and had run away  that was all  hate him she did not quite but he was dust and ashes to her and even for her names sake she scarcely wished to marry him  you ought to have been more careful if you didnt mean to get him to make you his wife  o mother my mother cried the agonized girl turning passionately upon her parent as if her poor heart would break  how could i be expected to know  i was a child when i left this house four months ago  why didnt you tell me there was danger in menfolk  why didnt you warn me  ladies know what to fend hands against because they read novels that tell them of these tricks but i never had the chance o learning in that way and you did not help me  her mother was subdued  i thought if i spoke of his fond feelings and what they might lead to you would be hontish wi him and lose your chance she murmured wiping her eyes with her apron  well we must make the best of it i suppose  tis nater after all and what do please god    xiii   the event of tess durbeyfields return from the manor of her bogus kinsfolk was rumoured abroad if rumour be not too large a word for a space of a square mile  in the afternoon several young girls of marlott former schoolfellows and acquaintances of tess called to see her arriving dressed in their best starched and ironed as became visitors to a person who had made a transcendent conquest as they supposed and sat round the room looking at her with great curiosity  for the fact that it was this said thirtyfirst cousin mr durberville who had fallen in love with her a gentleman not altogether local whose reputation as a reckless gallant and heartbreaker was beginning to spread beyond the immediate boundaries of trantridge lent tesss supposed position by its fearsomeness a far higher fascination that it would have exercised if unhazardous  their interest was so deep that the younger ones whispered when her back was turned  how pretty she is and how that best frock do set her off  i believe it cost an immense deal and that it was a gift from him  tess who was reaching up to get the teathings from the cornercupboard did not hear these commentaries  if she had heard them she might soon have set her friends right on the matter  but her mother heard and joans simple vanity having been denied the hope of a dashing marriage fed itself as well as it could upon the sensation of a dashing flirtation  upon the whole she felt gratified even though such a limited and evanescent triumph should involve her daughters reputation it might end in marriage yet and in the warmth of her responsiveness to their admiration she invited her visitors to stay to tea  their chatter their laughter their goodhumoured innuendoes above all their flashes and flickerings of envy revived tesss spirits also and as the evening wore on she caught the infection of their excitement and grew almost gay  the marble hardness left her face she moved with something of her old bounding step and flushed in all her young beauty  at moments in spite of thought she would reply to their inquiries with a manner of superiority as if recognizing that her experiences in the field of courtship had indeed been slightly enviable  but so far was she from being in the words of robert south in love with her own ruin that the illusion was transient as lightning cold reason came back to mock her spasmodic weakness the ghastliness of her momentary pride would convict her and recall her to reserved listlessness again  and the despondency of the next mornings dawn when it was no longer sunday but monday and no best clothes and the laughing visitors were gone and she awoke alone in her old bed the innocent younger children breathing softly around her  in place of the excitement of her return and the interest it had inspired she saw before her a long and stony highway which she had to tread without aid and with little sympathy  her depression was then terrible and she could have hidden herself in a tomb  in the course of a few weeks tess revived sufficiently to show herself so far as was necessary to get to church one sunday morning she liked to hear the chantingsuch as it wasand the old psalms and to join in the morning hymn  that innate love of melody which she had inherited from her balladsinging mother gave the simplest music a power over her which could wellnigh drag her heart out of her bosom at times  to be as much out of observation as possible for reasons of her own and to escape the gallantries of the young men she set out before the chiming began and took a back seat under the gallery close to the lumber where only old men and women came and where the bier stood on end among the churchyard tools  parishioners dropped in by twos and threes deposited themselves in rows before her rested threequarters of a minute on their foreheads as if they were praying though they were not then sat up and looked around when the chants came on one of her favourites happened to be chosen among the restthe old double chant langdonbut she did not know what it was called though she would much have liked to know  she thought without exactly wording the thought how strange and godlike was a composers power who from the grave could lead through sequences of emotion which he alone had felt at first a girl like her who had never heard of his name and never would have a clue to his personality  the people who had turned their heads turned them again as the service proceeded and at last observing her they whispered to each other  she knew what their whispers were about grew sick at heart and felt that she could come to church no more  the bedroom which she shared with some of the children formed her retreat more continually than ever  here under her few square yards of thatch she watched winds and snows and rains gorgeous sunsets and successive moons at their full  so close kept she that at length almost everybody thought she had gone away  the only exercise that tess took at this time was after dark and it was then when out in the woods that she seemed least solitary  she knew how to hit to a hairsbreadth that moment of evening when the light and the darkness are so evenly balanced that the constraint of day and the suspense of night neutralize each other leaving absolute mental liberty  it is then that the plight of being alive becomes attenuated to its least possible dimensions  she had no fear of the shadows her sole idea seemed to be to shun mankindor rather that cold accretion called the world which so terrible in the mass is so unformidable even pitiable in its units  on these lonely hills and dales her quiescent glide was of a piece with the element she moved in  her flexuous and stealthy figure became an integral part of the scene  at times her whimsical fancy would intensify natural processes around her till they seemed a part of her own story  rather they became a part of it for the world is only a psychological phenomenon and what they seemed they were  the midnight airs and gusts moaning amongst the tightlywrapped buds and bark of the winter twigs were formulae of bitter reproach  a wet day was the expression of irremediable grief at her weakness in the mind of some vague ethical being whom she could not class definitely as the god of her childhood and could not comprehend as any other  but this encompassment of her own characterization based on shreds of convention peopled by phantoms and voices antipathetic to her was a sorry and mistaken creation of tesss fancya cloud of moral hobgoblins by which she was terrified without reason  it was they that were out of harmony with the actual world not she  walking among the sleeping birds in the hedges watching the skipping rabbits on a moonlit warren or standing under a pheasantladen bough she looked upon herself as a figure of guilt intruding into the haunts of innocence  but all the while she was making a distinction where there was no difference  feeling herself in antagonism she was quite in accord  she had been made to break an accepted social law but no law known to the environment in which she fancied herself such an anomaly    xiv   it was a hazy sunrise in august  the denser nocturnal vapours attacked by the warm beams were dividing and shrinking into isolated fleeces within hollows and coverts where they waited till they should be dried away to nothing  the sun on account of the mist had a curious sentient personal look demanding the masculine pronoun for its adequate expression his present aspect coupled with the lack of all human forms in the scene explained the oldtime heliolatries in a moment  one could feel that a saner religion had never prevailed under the sky  the luminary was a goldenhaired beaming mildeyed godlike creature gazing down in the vigour and intentness of youth upon an earth that was brimming with interest for him  his light a little later broke though chinks of cottage shutters throwing stripes like redhot pokers upon cupboards chests of drawers and other furniture within and awakening harvesters who were not already astir  but of all ruddy things that morning the brightest were two broad arms of painted wood which rose from the margin of yellow cornfield hard by marlott village  they with two others below formed the revolving maltese cross of the reapingmachine which had been brought to the field on the previous evening to be ready for operations this day  the paint with which they were smeared intensified in hue by the sunlight imparted to them a look of having been dipped in liquid fire  the field had already been opened that is to say a lane a few feet wide had been handcut through the wheat along the whole circumference of the field for the first passage of the horses and machine  two groups one of men and lads the other of women had come down the lane just at the hour when the shadows of the eastern hedgetop struck the west hedge midway so that the heads of the groups were enjoying sunrise while their feet were still in the dawn  they disappeared from the lane between the two stone posts which flanked the nearest fieldgate  presently there arose from within a ticking like the lovemaking of the grasshopper  the machine had begun and a moving concatenation of three horses and the aforesaid long rickety machine was visible over the gate a driver sitting  upon one of the hauling horses and an attendant on the seat of the implement  along one side of the field the whole wain went the arms of the mechanical reaper revolving slowly till it passed down the hill quite out of sight in a minute it came up on the other side of the field at the same equable pace the glistening brass star in the forehead of the fore horse first catching the eye as it rose into view over the stubble then the bright arms and then the whole machine  the narrow lane of stubble encompassing the field grew wider with each circuit and the standing corn was reduced to a smaller area as the morning wore on  rabbits hares snakes rats mice retreated inwards as into a fastness unaware of the ephemeral nature of their refuge and of the doom that awaited them later in the day when their covert shrinking to a more and more horrible narrowness they were huddled together friends and foes till the last few yards of upright wheat fell also under the teeth of the unerring reaper and they were every one put to death by the sticks and stones of the harvesters  the reapingmachine left the fallen corn behind it in little heaps each heap being of the quantity for a sheaf and upon these the active binders in the rear laid their handsmainly women but some of them men in print shirts and trousers supported round their waists by leather straps rendering useless the two buttons behind which twinkled and bristled with sunbeams at every movement of each wearer as if they were a pair of eyes in the small of his back  but those of the other sex were the most interesting of this company of binders by reason of the charm which is acquired by woman when she becomes part and parcel of outdoor nature and is not merely an object set down therein as at ordinary times  a fieldman is a personality afield a fieldwoman is a portion of the field she had somehow lost her own margin imbibed the essence of her surrounding and assimilated herself with it  the womenor rather girls for they were mostly youngwore drawn cotton bonnets with great flapping curtains to keep off the sun and gloves to prevent their hands being wounded by the stubble  there was one wearing a pale pink jacket another in a creamcoloured tightsleeved gown another in a petticoat as red as the arms of the reapingmachine and others older in the brownrough wropper or overallthe oldestablished and most appropriate dress of the fieldwoman which the young ones were abandoning  this morning the eye returns involuntarily to the girl in the pink cotton jacket she being the most flexuous and finelydrawn figure of them all  but her bonnet is pulled so far over her brow that none of her face is disclosed while she binds though her complexion may be guessed from a stray twine or two of dark brown hair which extends below the curtain of her bonnet  perhaps one reason why she seduces casual attention is that she never courts it though the other women often gaze around them  her binding proceeds with clocklike monotony  from the sheaf last finished she draws a handful of ears patting their tips with her left palm to bring them even  then stooping low she moves forward gathering the corn with both hands against her knees and pushing her left gloved hand under the bundle to meet the right on the other side holding the corn in an embrace like that of a lover  she brings the ends of the bond together and kneels on the sheaf while she ties it beating back her skirts now and then when lifted by the breeze  a bit of her naked arm is visible between the buff leather of the gauntlet and the sleeve of her gown and as the day wears on its feminine smoothness becomes scarified by the stubble and bleeds  at intervals she stands up to rest and to retie her disarranged apron or to pull her bonnet straight  then one can see the oval face of a handsome young woman with deep dark eyes and long heavy clinging tresses which seem to clasp in a beseeching way anything they fall against  the cheeks are paler the teeth more regular the red lips thinner than is usual in a countrybred girl  it is tess durbeyfield otherwise durberville somewhat changedthe same but not the same at the present stage of her existence living as a stranger and an alien here though it was no strange land that she was in  after a long seclusion she had come to a resolve to undertake outdoor work in her native village the busiest season of the year in the agricultural world having arrived and nothing that she could do within the house being so remunerative for the time as harvesting in the fields  the movements of the other women were more or less similar to tesss the whole bevy of them drawing together like dancers in a quadrille at the completion of a sheaf by each every one placing her sheaf on end against those of the rest till a shock or stitch as it was here called of ten or a dozen was formed  they went to breakfast and came again and the work proceeded as before  as the hour of eleven drew near a person watching her might have noticed that every now and then tesss glance flitted wistfully to the brow of the hill though she did not pause in her sheafing on the verge of the hour the heads of a group of children of ages ranging from six to fourteen rose over the stubbly convexity of the hill  the face of tess flushed slightly but still she did not pause  the eldest of the comers a girl who wore a triangular shawl its corner draggling on the stubble carried in her arms what at first sight seemed to be a doll but proved to be an infant in long clothes  another brought some lunch  the harvesters ceased working took their provisions and sat down against one of the shocks  here they fell to the men plying a stone jar freely and passing round a cup  tess durbeyfield had been one of the last to suspend her labours she sat down at the end of the shock her face turned somewhat away from her companions  when she had deposited herself a man in a rabbitskin cap and with a red handkerchief tucked into his belt held the cup of ale over the top of the shock for her to drink  but she did not accept his offer  as soon as her lunch was spread she called up the big girl her sister and took the baby of her who glad to be relieved of the burden went away to the next shock and joined the other children playing there  tess with a curiously stealthy yet courageous movement and with a still rising colour unfastened her frock and began suckling the child  the men who sat nearest considerately turned their faces towards the other end of the field some of them beginning to smoke one with absentminded fondness regretfully stroking the jar that would no longer yield a stream  all the women but tess fell into animated talk and adjusted the disarranged knots of their hair  when the infant had taken its fill the young mother sat it upright in her lap and looking into the far distance dandled it with a gloomy indifference that was almost dislike then all of a sudden she fell to violently kissing it some dozens of times as if she could never leave off the child crying at the vehemence of an onset which strangely combined passionateness with contempt  shes fond of that there child though she mid pretend to hate en and say she wishes the baby and her too were in the churchyard observed the woman in the red petticoat  shell soon leave off saying that replied the one in buff lord tis wonderful what a body can get used to o that sort in time  a little more than persuading had to do wi the coming ot i reckon  there were they that heard a sobbing one night last year in the chase and it mid ha gone hard wi a certain party if folks had come along  well a little more or a little less twas a thousand pities that it should have happened to she of all others  but tis always the comeliest  the plain ones be as safe as churcheshey jenny  the speaker turned to one of the group who certainly was not illdefined as plain  it was a thousand pities indeed it was impossible for even an enemy to feel otherwise on looking at tess as she sat there with her flowerlike mouth and large tender eyes neither black nor blue nor grey nor violet rather all those shades together and a hundred others which could be seen if one looked into their irisesshade behind shadetint beyond tintaround pupils that had no bottom an almost standard woman but for the slight incautiousness of character inherited from her race  a resolution which had surprised herself had brought her into the fields this week for the first time during many months  after wearing and wasting her palpitating heart with every engine of regret that lonely inexperience could devise common sense had illuminated her  she felt that she would do well to be useful againto taste anew sweet independence at any price  the past was past whatever it had been it was no more at hand  whatever its consequences time would close over them they would all in a few years be as if they had never been and she herself grassed down and forgotten meanwhile the trees were just as green as before the birds sang and the sun shone as clearly now as ever  the familiar surroundings had not darkened because of her grief nor sickened because of her pain  she might have seen that what had bowed her head so profoundlythe thought of the worlds concern at her situationwas founded on an illusion  she was not an existence an experience a passion a structure of sensations to anybody but herself  to all humankind besides tess was only a passing thought  even to friends she was no more than a frequently passing thought  if she made herself miserable the livelong night and day it was only this much to themah she makes herself unhappy  if she tried to be cheerful to dismiss all care to take pleasure in the daylight the flowers the baby she could only be this idea to themah she bears it very well  moreover alone in a desert island would she have been wretched at what had happened to her  not greatly  if she could have been but just created to discover herself as a spouseless mother with no experience of life except as the parent of a nameless child would the position have caused her to despair  no she would have taken it calmly and found pleasure therein most of the misery had been generated by her conventional aspect and not by her innate sensations  whatever tesss reasoning some spirit had induced her to dress herself up neatly as she had formerly done and come out into the fields harvesthands being greatly in demand just then  this was why she had borne herself with dignity and had looked people calmly in the face at times even when holding the baby in her arms  the harvestmen rose from the shock of corn and stretched their limbs and extinguished their pipes  the horses which had been unharnessed and fed were again attached to the scarlet machine tess having quickly eaten her own meal beckoned to her eldest sister to come and take away the baby fastened her dress put on the buff gloves again and stooped anew to draw a bond from the last completed sheaf for the tying of the next  in the afternoon and evening the proceedings of the morning were continued tess staying on till dusk with the body of harvesters then they all rode home in one of the largest wagons in the company of a broad tarnished moon that had risen from the ground to the eastwards its face resembling the outworn goldleaf halo of some wormeaten tuscan saint  tesss female companions sang songs and showed themselves very sympathetic and glad at her reappearance out of doors though they could not refrain from mischievously throwing in a few verses of the ballad about the maid who went to the merry green wood and came back a changed state  there are counterpoises and compensations in life and the event which had made of her a social warning had also for the moment made her the most interesting personage in the village to many  their friendliness won her still farther away from herself their lively spirits were contagious and she became almost gay  but now that her moral sorrows were passing away a fresh one arose on the natural side of her which knew no social law  when she reached home it was to learn to her grief that the baby had been suddenly taken ill since the afternoon  some such collapse had been probable so tender and puny was its frame but the event came as a shock nevertheless  the babys offence against society in coming into the world was forgotten by the girlmother her souls desire was to continue that offence by preserving the life of the child  however it soon grew clear that the hour of emancipation for that little prisoner of the flesh was to arrive earlier than her worst misgiving had conjectured and when she had discovered this she was plunged into a misery which transcended that of the childs simple loss  her baby had not been baptized  tess had drifted into a frame of mind which accepted passively the consideration that if she should have to burn for what she had done burn she must and there was an end of it  like all village girls she was well grounded in the holy scriptures and had dutifully studied the histories of aholah and aholibah and knew the inferences to be drawn therefrom  but when the same question arose with regard to the baby it had a very different colour  her darling was about to die and no salvation  it was nearly bedtime but she rushed downstairs and asked if she might send for the parson  the moment happened to be one at which her fathers sense of the antique nobility of his family was highest and his sensitiveness to the smudge which tess had set upon that nobility most pronounced for he had just returned from his weekly booze at rollivers inn  no parson should come inside his door he declared prying into his affairs just then when by her shame it had become more necessary than ever to hide them  he locked the door and put the key in his pocket  the household went to bed and distressed beyond measure tess retired also  she was continually waking as she lay and in the middle of the night found that the baby was still worse  it was obviously dyingquietly and painlessly but none the less surely  in her misery she rocked herself upon the bed  the clock struck the solemn hour of one that hour when fancy stalks outside reason and malignant possibilities stand rockfirm as facts  she thought of the child consigned to the nethermost corner of hell as its double doom for lack of baptism and lack of legitimacy saw the archfiend tossing it with his threepronged fork like the one they used for heating the oven on baking days to which picture she added many other quaint and curious details of torment sometimes taught the young in this christian country  the lurid presentment so powerfully affected her imagination in the silence of the sleeping house that her nightgown became damp with perspiration and the bedstead shook with each throb of her heart  the infants breathing grew more difficult and the mothers mental tension increased  it was useless to devour the little thing with kisses she could stay in bed no longer and walked feverishly about the room  o merciful god have pity have pity upon my poor baby she cried heap as much anger as you want to upon me and welcome but pity the child  she leant against the chest of drawers and murmured incoherent supplications for a long while till she suddenly started up  ah perhaps baby can be saved  perhaps it will be just the same  she spoke so brightly that it seemed as though her face might have shone in the gloom surrounding her  she lit a candle and went to a second and a third bed under the wall where she awoke her young sisters and brothers all of whom occupied the same room  pulling out the washingstand so that she could get behind it she poured some water from a jug and made them kneel around putting their hands together with fingers exactly vertical  while the children scarcely awake awestricken at her manner their eyes growing larger and larger remained in this position she took the baby from her beda childs childso immature as scarce to seem a sufficient personality to endow its producer with the maternal title  tess then stood erect with the infant on her arm beside the basin the next sister held the prayerbook open before her as the clerk at church held it before the parson and thus the girl set about baptizing her child  her figure looked singularly tall and imposing as she stood in her long white nightgown a thick cable of twisted dark hair hanging straight down her back to her waist  the kindly dimness of the weak candle abstracted from her form and features the little blemishes which sunlight might have revealedthe stubble scratches upon her wrists and the weariness of her eyesher high enthusiasm having a transfiguring effect upon the face which had been her undoing showing it as a thing of immaculate beauty with a touch of dignity which was almost regal  the little ones kneeling round their sleepy eyes blinking and red awaited her preparations full of a suspended wonder which their physical heaviness at that hour would not allow to become active  the most impressed of them said  be you really going to christen him tess  the girlmother replied in a grave affirmative  whats his name going to be  she had not thought of that but a name suggested by a phrase in the book of genesis came into her head as she proceeded with the baptismal service and now she pronounced it  sorrow i baptize thee in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost  she sprinkled the water and there was silence  say amen children  the tiny voices piped in obedient response amen  tess went on  we receive this childand so forthand do sign him with the sign of the cross  here she dipped her hand into the basin and fervently drew an immense cross upon the baby with her forefinger continuing with the customary sentences as to his manfully fighting against sin the world and the devil and being a faithful soldier and servant unto his lifes end  she duly went on with the lords prayer the children lisping it after her in a thin gnatlike wail till at the conclusion raising their voices to clerks pitch they again piped into silence amen  then their sister with much augmented confidence in the efficacy of the sacrament poured forth from the bottom of her heart the thanksgiving that follows uttering it boldly and triumphantly in the stoptdiapason note which her voice acquired when her heart was in her speech and which will never be forgotten by those who knew her the ecstasy of faith almost apotheosized her it set upon her face a glowing irradiation and brought a red spot into the middle of each cheek while the miniature candleflame inverted in her eyepupils shone like a diamond  the children gazed up at her with more and more reverence and no longer had a will for questioning  she did not look like sissy to them now but as a being large towering and awfula divine personage with whom they had nothing in common  poor sorrows campaign against sin the world and the devil was doomed to be of limited brilliancyluckily perhaps for himself considering his beginnings  in the blue of the morning that fragile soldier and servant breathed his last and when the other children awoke they cried bitterly and begged sissy to have another pretty baby  the calmness which had possessed tess since the christening remained with her in the infants loss  in the daylight indeed she felt her terrors about his soul to have been somewhat exaggerated whether well founded or not she had no uneasiness now reasoning that if providence would not ratify such an act of approximation she for one did not value the kind of heaven lost by the irregularityeither for herself or for her child  so passed away sorrow the undesiredthat intrusive creature that bastard gift of shameless nature who respects not the social law a waif to whom eternal time had been a matter of days merely who knew not that such things as years and centuries ever were to whom the cottage interior was the universe the weeks weather climate newborn babyhood human existence and the instinct to suck human knowledge  tess who mused on the christening a good deal wondered if it were doctrinally sufficient to secure a christian burial for the child nobody could tell this but the parson of the parish and he was a newcomer and did not know her  she went to his house after dusk and stood by the gate but could not summon courage to go in  the enterprise would have been abandoned if she had not by accident met him coming homeward as she turned away  in the gloom she did not mind speaking freely  i should like to ask you something sir  he expressed his willingness to listen and she told the story of the babys illness and the extemporized ordinance  and now sir she added earnestly can you tell me thiswill it be just the same for him as if you had baptized him  having the natural feelings of a tradesman at finding that a job he should have been called in for had been unskilfully botched by his customers among themselves he was disposed to say no  yet the dignity of the girl the strange tenderness in her voice combined to affect his nobler impulsesor rather those that he had left in him after ten years of endeavour to graft technical belief on actual scepticism  the man and the ecclesiastic fought within him and the victory fell to the man  my dear girl he said it will be just the same  then will you give him a christian burial she asked quickly  the vicar felt himself cornered hearing of the babys illness he had conscientiously gone to the house after nightfall to perform the rite and unaware that the refusal to admit him had come from tesss father and not from tess he could not allow the plea of necessity for its irregular administration  ahthats another matter he said  another matterwhy asked tess rather warmly  welli would willingly do so if only we two were concerned  but i must notfor certain reasons  just for once sir  really i must not  o sir  she seized his hand as she spoke  he withdrew it shaking his head  then i dont like you she burst out and ill never come to your church no more  dont talk so rashly  perhaps it will be just the same to him if you dont   will it be just the same  dont for gods sake speak as saint to sinner but as you yourself to me myselfpoor me  how the vicar reconciled his answer with the strict notions he supposed himself to hold on these subjects it is beyond a laymans power to tell though not to excuse  somewhat moved he said in this case also  it will be just the same  so the baby was carried in a small deal box under an ancient womans shawl to the churchyard that night and buried by lanternlight at the cost of a shilling and a pint of beer to the sexton in that shabby corner of gods allotment where he lets the nettles grow and where all unbaptized infants notorious drunkards suicides and others of the conjecturally damned are laid  in spite of the untoward surroundings however tess bravely made a little cross of two laths and a piece of string and having bound it with flowers she stuck it up at the head of the grave one evening when she could enter the churchyard without being seen putting at the foot also a bunch of the same flowers in a little jar of water to keep them alive  what matter was it that on the outside of the jar the eye of mere observation noted the words keelwells marmalade  the eye of maternal affection did not see them in its vision of higher things    xv   by experience says roger ascham we find out a short way by a long wandering  not seldom that long wandering unfits us for further travel and of what use is our experience to us then  tess durbeyfields experience was of this incapacitating kind  at last she had learned what to do but who would now accept her doing  if before going to the durbervilles she had vigorously moved under the guidance of sundry gnomic texts and phrases known to her and to the world in general no doubt she would never have been imposed on but it had not been in tesss powernor is it in anybodys powerto feel the whole truth of golden opinions while it is possible to profit by them  sheand how many moremight have ironically said to god with saint augustine thou hast counselled a better course than thou hast permitted  she remained at her fathers house during the winter months plucking fowls or cramming turkeys and geese or making clothes for her sisters and brothers out of some finery which durberville had given her and she had put by with contempt  apply to him she would not but she would often clasp her hands behind her head and muse when she was supposed to be working hard  she philosophically noted dates as they came past in the revolution of the year the disastrous night of her undoing at trantridge with its dark background of the chase also the dates of the babys birth and death also her own birthday and every other day individualized by incidents in which she had taken some share  she suddenly thought one afternoon when looking in the glass at her fairness that there was yet another date of greater importance to her than those that of her own death when all these charms would have disappeared a day which lay sly and unseen among all the other days of the year giving no sign or sound when she annually passed over it but not the less surely there  when was it  why did she not feel the chill of each yearly encounter with such a cold relation  she had jeremy taylors thought that some time in the future those who had known her would say it is the th the day that poor tess durbeyfield died and there would be nothing singular to their minds in the statement  of that day doomed to be her terminus in time through all the ages she did not know the place in month week season or year  almost at a leap tess thus changed from simple girl to complex woman symbols of reflectiveness passed into her face and a note of tragedy at times into her voice  her eyes grew larger and more eloquent she became what would have been called a fine creature her aspect was fair and arresting her soul that of a woman whom the turbulent experiences of the last year or two had quite failed to demoralize but for the worlds opinion those experiences would have been simply a liberal education  she had held so aloof of late that her trouble never generally known was nearly forgotten in marlott  but it became evident to her that she could never be really comfortable again in a place which had seen the collapse of her familys attempt to claim kinand through her even closer unionwith the rich durbervilles  at least she could not be comfortable there till long years should have obliterated her keen consciousness of it  yet even now tess felt the pulse of hopeful life still warm within her she might be happy in some nook which had no memories  to escape the past and all that appertained thereto was to annihilate it and to do that she would have to get away  was once lost always lost really true of chastity she would ask herself  she might prove it false if she could veil bygones  the recuperative power which pervaded organic nature was surely not denied to maidenhood alone  she waited a long time without finding opportunity for a new departure  a particularly fine spring came round and the stir of germination was almost audible in the buds it moved her as it moved the wild animals and made her passionate to go  at last one day in early may a letter reached her from a former friend of her mothers to whom she had addressed inquiries long beforea person whom she had never seenthat a skilful milkmaid was required at a dairyhouse many miles to the southward and that the dairyman would be glad to have her for the summer months  it was not quite so far off as could have been wished but it was probably far enough her radius of movement and repute having been so small  to persons of limited spheres miles are as geographical degrees parishes as counties counties as provinces and kingdoms  on one point she was resolved there should be no more durberville aircastles in the dreams and deeds of her new life  she would be the dairymaid tess and nothing more  her mother knew tesss feeling on this point so well though no words had passed between them on the subject that she never alluded to the knightly ancestry now  yet such is human inconsistency that one of the interests of the new place to her was the accidental virtues of its lying near her forefathers country for they were not blakemore men though her mother was blakemore to the bone  the dairy called talbothays for which she was bound stood not remotely from some of the former estates of the durbervilles near the great family vaults of her granddames and their powerful husbands  she would be able to look at them and think not only that durberville like babylon had fallen but that the individual innocence of a humble descendant could lapse as silently  all the while she wondered if any strange good thing might come of her being in her ancestral land and some spirit within her rose  automatically as the sap in the twigs  it was unexpected youth surging up anew after its temporary check and bringing with it hope and the invincible instinct towards selfdelight   end of phase the second      phase the third the rally    xvi   on a thymescented birdhatching morning in may between two and three years after the return from trantridgesilent reconstructive years for tess durbeyfieldshe left her home for the second time  having packed up her luggage so that it could be sent to her later she started in a hired trap for the little town of stourcastle through which it was necessary to pass on her journey now in a direction almost opposite to that of her first adventuring  on the curve of the nearest hill she looked back regretfully at marlott and her fathers house although she had been so anxious to get away  her kindred dwelling there would probably continue their daily lives as heretofore with no great diminution of pleasure in their consciousness although she would be far off and they deprived of her smile  in a few days the children would engage in their games as merrily as ever without the sense of any gap left by her departure this leaving of the younger children she had decided to be for the best were she to remain they would probably gain less good by her precepts than harm by her example  she went through stourcastle without pausing and onward to a junction of highways where she could await a carriers van that ran to the southwest for the railways which engirdled this interior tract of country had never yet struck across it  while waiting however there came along a farmer in his spring cart driving approximately in the direction that she wished to pursue  though he was a stranger to her she accepted his offer of a seat beside him ignoring that its motive was a mere tribute to her countenance  he was going to weatherbury and by accompanying him thither she could walk the remainder of the distance instead of travelling in the van by way of casterbridge  tess did not stop at weatherbury after this long drive further than to make a slight nondescript meal at noon at a cottage to which the farmer recommended her  thence she started on foot basket in hand to reach the wide upland of heath dividing this district from the lowlying meads of a further valley in which the dairy stood that was the aim and end of her days pilgrimage  tess had never before visited this part of the country and yet she felt akin to the landscape  not so very far to the left of her she could discern a dark patch in the scenery which inquiry confirmed her in supposing to be trees marking the environs of kingsberein the church of which parish the bones of her ancestorsher useless ancestorslay entombed  she had no admiration for them now she almost hated them for the dance they had led her not a thing of all that had been theirs did she retain but the old seal and spoon  poohi have as much of mother as father in me she said  all my prettiness comes from her and she was only a dairymaid  the journey over the intervening uplands and lowlands of egdon when she reached them was a more troublesome walk than she had anticipated the distance being actually but a few miles  it was two hours owing to sundry wrong turnings ere she found herself on a summit commanding the longsoughtfor vale the valley of the great dairies the valley in which milk and butter grew to rankness and were produced more profusely if less delicately than at her homethe verdant plain so well watered by the river var or froom  it was intrinsically different from the vale of little dairies blackmoor vale which save during her disastrous sojourn at trantridge she had exclusively known till now  the world was drawn to a larger pattern here  the enclosures numbered fifty acres instead of ten the farmsteads were more extended the groups of cattle formed tribes hereabout there only families  these myriads of cows stretching under her eyes from the far east to the far west outnumbered any she had ever seen at one glance before the green lea was speckled as thickly with them as a canvas by van alsloot or sallaert with burghers  the ripe hue of the red and dun kine absorbed the evening sunlight which the whitecoated animals returned to the eye in rays almost dazzling even at the distant elevation on which she stood  the birdseye perspective before her was not so luxuriantly beautiful perhaps as that other one which she knew so well yet it was more cheering  it lacked the intensely blue atmosphere of the rival vale and its heavy soils and scents the new air was clear bracing ethereal  the river itself which nourished the grass and cows of these renowned dairies flowed not like the streams in blackmoor  those were slow silent often turbid flowing over beds of mud into which the incautious wader might sink and vanish unawares  the froom waters were clear as the pure river of life shown to the evangelist rapid as the shadow of a cloud with pebbly shallows that prattled to the sky all day long  there the waterflower was the lily the crowfoot here  either the change in the quality of the air from heavy to light or the sense of being amid new scenes where there were no invidious eyes upon her sent up her spirits wonderfully  her hopes mingled with the sunshine in an ideal photosphere which surrounded her as she bounded along against the soft south wind  she heard a pleasant voice in every breeze and in every birds note seemed to lurk a joy  her face had latterly changed with changing states of mind continually fluctuating between beauty and ordinariness according as the thoughts were gay or grave  one day she was pink and flawless another pale and tragical  when she was pink she was feeling less than when pale her more perfect beauty accorded with her less elevated mood her more intense mood with her less perfect beauty it was her best face physically that was now set against the south wind  the irresistible universal automatic tendency to find sweet pleasure somewhere which pervades all life from the meanest to the highest had at length mastered tess  being even now only a young woman of twenty one who mentally and sentimentally had not finished growing it was impossible that any event should have left upon her an impression that was not in time capable of transmutation  and thus her spirits and her thankfulness and her hopes rose higher and higher  she tried several ballads but found them inadequate till recollecting the psalter that her eyes had so often wandered over of a sunday morning before she had eaten of the tree of knowledge she chanted o ye sun and moon  o ye stars  ye green things upon the earth  ye fowls of the air  beasts and cattle  children of men  bless ye the lord praise him and magnify him for ever  she suddenly stopped and murmured but perhaps i dont quite know the lord as yet  and probably the halfunconscious rhapsody was a fetishistic utterance in a monotheistic setting women whose chief companions are the forms and forces of outdoor nature retain in their souls far more of the pagan fantasy of their remote forefathers than of the systematized religion taught their race at later date  however tess found at least approximate expression for her feelings in the old benedicite that she had lisped from infancy and it was enough such high contentment with such a slight initial performance as that of having started towards a means of independent living was a part of the durbeyfield temperament  tess really wished to walk uprightly while her father did nothing of the kind but she resembled him in being content with immediate and small achievements and in having no mind for laborious effort towards such petty social advancement as could alone be effected by a family so heavily handicapped as the once powerful durbervilles were now  there was it might be said the energy of her mothers unexpended family as well as the natural energy of tesss years rekindled after the experience which had so overwhelmed her for the time let the truth be toldwomen do as a rule live through such humiliations and regain their spirits and again look about them with an interested eye  while theres life theres hope is a conviction not so entirely unknown to the betrayed as some amiable theorists would have us believe  tess durbeyfield then in good heart and full of zest for life descended the egdon slopes lower and lower towards the dairy of her pilgrimage  the marked difference in the final particular between the rival vales now showed itself  the secret of blackmoor was best discovered from the heights around to read aright the valley before her it was necessary to descend into its midst  when tess had accomplished this feat she found herself to be standing on a carpeted level which stretched to the east and west as far as the eye could reach  the river had stolen from the higher tracts and brought in particles to the vale all this horizontal land and now exhausted aged and attenuated lay serpentining along through the midst of its former spoils  not quite sure of her direction tess stood still upon the hemmed expanse of verdant flatness like a fly on a billiardtable of indefinite length and of no more consequence to the surroundings than that fly  the sole effect of her presence upon the placid valley so far had been to excite the mind of a solitary heron which after descending to the ground not far from her path stood with neck erect looking at her  suddenly there arose from all parts of the lowland a prolonged and repeated callwaow waow waow  from the furthest east to the furthest west the cries spread as if by contagion accompanied in some cases by the barking of a dog  it was not the expression of the valleys consciousness that beautiful tess had arrived but the ordinary announcement of milkingtimehalfpast four oclock when the dairymen set about getting in the cows  the red and white herd nearest at hand which had been phlegmatically waiting for the call now trooped towards the steading in the background their great bags of milk swinging under them as they walked  tess followed slowly in their rear and entered the barton by the open gate through which they had entered before her  long thatched sheds stretched round the enclosure their slopes encrusted with vivid green moss and their eaves supported by wooden posts rubbed to a glossy smoothness by the flanks of infinite cows and calves of bygone years now passed to an oblivion almost inconceivable in its profundity  between the post were ranged the milchers each exhibiting herself at the present moment to a whimsical eye in the rear as a circle on two stalks down the centre of which a switch moved pendulumwise while the sun lowering itself behind this patient row threw their shadows accurately inwards upon the wall  thus it threw shadows of these obscure and homely figures every evening with as much care over each contour as if it had been the profile of a court beauty on a palace wall copied them as diligently as it had copied olympian shapes on marble façades long ago or the outline of alexander caesar and the pharaohs  they were the less restful cows that were stalled  those that would stand still of their own will were milked in the middle of the yard where many of such better behaved ones stood waiting nowall prime milchers such as were seldom seen out of this valley and not always within it nourished by the succulent feed which the watermeads supplied at this prime season of the year  those of them that were spotted with white reflected the sunshine in dazzling brilliancy and the polished brass knobs of their horns glittered with something of military display  their largeveined udders hung ponderous as sandbags the teats sticking out like the legs of a gipsys crock and as each animal lingered for her turn to arrive the milk oozed forth and fell in drops to the ground    xvii   the dairymaids and men had flocked down from their cottages and out of the dairyhouse with the arrival of the cows from the meads the maids walking in pattens not on account of the weather but to keep their shoes above the mulch of the barton  each girl sat down on her threelegged stool her face sideways her right cheek resting against the cow and looked musingly along the animals flank at tess as she approached  the male milkers with hatbrims turned down resting flat on their foreheads and gazing on the ground did not observe her  one of these was a sturdy middleaged manwhose long white pinner was somewhat finer and cleaner than the wraps of the others and whose jacket underneath had a presentable marketing aspectthe masterdairyman of whom she was in quest his double character as a working milker and butter maker here during six days and on the seventh as a man in shining broadcloth in his family pew at church being so marked as to have inspired a rhyme                dairyman dick              all the week      on sundays mister richard crick   seeing tess standing at gaze he went across to her  the majority of dairymen have a cross manner at milking time but it happened that mr crick was glad to get a new handfor the days were busy ones nowand he received her warmly inquiring for her mother and the rest of the familythough this as a matter of form merely for in reality he had not been aware of mrs durbeyfields existence till apprised of the fact by a brief businessletter about tess  ohay as a lad i knowed your part o the country very well he said terminatively  though ive never been there since  and a aged woman of ninety that use to live nigh here but is dead and gone long ago told me that a family of some such name as yours in blackmoor vale came originally from these parts and that twere a old ancient race that had all but perished off the earththough the new generations didnt know it  but lord i took no notice of the old womans ramblings not i  oh noit is nothing said tess  then the talk was of business only  you can milk em clean my maidy i dont want my cows going azew at this time o year  she reassured him on that point and he surveyed her up and down she had been staying indoors a good deal and her complexion had grown delicate  quite sure you can stand it  tis comfortable enough here for rough folk but we dont live in a cowcumber frame  she declared that she could stand it and her zest and willingness seemed to win him over  well i suppose youll want a dish o tay or victuals of some sort hey  not yet  well do as ye like about it  but faith if twas i i should be as dry as a kex wi travelling so far  ill begin milking now to get my hand in said tess  she drank a little milk as temporary refreshmentto the surpriseindeed slight contemptof dairyman crick to whose mind it had apparently never occurred that milk was good as a beverage  oh if ye can swaller that be it so he said indifferently while holding up the pail that she sipped from  tis what i haint touched for yearsnot i  rot the stuff it would lie in my innerds like lead  you can try your hand upon she he pursued nodding to the nearest cow  not but what she do milk rather hard  weve hard ones and weve easy ones like other folks  however youll find out that soon enough  when tess had changed her bonnet for a hood and was really on her stool under the cow and the milk was squirting from her fists into the pail she appeared to feel that she really had laid a new foundation for her future  the conviction bred serenity her pulse slowed and she was able to look about her  the milkers formed quite a little battalion of men and maids the men operating on the hardteated animals the maids on the kindlier natures  it was a large dairy  there were nearly a hundred milchers under cricks management all told and of the herd the masterdairyman milked six or eight with his own hands unless away from home  these were the cows that milked hardest of all for his journeymilkmen being more or less casually hired he would not entrust this halfdozen to their treatment lest from indifference they should not milk them fully nor to the maids lest they should fail in the same way for lack of fingergrip with the result that in course of time the cows would go azewthat is dry up  it was not the loss for the moment that made slack milking so serious but that with the decline of demand there came decline and ultimately cessation of supply  after tess had settled down to her cow there was for a time no talk in the barton and not a sound interfered with the purr of the milkjets into the numerous pails except a momentary exclamation to one or other of the beasts requesting her to turn round or stand still the only movements were those of the milkers hands up and down and the swing of the cows tails  thus they all worked on encompassed by the vast flat mead which extended to either slope of the valleya level landscape compounded of old landscapes long forgotten and no doubt differing in character very greatly from the landscape they composed now  to my thinking said the dairyman rising suddenly from a cow he had just finished off snatching up his threelegged stool in one hand and the pail in the other and moving on to the next hardyielder in his vicinity to my thinking the cows dont gie down their milk today as usual  upon my life if winker do begin keeping back like this shell not be worth going under by midsummer  tis because theres a new hand come among us said jonathan kail ive noticed such things afore  to be sure  it may be so  i didnt think ot  ive been told that it goes up into their horns at such times said a dairymaid  well as to going up into their horns replied dairyman crick dubiously as though even witchcraft might be limited by anatomical possibilities i couldnt say i certainly could not  but as nott cows will keep it back as well as the horned ones i dont quite agree to it  do ye know that riddle about the nott cows jonathan why do nott cows give less milk in a year than horned  i dont interposed the milkmaid why do they  because there baint so many of em said the dairyman howsomever these gamsters do certainly keep back their milk today  folks we must lift up a stave or twothats the only cure fort  songs were often resorted to in dairies hereabout as an enticement to the cows when they showed signs of withholding their usual yield and the band of milkers at this request burst into melodyin purely businesslike tones it is true and with no great spontaneity the result according to their own belief being a decided improvement during the songs continuance  when they had gone through fourteen or fifteen verses of a cheerful ballad about a murderer who was afraid to go to bed in the dark because he saw certain brimstone flames around him one of the male milkers said  i wish singing on the stoop didnt use up so much of a mans wind you should get your harp sir not but what a fiddle is best  tess who had given ear to this thought the words were addressed to the dairyman but she was wrong  a reply in the shape of why came as it were out of the belly of a dun cow in the stalls it had been spoken by a milker behind the animal whom she had not hitherto perceived  oh yes theres nothing like a fiddle said the dairyman though i do think that bulls are more moved by a tune than cowsat least thats my experience  once there was an old aged man over at mellstockwilliam dewy by nameone of the family that used to do a good deal of business as tranters over therejonathan do ye mindi knowed the man by sight as well as i know my own brother in a manner of speaking  well this man was a coming home along from a wedding where he had been playing his fiddle one fine moonlight night and for shortness sake he took a cut across fortyacres a field lying that way where a bull was out to grass  the bull seed william and took after him horns aground begad and though william runned his best and hadnt much drink in him considering twas a wedding and the folks well off he found hed never reach the fence and get over in time to save himself  well as a last thought he pulled out his fiddle as he runned and struck up a jig turning to the bull and backing towards the corner  the bull softened down and stood still looking hard at william dewy who fiddled on and on till a sort of a smile stole over the bulls face  but no sooner did william stop his playing and turn to get over hedge than the bull would stop his smiling and lower his horns towards the seat of williams breeches  well william had to turn about and play on willynilly and twas only three oclock in the world and a knowed that nobody would come that way for hours and he so leery and tired that a didnt know what to do  when he had scraped till about four oclock he felt that he verily would have to give over soon and he said to himself theres only this last tune between me and eternal welfare heaven save me or im a done man  well then he called to mind how hed seen the cattle kneel o christmas eves in the dead o night  it was not christmas eve then but it came into his head to play a trick upon the bull  so he broke into the tivity hymm just as at christmas carolsinging when lo and behold down went the bull on his bended knees in his ignorance just as if twere the true tivity night and hour  as soon as his horned friend were down william turned clinked off like a longdog and jumped safe over hedge before the praying bull had got on his feet again to take after him  william used to say that hed seen a man look a fool a good many times but never such a fool as that bull looked when he found his pious feelings had been played upon and twas not christmas eve   yes william dewy that was the mans name and i can tell you to a foot wheres he alying in mellstock churchyard at this very momentjust between the second yewtree and the north aisle  its a curious story it carries us back to medieval times when faith was a living thing  the remark singular for a dairyyard was murmured by the voice behind the dun cow but as nobody understood the reference no notice was taken except that the narrator seemed to think it might imply scepticism as to his tale  well tis quite true sir whether or no  i knowed the man well  oh yes i have no doubt of it said the person behind the dun cow  tesss attention was thus attracted to the dairymans interlocutor of whom she could see but the merest patch owing to his burying his head so persistently in the flank of the milcher  she could not understand why he should be addressed as sir even by the dairyman himself  but no explanation was discernible he remained under the cow long enough to have milked three uttering a private ejaculation now and then as if he could not get on  take it gentle sir take it gentle said the dairyman  tis knack not strength that does it  so i find said the other standing up at last and stretching his arms  i think i have finished her however though she made my fingers ache  tess could then see him at full length  he wore the ordinary white pinner and leather leggings of a dairyfarmer when milking and his boots were clogged with the mulch of the yard but this was all his local livery  beneath it was something educated reserved subtle sad differing  but the details of his aspect were temporarily thrust aside by the discovery that he was one whom she had seen before  such vicissitudes had tess passed through since that time that for a moment she could not remember where she had met him and then it flashed upon her that he was the pedestrian who had joined in the clubdance at marlottthe passing stranger who had come she knew not whence had danced with others but not with her and slightingly left her and gone on his way with his friends  the flood of memories brought back by this revival of an incident anterior to her troubles produced a momentary dismay lest recognizing her also he should by some means discover her story but it passed away when she found no sign of remembrance in him  she saw by degrees that since their first and only encounter his mobile face had grown more thoughtful and had acquired a young mans shapely moustache and beardthe latter of the palest straw colour where it began upon his cheeks and deepening to a warm brown farther from its root  under his linen milkingpinner he wore a dark velveteen jacket cord breeches and gaiters and a starched white shirt  without the milkinggear nobody could have guessed what he was  he might with equal probability have been an eccentric landowner or a gentlemanly ploughman  that he was but a novice at dairy work she had realized in a moment from the time he had spent upon the milking of one cow  meanwhile many of the milkmaids had said to one another of the newcomer how pretty she is with something of real generosity and admiration though with a half hope that the auditors would qualify the assertionwhich strictly speaking they might have done prettiness being an inexact definition of what struck the eye in tess  when the milking was finished for the evening they straggled indoors where mrs crick the dairymans wifewho was too respectable to go out milking herself and wore a hot stuff gown in warm weather because the dairymaids wore printswas giving an eye to the leads and things  only two or three of the maids tess learnt slept in the dairyhouse besides herself most of the helpers going to their homes  she saw nothing at suppertime of the superior milker who had commented on the story and asked no questions about him the remainder of the evening being occupied in arranging her place in the bedchamber it was a large room over the milkhouse some thirty feet long the sleepingcots of the other three indoor milkmaids being in the same apartment  they were blooming young women and except one rather older than herself  by bedtime tess was thoroughly tired and fell asleep immediately  but one of the girls who occupied an adjoining bed was more wakeful than tess and would insist upon relating to the latter various particulars of the homestead into which she had just entered  the girls whispered words mingled with the shades and to tesss drowsy mind they seemed to be generated by the darkness in which they floated  mr angel clarehe that is learning milking and that plays the harpnever says much to us  he is a pasons son and is too much taken up wi his own thoughts to notice girls  he is the dairymans pupillearning farming in all its branches  he has learnt sheepfarming at another place and hes now mastering dairywork  yes he is quite the gentlemanborn  his father is the reverent mr clare at emminstera good many miles from here  ohi have heard of him said her companion now awake  a very earnest clergyman is he not  yesthat he isthe earnestest man in all wessex they saythe last of the old low church sort they tell mefor all about here be what they call high  all his sons except our mr clare be made pasons too  tess had not at this hour the curiosity to ask why the present mr clare was not made a parson like his brethren and gradually fell asleep again the words of her informant coming to her along with the smell of the cheeses in the adjoining cheeseloft and the measured dripping of the whey from the wrings downstairs    xviii   angel clare rises out of the past not altogether as a distinct figure but as an appreciative voice a long regard of fixed abstracted eyes and a mobility of mouth somewhat too small and delicately lined for a mans though with an unexpectedly firm close of the lower lip now and then enough to do away with any inference of indecision  nevertheless something nebulous preoccupied vague in his bearing and regard marked him as one who probably had no very definite aim or concern about his material future  yet as a lad people had said of him that he was one who might do anything if he tried  he was the youngest son of his father a poor parson at the other end of the county and had arrived at talbothays dairy as a six months pupil after going the round of some other farms his object being to acquire a practical skill in the various processes of farming with a view either to the colonies or the tenure of a homefarm as circumstances might decide  his entry into the ranks of the agriculturists and breeders was a step in the young mans career which had been anticipated neither by himself nor by others  mr clare the elder whose first wife had died and left him a daughter married a second late in life  this lady had somewhat unexpectedly brought him three sons so that between angel the youngest and his father the vicar there seemed to be almost a missing generation  of these boys the aforesaid angel the child of his old age was the only son who had not taken a university degree though he was the single one of them whose early promise might have done full justice to an academical training  some two or three years before angels appearance at the marlott dance on a day when he had left school and was pursuing his studies at home a parcel came to the vicarage from the local booksellers directed to the reverend james clare  the vicar having opened it and found it to contain a book read a few pages whereupon he jumped up from his seat and went straight to the shop with the book under his arm  why has this been sent to my house he asked peremptorily holding up the volume  it was ordered sir  not by me or any one belonging to me i am happy to say  the shopkeeper looked into his orderbook  oh it has been misdirected sir he said  it was ordered by mr angel clare and should have been sent to him  mr clare winced as if he had been struck  he went home pale and dejected and called angel into his study  look into this book my boy he said  what do you know about it  i ordered it said angel simply  what for  to read  how can you think of reading it  how can i  whyit is a system of philosophy  there is no more moral or even religious work published  yesmoral enough i dont deny that  but religiousand for you who intend to be a minister of the gospel  since you have alluded to the matter father said the son with anxious thought upon his face i should like to say once for all that i should prefer not to take orders  i fear i could not conscientiously do so  i love the church as one loves a parent i shall always have the warmest affection for her  there is no institution for whose history i have a deeper admiration but i cannot honestly be ordained her minister as my brothers are while she refuses to liberate her mind from an untenable redemptive theolatry  it had never occurred to the straightforward and simpleminded vicar that one of his own flesh and blood could come to this  he was stultified shocked paralysed  and if angel were not going to enter the church what was the use of sending him to cambridge  the university as a step to anything but ordination seemed to this man of fixed ideas a preface without a volume  he was a man not merely religious but devout a firm believernot as the phrase is now elusively construed by theological thimbleriggers in the church and out of it but in the old and ardent sense of the evangelical school one who could                 indeed opine         that the eternal and divine         did eighteen centuries ago         in very truth   angels father tried argument persuasion entreaty  no father i cannot underwrite article four leave alone the rest taking it in the literal and grammatical sense as required by the declaration and therefore i cant be a parson in the present state of affairs said angel  my whole instinct in matters of religion is towards reconstruction to quote your favorite epistle to the hebrews the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain  his father grieved so deeply that it made angel quite ill to see him  what is the good of your mother and me economizing and stinting ourselves to give you a university education if it is not to be used for the honour and glory of god his father repeated  why that it may be used for the honour and glory of man father  perhaps if angel had persevered he might have gone to cambridge like his brothers  but the vicars view of that seat of learning as a steppingstone to orders alone was quite a family tradition and so rooted was the idea in his mind that perseverance began to appear to the sensitive son akin to an intent to misappropriate a trust and wrong the pious heads of the household who had been and were as his father had hinted compelled to exercise much thrift to carry out this uniform plan of education for the three young men  i will do without cambridge said angel at last  i feel that i have no right to go there in the circumstances  the effects of this decisive debate were not long in showing themselves  he spent years and years in desultory studies undertakings and meditations he began to evince considerable indifference to social forms and observances  the material distinctions of rank and wealth he increasingly despised  even the good old family to use a favourite phrase of a late local worthy had no aroma for him unless there were good new resolutions in its representatives  as a balance to these austerities when he went to live in london to see what the world was like and with a view to practising a profession or business there he was carried off his head and nearly entrapped by a woman much older than himself though luckily he escaped not greatly the worse for the experience  early association with country solitudes had bred in him an unconquerable and almost unreasonable aversion to modern town life and shut him out from such success as he might have aspired to by following a mundane calling in the impracticability of the spiritual one  but something had to be done he had wasted many valuable years and having an acquaintance who was starting on a thriving life as a colonial farmer it occurred to angel that this might be a lead in the right direction  farming either in the colonies america or at homefarming at any rate after becoming well qualified for the business by a careful apprenticeshipthat was a vocation which would probably afford an independence without the sacrifice of what he valued even more than a competencyintellectual liberty  so we find angel clare at sixandtwenty here at talbothays as a student of kine and as there were no houses near at hand in which he could get a comfortable lodging a boarder at the dairymans  his room was an immense attic which ran the whole length of the dairyhouse  it could only be reached by a ladder from the cheeseloft and had been closed up for a long time till he arrived and selected it as his retreat  here clare had plenty of space and could often be heard by the dairyfolk pacing up and down when the household had gone to rest  a portion was divided off at one end by a curtain behind which was his bed the outer part being furnished as a homely sittingroom  at first he lived up above entirely reading a good deal and strumming upon an old harp which he had bought at a sale saying when in a bitter humour that he might have to get his living by it in the streets some day  but he soon preferred to read human nature by taking his meals downstairs in the general diningkitchen with the dairyman and his wife and the maids and men who all together formed a lively assembly for though but few milking hands slept in the house several joined the family at meals  the longer clare resided here the less objection had he to his company and the more did he like to share quarters with them in common  much to his surprise he took indeed a real delight in their companionship  the conventional farmfolk of his imagination personified in the newspaperpress by the pitiable dummy known as hodgewere obliterated after a few days residence  at close quarters no hodge was to be seen  at first it is true when clares intelligence was fresh from a contrasting society these friends with whom he now hobnobbed seemed a little strange  sitting down as a level member of the dairymans household seemed at the outset an undignified proceeding  the ideas the modes the surroundings appeared retrogressive and unmeaning  but with living on there day after day the acute sojourner became conscious of a new aspect in the spectacle  without any objective change whatever variety had taken the place of monotonousness  his host and his hosts household his men and his maids as they became intimately known to clare began to differentiate themselves as in a chemical process the thought of pascals was brought home to him a mesure quon a plus desprit on trouve quil y a plus dhommes originaux  les gens du commun ne trouvent pas de différence entre les hommes the typical and unvarying hodge ceased to exist  he had been disintegrated into a number of varied fellowcreaturesbeings of many minds beings infinite in difference some happy many serene a few depressed one here and there bright even to genius some stupid others wanton others austere some mutely miltonic some potentially cromwellianinto men who had private views of each other as he had of his friends who could applaud or condemn each other amuse or sadden themselves by the contemplation of each others foibles or vices men every one of whom walked in his own individual way the road to dusty death  unexpectedly he began to like the outdoor life for its own sake and for what it brought apart from its bearing on his own proposed career  considering his position he became wonderfully free from the chronic melancholy which is taking hold of the civilized races with the decline of belief in a beneficent power  for the first time of late years he could read as his musings inclined him without any eye to cramming for a profession since the few farming handbooks which he deemed it desirable to master occupied him but little time  he grew away from old associations and saw something new in life and humanity  secondarily he made close acquaintance with phenomena which he had before known but darklythe seasons in their moods morning and evening night and noon winds in their different tempers trees waters and mists shades and silences and the voices of inanimate things   the early mornings were still sufficiently cool to render a fire acceptable in the large room wherein they breakfasted and by mrs cricks orders who held that he was too genteel to mess at their table it was angel clares custom to sit in the yawning chimneycorner during the meal his cupandsaucer and plate being placed on a hinged flap at his elbow  the light from the long wide mullioned window opposite shone in upon his nook and assisted by a secondary light of cold blue quality which shone down the chimney enabled him to read there easily whenever disposed to do so  between clare and the window was the table at which his companions sat their munching profiles rising sharp against the panes while to the side was the milkhouse door through which were visible the rectangular leads in rows full to the brim with the mornings milk  at the further end the great churn could be seen revolving and its slipslopping heardthe moving power being discernible through the window in the form of a spiritless horse walking in a circle and driven by a boy  for several days after tesss arrival clare sitting abstractedly reading from some book periodical or piece of music just come by post hardly noticed that she was present at table  she talked so little and the other maids talked so much that the babble did not strike him as possessing a new note and he was ever in the habit of neglecting the particulars of an outward scene for the general impression  one day however when he had been conning one of his musicscores and by force of imagination was hearing the tune in his head he lapsed into listlessness and the musicsheet rolled to the hearth  he looked at the fire of logs with its one flame pirouetting on the top in a dying dance after the breakfastcooking and boiling and it seemed to jig to his inward tune also at the two chimney crooks dangling down from the cotterel or crossbar plumed with soot which quivered to the same melody also at the halfempty kettle whining an accompaniment  the conversation at the table mixed in with his phantasmal orchestra till he thought what a fluty voice one of those milkmaids has  i suppose it is the new one  clare looked round upon her seated with the others  she was not looking towards him  indeed owing to his long silence his presence in the room was almost forgotten  i dont know about ghosts she was saying but i do know that our souls can be made to go outside our bodies when we are alive  the dairyman turned to her with his mouth full his eyes charged with serious inquiry and his great knife and fork breakfasts were breakfasts here planted erect on the table like the beginning of a gallows  whatreally now  and is it so maidy he said  a very easy way to feel em go continued tess is to lie on the grass at night and look straight up at some big bright star and by fixing your mind upon it you will soon find that you are hundreds and hundreds o miles away from your body which you dont seem to want at all  the dairyman removed his hard gaze from tess and fixed it on his wife  now thats a rum thing christianerhey  to think o the miles ive vamped o starlight nights these last thirty year courting or trading or for doctor or for nurse and yet never had the least notion o that till now or feeled my soul rise so much as an inch above my shirtcollar  the general attention being drawn to her including that of the dairymans pupil tess flushed and remarking evasively that it was only a fancy resumed her breakfast  clare continued to observe her  she soon finished her eating and having a consciousness that clare was regarding her began to trace imaginary patterns on the tablecloth with her forefinger with the constraint of a domestic animal that perceives itself to be watched  what a fresh and virginal daughter of nature that milkmaid is he said to himself  and then he seemed to discern in her something that was familiar something which carried him back into a joyous and unforeseeing past before the necessity of taking thought had made the heavens gray  he concluded that he had beheld her before where he could not tell  a casual encounter during some country ramble it certainly had been and he was not greatly curious about it  but the circumstance was sufficient to lead him to select tess in preference to the other pretty milkmaids when he wished to contemplate contiguous womankind    xix   in general the cows were milked as they presented themselves without fancy or choice  but certain cows will show a fondness for a particular pair of hands sometimes carrying this predilection so far as to refuse to stand at all except to their favourite the pail of a stranger being unceremoniously kicked over  it was dairyman cricks rule to insist on breaking down these partialities and aversions by constant interchange since otherwise in the event of a milkman or maid going away from the dairy he was placed in a difficulty  the maids private aims however were the reverse of the dairymans rule the daily selection by each damsel of the eight or ten cows to which she had grown accustomed rendering the operation on their willing udders surprisingly easy and effortless  tess like her compeers soon discovered which of the cows had a preference for her style of manipulation and her fingers having become delicate from the long domiciliary imprisonments to which she had subjected herself at intervals during the last two or three years she would have been glad to meet the milchers views in this respect  out of the whole ninetyfive there were eight in particulardumpling fancy lofty mist old pretty young pretty tidy and loudwho though the teats of one or two were as hard as carrots gave down to her with a readiness that made her work on them a mere touch of the fingers  knowing however the dairymans wish she endeavoured conscientiously to take the animals just as they came expecting the very hard yielders which she could not yet manage  but she soon found a curious correspondence between the ostensibly chance position of the cows and her wishes in this matter till she felt that their order could not be the result of accident  the dairymans pupil had lent a hand in getting the cows together of late and at the fifth or sixth time she turned her eyes as she rested against the cow full of sly inquiry upon him  mr clare you have ranged the cows she said blushing and in making the accusation symptoms of a smile gently lifted her upper lip in spite of her so as to show the tips of her teeth the lower lip remaining severely still  well it makes no difference said he  you will always be here to milk them  do you think so  i hope i shall  but i dont know  she was angry with herself afterwards thinking that he unaware of her grave reasons for liking this seclusion might have mistaken her meaning  she had spoken so earnestly to him as if his presence were somehow a factor in her wish  her misgiving was such that at dusk when the milking was over she walked in the garden alone to continue her regrets that she had disclosed to him her discovery of his considerateness  it was a typical summer evening in june the atmosphere being in such delicate equilibrium and so transmissive that inanimate objects seemed endowed with two or three senses if not five  there was no distinction between the near and the far and an auditor felt close to everything within the horizon  the soundlessness impressed her as a positive entity rather than as the mere negation of noise  it was broken by the strumming of strings  tess had heard those notes in the attic above her head  dim flattened constrained by their confinement they had never appealed to her as now when they wandered in the still air with a stark quality like that of nudity  to speak absolutely both instrument and execution were poor but the relative is all and as she listened tess like a fascinated bird could not leave the spot  far from leaving she drew up towards the performer keeping behind the hedge that he might not guess her presence  the outskirt of the garden in which tess found herself had been left uncultivated for some years and was now damp and rank with juicy grass which sent up mists of pollen at a touch and with tall blooming weeds emitting offensive smellsweeds whose red and yellow and purple hues formed a polychrome as dazzling as that of cultivated flowers  she went stealthily as a cat through this profusion of growth gathering cuckoospittle on her skirts cracking snails that were underfoot staining her hands with thistlemilk and slugslime and rubbing off upon her naked arms sticky blights which though snowwhite on the appletree trunks made madder stains on her skin thus she drew quite near to clare still unobserved of him  tess was conscious of neither time nor space  the exaltation which she had described as being producible at will by gazing at a star came now without any determination of hers she undulated upon the thin notes of the secondhand harp and their harmonies passed like breezes through her bringing tears into her eyes  the floating pollen seemed to be his notes made visible and the dampness of the garden the weeping of the gardens sensibility  though near nightfall the ranksmelling weedflowers glowed as if they would not close for intentness and the waves of colour mixed with the waves of sound  the light which still shone was derived mainly from a large hole in the western bank of cloud it was like a piece of day left behind by accident dusk having closed in elsewhere  he concluded his plaintive melody a very simple performance demanding no great skill and she waited thinking another might be begun  but tired of playing he had desultorily come round the fence and was rambling up behind her  tess her cheeks on fire moved away furtively as if hardly moving at all  angel however saw her light summer gown and he spoke his low tones reaching her though he was some distance off  what makes you draw off in that way tess said he  are you afraid  oh no sirnot of outdoor things especially just now when the appleblooth is falling and everything is so green  but you have your indoor fearseh  wellyes sir  what of  i couldnt quite say  the milk turning sour  no  life in general  yes sir  ahso have i very often  this hobble of being alive is rather serious dont you think so  it isnow you put it that way  all the same i shouldnt have expected a young girl like you to see it so just yet  how is it you do  she maintained a hesitating silence  come tess tell me in confidence  she thought that he meant what were the aspects of things to her and replied shyly  the trees have inquisitive eyes havent theythat is seem as if they had  and the river sayswhy do ye trouble me with your looks  and you seem to see numbers of tomorrows just all in a line the first of them the biggest and clearest the others getting smaller and smaller as they stand farther away but they all seem very fierce and cruel and as if they said im coming  beware of me  beware of me   but you sir can raise up dreams with your music and drive all such horrid fancies away  he was surprised to find this young womanwho though but a milkmaid had just that touch of rarity about her which might make her the envied of her housematesshaping such sad imaginings  she was expressing in her own native phrasesassisted a little by her sixth standard trainingfeelings which might almost have been called those of the agethe ache of modernism  the perception arrested him less when he reflected that what are called advanced ideas are really in great part but the latest fashion in definitiona more accurate expression by words in logy and ism of sensations which men and women have vaguely grasped for centuries  still it was strange that they should have come to her while yet so young more than strange it was impressive interesting pathetic not guessing the cause there was nothing to remind him that experience is as to intensity and not as to duration  tesss passing corporeal blight had been her mental harvest  tess on her part could not understand why a man of clerical family and good education and above physical want should look upon it as a mishap to be alive  for the unhappy pilgrim herself there was very good reason  but how could this admirable and poetic man ever have descended into the valley of humiliation have felt with the man of uzas she herself had felt two or three years agomy soul chooseth strangling and death rather than my life  i loathe it i would not live alway  it was true that he was at present out of his class  but she knew that was only because like peter the great in a shipwrights yard he was studying what he wanted to know  he did not milk cows because he was obliged to milk cows but because he was learning to be a rich and prosperous dairyman landowner agriculturist and breeder of cattle  he would become an american or australian abraham commanding like a monarch his flocks and his herds his spotted and his ringstraked his menservants and his maids  at times nevertheless it did seem unaccountable to her that a decidedly bookish musical thinking young man should have chosen deliberately to be a farmer and not a clergyman like his father and brothers  thus neither having the clue to the others secret they were respectively puzzled at what each revealed and awaited new knowledge of each others character and mood without attempting to pry into each others history   every day every hour brought to him one more little stroke of her nature and to her one more of his  tess was trying to lead a repressed life but she little divined the strength of her own vitality  at first tess seemed to regard angel clare as an intelligence rather than as a man  as such she compared him with herself and at every discovery of the abundance of his illuminations of the distance between her own modest mental standpoint and the unmeasurable andean altitude of his she became quite dejected disheartened from all further effort on her own part whatever  he observed her dejection one day when he had casually mentioned something to her about pastoral life in ancient greece  she was gathering the buds called lords and ladies from the bank while he spoke  why do you look so woebegone all of a sudden he asked  oh tis onlyabout my own self she said with a frail laugh of sadness fitfully beginning to peel a lady meanwhile  just a sense of what might have been with me  my life looks as if it had been wasted for want of chances  when i see what you know what you have read and seen and thought i feel what a nothing i am  im like the poor queen of sheba who lived in the bible  there is no more spirit in me  bless my soul dont go troubling about that  why he said with some enthusiasm i should be only too glad my dear tess to help you to anything in the way of history or any line of reading you would like to take up  it is a lady again interrupted she holding out the bud she had peeled  what  i meant that there are always more ladies than lords when you come to peel them  never mind about the lords and ladies  would you like to take up any course of studyhistory for example  sometimes i feel i dont want to know anything more about it than i know already  why not  because whats the use of learning that i am one of a long row onlyfinding out that there is set down in some old book somebody just like me and to know that i shall only act her part making me sad thats all  the best is not to remember that your nature and your past doings have been just like thousands and thousands and that your coming life and doings ll be like thousandss and thousands  what really then you dont want to learn anything  i shouldnt mind learning whywhy the sun do shine on the just and the unjust alike she answered with a slight quaver in her voice but thats what books will not tell me  tess fie for such bitterness  of course he spoke with a conventional sense of duty only for that sort of wondering had not been unknown to himself in bygone days  and as he looked at the unpracticed mouth and lips he thought that such a daughter of the soil could only have caught up the sentiment by rote  she went on peeling the lords and ladies till clare regarding for a moment the wavelike curl of her lashes as they dropped with her bent gaze on her soft cheek lingeringly went away  when he was gone she stood awhile thoughtfully peeling the last bud and then awakening from her reverie flung it and all the crowd of floral nobility impatiently on the ground in an ebullition of displeasure with herself for her niaiserie and with a quickening warmth in her heart of hearts  how stupid he must think her  in an access of hunger for his good opinion she bethought herself of what she had latterly endeavoured to forget so unpleasant had been its issuesthe identity of her family with that of the knightly durbervilles  barren attribute as it was disastrous as its discovery had been in many ways to her perhaps mr clare as a gentleman and a student of history would respect her sufficiently to forget her childish conduct with the lords and ladies if he knew that those purbeckmarble and alabaster people in kingsbere church really represented her own lineal forefathers that she was no spurious durberville compounded of money and ambition like those at trantridge but true durberville to the bone  but before venturing to make the revelation dubious tess indirectly sounded the dairyman as to its possible effect upon mr clare by asking the former if mr clare had any great respect for old county families when they had lost all their money and land  mr clare said the dairyman emphatically is one of the most rebellest rozums you ever knowednot a bit like the rest of his family and if theres one thing that he do hate more than another tis the notion of whats called a old family  he says that it stands to reason that old families have done their spurt of work in past days and cant have anything left in em now  theres the billets and the drenkhards and the greys and the st quintins and the hardys and the goulds who used to own the lands for miles down this valley you could buy em all up now for an old song amost why our little retty priddle here you know is one of the paridellesthe old family that used to own lots o the lands out by kings hintock now owned by the earl o wessex afore even he or his was heard of  well mr clare found this out and spoke quite scornful to the poor girl for days  ah he says to her youll never make a good dairymaid  all your skill was used up ages ago in palestine and you must lie fallow for a thousand years to git strength for more deeds  a boy came here tother day asking for a job and said his name was matt and when we asked him his surname he said hed never heard that a had any surname and when we asked why he said he supposed his folks hadnt been stablished long enough  ah youre the very boy i want says mr clare jumping up and shaking hands wien ive great hopes of you and gave him halfacrown  o no he cant stomach old families  after hearing this caricature of clares opinion poor tess was glad that she had not said a word in a weak moment about her familyeven though it was so unusually old almost to have gone round the circle and become a new one  besides another diarygirl was as good as she it seemed in that respect  she held her tongue about the durberville vault and the knight of the conqueror whose name she bore  the insight afforded into clares character suggested to her that it was largely owing to her supposed untraditional newness that she had won interest in his eyes    xx   the season developed and matured  another years instalment of flowers leaves nightingales thrushes finches and such ephemeral creatures took up their positions where only a year ago others had stood in their place when these were nothing more than germs and inorganic particles  rays from the sunrise drew forth the buds and stretched them into long stalks lifted up sap in noiseless streams opened petals and sucked out scents in invisible jets and breathings  dairyman cricks household of maids and men lived on comfortably placidly even merrily  their position was perhaps the happiest of all positions in the social scale being above the line at which neediness ends and below the line at which the convenances begin to cramp natural feelings and the stress of threadbare modishness makes too little of enough  thus passed the leafy time when arborescence seems to be the one thing aimed at out of doors  tess and clare unconsciously studied each other ever balanced on the edge of a passion yet apparently keeping out of it  all the while they were converging under an irresistible law as surely as two streams in one vale  tess had never in her recent life been so happy as she was now possibly never would be so happy again  she was for one thing physically and mentally suited among these new surroundings  the sapling which had rooted down to a poisonous stratum on the spot of its sowing had been transplanted to a deeper soil  moreover she and clare also stood as yet on the debatable land between predilection and love where no profundities have been reached no reflections have set in awkwardly inquiring whither does this new current tend to carry me  what does it mean to my future  how does it stand towards my past  tess was the merest stray phenomenon to angel clare as yeta rosy warming apparition which had only just acquired the attribute of persistence in his consciousness  so he allowed his mind to be occupied with her deeming his preoccupation to be no more than a philosophers regard of an exceedingly novel fresh and interesting specimen of womankind  they met continually they could not help it  they met daily in that strange and solemn interval the twilight of the morning in the violet or pink dawn for it was necessary to rise early so very early here  milking was done betimes and before the milking came the skimming which began at a little past three  it usually fell to the lot of some one or other of them to wake the rest the first being aroused by an alarmclock and as tess was the latest arrival and they soon discovered that she could be depended upon not to sleep though the alarm as others did this task was thrust most frequently upon her  no sooner had the hour of three struck and whizzed than she left her room and ran to the dairymans door then up the ladder to angels calling him in a loud whisper then woke her fellowmilkmaids  by the time that tess was dressed clare was downstairs and out in the humid air  the remaining maids and the dairyman usually gave themselves another turn on the pillow and did not appear till a quarter of an hour later  the gray halftones of daybreak are not the gray halftones of the days close though the degree of their shade may be the same  in the twilight of the morning light seems active darkness passive in the twilight of evening it is the darkness which is active and crescent and the light which is the drowsy reverse  being so oftenpossibly not always by chancethe first two persons to get up at the dairyhouse they seemed to themselves the first persons up of all the world  in these early days of her residence here tess did not skim but went out of doors at once after rising where he was generally awaiting her  the spectral halfcompounded aqueous light which pervaded the open mead impressed them with a feeling of isolation as if they were adam and eve  at this dim inceptive stage of the day tess seemed to clare to exhibit a dignified largeness both of disposition and physique an almost regnant power possibly because he knew that at that preternatural time hardly any woman so well endowed in person as she was likely to be walking in the open air within the boundaries of his horizon very few in all england  fair women are usually asleep at midsummer dawns  she was close at hand and the rest were nowhere  the mixed singular luminous gloom in which they walked along together to the spot where the cows lay often made him think of the resurrection hour  he little thought that the magdalen might be at his side  whilst all the landscape was in neutral shade his companions face which was the focus of his eyes rising above the mist stratum seemed to have a sort of phosphorescence upon it  she looked ghostly as if she were merely a soul at large  in reality her face without appearing to do so had caught the cold gleam of day from the northeast his own face though he did not think of it wore the same aspect to her  it was then as has been said that she impressed him most deeply she was no longer the milkmaid but a visionary essence of womana whole sex condensed into one typical form  he called her artemis demeter and other fanciful names half teasingly which she did not like because she did not understand them  call me tess she would say askance and he did  then it would grow lighter and her features would become simply feminine they had changed from those of a divinity who could confer bliss to those of a being who craved it  at these nonhuman hours they could get quite close to the waterfowl herons came with a great bold noise as of opening doors and shutters out of the boughs of a plantation which they frequented at the side of the mead or if already on the spot hardily maintained their standing in the water as the pair walked by watching them by moving their heads round in a slow horizontal passionless wheel like the turn of puppets by clockwork  they could then see the faint summer fogs in layers woolly level and apparently no thicker than counterpanes spread about the meadows in detached remnants of small extent  on the gray moisture of the grass were marks where the cows had lain through the nightdarkgreen islands of dry herbage the size of their carcasses in the general sea of dew from each island proceeded a serpentine trail by which the cow had rambled away to feed after getting up at the end of which trail they found her the snoring puff from her nostrils when she recognized them making an intenser little fog of her own amid the prevailing one  then they drove the animals back to the barton or sat down to milk them on the spot as the case might require  or perhaps the summer fog was more general and the meadows lay like a white sea out of which the scattered trees rose like dangerous rocks  birds would soar through it into the upper radiance and hang on the wing sunning themselves or alight on the wet rails subdividing the mead which now shone like glass rods  minute diamonds of moisture from the mist hung too upon tesss eyelashes and drops upon her hair like seed pearls  when the day grew quite strong and commonplace these dried off her moreover tess then lost her strange and ethereal beauty her teeth lips and eyes scintillated in the sunbeams and she was again the dazzlingly fair dairymaid only who had to hold her own against the other women of the world  about this time they would hear dairyman cricks voice lecturing the nonresident milkers for arriving late and speaking sharply to old deborah fyander for not washing her hands  for heavens sake pop thy hands under the pump deb  upon my soul if the london folk only knowed of thee and thy slovenly ways theyd swaller their milk and butter more mincing than they do aready and thats saying a good deal  the milking progressed till towards the end tess and clare in common with the rest could hear the heavy breakfast table dragged out from the wall in the kitchen by mrs crick this being the invariable preliminary to each meal the same horrible scrape accompanying its return journey when the table had been cleared    xxi   there was a great stir in the milkhouse just after breakfast  the churn revolved as usual but the butter would not come  whenever this happened the dairy was paralyzed  squish squash echoed the milk in the great cylinder but never arose the sound they waited for  dairyman crick and his wife the milkmaids tess marian retty priddle izz huett and the married ones from the cottages also mr clare jonathan kail old deborah and the rest stood gazing hopelessly at the churn and the boy who kept the horse going outside put on moonlike eyes to show his sense of the situation  even the melancholy horse himself seemed to look in at the window in inquiring despair at each walk round  tis years since i went to conjuror trendles son in egdonyears said the dairyman bitterly  and he was nothing to what his father had been  i have said fifty times if i have said once that i dont believe in en though a do cast folks waters very true  but i shall have to go to n if hes alive  o yes i shall have to go to n if this sort of thing continnys  even mr clare began to feel tragical at the dairymans desperation  conjuror fall tother side of casterbridge that they used to call wideo was a very good man when i was a boy said jonathan kail but hes rotten as touchwood by now  my grandfather used to go to conjuror mynterne out at owlscombe and a clever man a were so ive heard grandfer say continued mr crick  but theres no such genuine folk about nowadays  mrs cricks mind kept nearer to the matter in hand  perhaps somebody in the house is in love she said tentatively ive heard tell in my younger days that that will cause it  why crickthat maid we had years ago do ye mind and how the butter didnt come then  ah yes yesbut that isnt the rights ot  it had nothing to do with the lovemaking  i can mind all about ittwas the damage to the churn  he turned to clare  jack dollop a horesbird of a fellow we had here as milker at one time sir courted a young woman over at mellstock and deceived her as he had deceived many afore  but he had another sort o woman to reckon wi this time and it was not the girl herself  one holy thursday of all days in the almanack we was here as we mid be now only there was no churning in hand when we zid the girls mother coming up to the door wi a great brassmounted umbrella in her hand that would ha felled an ox and saying do jack dollop work herebecause i want him  i have a big bone to pick with he i can assure n  and some way behind her mother walked jacks young woman crying bitterly into her handkercher  o lard heres a time said jack looking out o winder at em  shell murder me where shall i getwhere shall i  dont tell her where i be and with that he scrambled into the churn through the trapdoor and shut himself inside just as the young womans mother busted into the milkhouse  the villainwhere is he says she  ill claw his face forn let me only catch him  well she hunted about everywhere ballyragging jack by side and by seam jack lying amost stifled inside the churn and the poor maidor young woman ratherstanding at the door crying her eyes out  i shall never forget it never twould have melted a marble stone  but she couldnt find him nowhere at all  the dairyman paused and one or two words of comment came from the listeners  dairyman cricks stories often seemed to be ended when they were not really so and strangers were betrayed into premature interjections of finality though old friends knew better  the narrator went on  well how the old woman should have had the wit to guess it i could never tell but she found out that he was inside that there churn without saying a word she took hold of the winch it was turned by handpower then and round she swung him and jack began to flop about inside  o lard stop the churn let me out says he popping out his head  i shall be churned into a pummy  he was a cowardly chap in his heart as such men mostly be  not till ye make amends for ravaging her virgin innocence says the old woman  stop the churn you old witch screams he  you call me old witch do ye you deceiver says she when ye ought to ha been calling me motherlaw these last five months  and on went the churn and jacks bones rattled round again  well none of us ventured to interfere and at last a promised to make it right wi her  yesill be as good as my word he said  and so it ended that day  while the listeners were smiling their comments there was a quick movement behind their backs and they looked round  tess palefaced had gone to the door  how warm tis today she said almost inaudibly  it was warm and none of them connected her withdrawal with the reminiscences of the dairyman  he went forward and opened the door for her saying with tender raillery  why maidy he frequently with unconscious irony gave her this pet name the prettiest milker ive got in my dairy you mustnt get so fagged as this at the first breath of summer weather or we shall be finely put to for want of ee by dogdays shant we mr clare  i was faintandi think i am better out o doors she said mechanically and disappeared outside  fortunately for her the milk in the revolving churn at that moment changed its squashing for a decided flickflack  tis coming cried mrs crick and the attention of all was called off from tess  that fair sufferer soon recovered herself externally but she remained much depressed all the afternoon when the evening milking was done she did not care to be with the rest of them and went out of doors wandering along she knew not whither  she was wretchedo so wretchedat the perception that to her companions the dairymans story had been rather a humorous narration than otherwise none of them but herself seemed to see the sorrow of it to a certainty not one knew how cruelly it touched the tender place in her experience the evening sun was now ugly to her like a great inflamed wound in the sky  only a solitary crackedvoice reedsparrow greeted her from the bushes by the river in a sad machinemade tone resembling that of a past friend whose friendship she had outworn  in these long june days the milkmaids and indeed most of the household went to bed at sunset or sooner the morning work before milking being so early and heavy at a time of full pails  tess usually accompanied her fellows upstairs  tonight however she was the first to go to their common chamber and she had dozed when the other girls came in  she saw them undressing in the orange light of the vanished sun which flushed their forms with its colour she dozed again but she was reawakened by their voices and quietly turned her eyes towards them  neither of her three chambercompanions had got into bed  they were standing in a group in their nightgowns barefooted at the window the last red rays of the west still warming their faces and necks and the walls around them  all were watching somebody in the garden with deep interest their three faces close together a jovial and round one a pale one with dark hair and a fair one whose tresses were auburn  dont push  you can see as well as i said retty the auburnhaired and youngest girl without removing her eyes from the window  tis no use for you to be in love with him any more than me retty priddle said jollyfaced marian the eldest slily  his thoughts be of other cheeks than thine  retty priddle still looked and the others looked again  there he is again cried izz huett the pale girl with dark damp hair and keenly cut lips  you neednt say anything izz answered retty  for i zid you kissing his shade  what did you see her doing asked marian  whyhe was standing over the wheytub to let off the whey and the shade of his face came upon the wall behind close to izz who was standing there filling a vat  she put her mouth against the wall and kissed the shade of his mouth i zid her though he didnt  o izz huett said marian  a rosy spot came into the middle of izz huetts cheek  well there was no harm in it she declared with attempted coolness  and if i be in love wien so is retty too and so be you marian come to that  marians full face could not blush past its chronic pinkness  i she said  what a tale  ah there he is again  dear eyesdear facedear mr clare  thereyouve owned it  so have youso have we all said marian with the dry frankness of complete indifference to opinion  it is silly to pretend otherwise amongst ourselves though we need not own it to other folks  i would just marry n tomorrow  so would iand more murmured izz huett  and i too whispered the more timid retty  the listener grew warm  we cant all marry him said izz  we shant either of us which is worse still said the eldest there he is again  they all three blew him a silent kiss  why asked retty quickly  because he likes tess durbeyfield best said marian lowering her voice  i have watched him every day and have found it out  there was a reflective silence  but she dont care anything for n at length breathed retty  welli sometimes think that too  but how silly all this is said izz huett impatiently  of course he wont marry any one of us or tess eithera gentlemans son whos going to be a great landowner and farmer abroad  more likely to ask us to come wien as farmhands at so much a year  one sighed and another sighed and marians plump figure sighed biggest of all  somebody in bed hard by sighed too  tears came into the eyes of retty priddle the pretty redhaired youngestthe last bud of the paridelles so important in the county annals  they watched silently a little longer their three faces still close together as before and the triple hues of their hair mingling  but the unconscious mr clare had gone indoors and they saw him no more and the shades beginning to deepen they crept into their beds in a few minutes they heard him ascend the ladder to his own room marian was soon snoring but izz did not drop into forgetfulness for a long time  retty priddle cried herself to sleep  the deeperpassioned tess was very far from sleeping even then  this conversation was another of the bitter pills she had been obliged to swallow that day  scarce the least feeling of jealousy arose in her breast  for that matter she knew herself to have the preference being more finely formed better educated and though the youngest except retty more woman than either she perceived that only the slightest ordinary care was necessary for holding her own in angel clares heart against these her candid friends  but the grave question was ought she to do this  there was to be sure hardly a ghost of a chance for either of them in a serious sense but there was or had been a chance of one or the other inspiring him with a passing fancy for her and enjoying the pleasure of his attentions while he stayed here  such unequal attachments had led to marriage and she had heard from mrs crick that mr clare had one day asked in a laughing way what would be the use of his marrying a fine lady and all the while ten thousand acres of colonial pasture to feed and cattle to rear and corn to reap  a farmwoman would be the only sensible kind of wife for him  but whether mr clare had spoken seriously or not why should she who could never conscientiously allow any man to marry her now and who had religiously determined that she never would be tempted to do so draw off mr clares attention from other women for the brief happiness of sunning herself in his eyes while he remained at talbothays    xxii   they came downstairs yawning next morning but skimming and milking were proceeded with as usual and they went indoors to breakfast dairyman crick was discovered stamping about the house  he had received a letter in which a customer had complained that the butter had a twang  and begad so t have said the dairyman who held in his left hand a wooden slice on which a lump of butter was stuck yestaste for yourself  several of them gathered round him and mr clare tasted tess tasted also the other indoor milkmaids one or two of the milkingmen and last of all mrs crick who came out from the waiting breakfasttable there certainly was a twang  the dairyman who had thrown himself into abstraction to better realize the taste and so divine the particular species of noxious weed to which it appertained suddenly exclaimed  tis garlic and i thought there wasnt a blade left in that mead  then all the old hands remembered that a certain dry mead into which a few of the cows had been admitted of late had in years gone by spoilt the butter in the same way  the dairyman had not recognized the taste at that time and thought the butter bewitched  we must overhaul that mead he resumed this mustnt continny  all having armed themselves with old pointed knives they went out together  as the inimical plant could only be present in very microscopic dimensions to have escaped ordinary observation to find it seemed rather a hopeless attempt in the stretch of rich grass before them  however they formed themselves into line all assisting owing to the importance of the search the dairyman at the upper end with mr clare who had volunteered to help then tess marian izz huett and retty then bill lewell jonathan and the married dairywomenbeck knibbs with her wooly black hair and rolling eyes and flaxen frances consumptive from the winter damps of the watermeadswho lived in their respective cottages  with eyes fixed upon the ground they crept slowly across a strip of the field returning a little further down in such a manner that when they should have finished not a single inch of the pasture but would have fallen under the eye of some one of them  it was a most tedious business not more than half a dozen shoots of garlic being discoverable in the whole field yet such was the herbs pungency that probably one bite of it by one cow had been sufficient to season the whole dairys produce for the day  differing one from another in natures and moods so greatly as they did they yet formed bending a curiously uniform rowautomatic noiseless and an alien observer passing down the neighbouring lane might well have been excused for massing them as hodge  as they crept along stooping low to discern the plant a soft yellow gleam was reflected from the buttercups into their shaded faces giving them an elfish moonlit aspect though the sun was pouring upon their backs in all the strength of noon  angel clare who communistically stuck to his rule of taking part with the rest in everything glanced up now and then  it was not of course by accident that he walked next to tess  well how are you he murmured  very well thank you sir she replied demurely  as they had been discussing a score of personal matters only halfanhour before the introductory style seemed a little superfluous  but they got no further in speech just then  they crept and crept the hem of her petticoat just touching his gaiter and his elbow sometimes brushing hers  at last the dairyman who came next could stand it no longer  upon my soul and body this here stooping do fairly make my back open and shut he exclaimed straightening himself slowly with an excruciated look till quite upright  and you maidy tess you wasnt well a day or two agothis will make your head ache finely dont do any more if you feel fainty leave the rest to finish it  dairyman crick withdrew and tess dropped behind  mr clare also stepped out of line and began privateering about for the weed  when she found him near her her very tension at what she had heard the night before made her the first to speak  dont they look pretty she said  who  izzy huett and retty  tess had moodily decided that either of these maidens would make a good farmers wife and that she ought to recommend them and obscure her own wretched charms  pretty  well yesthey are pretty girlsfresh looking  i have often thought so  though poor dears prettiness wont last long  o no unfortunately  they are excellent dairywomen  yes though not better than you  they skim better than i  do they  clare remained observing themnot without their observing him  she is colouring up continued tess heroically  who  retty priddle  oh  why it that  because you are looking at her  selfsacrificing as her mood might be tess could not well go further and cry marry one of them if you really do want a dairywoman and not a lady and dont think of marrying me  she followed dairyman crick and had the mournful satisfaction of seeing that clare remained behind  from this day she forced herself to take pains to avoid himnever allowing herself as formerly to remain long in his company even if their juxtaposition were purely accidental  she gave the other three every chance  tess was woman enough to realize from their avowals to herself that angel clare had the honour of all the dairymaids in his keeping and her perception of his care to avoid compromising the happiness of either in the least degree bred a tender respect in tess for what she deemed rightly or wrongly the selfcontrolling sense of duty shown by him a quality which she had never expected to find in one of the opposite sex and in the absence of which more than one of the simple hearts who were his housemates might have gone weeping on her pilgrimage    xxiii   the hot weather of july had crept upon them unawares and the atmosphere of the flat vale hung heavy as an opiate over the dairyfolk the cows and the trees  hot steaming rains fell frequently making the grass where the cows fed yet more rank and hindering the late haymaking in the other meads  it was sunday morning the milking was done the outdoor milkers had gone home  tess and the other three were dressing themselves rapidly the whole bevy having agreed to go together to mellstock church which lay some three or four miles distant from the dairyhouse  she had now been two months at talbothays and this was her first excursion  all the preceding afternoon and night heavy thunderstorms had hissed down upon the meads and washed some of the hay into the river but this morning the sun shone out all the more brilliantly for the deluge and the air was balmy and clear  the crooked lane leading from their own parish to mellstock ran along the lowest levels in a portion of its length and when the girls reached the most depressed spot they found that the result of the rain had been to flood the lane overshoe to a distance of some fifty yards  this would have been no serious hindrance on a weekday they would have clicked through it in their high patterns and boots quite unconcerned but on this day of vanity this sunsday when flesh went forth to coquet with flesh while hypocritically affecting business with spiritual things on this occasion for wearing their white stockings and thin shoes and their pink white and lilac gowns on which every mud spot would be visible the pool was an awkward impediment  they could hear the churchbell callingas yet nearly a mile off  who would have expected such a rise in the river in summertime said marian from the top of the roadside bank on which they had climbed and were maintaining a precarious footing in the hope of creeping along its slope till they were past the pool  we cant get there anyhow without walking right through it or else going round the turnpike way and that would make us so very late said retty pausing hopelessly  and i do colour up so hot walking into church late and all the people staring round said marian that i hardly cool down again till we get into the thatitmaypleasethees  while they stood clinging to the bank they heard a splashing round the bend of the road and presently appeared angel clare advancing along the lane towards them through the water  four hearts gave a big throb simultaneously  his aspect was probably as unsabbatarian a one as a dogmatic parsons son often presented his attire being his dairy clothes long wading boots a cabbageleaf inside his hat to keep his head cool with a thistlespud to finish him off  hes not going to church said marian  noi wish he was murmured tess  angel in fact rightly or wrongly to adopt the safe phrase of evasive controversialists preferred sermons in stones to sermons in churches and chapels on fine summer days  this morning moreover he had gone out to see if the damage to the hay by the flood was considerable or not  on his walk he observed the girls from a long distance though they had been so occupied with their difficulties of passage as not to notice him  he knew that the water had risen at that spot and that it would quite check their progress  so he had hastened on with a dim idea of how he could help themone of them in particular  the rosycheeked brighteyed quartet looked so charming in their light summer attire clinging to the roadside bank like pigeons on a roofslope that he stopped a moment to regard them before coming close  their gauzy skirts had brushed up from the grass innumerable flies and butterflies which unable to escape remained caged in the transparent tissue as in an aviary  angels eye at last fell upon tess the hindmost of the four she being full of suppressed laughter at their dilemma could not help meeting his glance radiantly  he came beneath them in the water which did not rise over his long boots and stood looking at the entrapped flies and butterflies  are you trying to get to church he said to marian who was in front including the next two in his remark but avoiding tess  yes sir and tis getting late and my colour do come up so  ill carry you through the poolevery jill of you  the whole four flushed as if one heart beat through them  i think you cant sir said marian  it is the only way for you to get past  stand still  nonsenseyou are not too heavy  id carry you all four together  now marian attend he continued and put your arms round my shoulders so now  hold on thats well done  marian had lowered herself upon his arm and shoulder as directed and angel strode off with her his slim figure as viewed from behind looking like the mere stem to the great nosegay suggested by hers they disappeared round the curve of the road and only his sousing footsteps and the top ribbon of marians bonnet told where they were in a few minutes he reappeared  izz huett was the next in order upon the bank  here he comes she murmured and they could hear that her lips were dry with emotion  and i have to put my arms round his neck and look into his face as marian did  theres nothing in that said tess quickly  theres a time for everything continued izz unheeding  a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing the first is now going to be mine  fieit is scripture izz  yes said izz ive always a ear at church for pretty verses  angel clare to whom threequarters of this performance was a commonplace act of kindness now approached izz  she quietly and dreamily lowered herself into his arms and angel methodically marched off with her  when he was heard returning for the third time rettys throbbing heart could be almost seen to shake her  he went up to the redhaired girl and while he was seizing her he glanced at tess  his lips could not have pronounced more plainly it will soon be you and i  her comprehension appeared in her face she could not help it  there was an understanding between them  poor little retty though by far the lightest weight was the most troublesome of clares burdens  marian had been like a sack of meal a dead weight of plumpness under which he has literally staggered izz had ridden sensibly and calmly  retty was a bunch of hysterics  however he got through with the disquieted creature deposited her and returned  tess could see over the hedge the distant three in a group standing as he had placed them on the next rising ground  it was now her turn  she was embarrassed to discover that excitement at the proximity of mr clares breath and eyes which she had contemned in her companions was intensified in herself and as if fearful of betraying her secret she paltered with him at the last moment  i may be able to clim along the bank perhapsi can clim better than they  you must be so tired mr clare  no no tess said he quickly  and almost before she was aware she was seated in his arms and resting against his shoulder  three leahs to get one rachel he whispered  they are better women than i she replied magnanimously sticking to her resolve  not to me said angel  he saw her grow warm at this and they went some steps in silence  i hope i am not too heavy she said timidly  o no  you should lift marian  such a lump  you are like an undulating billow warmed by the sun  and all this fluff of muslin about you is the froth  it is very prettyif i seem like that to you  do you know that i have undergone threequarters of this labour entirely for the sake of the fourth quarter  no  i did not expect such an event today  nor i  the water came up so sudden  that the rise in the water was what she understood him to refer to the state of breathing belied  clare stood still and inclinced his face towards hers  o tessy he exclaimed  the girls cheeks burned to the breeze and she could not look into his eyes for her emotion  it reminded angel that he was somewhat unfairly taking advantage of an accidental position and he went no further with it  no definite words of love had crossed their lips as yet and suspension at this point was desirable now however he walked slowly to make the remainder of the distance as long as possible but at last they came to the bend and the rest of their progress was in full view of the other three  the dry land was reached and he set her down  her friends were looking with round thoughtful eyes at her and him and she could see that they had been talking of her  he hastily bade them farewell and splashed back along the stretch of submerged road  the four moved on together as before till marian broke the silence by saying  noin all truth we have no chance against her  she looked joylessly at tess  what do you mean asked the latter  he likes ee bestthe very best  we could see it as he brought ee  he would have kissed ee if you had encouraged him to do it ever so little  no no said she  the gaiety with which they had set out had somehow vanished and yet there was no enmity or malice between them  they were generous young souls they had been reared in the lonely country nooks where fatalism is a strong sentiment and they did not blame her  such supplanting was to be  tesss heart ached  there was no concealing from herself the fact that she loved angel clare perhaps all the more passionately from knowing that the others had also lost their hearts to him  there is contagion in this sentiment especially among women  and yet that same hungry nature had fought against this but too feebly and the natural result had followed  i will never stand in your way nor in the way of either of you she declared to retty that night in the bedroom her tears running down  i cant help this my dear  i dont think marrying is in his mind at all but if he were ever to ask me i should refuse him as i should refuse any man  oh would you  why said wondering retty  it cannot be  but i will be plain  putting myself quite on one side i dont think he will choose either of you  i have never expected itthought of it moaned retty  but o i wish i was dead  the poor child torn by a feeling which she hardly understood turned to the other two girls who came upstairs just then  we be friends with her again she said to them  she thinks no more of his choosing her than we do  so the reserve went off and they were confiding and warm  i dont seem to care what i do now said marian whose mood was turned to its lowest bass  i was going to marry a dairyman at stickleford whos asked me twice butmy souli would put an end to myself rathern be his wife now  why dont ye speak izz  to confess then murmured izz i made sure today that he was going to kiss me as he held me and i lay still against his breast hoping and hoping and never moved at all  but he did not  i dont like biding here at talbothays any longer  i shall go hwome  the air of the sleepingchamber seemed to palpitate with the hopeless passion of the girls  they writhed feverishly under the oppressiveness of an emotion thrust on them by cruel natures lawan emotion which they had neither expected nor desired  the incident of the day had fanned the flame that was burning the inside of their hearts out and the torture was almost more than they could endure the differences which distinguished them as individuals were abstracted by this passion and each was but portion of one organism called sex  there was so much frankness and so little jealousy because there was no hope  each one was a girl of fair common sense and she did not delude herself with any vain conceits or deny her love or give herself airs in the idea of outshining the others the full recognition of the futility of their infatuation from a social point of view its purposeless beginning its selfbounded outlook its lack of everything to justify its existence in the eye of civilization while lacking nothing in the eye of nature the one fact that it did exist ecstasizing them to a killing joyall this imparted to them a resignation a dignity which a practical and sordid expectation of winning him as a husband would have destroyed  they tossed and turned on their little beds and the cheesewring dripped monotonously downstairs  b you awake tess whispered one halfanhour later  it was izz huetts voice  tess replied in the affirmative whereupon also retty and marian suddenly flung the bedclothes off them and sighed  so be we  i wonder what she is likethe lady they say his family have looked out for him  i wonder said izz  some lady looked out for him gasped tess starting  i have never heard o that  o yestis whispered a young lady of his own rank chosen by his family a doctor of divinitys daughter near his fathers parish of emminster he dont much care for her they say  but he is sure to marry her  they had heard so very little of this yet it was enough to build up wretched dolorous dreams upon there in the shade of the night  they pictured all the details of his being won round to consent of the wedding preparations of the brides happiness of her dress and veil of her blissful home with him when oblivion would have fallen upon themselves as far as he and their love were concerned  thus they talked and ached and wept till sleep charmed their sorrow away  after this disclosure tess nourished no further foolish thought that there lurked any grave and deliberate import in clares attentions to her  it was a passing summer love of her face for loves own temporary sakenothing more and the thorny crown of this sad conception was that she whom he really did prefer in a cursory way to the rest she who knew herself to be more impassioned in nature cleverer more beautiful than they was in the eyes of propriety far less worthy of him than the homelier ones whom he ignored    xxiv   amid the oozing fatness and warm ferments of the froom vale at a season when the rush of juices could almost be heard below the hiss of fertilization it was impossible that the most fanciful love should not grow passionate  the ready bosoms existing there were impregnated by their surroundings  july passed over their heads and the thermidorean weather which came in its wake seemed an effort on the part of nature to match the state of hearts at talbothays dairy  the air of the place so fresh in the spring and early summer was stagnant and enervating now  its heavy scents weighed upon them and at midday the landscape seemed lying in a swoon ethiopic scorchings browned the upper slopes of the pastures but there was still bright green herbage here where the watercourses purled  and as clare was oppressed by the outward heats so was he burdened inwardly by waxing fervour of passion for the soft and silent tess  the rains having passed the uplands were dry  the wheels of the dairymans springcart as he sped home from market licked up the pulverized surface of the highway and were followed by white ribands of dust as if they had set a thin powdertrain on fire  the cows jumped wildly over the fivebarred bartongate maddened by the gadfly dairyman crick kept his shirtsleeves permanently rolled up from monday to saturday open windows had no effect in ventilation without open doors and in the dairygarden the blackbirds and thrushes crept about under the currantbushes rather in the manner of quadrupeds than of winged creatures  the flies in the kitchen were lazy teasing and familiar crawling about in the unwonted places on the floors into drawers and over the backs of the milkmaids hands conversations were concerning sunstroke while buttermaking and still more butterkeeping was a despair  they milked entirely in the meads for coolness and convenience without driving in the cows  during the day the animals obsequiously followed the shadow of the smallest tree as it moved round the stem with the diurnal roll and when the milkers came they could hardly stand still for the flies  on one of these afternoons four or five unmilked cows chanced to stand apart from the general herd behind the corner of a hedge among them being dumpling and old pretty who loved tesss hands above those of any other maid  when she rose from her stool under a finished cow angel clare who had been observing her for some time asked her if she would take the aforesaid creatures next  she silently assented and with her stool at arms length and the pail against her knee went round to where they stood  soon the sound of old prettys milk fizzing into the pail came through the hedge and then angel felt inclined to go round the corner also to finish off a hardyielding milcher who had strayed there he being now as capable of this as the dairyman himself  all the men and some of the women when milking dug their foreheads into the cows and gazed into the pail  but a fewmainly the younger onesrested their heads sideways  this was tess durbeyfields habit her temple pressing the milchers flank her eyes fixed on the far end of the meadow with the quiet of one lost in meditation she was milking old pretty thus and the sun chancing to be on the milkingside it shone flat upon her pinkgowned form and her white curtainbonnet and upon her profile rendering it keen as a cameo cut from the dun background of the cow  she did not know that clare had followed her round and that he sat under his cow watching her  the stillness of her head and features was remarkable she might have been in a trance her eyes open yet unseeing  nothing in the picture moved but old prettys tail and tesss pink hands the latter so gently as to be a rhythmic pulsation only as if they were obeying a reflex stimulus like a beating heart  how very lovable her face was to him  yet there was nothing ethereal about it all was real vitality real warmth real incarnation  and it was in her mouth that this culminated  eyes almost as deep and speaking he had seen before and cheeks perhaps as fair brows as arched a chin and throat almost as shapely her mouth he had seen nothing to equal on the face of the earth  to a young man with the least fire in him that little upward lift in the middle of her red top lip was distracting infatuating maddening  he had never before seen a womans lips and teeth which forced upon his mind with such persistent iteration the old elizabethan simile of roses filled with snow  perfect he as a lover might have called them offhand  but nothey were not perfect  and it was the touch of the imperfect upon the wouldbe perfect that gave the sweetness because it was that which gave the humanity  clare had studied the curves of those lips so many times that he could reproduce them mentally with ease and now as they again confronted him clothed with colour and life they sent an aura over his flesh a breeze through his nerves which well nigh produced a qualm and actually produced by some mysterious physiological process a prosaic sneeze  she then became conscious that he was observing her but she would not show it by any change of position though the curious dreamlike fixity disappeared and a close eye might easily have discerned that the rosiness of her face deepened and then faded till only a tinge of it was left  the influence that had passed into clare like an excitation from the sky did not die down  resolutions reticences prudences fears fell back like a defeated battalion  he jumped up from his seat and leaving his pail to be kicked over if the milcher had such a mind went quickly towards the desire of his eyes and kneeling down beside her clasped her in his arms  tess was taken completely by surprise and she yielded to his embrace with unreflecting inevitableness  having seen that it was really her lover who had advanced and no one else her lips parted and she sank upon him in her momentary joy with something very like an ecstatic cry  he had been on the point of kissing that too tempting mouth but he checked himself for tender conscience sake  forgive me tess dear he whispered  i ought to have asked idid not know what i was doing  i do not mean it as a liberty i am devoted to you tessy dearest in all sincerity  old pretty by this time had looked round puzzled and seeing two people crouching under her where by immemorial custom there should have been only one lifted her hind leg crossly  she is angryshe doesnt know what we meanshell kick over the milk exclaimed tess gently striving to free herself her eyes concerned with the quadrupeds actions her heart more deeply concerned with herself and clare  she slipped up from her seat and they stood together his arm still encircling her  tesss eyes fixed on distance began to fill  why do you cry my darling he said  oi dont know she murmured  as she saw and felt more clearly the position she was in she became agitated and tried to withdraw  well i have betrayed my feeling tess at last said he with a curious sigh of desperation signifying unconsciously that his heart had outrun his judgement  that ilove you dearly and truly i need not say  but iit shall go no further nowit distresses youi am as surprised as you are  you will not think i have presumed upon your defencelessnessbeen too quick and unreflecting will you  ni cant tell  he had allowed her to free herself and in a minute or two the milking of each was resumed  nobody had beheld the gravitation of the two into one and when the dairyman came round by that screened nook a few minutes later there was not a sign to reveal that the markedly sundered pair were more to each other than mere acquaintance  yet in the interval since cricks last view of them something had occurred which changed the pivot of the universe for their two natures something which had he known its quality the dairyman would have despised as a practical man yet which was based upon a more stubborn and resistless tendency than a whole heap of socalled practicalities  a veil had been whisked aside the tract of each ones outlook was to have a new horizon thenceforwardfor a short time or for a long   end of phase the third      phase the fourth the consequence    xxv   clare restless went out into the dusk when evening drew on she who had won him having retired to her chamber  the night was as sultry as the day  there was no coolness after dark unless on the grass  roads gardenpaths the housefronts the bartonwalls were warm as hearths and reflected the noontime temperature into the noctambulists face  he sat on the east gate of the dairyyard and knew not what to think of himself  feeling had indeed smothered judgement that day  since the sudden embrace three hours before the twain had kept apart  she seemed stilled almost alarmed at what had occurred while the novelty unpremeditation mastery of circumstance disquieted himpalpitating contemplative being that he was  he could hardly realize their true relations to each other as yet and what their mutual bearing should be before third parties thenceforward  angel had come as pupil to this dairy in the idea that his temporary existence here was to be the merest episode in his life soon passed through and early forgotten he had come as to a place from which as from a screened alcove he could calmly view the absorbing world without and apostrophizing it with walt whitman     crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes   how curious you are to me   resolve upon a plan for plunging into that world anew  but behold the absorbing scene had been imported hither  what had been the engrossing world had dissolved into an uninteresting outer dumbshow while here in this apparently dim and unimpassioned place novelty had volcanically started up as it had never for him started up elsewhere  every window of the house being open clare could hear across the yard each trivial sound of the retiring household  the dairyhouse so humble so insignificant so purely to him a place of constrained sojourn that he had never hitherto deemed it of sufficient importance to be reconnoitred as an object of any quality whatever in the landscape what was it now  the aged and lichened brick gables breathed forth stay  the windows smiled the door coaxed and beckoned the creeper blushed confederacy  a personality within it was so farreaching in her influence as to spread into and make the bricks mortar and whole overhanging sky throb with a burning sensibility  whose was this mighty personality a milkmaids  it was amazing indeed to find how great a matter the life of the obscure dairy had become to him  and though new love was to be held partly responsible for this it was not solely so  many besides angel have learnt that the magnitude of lives is not as to their external displacements but as to their subjective experiences  the impressionable peasant leads a larger fuller more dramatic life than the pachydermatous king  looking at it thus he found that life was to be seen of the same magnitude here as elsewhere  despite his heterodoxy faults and weaknesses clare was a man with a conscience  tess was no insignificant creature to toy with and dismiss but a woman living her precious lifea life which to herself who endured or enjoyed it possessed as great a dimension as the life of the mightiest to himself  upon her sensations the whole world depended to tess through her existence all her fellowcreatures existed to her  the universe itself only came into being for tess on the particular day in the particular year in which she was born  this consciousness upon which he had intruded was the single opportunity of existence ever vouchsafed to tess by an unsympathetic first causeher all her every and only chance  how then should he look upon her as of less consequence than himself as a pretty trifle to caress and grow weary of and not deal in the greatest seriousness with the affection which he knew that he had awakened in herso fervid and so impressionable as she was under her reservein order that it might not agonize and wreck her  to encounter her daily in the accustomed manner would be to develop what had begun  living in such close relations to meet meant to fall into endearment flesh and blood could not resist it and having arrived at no conclusion as to the issue of such a tendency he decided to hold aloof for the present from occupations in which they would be mutually engaged  as yet the harm done was small  but it was not easy to carry out the resolution never to approach her  he was driven towards her by every heave of his pulse  he thought he would go and see his friends  it might be possible to sound them upon this  in less than five months his term here would have ended and after a few additional months spent upon other farms he would be fully equipped in agricultural knowledge and in a position to start on his own account  would not a farmer want a wife and should a farmers wife be a drawingroom waxfigure or a woman who understood farming  notwithstanding the pleasing answer returned to him by the silence he resolved to go his journey  one morning when they sat down to breakfast at talbothays dairy some maid observed that she had not seen anything of mr clare that day  o no said dairyman crick  mr clare has gone hwome to emminster to spend a few days wi his kinsfolk  for four impassioned ones around that table the sunshine of the morning went out at a stroke and the birds muffled their song but neither girl by word or gesture revealed her blankness  hes getting on towards the end of his time wi me added the dairyman with a phlegm which unconsciously was brutal and so i suppose he is beginning to see about his plans elsewhere  how much longer is he to bide here asked izz huett the only one of the gloomstricken bevy who could trust her voice with the question  the others waited for the dairymans answer as if their lives hung upon it retty with parted lips gazing on the tablecloth marian with heat added to her redness tess throbbing and looking out at the meads  well i cant mind the exact day without looking at my memorandumbook replied crick with the same intolerable unconcern and even that may be altered a bit  hell bide to get a little practice in the calving out at the strawyard for certain  hell hang on till the end of the year i should say  four months or so of torturing ecstasy in his societyof pleasure girdled about with pain  after that the blackness of unutterable night   at this moment of the morning angel clare was riding along a narrow lane ten miles distant from the breakfasters in the direction of his fathers vicarage at emminster carrying as well as he could a little basket which contained some blackpuddings and a bottle of mead sent by mrs crick with her kind respects to his parents  the white lane stretched before him and his eyes were upon it but they were staring into next year and not at the lane  he loved her ought he to marry her  dared he to marry her  what would his mother and his brothers say  what would he himself say a couple of years after the event  that would depend upon whether the germs of staunch comradeship underlay the temporary emotion or whether it were a sensuous joy in her form only with no substratum of everlastingness  his fathers hillsurrounded little town the tudor churchtower of red stone the clump of trees near the vicarage came at last into view beneath him and he rode down towards the wellknown gate casting a glance in the direction of the church before entering his home he beheld standing by the vestrydoor a group of girls of ages between twelve and sixteen apparently awaiting the arrival of some other one who in a moment became visible a figure somewhat older than the schoolgirls wearing a broadbrimmed hat and highlystarched cambric morninggown with a couple of books in her hand  clare knew her well  he could not be sure that she observed him he hoped she did not so as to render it unnecessary that he should go and speak to her blameless creature that she was  an overpowering reluctance to greet her made him decide that she had not seen him the young lady was miss mercy chant the only daughter of his fathers neighbour and friend whom it was his parents quiet hope that he might wed some day  she was great at antinomianism and bibleclasses and was plainly going to hold a class now  clares mind flew to the impassioned summersteeped heathens in the var vale their rosy faces courtpatched with cowdroppings and to one the most impassioned of them all  it was on the impulse of the moment that he had resolved to trot over to emminster and hence had not written to apprise his mother and father aiming however to arrive about the breakfast hour before they should have gone out to their parish duties  he was a little late and they had already sat down to the morning meal the group at the table jumped up to welcome him as soon as he entered  they were his father and mother his brother the reverend felixcurate at a town in the adjoining county home for the inside of a fortnightand his other brother the reverend cuthbert the classical scholar and fellow and dean of his college down from cambridge for the long vacation  his mother appeared in a cap and silver spectacles and his father looked what in fact he wasan earnest godfearing man somewhat gaunt in years about sixtyfive his pale face lined with thought and purpose  over their heads hung the picture of angels sister the eldest of the family sixteen years his senior who had married a missionary and gone out to africa  old mr clare was a clergyman of a type which within the last twenty years has well nigh dropped out of contemporary life  a spiritual descendant in the direct line from wycliff huss luther calvin an evangelical of the evangelicals a conversionist a man of apostolic simplicity in life and thought he had in his raw youth made up his mind once for all in the deeper questions of existence and admitted no further reasoning on them thenceforward  he was regarded even by those of his own date and school of thinking as extreme while on the other hand those totally opposed to him were unwillingly won to admiration for his thoroughness and for the remarkable power he showed in dismissing all question as to principles in his energy for applying them  he loved paul of tarsus liked st john hated st james as much as he dared and regarded with mixed feelings timothy titus and philemon  the new testament was less a christiad then a pauliad to his intelligenceless an argument than an intoxication his creed of determinism was such that it almost amounted to a vice and quite amounted on its negative side to a renunciative philosophy which had cousinship with that of schopenhauer and leopardi  he despised the canons and rubric swore by the articles and deemed himself consistent through the whole categorywhich in a way he might have been  one thing he certainly wassincere  to the aesthetic sensuous pagan pleasure in natural life and lush womanhood which his son angel had lately been experiencing in var vale his temper would have been antipathetic in a high degree had he either by inquiry or imagination been able to apprehend it  once upon a time angel had been so unlucky as to say to his father in a moment of irritation that it might have resulted far better for mankind if greece had been the source of the religion of modern civilization and not palestine and his fathers grief was of that blank description which could not realize that there might lurk a thousandth part of a truth much less a half truth or a whole truth in such a proposition  he had simply preached austerely at angel for some time after  but the kindness of his heart was such that he never resented anything for long and welcomed his son today with a smile which was as candidly sweet as a childs  angel sat down and the place felt like home yet he did not so much as formerly feel himself one of the family gathered there  every time that he returned hither he was conscious of this divergence and since he had last shared in the vicarage life it had grown even more distinctly foreign to his own than usual  its transcendental aspirationsstill unconsciously based on the geocentric view of things a zenithal paradise a nadiral hellwere as foreign to his own as if they had been the dreams of people on another planet latterly he had seen only life felt only the great passionate pulse of existence unwarped uncontorted untrammelled by those creeds which futilely attempt to check what wisdom would be content to regulate  on their part they saw a great difference in him a growing divergence from the angel clare of former times  it was chiefly a difference in his manner that they noticed just now particularly his brothers  he was getting to behave like a farmer he flung his legs about the muscles of his face had grown more expressive his eyes looked as much information as his tongue spoke and more  the manner of the scholar had nearly disappeared still more the manner of the drawingroom young man  a prig would have said that he had lost culture and a prude that he had become coarse  such was the contagion of domiciliary fellowship with the talbothays nymphs and swains  after breakfast he walked with his two brothers nonevangelical welleducated hallmarked young men correct to their remotest fibre such unimpeachable models as are turned out yearly by the lathe of a systematic tuition  they were both somewhat shortsighted and when it was the custom to wear a single eyeglass and string they wore a single eyeglass and string when it was the custom to wear a double glass they wore a double glass when it was the custom to wear spectacles they wore spectacles straightway all without reference to the particular variety of defect in their own vision  when wordsworth was enthroned they carried pocket copies and when shelley was belittled they allowed him to grow dusty on their shelves  when correggios holy families were admired they admired correggios holy families when he was decried in favour of velasquez they sedulously followed suit without any personal objection  if these two noticed angels growing social ineptness he noticed their growing mental limitations  felix seemed to him all church cuthbert all college  his diocesan synod and visitations were the mainsprings of the world to the one cambridge to the other  each brother candidly recognized that there were a few unimportant score of millions of outsiders in civilized society persons who were neither university men nor churchmen but they were to be tolerated rather than reckoned with and respected  they were both dutiful and attentive sons and were regular in their visits to their parents  felix though an offshoot from a far more recent point in the devolution of theology than his father was less selfsacrificing and disinterested  more tolerant than his father of a contradictory opinion in its aspect as a danger to its holder he was less ready than his father to pardon it as a slight to his own teaching  cuthbert was upon the whole the more liberalminded though with greater subtlety he had not so much heart  as they walked along the hillside angels former feeling revived in himthat whatever their advantages by comparison with himself neither saw or set forth life as it really was lived  perhaps as with many men their opportunities of observation were not so good as their opportunities of expression  neither had an adequate conception of the complicated forces at work outside the smooth and gentle current in which they and their associates floated  neither saw the difference between local truth and universal truth that what the inner world said in their clerical and academic hearing was quite a different thing from what the outer world was thinking  i suppose it is farming or nothing for you now my dear fellow felix was saying among other things to his youngest brother as he looked through his spectacles at the distant fields with sad austerity  and therefore we must make the best of it  but i do entreat you to endeavour to keep as much as possible in touch with moral ideals  farming of course means roughing it externally but high thinking may go with plain living nevertheless  of course it may said angel  was it not proved nineteen hundred years agoif i may trespass upon your domain a little  why should you think felix that i am likely to drop my high thinking and my moral ideals  well i fancied from the tone of your letters and our conversationit may be fancy onlythat you were somehow losing intellectual grasp  hasnt it struck you cuthbert  now felix said angel drily we are very good friends you know each of us treading our allotted circles but if it comes to intellectual grasp i think you as a contented dogmatist had better leave mine alone and inquire what has become of yours  they returned down the hill to dinner which was fixed at any time at which their fathers and mothers morning work in the parish usually concluded  convenience as regarded afternoon callers was the last thing to enter into the consideration of unselfish mr and mrs clare though the three sons were sufficiently in unison on this matter to wish that their parents would conform a little to modern notions  the walk had made them hungry angel in particular who was now an outdoor man accustomed to the profuse dapes inemptae of the dairymans somewhat coarselyladen table  but neither of the old people had arrived and it was not till the sons were almost tired of waiting that their parents entered  the selfdenying pair had been occupied in coaxing the appetites of some of their sick parishioners whom they somewhat inconsistently tried to keep imprisoned in the flesh their own appetites being quite forgotten  the family sat down to table and a frugal meal of cold viands was deposited before them  angel looked round for mrs cricks blackpuddings which he had directed to be nicely grilled as they did them at the dairy and of which he wished his father and mother to appreciate the marvellous herbal savours as highly as he did himself  ah you are looking for the blackpuddings my dear boy observed clares mother  but i am sure you will not mind doing without them as i am sure your father and i shall not when you know the reason i suggested to him that we should take mrs cricks kind present to the children of the man who can earn nothing just now because of his attacks of delirium tremens and he agreed that it would be a great pleasure to them so we did  of course said angel cheerfully looking round for the mead  i found the mead so extremely alcoholic continued his mother that it was quite unfit for use as a beverage but as valuable as rum or brandy in an emergency so i have put it in my medicinecloset  we never drink spirits at this table on principle added his father  but what shall i tell the dairymans wife said angel  the truth of course said his father  i rather wanted to say we enjoyed the mead and the blackpuddings very much  she is a kind jolly sort of body and is sure to ask me directly i return  you cannot if we did not mr clare answered lucidly  ahno though that mead was a drop of pretty tipple  a what said cuthbert and felix both  ohtis an expression they use down at talbothays replied angel blushing  he felt that his parents were right in their practice if wrong in their want of sentiment and said no more    xxvi   it was not till the evening after family prayers that angel found opportunity of broaching to his father one or two subjects near his heart  he had strung himself up to the purpose while kneeling behind his brothers on the carpet studying the little nails in the heels of their walking boots  when the service was over they went out of the room with their mother and mr clare and himself were left alone  the young man first discussed with the elder his plans for the attainment of his position as a farmer on an extensive scaleeither in england or in the colonies  his father then told him that as he had not been put to the expense of sending angel up to cambridge he had felt it his duty to set by a sum of money every year towards the purchase or lease of land for him some day that he might not feel himself unduly slighted  as far as worldly wealth goes continued his father you will no doubt stand far superior to your brothers in a few years  this considerateness on old mr clares part led angel onward to the other and dearer subject  he observed to his father that he was then sixandtwenty and that when he should start in the farming business he would require eyes in the back of his head to see to all matterssome one would be necessary to superintend the domestic labours of his establishment whilst he was afield  would it not be well therefore for him to marry  his father seemed to think this idea not unreasonable and then angel put the question  what kind of wife do you think would be best for me as a thrifty hardworking farmer  a truly christian woman who will be a help and a comfort to you in your goingsout and your comingsin  beyond that it really matters little  such an one can be found indeed my earnestminded friend and neighbour dr chant  but ought she not primarily to be able to milk cows churn good butter make immense cheeses know how to sit hens and turkeys and rear chickens to direct a field of labourers in an emergency and estimate the value of sheep and calves  yes a farmers wife yes certainly  it would be desirable  mr clare the elder had plainly never thought of these points before i was going to add he said that for a pure and saintly woman you will not find one more to your true advantage and certainly not more to your mothers mind and my own than your friend mercy whom you used to show a certain interest in  it is true that my neighbour chants daughter had lately caught up the fashion of the younger clergy round about us for decorating the communiontablealtar as i was shocked to hear her call it one daywith flowers and other stuff on festival occasions  but her father who is quite as opposed to such flummery as i says that can be cured  it is a mere girlish outbreak which i am sure will not be permanent  yes yes mercy is good and devout i know  but father dont you think that a young woman equally pure and virtuous as miss chant but one who in place of that ladys ecclesiastical accomplishments understands the duties of farm life as well as a farmer himself would suit me infinitely better  his father persisted in his conviction that a knowledge of a farmers wifes duties came second to a pauline view of humanity and the impulsive angel wishing to honour his fathers feelings and to advance the cause of his heart at the same time grew specious he said that fate or providence had thrown in his way a woman who possessed every qualification to be the helpmate of an agriculturist and was decidedly of a serious turn of mind  he would not say whether or not she had attached herself to the sound low church school of his father but she would probably be open to conviction on that point she was a regular churchgoer of simple faith honesthearted receptive intelligent graceful to a degree chaste as a vestal and in personal appearance exceptionally beautiful  is she of a family such as you would care to marry intoa lady in short asked his startled mother who had come softly into the study during the conversation  she is not what in common parlance is called a lady said angel unflinchingly for she is a cottagers daughter as i am proud to say  but she is a lady neverthelessin feeling and nature  mercy chant is of a very good family  poohwhats the advantage of that mother said angel quickly how is family to avail the wife of a man who has to rough it as i have and shall have to do  mercy is accomplished  and accomplishments have their charm returned his mother looking at him through her silver spectacles  as to external accomplishments what will be the use of them in the life i am going to leadwhile as to her reading i can take that in hand  shell be apt pupil enough as you would say if you knew her shes brim full of poetryactualized poetry if i may use the expression  she lives what paperpoets only write  and she is an unimpeachable christian i am sure perhaps of the very tribe genus and species you desire to propagate  o angel you are mocking  mother i beg pardon  but as she really does attend church almost every sunday morning and is a good christian girl i am sure you will tolerate any social shortcomings for the sake of that quality and feel that i may do worse than choose her  angel waxed quite earnest on that rather automatic orthodoxy in his beloved tess which never dreaming that it might stand him in such good stead he had been prone to slight when observing it practised by her and the other milkmaids because of its obvious unreality amid beliefs essentially naturalistic  in their sad doubts as to whether their son had himself any right whatever to the title he claimed for the unknown young woman mr and mrs clare began to feel it as an advantage not to be overlooked that she at least was sound in her views especially as the conjunction of the pair must have arisen by an act of providence for angel never would have made orthodoxy a condition of his choice  they said finally that it was better not to act in a hurry but that they would not object to see her  angel therefore refrained from declaring more particulars now he felt that singleminded and selfsacrificing as his parents were there yet existed certain latent prejudices of theirs as middleclass people which it would require some tact to overcome for though legally at liberty to do as he chose and though their daughterinlaws qualifications could make no practical difference to their lives in the probability of her living far away from them he wished for affections sake not to wound their sentiment in the most important decision of his life  he observed his own inconsistencies in dwelling upon accidents in tesss life as if they were vital features  it was for herself that he loved tess her soul her heart her substancenot for her skill in the dairy her aptness as his scholar and certainly not for her simple formal faithprofessions  her unsophisticated openair existence required no varnish of conventionality to make it palatable to him  he held that education had as yet but little affected the beats of emotion and impulse on which domestic happiness depends  it was probable that in the lapse of ages improved systems of moral and intellectual training would appreciably perhaps considerably elevate the involuntary and even the unconscious instincts of human nature but up to the present day culture as far as he could see might be said to have affected only the mental epiderm of those lives which had been brought under its influence  this belief was confirmed by his experience of women which having latterly been extended from the cultivated middleclass into the rural community had taught him how much less was the intrinsic difference between the good and wise woman of one social stratum and the good and wise woman of another social stratum than between the good and bad the wise and the foolish of the same stratum or class  it was the morning of his departure  his brothers had already left the vicarage to proceed on a walking tour in the north whence one was to return to his college and the other to his curacy  angel might have accompanied them but preferred to rejoin his sweetheart at talbothays  he would have been an awkward member of the party for though the most appreciative humanist the most ideal religionist even the bestversed christologist of the three there was alienation in the standing consciousness that his squareness would not fit the round hole that had been prepared for him  to neither felix nor cuthbert had he ventured to mention tess  his mother made him sandwiches and his father accompanied him on his own mare a little way along the road  having fairly well advanced his own affairs angel listened in a willing silence as they jogged on together through the shady lanes to his fathers account of his parish difficulties and the coldness of brother clergymen whom he loved because of his strict interpretations of the new testament by the light of what they deemed a pernicious calvinistic doctrine  pernicious said mr clare with genial scorn and he proceeded to recount experiences which would show the absurdity of that idea he told of wondrous conversions of evil livers of which he had been the instrument not only amongst the poor but amongst the rich and welltodo and he also candidly admitted many failures  as an instance of the latter he mentioned the case of a young upstart squire named durberville living some forty miles off in the neighbourhood of trantridge  not one of the ancient durbervilles of kingsbere and other places asked his son  that curiously historic wornout family with its ghostly legend of the coachandfour  o no  the original durbervilles decayed and disappeared sixty or eighty years agoat least i believe so  this seems to be a new family which had taken the name for the credit of the former knightly line i hope they are spurious im sure  but it is odd to hear you express interest in old families  i thought you set less store by them even than i  you misapprehend me father you often do said angel with a little impatience  politically i am sceptical as to the virtue of their being old  some of the wise even among themselves exclaim against their own succession as hamlet puts it but lyrically dramatically and even historically i am tenderly attached to them  this distinction though by no means a subtle one was yet too subtle for mr clare the elder and he went on with the story he had been about to relate which was that after the death of the senior socalled durberville the young man developed the most culpable passions though he had a blind mother whose condition should have made him know better  a knowledge of his career having come to the ears of mr clare when he was in that part of the country preaching missionary sermons he boldly took occasion to speak to the delinquent on his spiritual state  though he was a stranger occupying anothers pulpit he had felt this to be his duty and took for his text the words from st luke thou fool this night thy soul shall be required of thee  the young man much resented this directness of attack and in the war of words which followed when they met he did not scruple publicly to insult mr clare without respect for his gray hairs  angel flushed with distress  dear father he said sadly i wish you would not expose yourself to such gratuitous pain from scoundrels  pain said his father his rugged face shining in the ardour of selfabnegation  the only pain to me was pain on his account poor foolish young man  do you suppose his incensed words could give me any pain or even his blows  being reviled we bless being persecuted we suffer it being defamed we entreat we are made as the filth of the world and as the offscouring of all things unto this day  those ancient and noble words to the corinthians are strictly true at this present hour  not blows father  he did not proceed to blows  no he did not  though i have borne blows from men in a mad state of intoxication  no  a dozen times my boy  what then  i have saved them from the guilt of murdering their own flesh and blood thereby and they have lived to thank me and praise god  may this young man do the same said angel fervently  but i fear otherwise from what you say  well hope nevertheless said mr clare  and i continue to pray for him though on this side of the grave we shall probably never meet again  but after all one of those poor words of mine may spring up in his heart as a good seed some day  now as always clares father was sanguine as a child and though the younger could not accept his parents narrow dogma he revered his practice and recognized the hero under the pietist  perhaps he revered his fathers practice even more now than ever seeing that in the question of making tessy his wife his father had not once thought of inquiring whether she were well provided or penniless the same unworldliness was what had necessitated angels getting a living as a farmer and would probably keep his brothers in the position of poor parsons for the term of their activities yet angel admired it none the less  indeed despite his own heterodoxy angel often felt that he was nearer to his father on the human side than was either of his brethren    xxvii   an uphill and downhill ride of twentyodd miles through a garish midday atmosphere brought him in the afternoon to a detached knoll a mile or two west of talbothays whence he again looked into that green trough of sappiness and humidity the valley of the var or froom  immediately he began to descend from the upland to the fat alluvial soil below the atmosphere grew heavier the languid perfume of the summer fruits the mists the hay the flowers formed therein a vast pool of odour which at this hour seemed to make the animals the very bees and butterflies drowsy clare was now so familiar with the spot that he knew the individual cows by their names when a long distance off he saw them dotted about the meads  it was with a sense of luxury that he recognized his power of viewing life here from its inner side in a way that had been quite foreign to him in his studentdays and much as he loved his parents he could not help being aware that to come here as now after an experience of homelife affected him like throwing off splints and bandages even the one customary curb on the humours of english rural societies being absent in this place talbothays having no resident landlord  not a human being was out of doors at the dairy  the denizens were all enjoying the usual afternoon nap of an hour or so which the exceedingly early hours kept in summertime rendered a necessity at the door the woodhooped pails sodden and bleached by infinite scrubbings hung like hats on a stand upon the forked and peeled limb of an oak fixed there for that purpose all of them ready and dry for the evening milking  angel entered and went through the silent passages of the house to the back quarters where he listened for a moment  sustained snores came from the carthouse where some of the men were lying down the grunt and squeal of sweltering pigs arose from the still further distance  the largeleaved rhubarb and cabbage plants slept too their broad limp surfaces hanging in the sun like halfclosed umbrellas  he unbridled and fed his horse and as he reentered the house the clock struck three  three was the afternoon skimminghour and with the stroke clare heard the creaking of the floorboards above and then the touch of a descending foot on the stairs  it was tesss who in another moment came down before his eyes  she had not heard him enter and hardly realized his presence there she was yawning and he saw the red interior of her mouth as if it had been a snakes  she had stretched one arm so high above her coiledup cable of hair that he could see its satin delicacy above the sunburn her face was flushed with sleep and her eyelids hung heavy over their pupils  the brimfulness of her nature breathed from her  it was a moment when a womans soul is more incarnate than at any other time when the most spiritual beauty bespeaks itself flesh and sex takes the outside place in the presentation  then those eyes flashed brightly through their filmy heaviness before the remainder of her face was well awake  with an oddly compounded look of gladness shyness and surprise she exclaimedo mr clare  how you frightened mei  there had not at first been time for her to think of the changed relations which his declaration had introduced but the full sense of the matter rose up in her face when she encountered clares tender look as he stepped forward to the bottom stair  dear darling tessy he whispered putting his arm round her and his face to her flushed cheek  dont for heavens sake mister me any more  i have hastened back so soon because of you  tesss excitable heart beat against his by way of reply and there they stood upon the redbrick floor of the entry the sun slanting in by the window upon his back as he held her tightly to his breast upon her inclining face upon the blue veins of her temple upon her naked arm and her neck and into the depths of her hair  having been lying down in her clothes she was warm as a sunned cat  at first she would not look straight up at him but her eyes soon lifted and his plumbed the deepness of the evervarying pupils with their radiating fibrils of blue and black and gray and violet while she regarded him as eve at her second waking might have regarded adam  ive got to go askimming she pleaded and i have ony old deb to help me today  mrs crick is gone to market with mr crick and retty is not well and the others are gone out somewhere and wont be home till milking  as they retreated to the milkhouse deborah fyander appeared on the stairs  i have come back deborah said mr clare upwards  so i can help tess with the skimming and as you are very tired i am sure you neednt come down till milkingtime  possibly the talbothays milk was not very thoroughly skimmed that afternoon  tess was in a dream wherein familiar objects appeared as having light and shade and position but no particular outline every time she held the skimmer under the pump to cool it for the work her hand trembled the ardour of his affection being so palpable that she seemed to flinch under it like a plant in too burning a sun  then he pressed her again to his side and when she had done running her forefinger round the leads to cut off the creamedge he cleaned it in natures way for the unconstrained manners of talbothays dairy came convenient now  i may as well say it now as later dearest he resumed gently  i wish to ask you something of a very practical nature which i have been thinking of ever since that day last week in the meads  i shall soon want to marry and being a farmer you see i shall require for my wife a woman who knows all about the management of farms  will you be that woman tessy  he put it that way that she might not think he had yielded to an impulse of which his head would disapprove  she turned quite careworn  she had bowed to the inevitable result of proximity the necessity of loving him but she had not calculated upon this sudden corollary which indeed clare had put before her without quite meaning himself to do it so soon  with pain that was like the bitterness of dissolution she murmured the words of her indispensable and sworn answer as an honourable woman  o mr clarei cannot be your wifei cannot be  the sound of her own decision seemed to break tesss very heart and she bowed her face in her grief  but tess he said amazed at her reply and holding her still more greedily close  do you say no  surely you love me  o yes yes  and i would rather be yours than anybodys in the world returned the sweet and honest voice of the distressed girl but i cannot marry you  tess he said holding her at arms length you are engaged to marry some one else  no no  then why do you refuse me  i dont want to marry  i have not thought of doing it  i cannot i only want to love you  but why  driven to subterfuge she stammered  your father is a parson and your mother wouldn like you to marry such as me  she will want you to marry a lady  nonsensei have spoken to them both  that was partly why i went home  i feel i cannotnever never she echoed  is it too sudden to be asked thus my pretty  yesi did not expect it  if you will let it pass please tessy i will give you time he said  it was very abrupt to come home and speak to you all at once ill not allude to it again for a while  she again took up the shining skimmer held it beneath the pump and began anew  but she could not as at other times hit the exact undersurface of the cream with the delicate dexterity required try as she might sometimes she was cutting down into the milk sometimes in the air  she could hardly see her eyes having filled with two blurring tears drawn forth by a grief which to this her best friend and dear advocate she could never explain  i cant skimi cant she said turning away from him  not to agitate and hinder her longer the considerate clare began talking in a more general way  you quite misapprehend my parents  they are the most simplemannered people alive and quite unambitious  they are two of the few remaining evangelical school  tessy are you an evangelical  i dont know  you go to church very regularly and our parson here is not very high they tell me  tesss ideas on the views of the parish clergyman whom she heard every week seemed to be rather more vague than clares who had never heard him at all  i wish i could fix my mind on what i hear there more firmly than i do she remarked as a safe generality  it is often a great sorrow to me  she spoke so unaffectedly that angel was sure in his heart that his father could not object to her on religious grounds even though she did not know whether her principles were high low or broad  he himself knew that in reality the confused beliefs which she held apparently imbibed in childhood were if anything tractarian as to phraseology and pantheistic as to essence  confused or otherwise to disturb them was his last desire         leave thou thy sister when she prays          her early heaven her happy views          nor thou with shadowd hint confuse       a life that leads melodious days   he had occasionally thought the counsel less honest than musical but he gladly conformed to it now  he spoke further of the incidents of his visit of his fathers mode of life of his zeal for his principles she grew serener and the undulations disappeared from her skimming as she finished one lead after another he followed her and drew the plugs for letting down the milk  i fancied you looked a little downcast when you came in she ventured to observe anxious to keep away from the subject of herself  yeswell my father had been talking a good deal to me of his troubles and difficulties and the subject always tends to depress me  he is so zealous that he gets many snubs and buffetings from people of a different way of thinking from himself and i dont like to hear of such humiliations to a man of his age the more particularly as i dont think earnestness does any good when carried so far  he has been telling me of a very unpleasant scene in which he took part quite recently  he went as the deputy of some missionary society to preach in the neighbourhood of trantridge a place forty miles from here and made it his business to expostulate with a lax young cynic he met with somewhere about thereson of some landowner up that wayand who has a mother afflicted with blindness my father addressed himself to the gentleman pointblank and there was quite a disturbance  it was very foolish of my father i must say to intrude his conversation upon a stranger when the probabilities were so obvious that it would be useless  but whatever he thinks to be his duty that hell do in season or out of season and of course he makes many enemies not only among the absolutely vicious but among the easygoing who hate being bothered  he says he glories in what happened and that good may be done indirectly but i wish he would not wear himself out now he is getting old and would leave such pigs to their wallowing  tesss look had grown hard and worn and her ripe mouth tragical but she no longer showed any tremulousness  clares revived thoughts of his father prevented his noticing her particularly and so they went on down the white row of liquid rectangles till they had finished and drained them off when the other maids returned and took their pails and deb came to scald out the leads for the new milk  as tess withdrew to go afield to the cows he said to her softly  and my question tessy  o nono replied she with grave hopelessness as one who had heard anew the turmoil of her own past in the allusion to alec durberville it cant be  she went out towards the mead joining the other milkmaids with a bound as if trying to make the open air drive away her sad constraint  all the girls drew onward to the spot where the cows were grazing in the farther mead the bevy advancing with the bold grace of wild animalsthe reckless unchastened motion of women accustomed to unlimited spacein which they abandoned themselves to the air as a swimmer to the wave  it seemed natural enough to him now that tess was again in sight to choose a mate from unconstrained nature and not from the abodes of art    xxviii   her refusal though unexpected did not permanently daunt clare his experience of women was great enough for him to be aware that the negative often meant nothing more than the preface to the affirmative and it was little enough for him not to know that in the manner of the present negative there lay a great exception to the dallyings of coyness  that she had already permitted him to make love to her he read as an additional assurance not fully trowing that in the fields and pastures to sigh gratis is by no means deemed waste lovemaking being here more often accepted inconsiderately and for its own sweet sake than in the carking anxious homes of the ambitious where a girls craving for an establishment paralyzes her healthy thought of a passion as an end  tess why did you say no in such a positive way he asked her in the course of a few days  she started  dont ask me  i told you whypartly  i am not good enoughnot worthy enough  how  not fine lady enough  yessomething like that murmured she  your friends would scorn me  indeed you mistake themmy father and mother  as for my brothers i dont care  he clasped his fingers behind her back to keep her from slipping away  nowyou did not mean it sweeti am sure you did not  you have made me so restless that i cannot read or play or do anything  i am in no hurry tess but i want to knowto hear from your own warm lipsthat you will some day be mineany time you may choose but some day  she could only shake her head and look away from him  clare regarded her attentively conned the characters of her face as if they had been hieroglyphics  the denial seemed real  then i ought not to hold you in this wayought i  i have no right to youno right to seek out where you are or walk with you honestly tess do you love any other man  how can you ask she said with continued selfsuppression  i almost know that you do not  but then why do you repulse me  i dont repulse you  i like you totell me you love me and you may always tell me so as you go about with meand never offend me  but you will not accept me as a husband  ahthats differentit is for your good indeed my dearest o believe me it is only for your sake  i dont like to give myself the great happiness o promising to be yours in that waybecausebecause i am sure i ought not to do it  but you will make me happy  ahyou think so but you dont know  at such times as this apprehending the grounds of her refusal to be her modest sense of incompetence in matters social and polite he would say that she was wonderfully wellinformed and versatilewhich was certainly true her natural quickness and her admiration for him having led her to pick up his vocabulary his accent and fragments of his knowledge to a surprising extent  after these tender contests and her victory she would go away by herself under the remotest cow if at milkingtime or into the sedge or into her room if at a leisure interval and mourn silently not a minute after an apparently phlegmatic negative  the struggle was so fearful her own heart was so strongly on the side of histwo ardent hearts against one poor little conscience that she tried to fortify her resolution by every means in her power she had come to talbothays with a madeup mind  on no account could she agree to a step which might afterwards cause bitter rueing to her husband for his blindness in wedding her  and she held that what her conscience had decided for her when her mind was unbiassed ought not to be overruled now  why dont somebody tell him all about me she said  it was only forty miles offwhy hasnt it reached here  somebody must know  yet nobody seemed to know nobody told him  for two or three days no more was said  she guessed from the sad countenances of her chamber companions that they regarded her not only as the favourite but as the chosen but they could see for themselves that she did not put herself in his way  tess had never before known a time in which the thread of her life was so distinctly twisted of two strands positive pleasure and positive pain  at the next cheesemaking the pair were again left alone together  the dairyman himself had been lending a hand but mr crick as well as his wife seemed latterly to have acquired a suspicion of mutual interest between these two though they walked so circumspectly that suspicion was but of the faintest anyhow the dairyman left them to themselves  they were breaking up the masses of curd before putting them into the vats  the operation resembled the act of crumbling bread on a large scale and amid the immaculate whiteness of the curds tess durbeyfields hands showed themselves of the pinkness of the rose angel who was filling the vats with his handful suddenly ceased and laid his hands flat upon hers  her sleeves were rolled far above the elbow and bending lower he kissed the inside vein of her soft arm  although the early september weather was sultry her arm from her dabbling in the curds was as cold and damp to his mouth as a newgathered mushroom and tasted of the whey  but she was such a sheaf of susceptibilities that her pulse was accelerated by the touch her blood driven to her finderends and the cool arms flushed hot  then as though her heart had said is coyness longer necessary truth is truth between man and woman as between man and man she lifted her eyes and they beamed devotedly into his as her lip rose in a tender halfsmile  do you know why i did that tess he said  because you love me very much  yes and as a preliminary to a new entreaty  not again  she looked a sudden fear that her resistance might break down under her own desire  o tessy he went on i cannot think why you are so tantalizing why do you disappoint me so  you seem almost like a coquette upon my life you doa coquette of the first urban water  they blow hot and blow cold just as you do and it is the very last sort of thing to expect to find in a retreat like talbothays   and yet dearest he quickly added observing now the remark had cut her i know you to be the most honest spotless creature that ever lived so how can i suppose you a flirt  tess why dont you like the idea of being my wife if you love me as you seem to do  i have never said i dont like the idea and i never could say it becauseit isnt true  the stress now getting beyond endurance her lip quivered and she was obliged to go away  clare was so pained and perplexed that he ran after and caught her in the passage  tell me tell me he said passionately clasping her in forgetfulness of his curdy hands do tell me that you wont belong to anybody but me  i will i will tell you she exclaimed  and i will give you a complete answer if you will let me go now i will tell you my experiencesall about myselfall  your experiences dear yes certainly any number  he expressed assent in loving satire looking into her face  my tess no doubt almost as many experiences as that wild convolvulus out there on the garden hedge that opened itself this morning for the first time tell me anything but dont use that wretched expression any more about not being worthy of me  i will trynot  and ill give you my reasons tomorrownext week  say on sunday  yes on sunday  at last she got away and did not stop in her retreat till she was in the thicket of pollard willows at the lower side of the barton where she could be quite unseen  here tess flung herself down upon the rustling undergrowth of speargrass as upon a bed and remained crouching in palpitating misery broken by momentary shoots of joy which her fears about the ending could not altogether suppress  in reality she was drifting into acquiescence  every seesaw of her breath every wave of her blood every pulse singing in her ears was a voice that joined with nature in revolt against her scrupulousness reckless inconsiderate acceptance of him to close with him at the altar revealing nothing and chancing discovery to snatch ripe pleasure before the iron teeth of pain could have time to shut upon her that was what love counselled and in almost a terror of ecstasy tess divined that despite her many months of lonely selfchastisement wrestlings communings schemes to lead a future of austere isolation loves counsel would prevail  the afternoon advanced and still she remained among the willows she heard the rattle of taking down the pails from the forked stands the waowwaow which accompanied the getting together of the cows but she did not go to the milking  they would see her agitation and the dairyman thinking the cause to be love alone would goodnaturedly tease her and that harassment could not be borne  her lover must have guessed her overwrought state and invented some excuse for her nonappearance for no inquiries were made or calls given  at halfpast six the sun settled down upon the levels with the aspect of a great forge in the heavens and presently a monstrous pumpkinlike moon arose on the other hand  the pollard willows tortured out of their natural shape by incessant choppings became spinyhaired monsters as they stood up against it  she went in and upstairs without a light  it was now wednesday  thursday came and angel looked thoughtfully at her from a distance but intruded in no way upon her  the indoor milkmaids marian and the rest seemed to guess that something definite was afoot for they did not force any remarks upon her in the bedchamber  friday passed saturday  tomorrow was the day  i shall give wayi shall say yesi shall let myself marry himi cannot help it she jealously panted with her hot face to the pillow that night on hearing one of the other girls sigh his name in her sleep  i cant bear to let anybody have him but me yet it is a wrong to him and may kill him when he knows  o my heartooo    xxix   now who mid ye think ive heard news o this morning said dairyman crick as he sat down to breakfast next day with a riddling gaze round upon the munching men and maids now just who mid ye think  one guessed and another guessed  mrs crick did not guess because she knew already  well said the dairyman tis that slacktwisted horesbird of a feller jack dollop  hes lately got married to a widowwoman  not jack dollop  a villainto think o that said a milker  the name entered quickly into tess durbeyfields consciousness for it was the name of the lover who had wronged his sweetheart and had afterwards been so roughly used by the young womans mother in the butterchurn  and had he married the valiant matrons daughter as he promised asked angel clare absently as he turned over the newspaper he was reading at the little table to which he was always banished by mrs crick in her sense of his gentility  not he sir  never meant to replied the dairyman as i say tis a widowwoman and she had money it seemsfifty poun a year or so and that was all he was after  they were married in a great hurry and then she told him that by marrying she had lost her fifty poun a year  just fancy the state o my gentlemans mind at that news never such a catanddog life as theyve been leading ever since serves him well beright  but onluckily the poor woman gets the worst ot  well the silly body should have told en sooner that the ghost of her first man would trouble him said mrs crick  ay ay responded the dairyman indecisively  still you can see exactly how twas  she wanted a home and didnt like to run the risk of losing him  dont ye think that was something like it maidens  he glanced towards the row of girls  she ought to ha told him just before they went to church when he could hardly have backed out exclaimed marian  yes she ought agreed izz  she must have seen what he was after and should ha refused him cried retty spasmodically  and what do you say my dear asked the dairyman of tess  i think she oughtto have told him the true state of thingsor else refused himi dont know replied tess the breadandbutter choking her  be cust if id have done either ot said beck knibbs a married helper from one of the cottages  alls fair in love and war  id ha married en just as she did and if hed said two words to me about not telling him beforehand anything whatsomdever about my first chap that i hadnt chose to tell id ha knocked him down wi the rollingpina scram little feller like he  any woman could do it  the laughter which followed this sally was supplemented only by a sorry smile for forms sake from tess  what was comedy to them was tragedy to her and she could hardly bear their mirth  she soon rose from table and with an impression that clare would soon follow her went along a little wriggling path now stepping to one side of the irrigating channels and now to the other till she stood by the main stream of the var  men had been cutting the waterweeds higher up the river and masses of them were floating past hermoving islands of green crowfoot whereon she might almost have ridden long locks of which weed had lodged against the piles driven to keep the cows from crossing  yes there was the pain of it  this question of a woman telling her storythe heaviest of crosses to herselfseemed but amusement to others  it was as if people should laugh at martyrdom  tessy came from behind her and clare sprang across the gully alighting beside her feet  my wifesoon  no no i cannot  for your sake o mr clare for your sake i say no  tess  still i say no she repeated  not expecting this he had put his arm lightly round her waist the moment after speaking beneath her hanging tail of hair  the younger dairymaids including tess breakfasted with their hair loose on sunday mornings before building it up extra high for attending church a style they could not adopt when milking with their heads against the cows  if she had said yes instead of no he would have kissed her it had evidently been his intention but her determined negative deterred his scrupulous heart  their condition of domiciliary comradeship put her as the woman to such disadvantage by its enforced intercourse that he felt it unfair to her to exercise any pressure of blandishment which he might have honestly employed had she been better able to avoid him  he released her momentarilyimprisoned waist and withheld the kiss  it all turned on that release  what had given her strength to refuse him this time was solely the tale of the widow told by the dairyman and that would have been overcome in another moment  but angel said no more his face was perplexed he went away  day after day they metsomewhat less constantly than before and thus two or three weeks went by  the end of september drew near and she could see in his eye that he might ask her again  his plan of procedure was different nowas though he had made up his mind that her negatives were after all only coyness and youth startled by the novelty of the proposal  the fitful evasiveness of her manner when the subject was under discussion countenanced the idea  so he played a more coaxing game and while never going beyond words or attempting the renewal of caresses he did his utmost orally  in this way clare persistently wooed her in undertones like that of the purling milkat the cows side at skimmings at buttermakings at cheesemakings among broody poultry and among farrowing pigsas no milkmaid was ever wooed before by such a man  tess knew that she must break down  neither a religious sense of a certain moral validity in the previous union nor a conscientious wish for candour could hold out against it much longer  she loved him so passionately and he was so godlike in her eyes and being though untrained instinctively refined her nature cried for his tutelary guidance  and thus though tess kept repeating to herself i can never be his wife the words were vain  a proof of her weakness lay in the very utterance of what calm strength would not have taken the trouble to formulate  every sound of his voice beginning on the old subject stirred her with a terrifying bliss and she coveted the recantation she feared  his manner waswhat mans is notso much that of one who would love and cherish and defend her under any conditions changes charges or revelations that her gloom lessened as she basked in it the season meanwhile was drawing onward to the equinox and though it was still fine the days were much shorter  the dairy had again worked by morning candlelight for a long time and a fresh renewal of clares pleading occurred one morning between three and four  she had run up in her bedgown to his door to call him as usual then had gone back to dress and call the others and in ten minutes was walking to the head of the stairs with the candle in her hand  at the same moment he came down his steps from above in his shirtsleeves and put his arm across the stairway  now miss flirt before you go down he said peremptorily it is a fortnight since i spoke and this wont do any longer  you must tell me what you mean or i shall have to leave this house  my door was ajar just now and i saw you  for your own safety i must go  you dont know  well  is it to be yes at last  i am only just up mr clare and it is too early to take me to task she pouted  you need not call me flirt  tis cruel and untrue  wait till by and by  please wait till by and by  i will really think seriously about it between now and then  let me go downstairs  she looked a little like what he said she was as holding the candle sideways she tried to smile away the seriousness of her words  call me angel then and not mr clare  angel  angel dearestwhy not  twould mean that i agree wouldnt it  it would only mean that you love me even if you cannot marry me and you were so good as to own that long ago  very well then angel dearest if i must she murmured looking at her candle a roguish curl coming upon her mouth notwithstanding her suspense  clare had resolved never to kiss her until he had obtained her promise but somehow as tess stood there in her prettily tuckedup milking gown her hair carelessly heaped upon her head till there should be leisure to arrange it when skimming and milking were done he broke his resolve and brought his lips to her cheek for one moment  she passed downstairs very quickly never looking back at him or saying another word  the other maids were already down and the subject was not pursued  except marian they all looked wistfully and suspiciously at the pair in the sad yellow rays which the morning candles emitted in contrast with the first cold signals of the dawn without  when skimming was donewhich as the milk diminished with the approach of autumn was a lessening process day by dayretty and the rest went out  the lovers followed them  our tremulous lives are so different from theirs are they not he musingly observed to her as he regarded the three figures tripping before him through the frigid pallor of opening day  not so very different i think she said  why do you think that  there are very few womens lives that are nottremulous tess replied pausing over the new word as if it impressed her  theres more in those three than you think  what is in them  almost either of em she began would makeperhaps would makea properer wife than i  and perhaps they love you as well as ialmost  o tessy  there were signs that it was an exquisite relief to her to hear the impatient exclamation though she had resolved so intrepidly to let generosity make one bid against herself  that was now done and she had not the power to attempt selfimmolation a second time then they were joined by a milker from one of the cottages and no more was said on that which concerned them so deeply  but tess knew that this day would decide it  in the afternoon several of the dairymans household and assistants went down to the meads as usual a long way from the dairy where many of the cows were milked without being driven home  the supply was getting less as the animals advanced in calf and the supernumerary milkers of the lush green season had been dismissed  the work progressed leisurely  each pailful was poured into tall cans that stood in a large springwaggon which had been brought upon the scene and when they were milked the cows trailed away dairyman crick who was there with the rest his wrapper gleaming miraculously white against a leaden evening sky suddenly looked at his heavy watch  why tis later than i thought he said  begad  we shant be soon enough with this milk at the station if we dont mind  theres no time today to take it home and mix it with the bulk afore sending off  it must go to station straight from here  wholl drive it across  mr clare volunteered to do so though it was none of his business asking tess to accompany him  the evening though sunless had been warm and muggy for the season and tess had come out with her milkinghood only nakedarmed and jacketless certainly not dressed for a drive  she therefore replied by glancing over her scant habiliments but clare gently urged her  she assented by relinquishing her pail and stool to the dairyman to take home and mounted the springwaggon beside clare    xxx   in the diminishing daylight they went along the level roadway through the meads which stretched away into gray miles and were backed in the extreme edge of distance by the swarthy and abrupt slopes of egdon heath  on its summit stood clumps and stretches of firtrees whose notched tips appeared like battlemented towers crowning blackfronted castles of enchantment  they were so absorbed in the sense of being close to each other that they did not begin talking for a long while the silence being broken only by the clucking of the milk in the tall cans behind them the lane they followed was so solitary that the hazel nuts had remained on the boughs till they slipped from their shells and the blackberries hung in heavy clusters  every now and then angel would fling the lash of his whip round one of these pluck it off and give it to his companion  the dull sky soon began to tell its meaning by sending down heralddrops of rain and the stagnant air of the day changed into a fitful breeze which played about their faces  the quicksilvery glaze on the rivers and pools vanished from broad mirrors of light they changed to lustreless sheets of lead with a surface like a rasp  but that spectacle did not affect her preoccupation  her countenance a natural carnation slightly embrowned by the season had deepened its tinge with the beating of the raindrops and her hair which the pressure of the cows flanks had as usual caused to tumble down from its fastenings and stray beyond the curtain of her calico bonnet was made clammy by the moisture till it hardly was better than seaweed  i ought not to have come i suppose she murmured looking at the sky  i am sorry for the rain said he  but how glad i am to have you here  remote egdon disappeared by degree behind the liquid gauze  the evening grew darker and the roads being crossed by gates it was not safe to drive faster than at a walking pace  the air was rather chill  i am so afraid you will get cold with nothing upon your arms and shoulders he said  creep close to me and perhaps the drizzle wont hurt you much  i should be sorrier still if i did not think that the rain might be helping me  she imperceptibly crept closer and he wrapped round them both a large piece of sailcloth which was sometimes used to keep the sun off the milkcans  tess held it from slipping off him as well as herself clares hands being occupied  now we are all right again  ahno we are not  it runs down into my neck a little and it must still more into yours  thats better your arms are like wet marble tess  wipe them in the cloth  now if you stay quiet you will not get another drop  well dearabout that question of minethat longstanding question  the only reply that he could hear for a little while was the smack of the horses hoofs on the moistening road and the cluck of the milk in the cans behind them  do you remember what you said  i do she replied  before we get home mind  ill try  he said no more then  as they drove on the fragment of an old manor house of caroline date rose against the sky and was in due course passed and left behind  that he observed to entertain her is an interesting old placeone of the several seats which belonged to an ancient norman family formerly of great influence in this county the durbervilles i never pass one of their residences without thinking of them  there is something very sad in the extinction of a family of renown even if it was fierce domineering feudal renown  yes said tess  they crept along towards a point in the expanse of shade just at hand at which a feeble light was beginning to assert its presence a spot where by day a fitful white streak of steam at intervals upon the dark green background denoted intermittent moments of contact between their secluded world and modern life  modern life stretched out its steam feeler to this point three or four times a day touched the native existences and quickly withdrew its feeler again as if what it touched had been uncongenial  they reached the feeble light which came from the smoky lamp of a little railway station a poor enough terrestrial star yet in one sense of more importance to talbothays dairy and mankind than the celestial ones to which it stood in such humiliating contrast  the cans of new milk were unladen in the rain tess getting a little shelter from a neighbouring holly tree  then there was the hissing of a train which drew up almost silently upon the wet rails and the milk was rapidly swung can by can into the truck  the light of the engine flashed for a second upon tess durbeyfields figure motionless under the great holly tree  no object could have looked more foreign to the gleaming cranks and wheels than this unsophisticated girl with the round bare arms the rainy face and hair the suspended attitude of a friendly leopard at pause the print gown of no date or fashion and the cotton bonnet drooping on her brow  she mounted again beside her lover with a mute obedience characteristic of impassioned natures at times and when they had wrapped themselves up over head and ears in the sailcloth again they plunged back into the now thick night  tess was so receptive that the few minutes of contact with the whirl of material progress lingered in her thought  londoners will drink it at their breakfasts tomorrow wont they she asked  strange people that we have never seen  yesi suppose they will  though not as we send it  when its strength has been lowered so that it may not get up into their heads  noble men and noble women ambassadors and centurions ladies and tradeswomen and babies who have never seen a cow  well yes perhaps particularly centurions  who dont know anything of us and where it comes from or think how we two drove miles across the moor tonight in the rain that it might reach em in time  we did not drive entirely on account of these precious londoners we drove a little on our ownon account of that anxious matter which you will i am sure set at rest dear tess  now permit me to put it in this way  you belong to me already you know your heart i mean does it not  you know as well as i  o yesyes  then if your heart does why not your hand  my only reason was on account of youon account of a question  i have something to tell you  but suppose it to be entirely for my happiness and my worldly convenience also  o yes if it is for your happiness and worldly convenience  but my life before i came herei want  well it is for my convenience as well as my happiness  if i have a very large farm either english or colonial you will be invaluable as a wife to me better than a woman out of the largest mansion in the country  so pleaseplease dear tessy disabuse your mind of the feeling that you will stand in my way  but my history  i want you to know ityou must let me tell youyou will not like me so well  tell it if you wish to dearest  this precious history then  yes i was born at so and so anno domini  i was born at marlott she said catching at his words as a help lightly as they were spoken  and i grew up there and i was in the sixth standard when i left school and they said i had great aptness and should make a good teacher so it was settled that i should be one  but there was trouble in my family father was not very industrious and he drank a little  yes yes  poor child  nothing new  he pressed her more closely to his side  and thenthere is something very unusual about itabout me  ii was  tesss breath quickened  yes dearest  never mind  iiam not a durbeyfield but a durbervillea descendant of the same family as those that owned the old house we passed  andwe are all gone to nothing  a durbervilleindeed  and is that all the trouble dear tess  yes she answered faintly  wellwhy should i love you less after knowing this  i was told by the dairyman that you hated old families  he laughed  well it is true in one sense  i do hate the aristocratic principle of blood before everything and do think that as reasoners the only pedigrees we ought to respect are those spiritual ones of the wise and virtuous without regard to corporal paternity  but i am extremely interested in this newsyou can have no idea how interested i am  are you not interested yourself in being one of that wellknown line  no  i have thought it sadespecially since coming here and knowing that many of the hills and fields i see once belonged to my fathers people  but other hills and field belonged to rettys people and perhaps others to marians so that i dont value it particularly  yesit is surprising how many of the present tillers of the soil were once owners of it and i sometimes wonder that a certain school of politicians dont make capital of the circumstance but they dont seem to know it  i wonder that i did not see the resemblance of your name to durberville and trace the manifest corruption  and this was the carking secret  she had not told  at the last moment her courage had failed her she feared his blame for not telling him sooner and her instinct of selfpreservation was stronger than her candour  of course continued the unwitting clare i should have been glad to know you to be descended exclusively from the longsuffering dumb unrecorded rank and file of the english nation and not from the selfseeking few who made themselves powerful at the expense of the rest  but i am corrupted away from that by my affection for you tess he laughed as he spoke and made selfish likewise  for your own sake i rejoice in your descent  society is hopelessly snobbish and this fact of your extraction may make an appreciable difference to its acceptance of you as my wife after i have made you the wellread woman that i mean to make you  my mother too poor soul will think so much better of you on account of it  tess you must spell your name correctlydurbervillefrom this very day  i like the other way rather best  but you must dearest  good heavens why dozens of mushroom millionaires would jump at such a possession  by the bye theres one of that kidney who has taken the namewhere have i heard of himup in the neighbourhood of the chase i think  why he is the very man who had that rumpus with my father i told you of  what an odd coincidence  angel i think i would rather not take the name  it is unlucky perhaps  she was agitated  now then mistress teresa durberville i have you  take my name and so you will escape yours  the secret is out so why should you any longer refuse me  if it is sure to make you happy to have me as your wife and you feel that you do wish to marry me very very much  i do dearest of course  i mean that it is only your wanting me very much and being hardly able to keep alive without me whatever my offences that would make me feel i ought to say i will  you willyou do say it i know  you will be mine for ever and ever  he clasped her close and kissed her  yes  she had no sooner said it than she burst into a dry hard sobbing so violent that it seemed to rend her  tess was not a hysterical girl by any means and he was surprised  why do you cry dearest  i cant tellquitei am so glad to thinkof being yours and making you happy  but this does not seem very much like gladness my tessy  i meani cry because i have broken down in my vow  i said i would die unmarried  but if you love me you would like me to be your husband  yes yes yes  but o i sometimes wish i had never been born  now my dear tess if i did not know that you are very much excited and very inexperienced i should say that remark was not very complimentary  how came you to wish that if you care for me  do you care for me  i wish you would prove it in some way  how can i prove it more than i have done she cried in a distraction of tenderness  will this prove it more  she clasped his neck and for the first time clare learnt what an impassioned womans kisses were like upon the lips of one whom she loved with all her heart and soul as tess loved him  therenow do you believe she asked flushed and wiping her eyes  yes i never really doubtednever never  so they drove on through the gloom forming one bundle inside the sailcloth the horse going as he would and the rain driving against them  she had consented  she might as well have agreed at first the appetite for joy which pervades all creation that tremendous force which sways humanity to its purpose as the tide sways the helpless weed was not to be controlled by vague lucubrations over the social rubric  i must write to my mother she said  you dont mind my doing that  of course not dear child  you are a child to me tess not to know how very proper it is to write to your mother at such a time and how wrong it would be in me to object  where does she live  at the same placemarlott  on the further side of blackmoor vale  ah then i have seen you before this summer  yes at that dance on the green but you would not dance with me o i hope that is of no illomen for us now    xxxi   tess wrote a most touching and urgent letter to her mother the very next day and by the end of the week a response to her communication arrived in joan durbeyfields wandering lastcentury hand      dear tess     j write these few lines hoping they will find you well    as they leave me at present thank god for it  dear    tess we are all glad to hear that you are going really    to be married soon  but with respect to your question    tess j say between ourselves quite private but very    strong that on no account do you say a word of your    bygone trouble to him  j did not tell everything    to your father he being so proud on account of his    respectability which perhaps your intended is    the same  many a womansome of the highest in the    landhave had a trouble in their time and why should    you trumpet yours when others dont trumpet theirs  no    girl would be such a fool specially as it is so long    ago and not your fault at all  j shall answer the    same if you ask me fifty times  besides you must bear    in mind that knowing it to be your childish nature to    tell all thats in your heartso simplej made you    promise me never to let it out by word or deed having    your welfare in my mind and you most solemnly did    promise it going from this door  j have not named    either that question or your coming marriage to your    father as he would blab it everywhere poor simple    man     dear tess keep up your spirits and we mean to send    you a hogshead of cyder for you wedding knowing there    is not much in your parts and thin sour stuff what    there is  so no more at present and with kind love    to your young manfrom your affectte mother     j durbeyfield   o mother mother murmured tess  she was recognizing how light was the touch of events the most oppressive upon mrs durbeyfields elastic spirit  her mother did not see life as tess saw it  that haunting episode of bygone days was to her mother but a passing accident  but perhaps her mother was right as to the course to be followed whatever she might be in her reasons  silence seemed on the face of it best for her adored ones happiness silence it should be  thus steadied by a command from the only person in the world who had any shadow of right to control her action tess grew calmer  the responsibility was shifted and her heart was lighter than it had been for weeks  the days of declining autumn which followed her assent beginning with the month of october formed a season through which she lived in spiritual altitudes more nearly approaching ecstasy than any other period of her life  there was hardly a touch of earth in her love for clare  to her sublime trustfulness he was all that goodness could beknew all that a guide philosopher and friend should know  she thought every line in the contour of his person the perfection of masculine beauty his soul the soul of a saint his intellect that of a seer  the wisdom of her love for him as love sustained her dignity she seemed to be wearing a crown  the compassion of his love for her as she saw it made her lift up her heart to him in devotion  he would sometimes catch her large worshipful eyes that had no bottom to them looking at him from their depths as if she saw something immortal before her  she dismissed the pasttrod upon it and put it out as one treads on a coal that is smouldering and dangerous  she had not known that men could be so disinterested chivalrous protective in their love for women as he  angel clare was far from all that she thought him in this respect absurdly far indeed but he was in truth more spiritual than animal he had himself well in hand and was singularly free from grossness  though not coldnatured he was rather bright than hotless byronic than shelleyan could love desperately but with a love more especially inclined to the imaginative and ethereal it was a fastidious emotion which could jealously guard the loved one against his very self this amazed and enraptured tess whose slight experiences had been so infelicitous till now and in her reaction from indignation against the male sex she swerved to excess of honour for clare  they unaffectedly sought each others company in her honest faith she did not disguise her desire to be with him  the sum of her instincts on this matter if clearly stated would have been that the elusive quality of her sex which attracts men in general might be distasteful to so perfect a man after an avowal of love since it must in its very nature carry with it a suspicion of art  the country custom of unreserved comradeship out of doors during betrothal was the only custom she knew and to her it had no strangeness though it seemed oddly anticipative to clare till he saw how normal a thing she in common with all the other dairyfolk regarded it  thus during this october month of wonderful afternoons they roved along the meads by creeping paths which followed the brinks of trickling tributary brooks hopping across by little wooden bridges to the other side and back again  they were never out of the sound of some purling weir whose buzz accompanied their own murmuring while the beams of the sun almost as horizontal as the mead itself formed a pollen of radiance over the landscape  they saw tiny blue fogs in the shadows of trees and hedges all the time that there was bright sunshine elsewhere  the sun was so near the ground and the sward so flat that the shadows of clare and tess would stretch a quarter of a mile ahead of them like two long fingers pointing afar to where the green alluvial reaches abutted against the sloping sides of the vale  men were at work here and therefor it was the season for taking up the meadows or digging the little waterways clear for the winter irrigation and mending their banks where trodden down by the cows the shovelfuls of loam black as jet brought there by the river when it was as wide as the whole valley were an essence of soils pounded champaigns of the past steeped refined and subtilized to extraordinary richness out of which came all the fertility of the mead and of the cattle grazing there  clare hardily kept his arm round her waist in sight of these watermen with the air of a man who was accustomed to public dalliance though actually as shy as she who with lips parted and eyes askance on the labourers wore the look of a wary animal the while  you are not ashamed of owning me as yours before them she said gladly  o no  but if it should reach the ears of your friends at emminster that you are walking about like this with me a milkmaid  the most bewitching milkmaid ever seen  they might feel it a hurt to their dignity  my dear girla durberville hurt the dignity of a clare  it is a grand card to playthat of your belonging to such a family and i am reserving it for a grand effect when we are married and have the proofs of your descent from parson tringham  apart from that my future is to be totally foreign to my familyit will not affect even the surface of their lives  we shall leave this part of englandperhaps england itselfand what does it matter how people regard us here  you will like going will you not  she could answer no more than a bare affirmative so great was the emotion aroused in her at the thought of going through the world with him as his own familiar friend  her feelings almost filled her ears like a babble of waves and surged up to her eyes  she put her hand in his and thus they went on to a place where the reflected sun glared up from the river under a bridge with a moltenmetallic glow that dazzled their eyes though the sun itself was hidden by the bridge  they stood still whereupon little furred and feathered heads popped up from the smooth surface of the water but finding that the disturbing presences had paused and not passed by they disappeared again  upon this riverbrink they lingered till the fog began to close round themwhich was very early in the evening at this time of the yearsettling on the lashes of her eyes where it rested like crystals and on his brows and hair  they walked later on sundays when it was quite dark  some of the dairypeople who were also out of doors on the first sunday evening after their engagement heard her impulsive speeches ecstasized to fragments though they were too far off to hear the words discoursed noted the spasmodic catch in her remarks broken into syllables by the leapings of her heart as she walked leaning on his arm her contented pauses the occasional little laugh upon which her soul seemed to ridethe laugh of a woman in company with the man she loves and has won from all other womenunlike anything else in nature  they marked the buoyancy of her tread like the skim of a bird which has not quite alighted  her affection for him was now the breath and life of tesss being it enveloped her as a photosphere irradiated her into forgetfulness of her past sorrows keeping back the gloomy spectres that would persist in their attempts to touch herdoubt fear moodiness care shame she knew that they were waiting like wolves just outside the circumscribing light but she had long spells of power to keep them in hungry subjection there  a spiritual forgetfulness coexisted with an intellectual remembrance  she walked in brightness but she knew that in the background those shapes of darkness were always spread  they might be receding or they might be approaching one or the other a little every day   one evening tess and clare were obliged to sit indoors keeping house all the other occupants of the domicile being away  as they talked she looked thoughtfully up at him and met his two appreciative eyes  i am not worthy of youno i am not she burst out jumping up from her low stool as though appalled at his homage and the fulness of her own joy thereat  clare deeming the whole basis of her excitement to be that which was only the smaller part of it said  i wont have you speak like it dear tess  distinction does not consist in the facile use of a contemptible set of conventions but in being numbered among those who are true and honest and just and pure and lovely and of good reportas you are my tess  she struggled with the sob in her throat  how often had that string of excellences made her young heart ache in church of late years and how strange that he should have cited them now  why didnt you stay and love me when iwas sixteen living with my little sisters and brothers and you danced on the green  o why didnt you why didnt you she said impetuously clasping her hands  angel began to comfort and reassure her thinking to himself truly enough what a creature of moods she was and how careful he would have to be of her when she depended for her happiness entirely on him  ahwhy didnt i stay he said  that is just what i feel  if i had only known  but you must not be so bitter in your regretwhy should you be  with the womans instinct to hide she diverged hastily  i should have had four years more of your heart than i can ever have now  then i should not have wasted my time as i have donei should have had so much longer happiness  it was no mature woman with a long dark vista of intrigue behind her who was tormented thus but a girl of simple life not yet oneand twenty who had been caught during her days of immaturity like a bird in a springe  to calm herself the more completely she rose from her little stool and left the room overturning the stool with her skirts as she went  he sat on by the cheerful firelight thrown from a bundle of green ashsticks laid across the dogs the sticks snapped pleasantly and hissed out bubbles of sap from their ends  when she came back she was herself again  do you not think you are just a wee bit capricious fitful tess he said goodhumouredly as he spread a cushion for her on the stool and seated himself in the settle beside her  i wanted to ask you something and just then you ran away  yes perhaps i am capricious she murmured  she suddenly approached him and put a hand upon each of his arms  no angel i am not really soby nature i mean  the more particularly to assure him that she was not she placed herself close to him in the settle and allowed her head to find a restingplace against clares shoulder  what did you want to ask mei am sure i will answer it she continued humbly  well you love me and have agreed to marry me and hence there follows a thirdly when shall the day be  i like living like this  but i must think of starting in business on my own hook with the new year or a little later  and before i get involved in the multifarious details of my new position i should like to have secured my partner  but she timidly answered to talk quite practically wouldnt it be best not to marry till after all thatthough i cant bear the thought o your going away and leaving me here  of course you cannotand it is not best in this case  i want you to help me in many ways in making my start when shall it be  why not a fortnight from now  no she said becoming grave i have so many things to think of first  but  he drew her gently nearer to him  the reality of marriage was startling when it loomed so near  before discussion of the question had proceeded further there walked round the corner of the settle into the full firelight of the apartment mr dairyman crick mrs crick and two of the milkmaids  tess sprang like an elastic ball from his side to her feet while her face flushed and her eyes shone in the firelight  i knew how it would be if i sat so close to him she cried with vexation  i said to myself they are sure to come and catch us but i wasnt really sitting on his knee though it might ha seemed as if i was almost  wellif so be you hadnt told us i am sure we shouldnt ha noticed that ye had been sitting anywhere at all in this light replied the dairyman  he continued to his wife with the stolid mien of a man who understood nothing of the emotions relating to matrimonynow christianer that shows that folks should never fancy other folks be supposing things when they baint  o no i should never ha thought a word of where she was a sitting to if she hadnt told menot i  we are going to be married soon said clare with improvised phlegm  ahand be ye  well i am truly glad to hear it sir  ive thought you mid do such a thing for some time  shes too good for a dairymaidi said so the very first day i zid herand a prize for any man and whats more a wonderful woman for a gentlemanfarmers wife he wont be at the mercy of his baily wi her at his side  somehow tess disappeared  she had been even more struck with the look of the girls who followed crick than abashed by cricks blunt praise  after supper when she reached her bedroom they were all present  a light was burning and each damsel was sitting up whitely in her bed awaiting tess the whole like a row of avenging ghosts  but she saw in a few moments that there was no malice in their mood they could scarcely feel as a loss what they had never expected to have  their condition was objective contemplative  hes going to marry her murmured retty never taking eyes off tess  how her face do show it  you be going to marry him asked marian  yes said tess  when  some day  they thought that this was evasiveness only  yesgoing to marry hima gentleman repeated izz huett  and by a sort of fascination the three girls one after another crept out of their beds and came and stood barefooted round tess retty put her hands upon tesss shoulders as if to realize her friends corporeality after such a miracle and the other two laid their arms round her waist all looking into her face  how it do seem  almost more than i can think of said izz huett  marian kissed tess  yes she murmured as she withdrew her lips  was that because of love for her or because other lips have touched there by now continued izz drily to marian  i wasnt thinking o that said marian simply  i was ony feeling all the strangeness otthat she is to be his wife and nobody else i dont say nay to it nor either of us because we did not think of itonly loved him  still nobody else is to marryn in the worldno fine lady nobody in silks and satins but she who do live like we  are you sure you dont dislike me for it said tess in a low voice  they hung about her in their white nightgowns before replying as if they considered their answer might lie in her look  i dont knowi dont know murmured retty priddle  i want to hate ee but i cannot  thats how i feel echoed izz and marian  i cant hate her somehow she hinders me  he ought to marry one of you murmured tess  why  you are all better than i  we better than you said the girls in a low slow whisper  no no dear tess  you are she contradicted impetuously  and suddenly tearing away from their clinging arms she burst into a hysterical fit of tears bowing herself on the chest of drawers and repeating incessantly o yes yes yes  having once given way she could not stop her weeping  he ought to have had one of you she cried  i think i ought to make him even now  you would be better for him thani dont know what im saying  o  o  they went up to her and clasped her round but still her sobs tore her  get some water said marian  shes upset by us poor thing poor thing  they gently led her back to the side of her bed where they kissed her warmly  you are best forn said marian  more ladylike and a better scholar than we especially since he had taught ee so much  but even you ought to be proud  you be proud im sure  yes i am she said and i am ashamed at so breaking down  when they were all in bed and the light was out marian whispered across to her  you will think of us when you be his wife tess and of how we told ee that we loved him and how we tried not to hate you and did not hate you and could not hate you because you were his choice and we never hoped to be chose by him  they were not aware that at these words salt stinging tears trickled down upon tesss pillow anew and how she resolved with a bursting heart to tell all her history to angel clare despite her mothers commandto let him for whom she lived and breathed despise her if he would and her mother regard her as a fool rather then preserve a silence which might be deemed a treachery to him and which somehow seemed a wrong to these    xxxii   this penitential mood kept her from naming the weddingday the beginning of november found its date still in abeyance though he asked her at the most tempting times  but tesss desire seemed to be for a perpetual betrothal in which everything should remain as it was then  the meads were changing now but it was still warm enough in early afternoons before milking to idle there awhile and the state of dairywork at this time of year allowed a spare hour for idling looking over the damp sod in the direction of the sun a glistening ripple of gossamer webs was visible to their eyes under the luminary like the track of moonlight on the sea  gnats knowing nothing of their brief glorification wandered across the shimmer of this pathway irradiated as if they bore fire within them then passed out of its line and were quite extinct  in the presence of these things he would remind her that the date was still the question  or he would ask her at night when he accompanied her on some mission invented by mrs crick to give him the opportunity  this was mostly a journey to the farmhouse on the slopes above the vale to inquire how the advanced cows were getting on in the strawbarton to which they were relegated  for it was a time of the year that brought great changes to the world of kine  batches of the animals were sent away daily to this lyingin hospital where they lived on straw till their calves were born after which event and as soon as the calf could walk mother and offspring were driven back to the dairy  in the interval which elapsed before the calves were sold there was of course little milking to be done but as soon as the calf had been taken away the milkmaids would have to set to work as usual  returning from one of these dark walks they reached a great gravelcliff immediately over the levels where they stood still and listened  the water was now high in the streams squirting through the weirs and tinkling under culverts the smallest gullies were all full there was no taking short cuts anywhere and footpassengers were compelled to follow the permanent ways  from the whole extent of the invisible vale came a multitudinous intonation it forced upon their fancy that a great city lay below them and that the murmur was the vociferation of its populace  it seems like tens of thousands of them said tess holding publicmeetings in their marketplaces arguing preaching quarrelling sobbing groaning praying and cursing  clare was not particularly heeding  did crick speak to you today dear about his not wanting much assistance during the winter months  no  the cows are going dry rapidly  yes  six or seven went to the strawbarton yesterday and three the day before making nearly twenty in the straw already  ahis it that the farmer dont want my help for the calving  o i am not wanted here any more  and i have tried so hard to  crick didnt exactly say that he would no longer require you  but knowing what our relations were he said in the most goodnatured and respectful manner possible that he supposed on my leaving at christmas i should take you with me and on my asking what he would do without you he merely observed that as a matter of fact it was a time of year when he could do with a very little female help  i am afraid i was sinner enough to feel rather glad that he was in this way forcing your hand  i dont think you ought to have felt glad angel  because tis always mournful not to be wanted even if at the same time tis convenient  well it is convenientyou have admitted that  he put his finger upon her cheek  ah he said  what  i feel the red rising up at her having been caught  but why should i trifle so  we will not triflelife is too serious  it is  perhaps i saw that before you did  she was seeing it then  to decline to marry him after allin obedience to her emotion of last nightand leave the dairy meant to go to some strange place not a dairy for milkmaids were not in request now calvingtime was coming on to go to some arable farm where no divine being like angel clare was  she hated the thought and she hated more the thought of going home  so that seriously dearest tess he continued since you will probably have to leave at christmas it is in every way desirable and convenient that i should carry you off then as my property  besides if you were not the most uncalculating girl in the world you would know that we could not go on like this for ever  i wish we could  that it would always be summer and autumn and you always courting me and always thinking as much of me as you have done through the past summertime  i always shall  o i know you will she cried with a sudden fervour of faith in him  angel i will fix the day when i will become yours for always  thus at last it was arranged between them during that dark walk home amid the myriads of liquid voices on the right and left  when they reached the dairy mr and mrs crick were promptly toldwith injunctions of secrecy for each of the lovers was desirous that the marriage should be kept as private as possible  the dairyman though he had thought of dismissing her soon now made a great concern about losing her  what should he do about his skimming  who would make the ornamental butterpats for the anglebury and sandbourne ladies mrs crick congratulated tess on the shillyshallying having at last come to an end and said that directly she set eyes on tess she divined that she was to be the chosen one of somebody who was no common outdoor man tess had looked so superior as she walked across the barton on that afternoon of her arrival that she was of a good family she could have sworn  in point of fact mrs crick did remember thinking that tess was graceful and goodlooking as she approached but the superiority might have been a growth of the imagination aided by subsequent knowledge  tess was now carried along upon the wings of the hours without the sense of a will  the word had been given the number of the day written down  her naturally bright intelligence had begun to admit the fatalistic convictions common to fieldfolk and those who associate more extensively with natural phenomena than with their fellowcreatures and she accordingly drifted into that passive responsiveness to all things her lover suggested characteristic of the frame of mind  but she wrote anew to her mother ostensibly to notify the weddingday really to again implore her advice  it was a gentleman who had chosen her which perhaps her mother had not sufficiently considered  a postnuptial explanation which might be accepted with a light heart by a rougher man might not be received with the same feeling by him  but this communication brought no reply from mrs durbeyfield  despite angel clares plausible representation to himself and to tess of the practical need for their immediate marriage there was in truth an element of precipitancy in the step as became apparent at a later date  he loved her dearly though perhaps rather ideally and fancifully than with the impassioned thoroughness of her feeling for him  he had entertained no notion when doomed as he had thought to an unintellectual bucolic life that such charms as he beheld in this idyllic creature would be found behind the scenes  unsophistication was a thing to talk of but he had not known how it really struck one until he came here  yet he was very far from seeing his future track clearly and it might be a year or two before he would be able to consider himself fairly started in life  the secret lay in the tinge of recklessness imparted to his career and character by the sense that he had been made to miss his true destiny through the prejudices of his family  dont you think twould have been better for us to wait till you were quite settled in your midland farm she once asked timidly a midland farm was the idea just then  to tell the truth my tess i dont like you to be left anywhere away from my protection and sympathy  the reason was a good one so far as it went  his influence over her had been so marked that she had caught his manner and habits his speech and phrases his likings and his aversions  and to leave her in farmland would be to let her slip back again out of accord with him  he wished to have her under his charge for another reason his parents had naturally desired to see her once at least before he carried her off to a distant settlement english or colonial and as no opinion of theirs was to be allowed to change his intention he judged that a couple of months life with him in lodgings whilst seeking for an advantageous opening would be of some social assistance to her at what she might feel to be a trying ordealher presentation to his mother at the vicarage  next he wished to see a little of the working of a flourmill having an idea that he might combine the use of one with corngrowing  the proprietor of a large old watermill at wellbridgeonce the mill of an abbeyhad offered him the inspection of his timehonoured mode of procedure and a hand in the operations for a few days whenever he should choose to come  clare paid a visit to the place some few miles distant one day at this time to inquire particulars and returned to talbothays in the evening she found him determined to spend a short time at the wellbridge flourmills and what had determined him  less the opportunity of an insight into grinding and bolting than the casual fact that lodgings were to be obtained in that very farmhouse which before its mutilation had been the mansion of a branch of the durberville family  this was always how clare settled practical questions by a sentiment which had nothing to do with them  they decided to go immediately after the wedding and remain for a fortnight instead of journeying to towns and inns  then we will start off to examine some farms on the other side of london that i have heard of he said and by march or april we will pay a visit to my father and mother  questions of procedure such as these arose and passed and the day the incredible day on which she was to become his loomed large in the near future  the thirtyfirst of december new years eve was the date  his wife she said to herself  could it ever be  their two selves together nothing to divide them every incident shared by them why not  and yet why  one sunday morning izz huett returned from church and spoke privately to tess  you was not called home this morning  what  it should ha been the first time of asking today she answered looking quietly at tess  you meant to be married new years eve deary  the other returned a quick affirmative  and there must be three times of asking  and now there be only two sundays left between  tess felt her cheek paling izz was right of course there must be three  perhaps he had forgotten  if so there must be a weeks postponement and that was unlucky  how could she remind her lover she who had been so backward was suddenly fired with impatience and alarm lest she should lose her dear prize  a natural incident relieved her anxiety  izz mentioned the omission of the banns to mrs crick and mrs crick assumed a matrons privilege of speaking to angel on the point  have ye forgot em mr clare  the banns i mean  no i have not forgot em says clare  as soon as he caught tess alone he assured her  dont let them tease you about the banns  a licence will be quieter for us and i have decided on a licence without consulting you so if you go to church on sunday morning you will not hear your own name if you wished to  i didnt wish to hear it dearest she said proudly  but to know that things were in train was an immense relief to tess notwithstanding who had wellnigh feared that somebody would stand up and forbid the banns on the ground of her history  how events were favouring her  i dont quite feel easy she said to herself  all this good fortune may be scourged out of me afterwards by a lot of ill  thats how heaven mostly does  i wish i could have had common banns  but everything went smoothly  she wondered whether he would like her to be married in her present best white frock or if she ought to buy a new one  the question was set at rest by his forethought disclosed by the arrival of some large packages addressed to her inside them she found a whole stock of clothing from bonnet to shoes including a perfect morning costume such as would well suit the simple wedding they planned  he entered the house shortly after the arrival of the packages and heard her upstairs undoing them  a minute later she came down with a flush on her face and tears in her eyes  how thoughtful youve been she murmured her cheek upon his shoulder  even to the gloves and handkerchief  my own lovehow good how kind  no no tess just an order to a tradeswoman in londonnothing more  and to divert her from thinking too highly of him he told her to go upstairs and take her time and see if it all fitted and if not to get the village sempstress to make a few alterations  she did return upstairs and put on the gown  alone she stood for a moment before the glass looking at the effect of her silk attire and then there came into her head her mothers ballad of the mystic robe        that never would become that wife        that had once done amiss   which mrs durbeyfield had used to sing to her as a child so blithely and so archly her foot on the cradle which she rocked to the tune suppose this robe should betray her by changing colour as her robe had betrayed queen guinevere  since she had been at the dairy she had not once thought of the lines till now    xxxiii   angel felt that he would like to spend a day with her before the wedding somewhere away from the dairy as a last jaunt in her company while there were yet mere lover and mistress a romantic day in circumstances that would never be repeated with that other and greater day beaming close ahead of them  during the preceding week therefore he suggested making a few purchases in the nearest town and they started together  clares life at the dairy had been that of a recluse in respect the world of his own class  for months he had never gone near a town and requiring no vehicle had never kept one hiring the dairymans cob or gig if he rode or drove  they went in the gig that day  and then for the first time in their lives they shopped as partners in one concern  it was christmas eve with its loads a holly and mistletoe and the town was very full of strangers who had come in from all parts of the country on account of the day  tess paid the penalty of walking about with happiness superadded to beauty on her countenance by being much stared at as she moved amid them on his arm  in the evening they returned to the inn at which they had put up and tess waited in the entry while angel went to see the horse and gig brought to the door  the general sittingroom was full of guests who were continually going in and out  as the door opened and shut each time for the passage of these the light within the parlour fell full upon tesss face  two men came out and passed by her among the rest  one of them had stared her up and down in surprise and she fancied he was a trantridge man though that village lay so many miles off that trantridge folk were rarities here  a comely maid that said the other  true comely enough  but unless i make a great mistake  and he negatived the remainder of the definition forthwith  clare had just returned from the stableyard and confronting the man on the threshold heard the words and saw the shrinking of tess  the insult to her stung him to the quick and before he had considered anything at all he struck the man on the chin with the full force of his fist sending him staggering backwards into the passage  the man recovered himself and seemed inclined to come on and clare stepping outside the door put himself in a posture of defence  but his opponent began to think better of the matter  he looked anew at tess as he passed her and said to clare  i beg pardon sir twas a complete mistake  i thought she was another woman forty miles from here  clare feeling then that he had been too hasty and that he was moreover to blame for leaving her standing in an innpassage did what he usually did in such cases gave the man five shillings to plaster the blow and thus they parted bidding each other a pacific good night  as soon as clare had taken the reins from the ostler and the young couple had driven off the two men went in the other direction  and was it a mistake said the second one  not a bit of it  but i didnt want to hurt the gentlemans feelingsnot i  in the meantime the lovers were driving onward  could we put off our wedding till a little later tess asked in a dry dull voice  i mean if we wished  no my love  calm yourself  do you mean that the fellow may have time to summon me for assault he asked goodhumouredly  noi only meantif it should have to be put off  what she meant was not very clear and he directed her to dismiss such fancies from her mind which she obediently did as well as she could  but she was grave very grave all the way home till she thought we shall go away a very long distance hundreds of miles from these parts and such as this can never happen again and no ghost of the past reach there  they parted tenderly that night on the landing and clare ascended to his attic  tess sat up getting on with some little requisites lest the few remaining days should not afford sufficient time  while she sat she heard a noise in angels room overhead a sound of thumping and struggling  everybody else in the house was asleep and in her anxiety lest clare should be ill she ran up and knocked at his door and asked him what was the matter  oh nothing dear he said from within  i am so sorry i disturbed you  but the reason is rather an amusing one i fell asleep and dreamt that i was fighting that fellow again who insulted you and the noise you heard was my pummelling away with my fists at my portmanteau which i pulled out today for packing  i am occasionally liable to these freaks in my sleep go to bed and think of it no more  this was the last drachm required to turn the scale of her indecision  declare the past to him by word of mouth she could not but there was another way  she sat down and wrote on the four pages of a notesheet a succinct narrative of those events of three or four years ago put it into an envelope and directed it to clare  then lest the flesh should again be weak she crept upstairs without any shoes and slipped the note under his door  her night was a broken one as it well might be and she listened for the first faint noise overhead  it came as usual he descended as usual  she descended  he met her at the bottom of the stairs and kissed her surely it was as warmly as ever  he looked a little disturbed and worn she thought  but he said not a word to her about her revelation even when they were alone  could he have had it  unless he began the subject she felt that she could say nothing  so the day passed and it was evident that whatever he thought he meant to keep to himself  yet he was frank and affectionate as before  could it be that her doubts were childish that he forgave her that he loved her for what she was just as she was and smiled at her disquiet as at a foolish nightmare  had he really received her note  she glanced into his room and could see nothing of it  it might be that he forgave her  but even if he had not received it she had a sudden enthusiastic trust that he surely would forgive her  every morning and night he was the same and thus new years eve brokethe wedding day  the lovers did not rise at milkingtime having through the whole of this last week of their sojourn at the dairy been accorded something of the position of guests tess being honoured with a room of her own  when they arrived downstairs at breakfasttime they were surprised to see what effects had been produced in the large kitchen for their glory since they had last beheld it  at some unnatural hour of the morning the dairyman had caused the yawning chimneycorner to be whitened and the brick hearth reddened and a blazing yellow damask blower to be hung across the arch in place of the old grimy blue cotton one with a black sprig pattern which had formerly done duty there  this renovated aspect of what was the focus indeed of the room on a full winter morning threw a smiling demeanour over the whole apartment  i was determined to do summat in honour ot said the dairyman and as you wouldnt hear of my gieing a rattling good randy wi fiddles and bassviols complete as we should ha done in old times this was all i could think o as a noiseless thing  tesss friends lived so far off that none could conveniently have been present at the ceremony even had any been asked but as a fact nobody was invited from marlott  as for angels family he had written and duly informed them of the time and assured them that he would be glad to see one at least of them there for the day if he would like to come  his brothers had not replied at all seeming to be indignant with him while his father and mother had written a rather sad letter deploring his precipitancy in rushing into marriage but making the best of the matter by saying that though a dairywoman was the last daughterinlaw they could have expected their son had arrived at an age which he might be supposed to be the best judge  this coolness in his relations distressed clare less than it would have done had he been without the grand card with which he meant to surprise them ere long  to produce tess fresh from the dairy as a durberville and a lady he had felt to be temerarious and risky hence he had concealed her lineage till such time as familiarized with worldly ways by a few months travel and reading with him he could take her on a visit to his parents and impart the knowledge while triumphantly producing her as worthy of such an ancient line it was a pretty lovers dream if no more  perhaps tesss lineage had more value for himself than for anybody in the world beside  her perception that angels bearing towards her still remained in no whit altered by her own communication rendered tess guiltily doubtful if he could have received it  she rose from breakfast before he had finished and hastened upstairs  it had occurred to her to look once more into the queer gaunt room which had been clares den or rather eyrie for so long and climbing the ladder she stood at the open door of the apartment regarding and pondering  she stooped to the threshold of the doorway where she had pushed in the note two or three days earlier in such excitement  the carpet reached close to the sill and under the edge of the carpet she discerned the faint white margin of the envelope containing her letter to him which he obviously had never seen owing to her having in her haste thrust it beneath the carpet as well as beneath the door  with a feeling of faintness she withdrew the letter there it wassealed up just as it had left her hands  the mountain had not yet been removed  she could not let him read it now the house being in full bustle of preparation and descending to her own room she destroyed the letter there  she was so pale when he saw her again that he felt quite anxious the incident of the misplaced letter she had jumped at as if it prevented a confession but she knew in her conscience that it need not there was still time  yet everything was in a stir there was coming and going all had to dress the dairyman and mrs crick having been asked to accompany them as witnesses and reflection or deliberate talk was wellnigh impossible  the only minute tess could get to be alone with clare was when they met upon the landing  i am so anxious to talk to youi want to confess all my faults and blunders she said with attempted lightness  no nowe cant have faults talked ofyou must be deemed perfect today at least my sweet he cried  we shall have plenty of time hereafter i hope to talk over our failings  i will confess mine at the same time  but it would be better for me to do it now i think so that you could not say  well my quixotic one you shall tell me anythingsay as soon as we are settled in our lodging not now  i too will tell you my faults then  but do not let us spoil the day with them they will be excellent matter for a dull time  then you dont wish me to dearest  i do not tessy really  the hurry of dressing and starting left no time for more than this those words of his seemed to reassure her on further reflection she was whirled onward through the next couple of critical hours by the mastering tide of her devotion to him which closed up further meditation  her one desire so long resisted to make herself his to call him her lord her ownthen if necessary to diehad at last lifted her up from her plodding reflective pathway  in dressing she moved about in a mental cloud of manycoloured idealities which eclipsed all sinister contingencies by its brightness  the church was a long way off and they were obliged to drive particularly as it was winter  a closed carriage was ordered from a roadside inn a vehicle which had been kept there ever since the old days of postchaise travelling  it had stout wheelspokes and heavy felloes a great curved bed immense straps and springs and a pole like a batteringram  the postilion was a venerable boy of sixtya martyr to rheumatic gout the result of excessive exposure in youth counteracted by strong liquorswho had stood at inndoors doing nothing for the whole fiveandtwenty years that had elapsed since he had no longer been required to ride professionally as if expecting the old times to come back again  he had a permanent running wound on the outside of his right leg originated by the constant bruisings of aristocratic carriagepoles during the many years that he had been in regular employ at the kings arms casterbridge  inside this cumbrous and creaking structure and behind this decayed conductor the partie carrée took their seatsthe bride and bridegroom and mr and mrs crick  angel would have liked one at least of his brothers to be present as groomsman but their silence after his gentle hint to that effect by letter had signified that they did not care to come  they disapproved of the marriage and could not be expected to countenance it  perhaps it was as well that they could not be present they were not worldly young fellows but fraternizing with dairyfolk would have struck unpleasantly upon their biased niceness apart from their views of the match  upheld by the momentum of the time tess knew nothing of this did not see anything did not know the road they were taking to the church  she knew that angel was close to her all the rest was a luminous mist  she was a sort of celestial person who owed her being to poetryone of those classical divinities clare was accustomed to talk to her about when they took their walks together  the marriage being by licence there were only a dozen or so of people in the church had there been a thousand they would have produced no more effect upon her  they were at stellar distances from her present world  in the ecstatic solemnity with which she swore her faith to him the ordinary sensibilities of sex seemed a flippancy at a pause in the service while they were kneeling together she unconsciously inclined herself towards him so that her shoulder touched his arm she had been frightened by a passing thought and the movement had been automatic to assure herself that he was really there and to fortify her belief that his fidelity would be proof against all things  clare knew that she loved himevery curve of her form showed that but he did not know at that time the full depth of her devotion its singlemindedness its meekness what longsuffering it guaranteed what honesty what endurance what good faith  as they came out of church the ringers swung the bells off their rests and a modest peal of three notes broke forththat limited amount of expression having been deemed sufficient by the church builders for the joys of such a small parish  passing by the tower with her husband on the path to the gate she could feel the vibrant air humming round them from the louvred belfry in the circle of sound and it matched the highlycharged mental atmosphere in which she was living  this condition of mind wherein she felt glorified by an irradiation not her own like the angel whom st john saw in the sun lasted till the sound of the church bells had died away and the emotions of the weddingservice had calmed down  her eyes could dwell upon details more clearly now and mr and mrs crick having directed their own gig to be sent for them to leave the carriage to the young couple she observed the build and character of that conveyance for the first time  sitting in silence she regarded it long  i fancy you seem oppressed tessy said clare  yes she answered putting her hand to her brow  i tremble at many things  it is all so serious angel  among other things i seem to have seen this carriage before to be very well acquainted with it  it is very oddi must have seen it in a dream  ohyou have heard the legend of the durberville coachthat wellknown superstition of this county about your family when they were very popular here and this lumbering old thing reminds you of it  i have never heard of it to my knowledge said she  what is the legendmay i know it  welli would rather not tell it in detail just now  a certain durberville of the sixteenth or seventeenth century committed a dreadful crime in his family coach and since that time members of the family see or hear the old coach wheneverbut ill tell you another dayit is rather gloomy  evidently some dim knowledge of it has been brought back to your mind by the sight of this venerable caravan  i dont remember hearing it before she murmured  is it when we are going to die angel that members of my family see it or is it when we have committed a crime  now tess  he silenced her by a kiss  by the time they reached home she was contrite and spiritless  she was mrs angel clare indeed but had she any moral right to the name was she not more truly mrs alexander durberville  could intensity of love justify what might be considered in upright souls as culpable reticence  she knew not what was expected of women in such cases and she had no counsellor  however when she found herself alone in her room for a few minutesthe last day this on which she was ever to enter itshe knelt down and prayed  she tried to pray to god but it was her husband who really had her supplication  her idolatry of this man was such that she herself almost feared it to be illomened  she was conscious of the notion expressed by friar laurence these violent delights have violent ends  it might be too desperate for human conditionstoo rank to wild too deadly  o my love why do i love you so she whispered there alone for she you love is not my real self but one in my image the one i might have been  afternoon came and with it the hour for departure they had decided to fulfil the plan of going for a few days to the lodgings in the old farmhouse near wellbridge mill at which he meant to reside during his investigation of flour processes  at two oclock there was nothing left to do but to start  all the servantry of the dairy were standing in the redbrick entry to see them go out the dairyman and his wife following to the door  tess saw her three chambermates in a row against the wall pensively inclining their heads  she had much questioned if they would appear at the parting moment but there they were stoical and staunch to the last  she knew why the delicate retty looked so fragile and izz so tragically sorrowful and marian so blank and she forgot her own dogging shadow for a moment in contemplating theirs  she impulsively whispered to him  will you kiss em all once poor things for the first and last time  clare had not the least objection to such a farewell formalitywhich was all that it was to himand as he passed them he kissed them in succession where they stood saying goodbye to each as he did so when they reached the door tess femininely glanced back to discern the effect of that kiss of charity there was no triumph in her glance as there might have been  if there had it would have disappeared when she saw how moved the girls all were  the kiss had obviously done harm by awakening feelings they were trying to subdue  of all this clare was unconscious  passing on to the wicketgate he shook hands with the dairyman and his wife and expressed his last thanks to them for their attentions after which there was a moment of silence before they had moved off  it was interrupted by the crowing of a cock  the white one with the rose comb had come and settled on the palings in front of the house within a few yards of them and his notes thrilled their ears through dwindling away like echoes down a valley of rocks  oh said mrs crick  an afternoon crow  two men were standing by the yard gate holding it open  thats bad one murmured to the other not thinking that the words could be heard by the group at the doorwicket  the cock crew againstraight towards clare  well said the dairyman  i dont like to hear him said tess to her husband  tell the man to drive on  goodbye goodbye  the cock crew again  hoosh  just you be off sir or ill twist your neck said the dairyman with some irritation turning to the bird and driving him away  and to his wife as they went indoors now to think o that just today  ive not heard his crow of an afternoon all the year afore  it only means a change in the weather said she not what you think tis impossible    xxxiv   they drove by the level road along the valley to a distance of a few miles and reaching wellbridge turned away from the village to the left and over the great elizabethan bridge which gives the place half its name  immediately behind it stood the house wherein they had engaged lodgings whose exterior features are so well known to all travellers through the froom valley once portion of a fine manorial residence and the property and seat of a durberville but since its partial demolition a farmhouse  welcome to one of your ancestral mansions said clare as he handed her down  but he regretted the pleasantry it was too near a satire  on entering they found that though they had only engaged a couple of rooms the farmer had taken advantage of their proposed presence during the coming days to pay a new years visit to some friends leaving a woman from a neighbouring cottage to minister to their few wants  the absoluteness of possession pleased them and they realized it as the first moment of their experience under their own exclusive rooftree  but he found that the mouldy old habitation somewhat depressed his bride  when the carriage was gone they ascended the stairs to wash their hands the charwoman showing the way  on the landing tess stopped and started  whats the matter said he  those horrid women she answered with a smile  how they frightened me  he looked up and perceived two lifesize portraits on panels built into the masonry  as all visitors to the mansion are aware these paintings represent women of middle age of a date some two hundred years ago whose lineaments once seen can never be forgotten the long pointed features narrow eye and smirk of the one so suggestive of merciless treachery the billhook nose large teeth and bold eye of the other suggesting arrogance to the point of ferocity haunt the beholder afterwards in his dreams  whose portraits are those asked clare of the charwoman  i have been told by old folk that they were ladies of the durberville family the ancient lords of this manor she said owing to their being builded into the wall they cant be moved away  the unpleasantness of the matter was that in addition to their effect upon tess her fine features were unquestionably traceable in these exaggerated forms  he said nothing of this however and regretting that he had gone out of his way to choose the house for their bridal time went on into the adjoining room  the place having been rather hastily prepared for them they washed their hands in one basin  clare touched hers under the water  which are my fingers and which are yours he said looking up they are very much mixed  they are all yours said she very prettily and endeavoured to be gayer than she was  he had not been displeased with her thoughtfulness on such an occasion it was what every sensible woman would show but tess knew that she had been thoughtful to excess and struggled against it  the sun was so low on that short last afternoon of the year that it shone in through a small opening and formed a golden staff which stretched across to her skirt where it made a spot like a paintmark set upon her  they went into the ancient parlour to tea and here they shared their first common meal alone  such was their childishness or rather his that he found it interesting to use the same breadandbutter plate as herself and to brush crumbs from her lips with his own  he wondered a little that she did not enter into these frivolities with his own zest  looking at her silently for a long time she is a dear dear tess he thought to himself as one deciding on the true construction of a difficult passage  do i realize solemnly enough how utterly and irretrievably this little womanly thing is the creature of my good or bad faith and fortune  i think not  i think i could not unless i were a woman myself  what i am in worldly estate she is  what i become she must become  what i cannot be she cannot be  and shall i ever neglect her or hurt her or even forget to consider her  god forbid such a crime  they sat on over the teatable waiting for their luggage which the dairyman had promised to send before it grew dark  but evening began to close in and the luggage did not arrive and they had brought nothing more than they stood in  with the departure of the sun the calm mood of the winter day changed  out of doors there began noises as of silk smartly rubbed the restful dead leaves of the preceding autumn were stirred to irritated resurrection and whirled about unwillingly and tapped against the shutters  it soon began to rain  that cock knew the weather was going to change said clare  the woman who had attended upon them had gone home for the night but she had placed candles upon the table and now they lit them  each candleflame drew towards the fireplace  these old houses are so draughty continued angel looking at the flames and at the grease guttering down the sides  i wonder where that luggage is  we havent even a brush and comb  i dont know she answered absentminded  tess you are not a bit cheerful this eveningnot at all as you used to be  those harridans on the panels upstairs have unsettled you  i am sorry i brought you here  i wonder if you really love me after all  he knew that she did and the words had no serious intent but she was surcharged with emotion and winced like a wounded animal though she tried not to shed tears she could not help showing one or two  i did not mean it said he sorry  you are worried at not having your things i know  i cannot think why old jonathan has not come with them  why it is seven oclock  ah there he is  a knock had come to the door and there being nobody else to answer it clare went out  he returned to the room with a small package in his hand  it is not jonathan after all he said  how vexing said tess  the packet had been brought by a special messenger who had arrived at talbothays from emminster vicarage immediately after the departure of the married couple and had followed them hither being under injunction to deliver it into nobodys hands but theirs  clare brought it to the light  it was less than a foot long sewed up in canvas sealed in red wax with his fathers seal and directed in his fathers hand to mrs angel clare  it is a little weddingpresent for you tess said he handing it to her  how thoughtful they are  tess looked a little flustered as she took it  i think i would rather have you open it dearest said she turning over the parcel  i dont like to break those great seals they look so serious  please open it for me  he undid the parcel  inside was a case of morocco leather on the top of which lay a note and a key  the note was for clare in the following words      my dear son     possibly you have forgotten that on the death of your    godmother mrs pitney when you were a lad shevain    kind woman that she wasleft to me a portion of the    contents of her jewelcase in trust for your wife if    you should ever have one as a mark of her affection    for you and whomsoever you should choose  this trust    i have fulfilled and the diamonds have been locked up    at my bankers ever since  though i feel it to be a    somewhat incongruous act in the circumstances i am as    you will see bound to hand over the articles to the    woman to whom the use of them for her lifetime will now    rightly belong and they are therefore promptly sent    they become i believe heirlooms strictly speaking    according to the terms of your godmothers will  the    precise words of the clause that refers to this matter    are enclosed   i do remember said clare but i had quite forgotten  unlocking the case they found it to contain a necklace with pendant bracelets and earrings and also some other small ornaments  tess seemed afraid to touch them at first but her eyes sparkled for a moment as much as the stones when clare spread out the set  are they mine she asked incredulously  they are certainly said he  he looked into the fire  he remembered how when he was a lad of fifteen his godmother the squires wifethe only rich person with whom he had ever come in contacthad pinned her faith to his success had prophesied a wondrous career for him  there had seemed nothing at all out of keeping with such a conjectured career in the storing up of these showy ornaments for his wife and the wives of her descendants  they gleamed somewhat ironically now  yet why he asked himself  it was but a question of vanity throughout and if that were admitted into one side of the equation it should be admitted into the other  his wife was a durberville whom could they become better than her  suddenly he said with enthusiasm  tess put them onput them on  and he turned from the fire to help her  but as if by magic she had already donned themnecklace earrings bracelets and all  but the gown isnt right tess said clare  it ought to be a low one for a set of brilliants like that  ought it said tess  yes said he  he suggested to her how to tuck in the upper edge of her bodice so as to make it roughly approximate to the cut for evening wear and when she had done this and the pendant to the necklace hung isolated amid the whiteness of her throat as it was designed to do he stepped back to survey her  my heavens said clare how beautiful you are  as everybody knows fine feathers make fine birds a peasant girl but very moderately prepossessing to the casual observer in her simple condition and attire will bloom as an amazing beauty if clothed as a woman of fashion with the aids that art can render while the beauty of the midnight crush would often cut but a sorry figure if placed inside the fieldwomans wrapper upon a monotonous acreage of turnips on a dull day  he had never till now estimated the artistic excellence of tesss limbs and features  if you were only to appear in a ballroom he said  but nono dearest i think i love you best in the wingbonnet and cottonfrockyes better than in this well as you support these dignities  tesss sense of her striking appearance had given her a flush of excitement which was yet not happiness  ill take them off she said in case jonathan should see me they are not fit for me are they  they must be sold i suppose  let them stay a few minutes longer  sell them  never it would be a breach of faith  influenced by a second thought she readily obeyed  she had something to tell and there might be help in these  she sat down with the jewels upon her and they again indulged in conjectures as to where jonathan could possibly be with their baggage  the ale they had poured out for his consumption when he came had gone flat with long standing  shortly after this they began supper which was already laid on a sidetable  ere they had finished there was a jerk in the firesmoke the rising skein of which bulged out into the room as if some giant had laid his hand on the chimneytop for a moment  it had been caused by the opening of the outer door  a heavy step was now heard in the passage and angel went out  i couldn make nobody hear at all by knocking apologized jonathan kail for it was he at last and ast was raining out i opened the door  ive brought the things sir  i am very glad to see them  but you are very late  well yes sir  there was something subdued in jonathan kails tone which had not been there in the day and lines of concern were ploughed upon his forehead in addition to the lines of years  he continued  weve all been gallied at the dairy at what might ha been a most terrible affliction since you and your misessso to name her nowleft us this aternoon  perhaps you hant forgot the cocks afternoon crow  dear mewhat  well some says it do mane one thing and some another but whats happened is that poor little retty priddle hev tried to drown herself  no really  why she bade us goodbye with the rest  yes  well sir when you and your misessso to name what she lawful iswhen you two drove away as i say retty and marian put on their bonnets and went out and as there is not much doing now being new years eve and folks mops and brooms from whats inside em nobody took much notice  they went on to leweverard where they had summut to drink and then on they vamped to dreearmed cross and there they seemed to have parted retty striking across the watermeads as if for home and marian going on to the next village where theres another publichouse  nothing more was zeed or heard o retty till the waterman on his way home noticed something by the great pool twas her bonnet and shawl packed up  in the water he found her  he and another man brought her home thinking a was dead but she fetched round by degrees  angel suddenly recollecting that tess was overhearing this gloomy tale went to shut the door between the passage and the anteroom to the inner parlour where she was but his wife flinging a shawl round her had come to the outer room and was listening to the mans narrative her eyes resting absently on the luggage and the drops of rain glistening upon it  and more than this theres marian shes been found dead drunk by the withybeda girl who hev never been known to touch anything before except shilling ale though to be sure a was always a good trencherwoman as her face showed  it seems as if the maids had all gone out o their minds  and izz asked tess  izz is about house as usual but a do say a can guess how it happened and she seems to be very low in mind about it poor maid as well she mid be  and so you see sir as all this happened just when we was packing your few traps and your misesss nightrail and dressing things into the cart why it belated me  yes  well jonathan will you get the trunks upstairs and drink a cup of ale and hasten back as soon as you can in case you should be wanted  tess had gone back to the inner parlour and sat down by the fire looking wistfully into it  she heard jonathan kails heavy footsteps up and down the stairs till he had done placing the luggage and heard him express his thanks for the ale her husband took out to him and for the gratuity he received  jonathans footsteps then died from the door and his cart creaked away  angel slid forward the massive oak bar which secured the door and coming in to where she sat over the hearth pressed her cheeks between his hands from behind  he expected her to jump up gaily and unpack the toiletgear that she had been so anxious about but as she did not rise he sat down with her in the firelight the candles on the suppertable being too thin and glimmering to interfere with its glow  i am so sorry you should have heard this sad story about the girls he said  still dont let it depress you  retty was naturally morbid you know  without the least cause said tess  while they who have cause to be hide it and pretend they are not  this incident had turned the scale for her  they were simple and innocent girls on whom the unhappiness of unrequited love had fallen they had deserved better at the hands of fate  she had deserved worseyet she was the chosen one  it was wicked of her to take all without paying  she would pay to the uttermost farthing she would tell there and then  this final determination she came to when she looked into the fire he holding her hand  a steady glare from the now flameless embers painted the sides and back of the fireplace with its colour and the wellpolished andirons and the old brass tongs that would not meet  the underside of the mantelshelf was flushed with the highcoloured light and the legs of the table nearest the fire  tesss face and neck reflected the same warmth which each gem turned into an aldebaran or a siriusa constellation of white red and green flashes that interchanged their hues with her every pulsation  do you remember what we said to each other this morning about telling our faults he asked abruptly finding that she still remained immovable  we spoke lightly perhaps and you may well have done so  but for me it was no light promise  i want to make a confession to you love  this from him so unexpectedly apposite had the effect upon her of a providential interposition  you have to confess something she said quickly and even with gladness and relief  you did not expect it  ahyou thought too highly of me  now listen  put your head there because i want you to forgive me and not to be indignant with me for not telling you before as perhaps i ought to have done  how strange it was  he seemed to be her double  she did not speak and clare went on  i did not mention it because i was afraid of endangering my chance of you darling the great prize of my lifemy fellowship i call you  my brothers fellowship was won at his college mine at talbothays dairy  well i would not risk it  i was going to tell you a month agoat the time you agreed to be mine but i could not i thought it might frighten you away from me  i put it off then i thought i would tell you yesterday to give you a chance at least of escaping me  but i did not  and i did not this morning when you proposed our confessing our faults on the landingthe sinner that i was  but i must now i see you sitting there so solemnly  i wonder if you will forgive me  o yes  i am sure that  well i hope so  but wait a minute  you dont know to begin at the beginning  though i imagine my poor father fears that i am one of the eternally lost for my doctrines i am of course a believer in good morals tess as much as you  i used to wish to be a teacher of men and it was a great disappointment to me when i found i could not enter the church  i admired spotlessness even though i could lay no claim to it and hated impurity as i hope i do now  whatever one may think of plenary inspiration one must heartily subscribe to these words of paul be thou an examplein word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith in purity  it is the only safeguard for us poor human beings  integer vitae says a roman poet who is strange company for st paul     the man of upright life from frailties free    stands not in need of moorish spear or bow   well a certain place is paved with good intentions and having felt all that so strongly you will see what a terrible remorse it bred in me when in the midst of my fine aims for other people i myself fell  he then told her of that time of his life to which allusion has been made when tossed about by doubts and difficulties in london like a cork on the waves he plunged into eightandforty hours dissipation with a stranger  happily i awoke almost immediately to a sense of my folly he continued  i would have no more to say to her and i came home  i have never repeated the offence  but i felt i should like to treat you with perfect frankness and honour and i could not do so without telling this  do you forgive me  she pressed his hand tightly for an answer  then we will dismiss it at once and for evertoo painful as it is for the occasionand talk of something lighter  o angeli am almost gladbecause now you can forgive me  i have not made my confession  i have a confession tooremember i said so  ah to be sure  now then for it wicked little one  perhaps although you smile it is as serious as yours or more so  it can hardly be more serious dearest  it cannoto no it cannot  she jumped up joyfully at the hope no it cannot be more serious certainly she cried because tis just the same i will tell you now  she sat down again  their hands were still joined  the ashes under the grate were lit by the fire vertically like a torrid waste  imagination might have beheld a last day luridness in this redcoaled glow which fell on his face and hand and on hers peering into the loose hair about her brow and firing the delicate skin underneath  a large shadow of her shape rose upon the wall and ceiling  she bent forward at which each diamond on her neck gave a sinister wink like a toads and pressing her forehead against his temple she entered on her story of her acquaintance with alec durberville and its results murmuring the words without flinching and with her eyelids drooping down   end of phase the fourth      phase the fifth the woman pays    xxxv   her narrative ended even its reassertions and secondary explanations were done  tesss voice throughout had hardly risen higher than its opening tone there had been no exculpatory phrase of any kind and she had not wept  but the complexion even of external things seemed to suffer transmutation as her announcement progressed  the fire in the grate looked impishdemoniacally funny as if it did not care in the least about her strait  the fender grinned idly as if it too did not care  the light from the waterbottle was merely engaged in a chromatic problem  all material objects around announced their irresponsibility with terrible iteration  and yet nothing had changed since the moments when he had been kissing her or rather nothing in the substance of things  but the essence of things had changed  when she ceased the auricular impressions from their previous endearments seemed to hustle away into the corner of their brains repeating themselves as echoes from a time of supremely purblind foolishness  clare performed the irrelevant act of stirring the fire the intelligence had not even yet got to the bottom of him  after stirring the embers he rose to his feet all the force of her disclosure had imparted itself now  his face had withered  in the strenuousness of his concentration he treadled fitfully on the floor he could not by any contrivance think closely enough that was the meaning of his vague movement  when he spoke it was in the most inadequate commonplace voice of the many varied tones she had heard from him  tess  yes dearest  am i to believe this  from your manner i am to take it as true o you cannot be out of your mind  you ought to be  yet you are not  my wife my tessnothing in you warrants such a supposition as that  i am not out of my mind she said  and yet  he looked vacantly at her to resume with dazed senses why didnt you tell me before ah yes you would have told me in a waybut i hindered you i remember  these and other of his words were nothing but the perfunctory babble of the surface while the depths remained paralyzed  he turned away and bent over a chair  tess followed him to the middle of the room where he was and stood there staring at him with eyes that did not weep  presently she slid down upon her knees beside his foot and from this position she crouched in a heap  in the name of our love forgive me she whispered with a dry mouth  i have forgiven you for the same  and as he did not answer she said again  forgive me as you are forgiven  i forgive you angel  youyes you do  but you do not forgive me  o tess forgiveness does not apply to the case  you were one person now you are another  my godhow can forgiveness meet such a grotesqueprestidigitation as that  he paused contemplating this definition then suddenly broke into horrible laughteras unnatural and ghastly as a laugh in hell  dontdont  it kills me quite that she shrieked  o have mercy upon mehave mercy  he did not answer and sickly white she jumped up  angel angel what do you mean by that laugh she cried out  do you know what this is to me  he shook his head  i have been hoping longing praying to make you happy  i have thought what joy it will be to do it what an unworthy wife i shall be if i do not  thats what i have felt angel  i know that  i thought angel that you loved meme my very self  if it is i you do love o how can it be that you look and speak so  it frightens me  having begun to love you i love you for everin all changes in all disgraces because you are yourself  i ask no more then how can you o my own husband stop loving me  i repeat the woman i have been loving is not you  but who  another woman in your shape  she perceived in his words the realization of her own apprehensive foreboding in former times  he looked upon her as a species of imposter a guilty woman in the guise of an innocent one  terror was upon her white face as she saw it her cheek was flaccid and her mouth had almost the aspect of a round little hole the horrible sense of his view of her so deadened her that she staggered and he stepped forward thinking she was going to fall  sit down sit down he said gently  you are ill and it is natural that you should be  she did sit down without knowing where she was that strained look still upon her face and her eyes such as to make his flesh creep  i dont belong to you any more then do i angel she asked helplessly  it is not me but another woman like me that he loved he says  the image raised caused her to take pity upon herself as one who was illused  her eyes filled as she regarded her position further she turned round and burst into a flood of selfsympathetic tears  clare was relieved at this change for the effect on her of what had happened was beginning to be a trouble to him only less than the woe of the disclosure itself  he waited patiently apathetically till the violence of her grief had worn itself out and her rush of weeping had lessened to a catching gasp at intervals  angel she said suddenly in her natural tones the insane dry voice of terror having left her now  angel am i too wicked for you and me to live together  i have not been able to think what we can do  i shant ask you to let me live with you angel because i have no right to  i shall not write to mother and sisters to say we be married as i said i would do and i shant finish the goodhussif i cut out and meant to make while we were in lodgings  shant you  no i shant do anything unless you order me to and if you go away from me i shall not follow ee and if you never speak to me any more i shall not ask why unless you tell me i may  and if i order you to do anything  i will obey you like your wretched slave even if it is to lie down and die  you are very good  but it strikes me that there is a want of harmony between your present mood of selfsacrifice and your past mood of selfpreservation  these were the first words of antagonism  to fling elaborate sarcasms at tess however was much like flinging them at a dog or cat  the charms of their subtlety passed by her unappreciated and she only received them as inimical sounds which meant that anger ruled  she remained mute not knowing that he was smothering his affection for her  she hardly observed that a tear descended slowly upon his cheek a tear so large that it magnified the pores of the skin over which it rolled like the object lens of a microscope meanwhile reillumination as to the terrible and total change that her confession had wrought in his life in his universe returned to him and he tried desperately to advance among the new conditions in which he stood  some consequent action was necessary yet what  tess he said as gently as he could speak i cannot stayin this roomjust now i will walk out a little way  he quietly left the room and the two glasses of wine that he had poured out for their supperone for her one for himremained on the table untasted  this was what their agape had come to  at tea two or three hours earlier they had in the freakishness of affection drunk from one cup  the closing of the door behind him gently as it had been pulled to roused tess from her stupor  he was gone she could not stay hastily flinging her cloak around her she opened the door and followed putting out the candles as if she were never coming back the rain was over and the night was now clear  she was soon close at his heels for clare walked slowly and without purpose  his form beside her light gray figure looked black sinister and forbidding and she felt as sarcasm the touch of the jewels of which she had been momentarily so proud  clare turned at hearing her footsteps but his recognition of her presence seemed to make no difference to him and he went on over the five yawning arches of the great bridge in front of the house  the cow and horse tracks in the road were full of water the rain having been enough to charge them but not enough to wash them away across these minute pools the reflected stars flitted in a quick transit as she passed she would not have known they were shining overhead if she had not seen them therethe vastest things of the universe imaged in objects so mean  the place to which they had travelled today was in the same valley as talbothays but some miles lower down the river and the surroundings being open she kept easily in sight of him  away from the house the road wound through the meads and along these she followed clare without any attempt to come up with him or to attract him but with dumb and vacant fidelity  at last however her listless walk brought her up alongside him and still he said nothing  the cruelty of fooled honesty is often great after enlightenment and it was mighty in clare now  the outdoor air had apparently taken away from him all tendency to act on impulse she knew that he saw her without irradiationin all her bareness that time was chanting his satiric psalm at her then      behold when thy face is made bare he that loved thee       shall hate    thy face shall be no more fair at the fall of thy fate    for thy life shall fall as a leaf and be shed as the rain    and the veil of thine head shall be grief and the crown       shall be pain   he was still intently thinking and her companionship had now insufficient power to break or divert the strain of thought  what a weak thing her presence must have become to him  she could not help addressing clare  what have i donewhat have i done  i have not told of anything that interferes with or belies my love for you  you dont think i planned it do you  it is in your own mind what you are angry at angel it is not in me  o it is not in me and i am not that deceitful woman you think me  hmwell  not deceitful my wife but not the same  no not the same  but do not make me reproach you  i have sworn that i will not and i will do everything to avoid it  but she went on pleading in her distraction and perhaps said things that would have been better left to silence  angelangel  i was a childa child when it happened  i knew nothing of men  you were more sinned against than sinning that i admit  then will you not forgive me  i do forgive you but forgiveness is not all  and love me  to this question he did not answer  o angelmy mother says that it sometimes happens soshe knows several cases where they were worse than i and the husband has not minded it muchhas got over it at least  and yet the woman had not loved him as i do you  dont tess dont argue  different societies different manners you almost make me say you are an unapprehending peasant woman who have never been initiated into the proportions of social things you dont know what you say  i am only a peasant by position not by nature  she spoke with an impulse to anger but it went as it came  so much the worse for you  i think that parson who unearthed your pedigree would have done better if he had held his tongue  i cannot help associating your decline as a family with this other factof your want of firmness  decrepit families imply decrepit wills decrepit conduct  heaven why did you give me a handle for despising you more by informing me of your descent  here was i thinking you a newsprung child of nature there were you the belated seedling of an effete aristocracy  lots of families are as bad as mine in that  rettys family were once large landowners and so were dairyman billetts  and the debbyhouses who now are carters were once the de bayeux family you find such as i everywhere tis a feature of our county and i cant help it  so much the worse for the county  she took these reproaches in their bulk simply not in their particulars he did not love her as he had loved her hitherto and to all else she was indifferent  they wandered on again in silence  it was said afterwards that a cottager of wellbridge who went out late that night for a doctor met two lovers in the pastures walking very slowly without converse one behind the other as in a funeral procession and the glimpse that he obtained of their faces seemed to denote that they were anxious and sad  returning later he passed them again in the same field progressing just as slowly and as regardless of the hour and of the cheerless night as before  it was only on account of his preoccupation with his own affairs and the illness in his house that he did not bear in mind the curious incident which however he recalled a long while after  during the interval of the cottagers going and coming she had said to her husband  i dont see how i can help being the cause of much misery to you all your life  the river is down there  i can put an end to myself in it  i am not afraid  i dont wish to add murder to my other follies he said  i will leave something to show that i did it myselfon account of my shame  they will not blame you then  dont speak so absurdlyi wish not to hear it  it is nonsense to have such thoughts in this kind of case which is rather one for satirical laughter than for tragedy  you dont in the least understand the quality of the mishap  it would be viewed in the light of a joke by ninetenths of the world if it were known please oblige me by returning to the house and going to bed  i will said she dutifully  they had rambled round by a road which led to the wellknown ruins of the cistercian abbey behind the mill the latter having in centuries past been attached to the monastic establishment  the mill still worked on food being a perennial necessity the abbey had perished creeds being transient  one continually sees the ministration of the temporary outlasting the ministration of the eternal  their walk having been circuitous they were still not far from the house and in obeying his direction she only had to reach the large stone bridge across the main river and follow the road for a few yards  when she got back everything remained as she had left it the fire being still burning  she did not stay downstairs for more than a minute but proceeded to her chamber whither the luggage had been taken here she sat down on the edge of the bed looking blankly around and presently began to undress  in removing the light towards the bedstead its rays fell upon the tester of white dimity something was hanging beneath it and she lifted the candle to see what it was a bough of mistletoe  angel had put it there she knew that in an instant this was the explanation of that mysterious parcel which it had been so difficult to pack and bring whose contents he would not explain to her saying that time would soon show her the purpose thereof  in his zest and his gaiety he had hung it there  how foolish and inopportune that mistletoe looked now  having nothing more to fear having scarce anything to hope for that he would relent there seemed no promise whatever she lay down dully when sorrow ceases to be speculative sleep sees her opportunity among so many happier moods which forbid repose this was a mood which welcomed it and in a few minutes the lonely tess forgot existence surrounded by the aromatic stillness of the chamber that had once possibly been the bridechamber of her own ancestry  later on that night clare also retraced his steps to the house entering softly to the sittingroom he obtained a light and with the manner of one who had considered his course he spread his rugs upon the old horsehair sofa which stood there and roughly shaped it to a sleepingcouch  before lying down he crept shoeless upstairs and listened at the door of her apartment  her measured breathing told that she was sleeping profoundly  thank god murmured clare and yet he was conscious of a pang of bitterness at the thoughtapproximately true though not wholly sothat having shifted the burden of her life to his shoulders she was now reposing without care  he turned away to descend then irresolute faced round to her door again  in the act he caught sight of one of the durberville dames whose portrait was immediately over the entrance to tesss bedchamber  in the candlelight the painting was more than unpleasant  sinister design lurked in the womans features a concentrated purpose of revenge on the other sexso it seemed to him then  the caroline bodice of the portrait was lowprecisely as tesss had been when he tucked it in to show the necklace and again he experienced the distressing sensation of a resemblance between them  the check was sufficient  he resumed his retreat and descended  his air remained calm and cold his small compressed mouth indexing his powers of selfcontrol his face wearing still that terrible sterile expression which had spread thereon since her disclosure it was the face of a man who was no longer passions slave yet who found no advantage in his enfranchisement  he was simply regarding the harrowing contingencies of human experience the unexpectedness of things  nothing so pure so sweet so virginal as tess had seemed possible all the long while that he had adored her up to an hour ago but          the little less and what worlds away   he argued erroneously when he said to himself that her heart was not indexed in the honest freshness of her face but tess had no advocate to set him right  could it be possible he continued that eyes which as they gazed never expressed any divergence from what the tongue was telling were yet ever seeing another world behind her ostensible one discordant and contrasting  he reclined on his couch in the sittingroom and extinguished the light  the night came in and took up its place there unconcerned and indifferent the night which had already swallowed up his happiness and was now digesting it listlessly and was ready to swallow up the happiness of a thousand other people with as little disturbance or change of mien    xxxvi   clare arose in the light of a dawn that was ashy and furtive as though associated with crime  the fireplace confronted him with its extinct embers the spread suppertable whereon stood the two full glasses of untasted wine now flat and filmy her vacated seat and his own the other articles of furniture with their eternal look of not being able to help it their intolerable inquiry what was to be done  from above there was no sound but in a few minutes there came a knock at the door  he remembered that it would be the neighbouring cottagers wife who was to minister to their wants while they remained here  the presence of a third person in the house would be extremely awkward just now and being already dressed he opened the window and informed her that they could manage to shift for themselves that morning  she had a milkcan in her hand which he told her to leave at the door  when the dame had gone away he searched in the back quarters of the house for fuel and speedily lit a fire  there was plenty of eggs butter bread and so on in the larder and clare soon had breakfast laid his experiences at the dairy having rendered him facile in domestic preparations  the smoke of the kindled wood rose from the chimney without like a lotusheaded column local people who were passing by saw it and thought of the newlymarried couple and envied their happiness  angel cast a final glance round and then going to the foot of the stairs called in a conventional voice  breakfast is ready  he opened the front door and took a few steps in the morning air when after a short space he came back she was already in the sittingroom mechanically readjusting the breakfast things  as she was fully attired and the interval since his calling her had been but two or three minutes she must have been dressed or nearly so before he went to summon her  her hair was twisted up in a large round mass at the back of her head and she had put on one of the new frocksa pale blue woollen garment with neckfrillings of white  her hands and face appeared to be cold and she had possibly been sitting dressed in the bedroom a long time without any fire the marked civility of clares tone in calling her seemed to have inspired her for the moment with a new glimmer of hope  but it soon died when she looked at him  the pair were in truth but the ashes of their former fires  to the hot sorrow of the previous night had succeeded heaviness it seemed as if nothing could kindle either of them to fervour of sensation any more  he spoke gently to her and she replied with a like undemonstrativeness  at last she came up to him looking in his sharplydefined face as one who had no consciousness that her own formed a visible object also  angel she said and paused touching him with her fingers lightly as a breeze as though she could hardly believe to be there in the flesh the man who was once her lover  her eyes were bright her pale cheek still showed its wonted roundness though halfdried tears had left glistening traces thereon and the usually ripe red mouth was almost as pale as her cheek  throbbingly alive as she was still under the stress of her mental grief the life beat so brokenly that a little further pull upon it would cause real illness dull her characteristic eyes and make her mouth thin  she looked absolutely pure  nature in her fantastic trickery had set such a seal of maidenhood upon tesss countenance that he gazed at her with a stupefied air  tess  say it is not true  no it is not true  it is true  every word  every word  he looked at her imploringly as if he would willingly have taken a lie from her lips knowing it to be one and have made of it by some sort of sophistry a valid denial however she only repeated  it is true  is he living angel then asked  the baby died  but the man  he is alive  a last despair passed over clares face  is he in england  yes  he took a few vague steps  my positionis this he said abruptly  i thoughtany man would have thoughtthat by giving up all ambition to win a wife with social standing with fortune with knowledge of the world i should secure rustic innocence as surely as i should secure pink cheeks buthowever i am no man to reproach you and i will not  tess felt his position so entirely that the remainder had not been needed  therein lay just the distress of it she saw that he had lost all round  angeli should not have let it go on to marriage with you if i had not known that after all there was a last way out of it for you though i hoped you would never  her voice grew husky  a last way  i mean to get rid of me  you can get rid of me  how  by divorcing me  good heavenshow can you be so simple  how can i divorce you  cant younow i have told you  i thought my confession would give you grounds for that  o tessyou are too toochildishunformedcrude i suppose  i dont know what you are  you dont understand the lawyou dont understand  whatyou cannot  indeed i cannot  a quick shame mixed with the misery upon his listeners face  i thoughti thought she whispered  o now i see how wicked i seem to you  believe mebelieve me on my soul i never thought but that you could  i hoped you would not yet i believed without a doubt that you could cast me off if you were determined and didnt love me atatall  you were mistaken he said  o then i ought to have done it to have done it last night  but i hadnt the courage  thats just like me  the courage to do what  as she did not answer he took her by the hand  what were you thinking of doing he inquired  of putting an end to myself  when  she writhed under this inquisitorial manner of his  last night she answered  where  under your mistletoe  my good  how he asked sternly  ill tell you if you wont be angry with me she said shrinking it was with the cord of my box  but i could notdo the last thing i was afraid that it might cause a scandal to your name  the unexpected quality of this confession wrung from her and not volunteered shook him perceptibly  but he still held her and letting his glance fall from her face downwards he said  now listen to this  you must not dare to think of such a horrible thing how could you  you will promise me as your husband to attempt that no more  i am ready to promise  i saw how wicked it was  wicked  the idea was unworthy of you beyond description  but angel she pleaded enlarging her eyes in calm unconcern upon him it was thought of entirely on your accountto set you free without the scandal of the divorce that i thought you would have to get  i should never have dreamt of doing it on mine  however to do it with my own hand is too good for me after all  it is you my ruined husband who ought to strike the blow  i think i should love you more if that were possible if you could bring yourself to do it since theres no other way of escape for ee  i feel i am so utterly worthless  so very greatly in the way  ssh  well since you say no i wont  i have no wish opposed to yours  he knew this to be true enough  since the desperation of the night her activities had dropped to zero and there was no further rashness to be feared  tess tried to busy herself again over the breakfasttable with more or less success and they sat down both on the same side so that their glances did not meet  there was at first something awkward in hearing each other eat and drink but this could not be escaped moreover the amount of eating done was small on both sides breakfast over he rose and telling her the hour at which he might be expected to dinner went off to the millers in a mechanical pursuance of the plan of studying that business which had been his only practical reason for coming here  when he was gone tess stood at the window and presently saw his form crossing the great stone bridge which conducted to the mill premises he sank behind it crossed the railway beyond and disappeared then without a sigh she turned her attention to the room and began clearing the table and setting it in order  the charwoman soon came  her presence was at first a strain upon tess but afterwards an alleviation  at halfpast twelve she left her assistant alone in the kitchen and returning to the sittingroom waited for the reappearance of angels form behind the bridge  about one he showed himself  her face flushed although he was a quarter of a mile off  she ran to the kitchen to get the dinner served by the time he should enter  he went first to the room where they had washed their hands together the day before and as he entered the sittingroom the dishcovers rose from the dishes as if by his own motion  how punctual he said  yes  i saw you coming over the bridge said she  the meal was passed in commonplace talk of what he had been doing during the morning at the abbey mill of the methods of bolting and the oldfashioned machinery which he feared would not enlighten him greatly on modern improved methods some of it seeming to have been in use ever since the days it ground for the monks in the adjoining conventual buildingsnow a heap of ruins  he left the house again in the course of an hour coming home at dusk and occupying himself through the evening with his papers  she feared she was in the way and when the old woman was gone retired to the kitchen where she made herself busy as well as she could for more than an hour  clares shape appeared at the door you must not work like this he said  you are not my servant you are my wife  she raised her eyes and brightened somewhat  i may think myself thatindeed she murmured in piteous raillery  you mean in name well i dont want to be anything more  you may think so tess  you are  what do you mean  i dont know she said hastily with tears in her accents  i thought ibecause i am not respectable i mean  i told you i thought i was not respectable enough long agoand on that account i didnt want to marry you onlyonly you urged me  she broke into sobs and turned her back to him  it would almost have won round any man but angel clare  within the remote depths of his constitution so gentle and affectionate as he was in general there lay hidden a hard logical deposit like a vein of metal in a soft loam which turned the edge of everything that attempted to traverse it  it had blocked his acceptance of the church it blocked his acceptance of tess  moreover his affection itself was less fire than radiance and with regard to the other sex when he ceased to believe he ceased to follow contrasting in this with many impressionable natures who remain sensuously infatuated with what they intellectually despise  he waited till her sobbing ceased  i wish half the women in england were as respectable as you he said in an ebullition of bitterness against womankind in general it isnt a question of respectability but one of principle  he spoke such things as these and more of a kindred sort to her being still swayed by the antipathetic wave which warps direct souls with such persistence when once their vision finds itself mocked by appearances  there was it is true underneath a back current of sympathy through which a woman of the world might have conquered him but tess did not think of this she took everything as her deserts and hardly opened her mouth  the firmness of her devotion to him was indeed almost pitiful quicktempered as she naturally was nothing that he could say made her unseemly she sought not her own was not provoked thought no evil of his treatment of her  she might just now have been apostolic charity herself returned to a selfseeking modern world  this evening night and morning were passed precisely as the preceding ones had been passed  on one and only one occasion did shethe formerly free and independent tessventure to make any advances  it was on the third occasion of his starting after a meal to go out to the flourmill  as he was leaving the table he said goodbye and she replied in the same words at the same time inclining her mouth in the way of his  he did not avail himself of the invitation saying as he turned hastily aside  i shall be home punctually  tess shrank into herself as if she had been struck  often enough had he tried to reach those lips against her consentoften had he said gaily that her mouth and breath tasted of the butter and eggs and milk and honey on which she mainly lived that he drew sustenance from them and other follies of that sort  but he did not care for them now  he observed her sudden shrinking and said gently  you know i have to think of a course  it was imperative that we should stay together a little while to avoid the scandal to you that would have resulted from our immediate parting  but you must see it is only for forms sake  yes said tess absently  he went out and on his way to the mill stood still and wished for a moment that he had responded yet more kindly and kissed her once at least  thus they lived through this despairing day or two in the same house truly but more widely apart than before they were lovers  it was evident to her that he was as he had said living with paralyzed activities in his endeavour to think of a plan of procedure  she was awestricken to discover such determination under such apparent flexibility  his consistency was indeed too cruel  she no longer expected forgiveness now  more than once she thought of going away from him during his absence at the mill but she feared that this instead of benefiting him might be the means of hampering and humiliating him yet more if it should become known  meanwhile clare was meditating verily  his thought had been unsuspended he was becoming ill with thinking eaten out with thinking withered by thinking scourged out of all his former pulsating flexuous domesticity  he walked about saying to himself whats to be donewhats to be done and by chance she overheard him  it caused her to break the reserve about their future which had hitherto prevailed  i supposeyou are not going to live with melong are you angel she asked the sunk corners of her mouth betraying how purely mechanical were the means by which she retained that expression of chastened calm upon her face  i cannot he said without despising myself and what is worse perhaps despising you  i mean of course cannot live with you in the ordinary sense  at present whatever i feel i do not despise you  and let me speak plainly or you may not see all my difficulties  how can we live together while that man liveshe being your husband in nature and not i  if he were dead it might be different  besides thats not all the difficulty it lies in another considerationone bearing upon the future of other people than ourselves  think of years to come and children being born to us and this past matter getting knownfor it must get known  there is not an uttermost part of the earth but somebody comes from it or goes to it from elsewhere  well think of wretches of our flesh and blood growing up under a taunt which they will gradually get to feel the full force of with their expanding years  what an awakening for them  what a prospect  can you honestly say remain after contemplating this contingency  dont you think we had better endure the ills we have than fly to others  her eyelids weighted with trouble continued drooping as before  i cannot say remain she answered i cannot i had not thought so far  tesss feminine hopeshall we confess ithad been so obstinately recuperative as to revive in her surreptitious visions of a domiciliary intimacy continued long enough to break down his coldness even against his judgement  though unsophisticated in the usual sense she was not incomplete and it would have denoted deficiency of womanhood if she had not instinctively known what an argument lies in propinquity  nothing else would serve her she knew if this failed  it was wrong to hope in what was of the nature of strategy she said to herself yet that sort of hope she could not extinguish his last representation had now been made and it was as she said a new view  she had truly never thought so far as that and his lucid picture of possible offspring who would scorn her was one that brought deadly convictions to an honest heart which was humanitarian to its centre  sheer experience had already taught her that in some circumstances there was one thing better than to lead a good life and that was to be saved from leading any life whatever  like all who have been previsioned by suffering she could in the words of m sullyprudhomme hear a penal sentence in the fiat you shall be born particularly if addressed to potential issue of hers  yet such is the vulpine slyness of dame nature that till now tess had been hoodwinked by her love for clare into forgetting it might result in vitalizations that would inflict upon others what she had bewailed as misfortune to herself  she therefore could not withstand his argument  but with the selfcombating proclivity of the supersensitive an answer thereto arose in clares own mind and he almost feared it  it was based on her exceptional physical nature and she might have used it promisingly she might have added besides on an australian upland or texan plain who is to know or care about my misfortunes or to reproach me or you  yet like the majority of women she accepted the momentary presentment as if it were the inevitable  and she may have been right  the intuitive heart of woman knoweth not only its own bitterness but its husbands and even if these assumed reproaches were not likely to be addressed to him or to his by strangers they might have reached his ears from his own fastidious brain  it was the third day of the estrangement  some might risk the odd paradox that with more animalism he would have been the nobler man we do not say it  yet clares love was doubtless ethereal to a fault imaginative to impracticability  with these natures corporal presence is something less appealing than corporal absence the latter creating an ideal presence that conveniently drops the defects of the real  she found that her personality did not plead her cause so forcibly as she had anticipated  the figurative phrase was true she was another woman than the one who had excited his desire  i have thought over what you say she remarked to him moving her forefinger over the tablecloth her other hand which bore the ring that mocked them both supporting her forehead  it is quite true all of it it must be  you must go away from me  but what can you do  i can go home  clare had not thought of that  are you sure he inquired  quite sure  we ought to part and we may as well get it past and done  you once said that i was apt to win men against their better judgement and if i am constantly before your eyes i may cause you to change your plans in opposition to your reason and wish and afterwards your repentance and my sorrow will be terrible  and you would like to go home he asked  i want to leave you and go home  then it shall be so  though she did not look up at him she started  there was a difference between the proposition and the covenant which she had felt only too quickly  i feared it would come to this she murmured her countenance meekly fixed  i dont complain angel ii think it best  what you said has quite convinced me  yes though nobody else should reproach me if we should stay together yet somewhen years hence you might get angry with me for any ordinary matter and knowing what you do of my bygones you yourself might be tempted to say words and they might be overheard perhaps by my own children  o what only hurts me now would torture and kill me then i will gotomorrow  and i shall not stay here  though i didnt like to initiate it i have seen that it was advisable we should partat least for a while till i can better see the shape that things have taken and can write to you  tess stole a glance at her husband  he was pale even tremulous but as before she was appalled by the determination revealed in the depths of this gentle being she had marriedthe will to subdue the grosser to the subtler emotion the substance to the conception the flesh to the spirit  propensities tendencies habits were as dead leaves upon the tyrannous wind of his imaginative ascendency  he may have observed her look for he explained  i think of people more kindly when i am away from them adding cynically god knows perhaps we will shake down together some day for weariness thousands have done it  that day he began to pack up and she went upstairs and began to pack also  both knew that it was in their two minds that they might part the next morning for ever despite the gloss of assuaging conjectures thrown over their proceeding because they were of the sort to whom any parting which has an air of finality is a torture  he knew and she knew that though the fascination which each had exercised over the otheron her part independently of accomplishmentswould probably in the first days of their separation be even more potent than ever time must attenuate that effect the practical arguments against accepting her as a housemate might pronounce themselves more strongly in the boreal light of a remoter view  moreover when two people are once partedhave abandoned a common domicile and a common environmentnew growths insensibly bud upward to fill each vacated place unforeseen accidents hinder intentions and old plans are forgotten    xxxvii   midnight came and passed silently for there was nothing to announce it in the valley of the froom  not long after one oclock there was a slight creak in the darkened farmhouse once the mansion of the durbervilles  tess who used the upper chamber heard it and awoke  it had come from the corner step of the staircase which as usual was loosely nailed  she saw the door of her bedroom open and the figure of her husband crossed the stream of moonlight with a curiously careful tread  he was in his shirt and trousers only and her first flush of joy died when she perceived that his eyes were fixed in an unnatural stare on vacancy when he reached the middle of the room he stood still and murmured in tones of indescribable sadness  dead dead dead  under the influence of any stronglydisturbing force clare would occasionally walk in his sleep and even perform strange feats such as he had done on the night of their return from market just before their marriage when he reenacted in his bedroom his combat with the man who had insulted her  tess saw that continued mental distress had wrought him into that somnambulistic state now  her loyal confidence in him lay so deep down in her heart that awake or asleep he inspired her with no sort of personal fear  if he had entered with a pistol in his hand he would scarcely have disturbed her trust in his protectiveness  clare came close and bent over her dead dead dead he murmured  after fixedly regarding her for some moments with the same gaze of unmeasurable woe he bent lower enclosed her in his arms and rolled her in the sheet as in a shroud  then lifting her from the bed with as much respect as one would show to a dead body he carried her across the room murmuring  my poor poor tessmy dearest darling tess  so sweet so good so true  the words of endearment withheld so severely in his waking hours were inexpressibly sweet to her forlorn and hungry heart  if it had been to save her weary life she would not by moving or struggling have put an end to the position she found herself in  thus she lay in absolute stillness scarcely venturing to breathe and wondering what he was going to do with her suffered herself to be borne out upon the landing  my wifedead dead he said  he paused in his labours for a moment to lean with her against the banister  was he going to throw her down  selfsolicitude was near extinction in her and in the knowledge that he had planned to depart on the morrow possibly for always she lay in his arms in this precarious position with a sense rather of luxury than of terror  if they could only fall together and both be dashed to pieces how fit how desirable  however he did not let her fall but took advantage of the support of the handrail to imprint a kiss upon her lipslips in the daytime scorned  then he clasped her with a renewed firmness of hold and descended the staircase  the creak of the loose stair did not awaken him and they reached the groundfloor safely  freeing one of his hands from his grasp of her for a moment he slid back the doorbar and passed out slightly striking his stockinged toe against the edge of the door  but this he seemed not to mind and having room for extension in the open air he lifted her against his shoulder so that he could carry her with ease the absence of clothes taking much from his burden  thus he bore her off the premises in the direction of the river a few yards distant  his ultimate intention if he had any she had not yet divined and she found herself conjecturing on the matter as a third person might have done  so easefully had she delivered her whole being up to him that it pleased her to think he was regarding her as his absolute possession to dispose of as he should choose  it was consoling under the hovering terror of tomorrows separation to feel that he really recognized her now as his wife tess and did not cast her off even if in that recognition he went so far as to arrogate to himself the right of harming her  ah now she knew what he was dreaming ofthat sunday morning when he had borne her along through the water with the other dairymaids who had loved him nearly as much as she if that were possible which tess could hardly admit  clare did not cross the bridge with her but proceeding several paces on the same side towards the adjoining mill at length stood still on the brink of the river  its waters in creeping down these miles of meadowland frequently divided serpentining in purposeless curves looping themselves around little islands that had no name returning and reembodying themselves as a broad main stream further on  opposite the spot to which he had brought her was such a general confluence and the river was proportionately voluminous and deep  across it was a narrow footbridge but now the autumn flood had washed the handrail away leaving the bare plank only which lying a few inches above the speeding current formed a giddy pathway for even steady heads and tess had noticed from the window of the house in the daytime young men walking across upon it as a feat in balancing  her husband had possibly observed the same performance anyhow he now mounted the plank and sliding one foot forward advanced along it  was he going to drown her  probably he was  the spot was lonely the river deep and wide enough to make such a purpose easy of accomplishment  he might drown her if he would it would be better than parting tomorrow to lead severed lives  the swift stream raced and gyrated under them tossing distorting and splitting the moons reflected face  spots of froth travelled past and intercepted weeds waved behind the piles  if they could both fall together into the current now their arms would be so tightly clasped together that they could not be saved they would go out of the world almost painlessly and there would be no more reproach to her or to him for marrying her  his last halfhour with her would have been a loving one while if they lived till he awoke his daytime aversion would return and this hour would remain to be contemplated only as a transient dream  the impulse stirred in her yet she dared not indulge it to make a movement that would have precipitated them both into the gulf  how she valued her own life had been proved but hisshe had no right to tamper with it  he reached the other side with her in safety  here they were within a plantation which formed the abbey grounds and taking a new hold of her he went onward a few steps till they reached the ruined choir of the abbeychurch  against the north wall was the empty stone coffin of an abbot in which every tourist with a turn for grim humour was accustomed to stretch himself  in this clare carefully laid tess  having kissed her lips a second time he breathed deeply as if a greatly desired end were attained  clare then lay down on the ground alongside when he immediately fell into the deep dead slumber of exhaustion and remained motionless as a log  the spurt of mental excitement which had produced the effort was now over  tess sat up in the coffin  the night though dry and mild for the season was more than sufficiently cold to make it dangerous for him to remain here long in his halfclothed state  if he were left to himself he would in all probability stay there till the morning and be chilled to certain death  she had heard of such deaths after sleepwalking  but how could she dare to awaken him and let him know what he had been doing when it would mortify him to discover his folly in respect of her  tess however stepping out of her stone confine shook him slightly but was unable to arouse him without being violent  it was indispensable to do something for she was beginning to shiver the sheet being but a poor protection  her excitement had in a measure kept her warm during the few minutes adventure but that beatific interval was over  it suddenly occurred to her to try persuasion and accordingly she whispered in his ear with as much firmness and decision as she could summon  let us walk on darling at the same time taking him suggestively by the arm  to her relief he unresistingly acquiesced her words had apparently thrown him back into his dream which thenceforward seemed to enter on a new phase wherein he fancied she had risen as a spirit and was leading him to heaven thus she conducted him by the arm to the stone bridge in front of their residence crossing which they stood at the manorhouse door  tesss feet were quite bare and the stones hurt her and chilled her to the bone but clare was in his woollen stockings and appeared to feel no discomfort  there was no further difficulty  she induced him to lie down on his own sofa bed and covered him up warmly lighting a temporary fire of wood to dry any dampness out of him  the noise of these attentions she thought might awaken him and secretly wished that they might but the exhaustion of his mind and body was such that he remained undisturbed  as soon as they met the next morning tess divined that angel knew little or nothing of how far she had been concerned in the nights excursion though as regarded himself he may have been aware that he had not lain still  in truth he had awakened that morning from a sleep deep as annihilation and during those first few moments in which the brain like a samson shaking himself is trying its strength he had some dim notion of an unusual nocturnal proceeding but the realities of his situation soon displaced conjecture on the other subject  he waited in expectancy to discern some mental pointing he knew that if any intention of his concluded overnight did not vanish in the light of morning it stood on a basis approximating to one of pure reason even if initiated by impulse of feeling that it was so far therefore to be trusted  he thus beheld in the pale morning light the resolve to separate from her not as a hot and indignant instinct but denuded of the passionateness which had made it scorch and burn standing in its bones nothing but a skeleton but none the less there  clare no longer hesitated  at breakfast and while they were packing the few remaining articles he showed his weariness from the nights effort so unmistakeably that tess was on the point of revealing all that had happened but the reflection that it would anger him grieve him stultify him to know that he had instinctively manifested a fondness for her of which his commonsense did not approve that his inclination had compromised his dignity when reason slept again deterred her  it was too much like laughing at a man when sober for his erratic deeds during intoxication  it just crossed her mind too that he might have a faint recollection of his tender vagary and was disinclined to allude to it from a conviction that she would take amatory advantage of the opportunity it gave her of appealing to him anew not to go  he had ordered by letter a vehicle from the nearest town and soon after breakfast it arrived  she saw in it the beginning of the endthe temporary end at least for the revelation of his tenderness by the incident of the night raised dreams of a possible future with him  the luggage was put on the top and the man drove them off the miller and the old waitingwoman expressing some surprise at their precipitate departure which clare attributed to his discovery that the millwork was not of the modern kind which he wished to investigate a statement that was true so far as it went beyond this there was nothing in the manner of their leaving to suggest a fiasco or that they were not going together to visit friends  their route lay near the dairy from which they had started with such solemn joy in each other a few days back and as clare wished to wind up his business with mr crick tess could hardly avoid paying mrs crick a call at the same time unless she would excite suspicion of their unhappy state  to make the call as unobtrusive as possible they left the carriage by the wicket leading down from the high road to the dairyhouse and descended the track on foot side by side  the withybed had been cut and they could see over the stumps the spot to which clare had followed her when he pressed her to be his wife to the left the enclosure in which she had been fascinated by his harp and far away behind the cowstalls the mead which had been the scene of their first embrace  the gold of the summer picture was now gray the colours mean the rich soil mud and the river cold  over the bartongate the dairyman saw them and came forward throwing into his face the kind of jocularity deemed appropriate in talbothays and its vicinity on the reappearance of the newlymarried  then mrs crick emerged from the house and several others of their old acquaintance though marian and retty did not seem to be there  tess valiantly bore their sly attacks and friendly humours which affected her far otherwise than they supposed  in the tacit agreement of husband and wife to keep their estrangement a secret they behaved as would have been ordinary  and then although she would rather there had been no word spoken on the subject tess had to hear in detail the story of marian and retty  the later had gone home to her fathers and marian had left to look for employment elsewhere  they feared she would come to no good  to dissipate the sadness of this recital tess went and bade all her favourite cows goodbye touching each of them with her hand and as she and clare stood side by side at leaving as if united body and soul there would have been something peculiarly sorry in their aspect to one who should have seen it truly two limbs of one life as they outwardly were his arm touching hers her skirts touching him facing one way as against all the dairy facing the other speaking in their adieux as we and yet sundered like the poles perhaps something unusually stiff and embarrassed in their attitude some awkwardness in acting up to their profession of unity different from the natural shyness of young couples may have been apparent for when they were gone mrs crick said to her husband  how onnatural the brightness of her eyes did seem and how they stood like waxen images and talked as if they were in a dream didnt it strike ee that twas so  tess had always sommat strange in her and shes not now quite like the proud young bride of a wellbedoing man  they reentered the vehicle and were driven along the roads towards weatherbury and stagfoot lane till they reached the lane inn where clare dismissed the fly and man  they rested here a while and entering the vale were next driven onward towards her home by a stranger who did not know their relations  at a midway point when nuttlebury had been passed and where there were crossroads clare stopped the conveyance and said to tess that if she meant to return to her mothers house it was here that he would leave her  as they could not talk with freedom in the drivers presence he asked her to accompany him for a few steps on foot along one of the branch roads she assented and directing the man to wait a few minutes they strolled away  now let us understand each other he said gently  there is no anger between us though there is that which i cannot endure at present  i will try to bring myself to endure it  i will let you know where i go to as soon as i know myself  and if i can bring myself to bear itif it is desirable possiblei will come to you but until i come to you it will be better that you should not try to come to me  the severity of the decree seemed deadly to tess she saw his view of her clearly enough he could regard her in no other light than that of one who had practised gross deceit upon him  yet could a woman who had done even what she had done deserve all this  but she could contest the point with him no further  she simply repeated after him his own words  until you come to me i must not try to come to you  just so  may i write to you  o yesif you are ill or want anything at all  i hope that will not be the case so that it may happen that i write first to you  i agree to the conditions angel because you know best what my punishment ought to be onlyonlydont make it more than i can bear  that was all she said on the matter  if tess had been artful had she made a scene fainted wept hysterically in that lonely lane notwithstanding the fury of fastidiousness with which he was possessed he would probably not have withstood her  but her mood of longsuffering made his way easy for him and she herself was his best advocate  pride too entered into her submissionwhich perhaps was a symptom of that reckless acquiescence in chance too apparent in the whole durberville familyand the many effective chords which she could have stirred by an appeal were left untouched  the remainder of their discourse was on practical matters only  he now handed her a packet containing a fairly good sum of money which he had obtained from his bankers for the purpose  the brilliants the interest in which seemed to be tesss for her life only if he understood the wording of the will he advised her to let him send to a bank for safety and to this she readily agreed  these things arranged he walked with tess back to the carriage and handed her in  the coachman was paid and told where to drive her  taking next his own bag and umbrellathe sole articles he had brought with him hitherwardshe bade her goodbye and they parted there and then  the fly moved creepingly up a hill and clare watched it go with an unpremeditated hope that tess would look out of the window for one moment  but that she never thought of doing would not have ventured to do lying in a halfdead faint inside  thus he beheld her recede and in the anguish of his heart quoted a line from a poet with peculiar emendations of his own       gods not in his heaven     alls wrong with the world   when tess had passed over the crest of the hill he turned to go his own way and hardly knew that he loved her still    xxxviii   as she drove on through blackmoor vale and the landscape of her youth began to open around her tess aroused herself from her stupor her first thought was how would she be able to face her parents  she reached a turnpikegate which stood upon the highway to the village  it was thrown open by a stranger not by the old man who had kept it for many years and to whom she had been known he had probably left on new years day the date when such changes were made  having received no intelligence lately from her home she asked the turnpikekeeper for news  ohnothing miss he answered  marlott is marlott still  folks have died and that  john durbeyfield too hev had a daughter married this week to a gentlemanfarmer not from johns own house you know they was married elsewhere the gentleman being of that high standing that johns own folk was not considered wellbedoing enough to have any part in it the bridegroom seeming not to know howt have been discovered that john is a old and ancient nobleman himself by blood with family skillentons in their own vaults to this day but done out of his property in the time o the romans however sir john as we call n now kept up the weddingday as well as he could and stood treat to everybody in the parish and johns wife sung songs at the pure drop till past eleven oclock  hearing this tess felt so sick at heart that she could not decide to go home publicly in the fly with her luggage and belongings  she asked the turnpikekeeper if she might deposit her things at his house for a while and on his offering no objection she dismissed her carriage and went on to the village alone by a back lane  at sight of her fathers chimney she asked herself how she could possibly enter the house  inside that cottage her relations were calmly supposing her far away on a weddingtour with a comparatively rich man who was to conduct her to bouncing prosperity while here she was friendless creeping up to the old door quite by herself with no better place to go to in the world  she did not reach the house unobserved  just by the gardenhedge she was met by a girl who knew herone of the two or three with whom she had been intimate at school  after making a few inquiries as to how tess came there her friend unheeding her tragic look interrupted with  but wheres thy gentleman tess  tess hastily explained that he had been called away on business and leaving her interlocutor clambered over the gardenhedge and thus made her way to the house  as she went up the gardenpath she heard her mother singing by the back door coming in sight of which she perceived mrs durbeyfield on the doorstep in the act of wringing a sheet  having performed this without observing tess she went indoors and her daughter followed her  the washingtub stood in the same old place on the same old quarterhogshead and her mother having thrown the sheet aside was about to plunge her arms in anew  whytessmy chili thought you was marriedmarried really and truly this timewe sent the cider  yes mother so i am  going to be  noi am married  married  then wheres thy husband  oh hes gone away for a time  gone away  when was you married then  the day you said  yes tuesday mother  and now tis ony saturday and he gone away  yes hes gone  whats the meaning o that  nation seize such husbands as you seem to get say i  mother  tess went across to joan durbeyfield laid her face upon the matrons bosom and burst into sobs  i dont know how to tell ee mother  you said to me and wrote to me that i was not to tell him  but i did tell himi couldnt help itand he went away  o you little foolyou little fool burst out mrs durbeyfield splashing tess and herself in her agitation  my good god that ever i should ha lived to say it but i say it again you little fool  tess was convulsed with weeping the tension of so many days having relaxed at last  i know iti knowi know she gasped through her sobs  but o my mother i could not help it  he was so goodand i felt the wickedness of trying to blind him as to what had happened ififit were to be done againi should do the same  i could noti dared notso sinagainst him  but you sinned enough to marry him first  yes yes thats where my misery do lie  but i thought he could get rid o me by law if he were determined not to overlook it  and o if you knewif you could only half know how i loved himhow anxious i was to have himand how wrung i was between caring so much for him and my wish to be fair to him  tess was so shaken that she could get no further and sank a helpless thing into a chair  well well whats done cant be undone  im sure i dont know why children o my bringing forth should all be bigger simpletons than other peoplesnot to know better than to blab such a thing as that when he couldnt ha found it out till too late  here mrs durbeyfield began shedding tears on her own account as a mother to be pitied  what your father will say i dont know she continued for hes been talking about the wedding up at rollivers and the pure drop every day since and about his family getting back to their rightful position through youpoor silly manand now youve made this mess of it  the lordalord  as if to bring matters to a focus tesss father was heard approaching at that moment  he did not however enter immediately and mrs durbeyfield said that she would break the bad news to him herself tess keeping out of sight for the present  after her first burst of disappointment joan began to take the mishap as she had taken tesss original trouble as she would have taken a wet holiday or failure in the potatocrop as a thing which had come upon them irrespective of desert or folly a chance external impingement to be borne with not a lesson  tess retreated upstairs and beheld casually that the beds had been shifted and new arrangements made  her old bed had been adapted for two younger children  there was no place here for her now  the room below being unceiled she could hear most of what went on there  presently her father entered apparently carrying in a live hen  he was a foothaggler now having been obliged to sell his second horse and he travelled with his basket on his arm  the hen had been carried about this morning as it was often carried to show people that he was in his work though it had lain with its legs tied under the table at rollivers for more than an hour  weve just had up a story about durbeyfield began and thereupon related in detail to his wife a discussion which had arisen at the inn about the clergy originated by the fact of his daughter having married into a clerical family they was formerly styled sir like my own ancestry he said though nowadays their true style strictly speaking is clerk only  as tess had wished that no great publicity should be given to the event he had mentioned no particulars  he hoped she would remove that prohibition soon  he proposed that the couple should take tesss own name durberville as uncorrupted  it was better than her husbandss  he asked if any letter had come from her that day  then mrs durbeyfield informed him that no letter had come but tess unfortunately had come herself  when at length the collapse was explained to him a sullen mortification not usual with durbeyfield overpowered the influence of the cheering glass  yet the intrinsic quality of the event moved his touchy sensitiveness less than its conjectured effect upon the minds of others  to think now that this was to be the end ot said sir john and i with a family vault under that there church of kingsbere as big as squire jollards alecellar and my folk lying there in sixes and sevens as genuine county bones and marrow as any recorded in history  and now to be sure what they fellers at rollivers and the pure drop will say to me  how theyll squint and glane and say this is yer mighty match is it this is yer getting back to the true level of yer forefathers in king normans time i feel this is too much joan i shall put an end to myself title and alli can bear it no longer   but she can make him keep her if hes married her  why yes but she wont think o doing that  dye think he really have married heror is it like the first  poor tess who had heard as far as this could not bear to hear more the perception that her word could be doubted even here in her own parental house set her mind against the spot as nothing else could have done  how unexpected were the attacks of destiny  and if her father doubted her a little would not neighbours and acquaintance doubt her much  o she could not live long at home  a few days accordingly were all that she allowed herself here at the end of which time she received a short note from clare informing her that he had gone to the north of england to look at a farm  in her craving for the lustre of her true position as his wife and to hide from her parents the vast extent of the division between them she made use of this letter as her reason for again departing leaving them under the impression that she was setting out to join him  still further to screen her husband from any imputation of unkindness to her she took twentyfive of the fifty pounds clare had given her and handed the sum over to her mother as if the wife of a man like angel clare could well afford it saying that it was a slight return for the trouble and humiliation she had brought upon them in years past  with this assertion of her dignity she bade them farewell and after that there were lively doings in the durbeyfield household for some time on the strength of tesss bounty her mother saying and indeed believing that the rupture which had arisen between the young husband and wife had adjusted itself under their strong feeling that they could not live apart from each other    xxxix   it was three weeks after the marriage that clare found himself descending the hill which led to the wellknown parsonage of his father  with his downward course the tower of the church rose into the evening sky in a manner of inquiry as to why he had come and no living person in the twilighted town seemed to notice him still less to expect him  he was arriving like a ghost and the sound of his own footsteps was almost an encumbrance to be got rid of  the picture of life had changed for him  before this time he had known it but speculatively now he thought he knew it as a practical man though perhaps he did not even yet  nevertheless humanity stood before him no longer in the pensive sweetness of italian art but in the staring and ghastly attitudes of a wiertz museum and with the leer of a study by van beers  his conduct during these first weeks had been desultory beyond description  after mechanically attempting to pursue his agricultural plans as though nothing unusual had happened in the manner recommended by the great and wise men of all ages he concluded that very few of those great and wise men had ever gone so far outside themselves as to test the feasibility of their counsel this is the chief thing be not perturbed said the pagan moralist that was just clares own opinion  but he was perturbed  let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid said the nazarene clare chimed in cordially but his heart was troubled all the same how he would have liked to confront those two great thinkers and earnestly appeal to them as fellowman to fellowmen and ask them to tell him their method  his mood transmuted itself into a dogged indifference till at length he fancied he was looking on his own existence with the passive interest of an outsider  he was embittered by the conviction that all this desolation had been brought about by the accident of her being a durberville  when he found that tess came of that exhausted ancient line and was not of the new tribes from below as he had fondly dreamed why had he not stoically abandoned her in fidelity to his principles  this was what he had got by apostasy and his punishment was deserved  then he became weary and anxious and his anxiety increased  he wondered if he had treated her unfairly  he ate without knowing that he ate and drank without tasting  as the hours dropped past as the motive of each act in the long series of bygone days presented itself to his view he perceived how intimately the notion of having tess as a dear possession was mixed up with all his schemes and words and ways  in going hither and thither he observed in the outskirts of a small town a redandblue placard setting forth the great advantages of the empire of brazil as a field for the emigrating agriculturist land was offered there on exceptionally advantageous terms  brazil somewhat attracted him as a new idea  tess could eventually join him there and perhaps in that country of contrasting scenes and notions and habits the conventions would not be so operative which made life with her seem impracticable to him here  in brief he was strongly inclined to try brazil especially as the season for going thither was just at hand  with this view he was returning to emminster to disclose his plan to his parents and to make the best explanation he could make of arriving without tess short of revealing what had actually separated them  as he reached the door the new moon shone upon his face just as the old one had done in the small hours of that morning when he had carried his wife in his arms across the river to the graveyard of the monks but his face was thinner now  clare had given his parents no warning of his visit and his arrival stirred the atmosphere of the vicarage as the dive of the kingfisher stirs a quiet pool  his father and mother were both in the drawingroom but neither of his brothers was now at home  angel entered and closed the door quietly behind him  butwheres your wife dear angel cried his mother  how you surprise us  she is at her motherstemporarily  i have come home rather in a hurry because ive decided to go to brazil  brazil  why they are all roman catholics there surely  are they  i hadnt thought of that  but even the novelty and painfulness of his going to a papistical land could not displace for long mr and mrs clares natural interest in their sons marriage  we had your brief note three weeks ago announcing that it had taken place said mrs clare and your father sent your godmothers gift to her as you know  of course it was best that none of us should be present especially as you preferred to marry her from the dairy and not at her home wherever that may be  it would have embarrassed you and given us no pleasure  your bothers felt that very strongly now it is done we do not complain particularly if she suits you for the business you have chosen to follow instead of the ministry of the gospel   yet i wish i could have seen her first angel or have known a little more about her  we sent her no present of our own not knowing what would best give her pleasure but you must suppose it only delayed  angel there is no irritation in my mind or your fathers against you for this marriage but we have thought it much better to reserve our liking for your wife till we could see her and now you have not brought her  it seems strange  what has happened  he replied that it had been thought best by them that she should to go her parents home for the present whilst he came there  i dont mind telling you dear mother he said that i always meant to keep her away from this house till i should feel she could some with credit to you  but this idea of brazil is quite a recent one  if i do go it will be unadvisable for me to take her on this my first journey  she will remain at her mothers till i come back  and i shall not see her before you start  he was afraid they would not  his original plan had been as he had said to refrain from bringing her there for some little whilenot to wound their prejudicesfeelingsin any way and for other reasons he had adhered to it  he would have to visit home in the course of a year if he went out at once and it would be possible for them to see her before he started a second timewith her  a hastily prepared supper was brought in and clare made further exposition of his plans  his mothers disappointment at not seeing the bride still remained with her  clares late enthusiasm for tess had infected her through her maternal sympathies till she had almost fancied that a good thing could come out of nazaretha charming woman out of talbothays dairy she watched her son as he ate  cannot you describe her  i am sure she is very pretty angel  of that there can be no question he said with a zest which covered its bitterness  and that she is pure and virtuous goes without question  pure and virtuous of course she is  i can see her quite distinctly  you said the other day that she was fine in figure roundly built had deep red lips like cupids bow dark eyelashes and brows an immense rope of hair like a ships cable and large eyes violetyblueyblackish  i did mother  i quite see her  and living in such seclusion she naturally had scarce ever seen any young man from the world without till she saw you  scarcely  you were her first love  of course  there are worse wives than these simple rosymouthed robust girls of the farm  certainly i could have wishedwell since my son is to be an agriculturist it is perhaps but proper that his wife should have been accustomed to an outdoor life  his father was less inquisitive but when the time came for the chapter from the bible which was always read before evening prayers the vicar observed to mrs clare  i think since angel has come that it will be more appropriate to read the thirtyfirst of proverbs than the chapter which we should have had in the usual course of our reading  yes certainly said mrs clare  the words of king lemuel she could cite chapter and verse as well as her husband  my dear son your father has decided to read us the chapter in proverbs in praise of a virtuous wife  we shall not need to be reminded to apply the words to the absent one  may heaven shield her in all her ways  a lump rose in clares throat  the portable lectern was taken out from the corner and set in the middle of the fireplace the two old servants came in and angels father began to read at the tenth verse of the aforesaid chapter      who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far    above rubies  she riseth while it is yet night and    giveth meat to her household  she girdeth her loins    with strength and strengtheneth her arms  she    perceiveth that her merchandise is good her candle    goeth not out by night  she looketh well to the ways    of her household and eateth not the bread of idleness    her children arise up and call her blessed her husband    also and he praiseth her  many daughters have done    virtuously but thou excellest them all   when prayers were over his mother said  i could not help thinking how very aptly that chapter your dear father read applied in some of its particulars to the woman you have chosen  the perfect woman you see was a working woman not an idler not a fine lady but one who used her hands and her head and her heart for the good of others  her children arise up and call her blessed her husband also and he praiseth her  many daughters have done virtuously but she excelleth them all  well i wish i could have seen her angel  since she is pure and chaste she would have been refined enough for me  clare could bear this no longer  his eyes were full of tears which seemed like drops of molten lead  he bade a quick good night to these sincere and simple souls whom he loved so well who knew neither the world the flesh nor the devil in their own hearts only as something vague and external to themselves  he went to his own chamber  his mother followed him and tapped at his door  clare opened it to discover her standing without with anxious eyes  angel she asked is there something wrong that you go away so soon  i am quite sure you are not yourself  i am not quite mother said he  about her  now my son i know it is thati know it is about her have you quarrelled in these three weeks  we have not exactly quarrelled he said  but we have had a difference  angelis she a young woman whose history will bear investigation  with a mothers instinct mrs clare had put her finger on the kind of trouble that would cause such a disquiet as seemed to agitate her son  she is spotless he replied and felt that if it had sent him to eternal hell there and then he would have told that lie  then never mind the rest  after all there are few purer things in nature then an unsullied country maid any crudeness of manner which may offend your more educated sense at first will i am sure disappear under the influence or your companionship and tuition  such terrible sarcasm of blind magnanimity brought home to clare the secondary perception that he had utterly wrecked his career by this marriage which had not been among his early thoughts after the disclosure  true on his own account he cared very little about his career but he had wished to make it at least a respectable one on account of his parents and brothers  and now as he looked into the candle its flame dumbly expressed to him that it was made to shine on sensible people and that it abhorred lighting the face of a dupe and a failure  when his agitation had cooled he would be at moments incensed with his poor wife for causing a situation in which he was obliged to practise deception on his parents  he almost talked to her in his anger as if she had been in the room  and then her cooing voice plaintive in expostulation disturbed the darkness the velvet touch of her lips passed over his brow and he could distinguish in the air the warmth of her breath  this night the woman of his belittling deprecations was thinking how great and good her husband was  but over them both there hung a deeper shade than the shade which angel clare perceived namely the shade of his own limitations  with all his attempted independence of judgement this advanced and wellmeaning young man a sample product of the last fiveandtwenty years was yet the slave to custom and conventionality when surprised back into his early teachings  no prophet had told him and he was not prophet enough to tell himself that essentially this young wife of his was as deserving of the praise of king lemuel as any other woman endowed with the same dislike of evil her moral value having to be reckoned not by achievement but by tendency  moreover the figure near at hand suffers on such occasion because it shows up its sorriness without shade while vague figures afar off are honoured in that their distance makes artistic virtues of their stains  in considering what tess was not he overlooked what she was and forgot that the defective can be more than the entire    xl   at breakfast brazil was the topic and all endeavoured to take a hopeful view of clares proposed experiment with that countrys soil notwithstanding the discouraging reports of some farmlabourers who had emigrated thither and returned home within the twelve months after breakfast clare went into the little town to wind up such trifling matters as he was concerned with there and to get from the local bank all the money he possessed  on his way back he encountered miss mercy chant by the church from whose walls she seemed to be a sort of emanation  she was carrying an armful of bibles for her class and such was her view of life that events which produced heartache in others wrought beatific smiles upon heran enviable result although in the opinion of angel it was obtained by a curiously unnatural sacrifice of humanity to mysticism  she had learnt that he was about to leave england and observed what an excellent and promising scheme it seemed to be  yes it is a likely scheme enough in a commercial sense no doubt he replied  but my dear mercy it snaps the continuity of existence  perhaps a cloister would be preferable  a cloister  o angel clare  well  why you wicked man a cloister implies a monk and a monk roman catholicism  and roman catholicism sin and sin damnation  thou art in a parlous state angel clare  i glory in my protestantism she said severely  then clare thrown by sheer misery into one of the demoniacal moods in which a man does despite to his true principles called her close to him and fiendishly whispered in her ear the most heterodox ideas he could think of  his momentary laughter at the horror which appeared on her fair face ceased when it merged in pain and anxiety for his welfare  dear mercy he said you must forgive me  i think i am going crazy  she thought that he was and thus the interview ended and clare reentered the vicarage  with the local banker he deposited the jewels till happier days should arise  he also paid into the bank thirty poundsto be sent to tess in a few months as she might require and wrote to her at her parents home in blackmoor vale to inform her of what he had done  this amount with the sum he had already placed in her handsabout fifty poundshe hoped would be amply sufficient for her wants just at present particularly as in an emergency she had been directed to apply to his father  he deemed it best not to put his parents into communication with her by informing them of her address and being unaware of what had really happened to estrange the two neither his father nor his mother suggested that he should do so  during the day he left the parsonage for what he had to complete he wished to get done quickly  as the last duty before leaving this part of england it was necessary for him to call at the wellbridge farmhouse in which he had spent with tess the first three days of their marriage the trifle of rent having to be paid the key given up of the rooms they had occupied and two or three small articles fetched away that they had left behind  it was under this roof that the deepest shadow ever thrown upon his life had stretched its gloom over him  yet when he had unlocked the door of the sittingroom and looked into it the memory which returned first upon him was that of their happy arrival on a similar afternoon the first fresh sense of sharing a habitation conjointly the first meal together the chatting by the fire with joined hands  the farmer and his wife were in the field at the moment of his visit and clare was in the rooms alone for some time  inwardly swollen with a renewal of sentiment that he had not quite reckoned with he went upstairs to her chamber which had never been his  the bed was smooth as she had made it with her own hands on the morning of leaving  the mistletoe hung under the tester just as he had placed it  having been there three or four weeks it was turning colour and the leaves and berries were wrinkled  angel took it down and crushed it into the grate  standing there he for the first time doubted whether his course in this conjecture had been a wise much less a generous one  but had he not been cruelly blinded  in the incoherent multitude of his emotions he knelt down at the bedside weteyed  o tess  if you had only told me sooner i would have forgiven you he mourned  hearing a footstep below he rose and went to the top of the stairs at the bottom of the flight he saw a woman standing and on her turning up her face recognized the pale darkeyed izz huett  mr clare she said ive called to see you and mrs clare and to inquire if ye be well  i thought you might be back here again  this was a girl whose secret he had guessed but who had not yet guessed his an honest girl who loved himone who would have made as good or nearly as good a practical farmers wife as tess  i am here alone he said we are not living here now  explaining why he had come he asked which way are you going home izz  i have no home at talbothays dairy now sir she said  why is that  izz looked down  it was so dismal there that i left  i am staying out this way she pointed in a contrary direction the direction in which he was journeying  wellare you going there now  i can take you if you wish for a lift  her olive complexion grew richer in hue  thank ee mr clare she said  he soon found the farmer and settled the account for his rent and the few other items which had to be considered by reason of the sudden abandonment of the lodgings  on clares return to his horse and gig izz jumped up beside him  i am going to leave england izz he said as they drove on going to brazil  and do mrs clare like the notion of such a journey she asked  she is not going at presentsay for a year or so  i am going out to reconnoitreto see what life there is like  they sped along eastward for some considerable distance izz making no observation  how are the others he inquired  how is retty  she was in a sort of nervous state when i zid her last and so thin and hollowcheeked that a do seem in a decline  nobody will ever fall in love wi her any more said izz absently  and marian  izz lowered her voice  marian drinks  indeed  yes  the dairyman has got rid of her  and you  i dont drink and i baint in a decline  buti am no great things at singing afore breakfast now  how is that  do you remember how neatly you used to turn twas down in cupids gardens and the tailors breeches at morning milking  ah yes  when you first came sir that was  not when you had been there a bit  why was that fallingoff  her black eyes flashed up to his face for one moment by way of answer  izzhow weak of youfor such as i he said and fell into reverie  thensuppose i had asked you to marry me  if you had i should have said yes and you would have married a woman who loved ee  really  down to the ground she whispered vehemently  o my god did you never guess it till now  byandby they reached a branch road to a village  i must get down  i live out there said izz abruptly never having spoken since her avowal  clare slowed the horse  he was incensed against his fate bitterly disposed towards social ordinances for they had cooped him up in a corner out of which there was no legitimate pathway  why not be revenged on society by shaping his future domesticities loosely instead of kissing the pedagogic rod of convention in this ensnaring manner  i am going to brazil alone izz said he  i have separated from my wife for personal not voyaging reasons  i may never live with her again  i may not be able to love you butwill you go with me instead of her  you truly wish me to go  i do  i have been badly used enough to wish for relief  and you at least love me disinterestedly  yesi will go said izz after a pause  you will  you know what it means izz  it means that i shall live with you for the time you are over therethats good enough for me  remember you are not to trust me in morals now  but i ought to remind you that it will be wrongdoing in the eyes of civilizationwestern civilization that is to say  i dont mind that no woman do when it comes to agonypoint and theres no other way  then dont get down but sit where you are  he drove past the crossroads one mile two miles without showing any signs of affection  you love me very very much izz he suddenly asked  i doi have said i do  i loved you all the time we was at the dairy together  more than tess  she shook her head  no she murmured not more than she  hows that  because nobody could love ee more than tess did   she would have laid down her life for ee  i could do no more  like the prophet on the top of peor izz huett would fain have spoken perversely at such a moment but the fascination exercised over her rougher nature by tesss character compelled her to grace  clare was silent his heart had risen at these straightforward words from such an unexpected unimpeachable quarter  in his throat was something as if a sob had solidified there  his ears repeated she would have laid down her life for ee  i could do no more  forget our idle talk izz he said turning the horses head suddenly  i dont know what ive been saying  i will now drive you back to where your lane branches off  so much for honesty towards ee  ohow can i bear ithow can ihow can i  izz huett burst into wild tears and beat her forehead as she saw what she had done  do you regret that poor little act of justice to an absent one o izz dont spoil it by regret  she stilled herself by degrees  very well sir  perhaps i didnt know what i was saying either whwhen i agreed to go  i wishwhat cannot be  because i have a loving wife already  yes yes  you have  they reached the corner of the lane which they had passed half an hour earlier and she hopped down  izzplease please forget my momentary levity he cried  it was so illconsidered so illadvised  forget it  never never  o it was no levity to me  he felt how richly he deserved the reproach that the wounded cry conveyed and in a sorrow that was inexpressible leapt down and took her hand  well but izz well part friends anyhow  you dont know what ive had to bear  she was a really generous girl and allowed no further bitterness to mar their adieux  i forgive ee sir she said  now izz he said while she stood beside him there forcing himself to the mentors part he was far from feeling i want you to tell marian when you see her that she is to be a good woman and not to give way to folly  promise that and tell retty that there are more worthy men than i in the world that for my sake she is to act wisely and wellremember the wordswisely and wellfor my sake i send this message to them as a dying man to the dying for i shall never see them again  and you izzy you have saved me by your honest words about my wife from an incredible impulse towards folly and treachery  women may be bad but they are not so bad as men in these things  on that one account i can never forget you  be always the good and sincere girl you have hitherto been and think of me as a worthless lover but a faithful friend  promise  she gave the promise  heaven bless and keep you sir  goodbye  he drove on but no sooner had izz turned into the lane and clare was out of sight than she flung herself down on the bank in a fit of racking anguish and it was with a strained unnatural face that she entered her mothers cottage late that night  nobody ever was told how izz spent the dark hours that intervened between angel clares parting from her and her arrival home  clare too after bidding the girl farewell was wrought to aching thoughts and quivering lips  but his sorrow was not for izz  that evening he was within a featherweights turn of abandoning his road to the nearest station and driving across that elevated dorsal line of south wessex which divided him from his tesss home  it was neither a contempt for her nature nor the probable state of her heart which deterred him  no it was a sense that despite her love as corroborated by izzs admission the facts had not changed  if he was right at first he was right now  and the momentum of the course on which he had embarked tended to keep him going in it unless diverted by a stronger more sustained force than had played upon him this afternoon  he could soon come back to her  he took the train that night for london and five days after shook hands in farewell of his brothers at the port of embarkation    xli   from the foregoing events of the wintertime let us press on to an october day more than eight months subsequent to the parting of clare and tess  we discover the latter in changed conditions instead of a bride with boxes and trunks which others bore we see her a lonely woman with a basket and a bundle in her own porterage as at an earlier time when she was no bride instead of the ample means that were projected by her husband for her comfort through this probationary period she can produce only a flattened purse  after again leaving marlott her home she had got through the spring and summer without any great stress upon her physical powers the time being mainly spent in rendering light irregular service at dairywork near portbredy to the west of the blackmoor valley equally remote from her native place and from talbothays  she preferred this to living on his allowance  mentally she remained in utter stagnation a condition which the mechanical occupation rather fostered than checked  her consciousness was at that other dairy at that other season in the presence of the tender lover who had confronted her therehe who the moment she had grasped him to keep for her own had disappeared like a shape in a vision  the dairywork lasted only till the milk began to lessen for she had not met with a second regular engagement as at talbothays but had done duty as a supernumerary only  however as harvest was now beginning she had simply to remove from the pasture to the stubble to find plenty of further occupation and this continued till harvest was done  of the fiveandtwenty pounds which had remained to her of clares allowance after deducting the other half of the fifty as a contribution to her parents for the trouble and expense to which she had put them she had as yet spent but little  but there now followed an unfortunate interval of wet weather during which she was obliged to fall back upon her sovereigns  she could not bear to let them go  angel had put them into her hand had obtained them bright and new from his bank for her his touch had consecrated them to souvenirs of himselfthey appeared to have had as yet no other history than such as was created by his and her own experiencesand to disperse them was like giving away relics  but she had to do it and one by one they left her hands  she had been compelled to send her mother her address from time to time but she concealed her circumstances  when her money had almost gone a letter from her mother reached her  joan stated that they were in dreadful difficulty the autumn rains had gone through the thatch of the house which required entire renewal but this could not be done because the previous thatching had never been paid for new rafters and a new ceiling upstairs also were required which with the previous bill would amount to a sum of twenty pounds  as her husband was a man of means and had doubtless returned by this time could she not send them the money  tess had thirty pounds coming to her almost immediately from angels bankers and the case being so deplorable as soon as the sum was received she sent the twenty as requested  part of the remainder she was obliged to expend in winter clothing leaving only a nominal sum for the whole inclement season at hand  when the last pound had gone a remark of angels that whenever she required further resources she was to apply to his father remained to be considered  but the more tess thought of the step the more reluctant was she to take it  the same delicacy pride false shame whatever it may be called on clares account which had led her to hide from her own parents the prolongation of the estrangement hindered her owning to his that she was in want after the fair allowance he had left her they probably despised her already how much more they would despise her in the character of a mendicant  the consequence was that by no effort could the parsons daughterinlaw bring herself to let him know her state  her reluctance to communicate with her husbands parents might she thought lessen with the lapse of time but with her own the reverse obtained  on her leaving their house after the short visit subsequent to her marriage they were under the impression that she was ultimately going to join her husband and from that time to the present she had done nothing to disturb their belief that she was awaiting his return in comfort hoping against hope that his journey to brazil would result in a short stay only after which he would come to fetch her or that he would write for her to join him in any case that they would soon present a united front to their families and the world  this hope she still fostered  to let her parents know that she was a deserted wife dependent now that she had relieved their necessities on her own hands for a living after the éclat of a marriage which was to nullify the collapse of the first attempt would be too much indeed  the set of brilliants returned to her mind  where clare had deposited them she did not know and it mattered little if it were true that she could only use and not sell them  even were they absolutely hers it would be passing mean to enrich herself by a legal title to them which was not essentially hers at all  meanwhile her husbands days had been by no means free from trial at this moment he was lying ill of fever in the clay lands near curitiba in brazil having been drenched with thunderstorms and persecuted by other hardships in common with all the english farmers and farmlabourers who just at this time were deluded into going thither by the promises of the brazilian government and by the baseless assumption that those frames which ploughing and sowing on english uplands had resisted all the weathers to whose moods they had been born could resist equally well all the weathers by which they were surprised on brazilian plains  to return  thus it happened that when the last of tesss sovereigns had been spent she was unprovided with others to take their place while on account of the season she found it increasingly difficult to get employment  not being aware of the rarity of intelligence energy health and willingness in any sphere of life she refrained from seeking an indoor occupation fearing towns large houses people of means and social sophistication and of manners other than rural  from that direction of gentility black care had come society might be better than she supposed from her slight experience of it  but she had no proof of this and her instinct in the circumstances was to avoid its purlieus  the small dairies to the west beyond portbredy in which she had served as supernumerary milkmaid during the spring and summer required no further aid  room would probably have been made for her at talbothays if only out of sheer compassion but comfortable as her life had been there she could not go back  the anticlimax would be too intolerable and her return might bring reproach upon her idolized husband  she could not have borne their pity and their whispered remarks to one another upon her strange situation though she would almost have faced a knowledge of her circumstances by every individual there so long as her story had remained isolated in the mind of each  it was the interchange of ideas about her that made her sensitiveness wince  tess could not account for this distinction she simply knew that she felt it  she was now on her way to an upland farm in the centre of the county to which she had been recommended by a wandering letter which had reached her from marian  marian had somehow heard that tess was separated from her husbandprobably through izz huettand the goodnatured and now tippling girl deeming tess in trouble had hastened to notify to her former friend that she herself had gone to this upland spot after leaving the dairy and would like to see her there where there was room for other hands if it was really true that she worked again as of old  with the shortening of the days all hope of obtaining her husbands forgiveness began to leave her and there was something of the habitude of the wild animal in the unreflecting instinct with which she rambled ondisconnecting herself by littles from her eventful past at every step obliterating her identity giving no thought to accidents or contingencies which might make a quick discovery of her whereabouts by others of importance to her own happiness if not to theirs  among the difficulties of her lonely position not the least was the attention she excited by her appearance a certain bearing of distinction which she had caught from clare being superadded to her natural attractiveness  whilst the clothes lasted which had been prepared for her marriage these casual glances of interest caused her no inconvenience but as soon as she was compelled to don the wrapper of a fieldwoman rude words were addressed to her more than once but nothing occurred to cause her bodily fear till a particular november afternoon  she had preferred the country west of the river brit to the upland farm for which she was now bound because for one thing it was nearer to the home of her husbands father and to hover about that region unrecognized with the notion that she might decide to call at the vicarage some day gave her pleasure  but having once decided to try the higher and drier levels she pressed back eastward marching afoot towards the village of chalknewton where she meant to pass the night  the lane was long and unvaried and owing to the rapid shortening of the days dusk came upon her before she was aware  she had reached the top of a hill down which the lane stretched its serpentine length in glimpses when she heard footsteps behind her back and in a few moments she was overtaken by a man  he stepped up alongside tess and said  good night my pretty maid to which she civilly replied  the light still remaining in the sky lit up her face though the landscape was nearly dark  the man turned and stared hard at her  why surely it is the young wench who was at trantridge awhile young squire durbervilles friend  i was there at that time though i dont live there now  she recognized in him the welltodo boor whom angel had knocked down at the inn for addressing her coarsely  a spasm of anguish shot through her and she returned him no answer  be honest enough to own it and that what i said in the town was true though your fancyman was so up about ithey my sly one  you ought to beg my pardon for that blow of his considering  still no answer came from tess  there seemed only one escape for her hunted soul  she suddenly took to her heels with the speed of the wind and without looking behind her ran along the road till she came to a gate which opened directly into a plantation  into this she plunged and did not pause till she was deep enough in its shade to be safe against any possibility of discovery  under foot the leaves were dry and the foliage of some holly bushes which grew among the deciduous trees was dense enough to keep off draughts  she scraped together the dead leaves till she had formed them into a large heap making a sort of nest in the middle  into this tess crept  such sleep as she got was naturally fitful she fancied she heard strange noises but persuaded herself that they were caused by the breeze  she thought of her husband in some vague warm clime on the other side of the globe while she was here in the cold  was there another such a wretched being as she in the world  tess asked herself and thinking of her wasted life said all is vanity she repeated the words mechanically till she reflected that this was a most inadequate thought for modern days  solomon had thought as far as that more than two thousand years ago she herself though not in the van of thinkers had got much further  if all were only vanity who would mind it  all was alas worse than vanityinjustice punishment exaction death  the wife of angel clare put her hand to her brow and felt its curve and the edges of her eyesockets perceptible under the soft skin and thought as she did so that a time would come when that bone would be bare  i wish it were now she said  in the midst of these whimsical fancies she heard a new strange sound among the leaves  it might be the wind yet there was scarcely any wind  sometimes it was a palpitation sometimes a flutter sometimes it was a sort of gasp or gurgle  soon she was certain that the noises came from wild creatures of some kind the more so when originating in the boughs overhead they were followed by the fall of a heavy body upon the ground  had she been ensconced here under other and more pleasant conditions she would have become alarmed but outside humanity she had at present no fear  day at length broke in the sky  when it had been day aloft for some little while it became day in the wood  directly the assuring and prosaic light of the worlds active hours had grown strong she crept from under her hillock of leaves and looked around boldly  then she perceived what had been going on to disturb her  the plantation wherein she had taken shelter ran down at this spot into a peak which ended it hitherward outside the hedge being arable ground  under the trees several pheasants lay about their rich plumage dabbled with blood some were dead some feebly twitching a wing some staring up at the sky some pulsating quickly some contorted some stretched outall of them writhing in agony except the fortunate ones whose tortures had ended during the night by the inability of nature to bear more  tess guessed at once the meaning of this  the birds had been driven down into this corner the day before by some shootingparty and while those that had dropped dead under the shot or had died before nightfall had been searched for and carried off many badly wounded birds had escaped and hidden themselves away or risen among the thick boughs where they had maintained their position till they grew weaker with loss of blood in the nighttime when they had fallen one by one as she had heard them  she had occasionally caught glimpses of these men in girlhood looking over hedges or peeping through bushes and pointing their guns strangely accoutred a bloodthirsty light in their eyes  she had been told that rough and brutal as they seemed just then they were not like this all the year round but were in fact quite civil persons save during certain weeks of autumn and winter when like the inhabitants of the malay peninsula they ran amuck and made it their purpose to destroy lifein this case harmless feathered creatures brought into being by artificial means solely to gratify these propensitiesat once so unmannerly and so unchivalrous towards their weaker fellows in natures teeming family  with the impulse of a soul who could feel for kindred sufferers as much as for herself tesss first thought was to put the still living birds out of their torture and to this end with her own hands she broke the necks of as many as she could find leaving them to lie where she had found them till the gamekeepers should comeas they probably would cometo look for them a second time  poor darlingsto suppose myself the most miserable being on earth in the sight o such misery as yours she exclaimed her tears running down as she killed the birds tenderly  and not a twinge of bodily pain about me  i be not mangled and i be not bleeding and i have two hands to feed and clothe me  she was ashamed of herself for her gloom of the night based on nothing more tangible than a sense of condemnation under an arbitrary law of society which had no foundation in nature    xlii   it was now broad day and she started again emerging cautiously upon the highway  but there was no need for caution not a soul was at hand and tess went onward with fortitude her recollection of the birds silent endurance of their night of agony impressing upon her the relativity of sorrows and the tolerable nature of her own if she could once rise high enough to despise opinion  but that she could not do so long as it was held by clare  she reached chalknewton and breakfasted at an inn where several young men were troublesomely complimentary to her good looks somehow she felt hopeful for was it not possible that her husband also might say these same things to her even yet  she was bound to take care of herself on the chance of it and keep off these casual lovers  to this end tess resolved to run no further risks from her appearance  as soon as she got out of the village she entered a thicket and took from her basket one of the oldest fieldgowns which she had never put on even at the dairynever since she had worked among the stubble at marlott  she also by a felicitous thought took a handkerchief from her bundle and tied it round her face under her bonnet covering her chin and half her cheeks and temples as if she were suffering from toothache then with her little scissors by the aid of a pocket lookingglass she mercilessly nipped her eyebrows off and thus insured against aggressive admiration she went on her uneven way  what a mommet of a maid said the next man who met her to a companion  tears came into her eyes for very pity of herself as she heard him  but i dont care she said  o noi dont care  ill always be ugly now because angel is not here and i have nobody to take care of me  my husband that was is gone away and never will love me any more but i love him just the same and hate all other men and like to make em think scornfully of me  thus tess walks on a figure which is part of the landscape a fieldwoman pure and simple in winter guise a gray serge cape a red woollen cravat a stuff skirt covered by a whiteybrown rough wrapper and buffleather gloves  every thread of that old attire has become faded and thin under the stroke of raindrops the burn of sunbeams and the stress of winds  there is no sign of young passion in her now        the maidens mouth is cold              fold over simple fold      binding her head   inside this exterior over which the eye might have roved as over a thing scarcely percipient almost inorganic there was the record of a pulsing life which had learnt too well for its years of the dust and ashes of things of the cruelty of lust and the fragility of love  next day the weather was bad but she trudged on the honesty directness and impartiality of elemental enmity disconcerting her but little  her object being a winters occupation and a winters home there was no time to lose  her experience of short hirings had been such that she was determined to accept no more  thus she went forward from farm to farm in the direction of the place whence marian had written to her which she determined to make use of as a last shift only its rumoured stringencies being the reverse of tempting  first she inquired for the lighter kinds of employment and as acceptance in any variety of these grew hopeless applied next for the less light till beginning with the dairy and poultry tendance that she liked best she ended with the heavy and course pursuits which she liked leastwork on arable land work of such roughness indeed as she would never have deliberately voluteered for  towards the second evening she reached the irregular chalk tableland or plateau bosomed with semiglobular tumulias if cybele the manybreasted were supinely extended therewhich stretched between the valley of her birth and the valley of her love  here the air was dry and cold and the long cartroads were blown white and dusty within a few hours after rain  there were few trees or none those that would have grown in the hedges being mercilessly plashed down with the quickset by the tenantfarmers the natural enemies of tree bush and brake  in the middle distance ahead of her she could see the summits of bulbarrow and of nettlecombe tout and they seemed friendly  they had a low and unassuming aspect from this upland though as approached on the other side from blackmoor in her childhood they were as lofty bastions against the sky southerly at many miles distance and over the hills and ridges coastward she could discern a surface like polished steel it was the english channel at a point far out towards france  before her in a slight depression were the remains of a village she had in fact reached flintcombash the place of marians sojourn  there seemed to be no help for it hither she was doomed to come  the stubborn soil around her showed plainly enough that the kind of labour in demand here was of the roughest kind but it was time to rest from searching and she resolved to stay particularly as it began to rain  at the entrance to the village was a cottage whose gable jutted into the road and before applying for a lodging she stood under its shelter and watched the evening close in  who would think i was mrs angel clare she said  the wall felt warm to her back and shoulders and she found that immediately within the gable was the cottage fireplace the heat of which came through the bricks  she warmed her hands upon them and also put her cheekred and moist with the drizzleagainst their comforting surface  the wall seemed to be the only friend she had she had so little wish to leave it that she could have stayed there all night  tess could hear the occupants of the cottagegathered together after their days labourtalking to each other within and the rattle of their supperplates was also audible  but in the villagestreet she had seen no soul as yet  the solitude was at last broken by the approach of one feminine figure who though the evening was cold wore the print gown and the tiltbonnet of summer time  tess instinctively thought it might be marian and when she came near enough to be distinguishable in the gloom surely enough it was she  marian was even stouter and redder in the face than formerly and decidedly shabbier in attire  at any previous period of her existence tess would hardly have cared to renew the acquaintance in such conditions but her loneliness was excessive and she responded readily to marians greeting  marian was quite respectful in her inquiries but seemed much moved by the fact that tess should still continue in no better condition than at first though she had dimly heard of the separation  tessmrs clarethe dear wife of dear he  and is it really so bad as this my child  why is your cwomely face tied up in such a way anybody been beating ee  not he  no no no  i merely did it not to be clipsed or colled marian  she pulled off in disgust a bandage which could suggest such wild thoughts  and youve got no collar on tess had been accustomed to wear a little white collar at the dairy  i know it marian  youve lost it travelling  ive not lost it  the truth is i dont care anything about my looks and so i didnt put it on  and you dont wear your weddingring  yes i do but not in public  i wear it round my neck on a ribbon i dont wish people to think who i am by marriage or that i am married at all it would be so awkward while i lead my present life  marian paused  but you be a gentlemans wife and it seems hardly fair that you should live like this  o yes it is quite fair though i am very unhappy  well well  he married youand you can be unhappy  wives are unhappy sometimes from no fault of their husbandsfrom their own  youve no faults deary that im sure of  and hes none  so it must be something outside ye both  marian dear marian will you do me a good turn without asking questions  my husband has gone abroad and somehow i have overrun my allowance so that i have to fall back upon my old work for a time do not call me mrs clare but tess as before  do they want a hand here  o yes theyll take one always because few care to come  tis a starveacre place  corn and swedes are all they grow  though i be here myself i feel tis a pity for such as you to come  but you used to be as good a dairywoman as i  yes but ive got out o that since i took to drink  lord thats the only comfort ive got now  if you engage youll be set swedehacking  thats what i be doing but you wont like it  oanything  will you speak for me  you will do better by speaking for yourself  very well  now marian remembernothing about him if i get the place  i dont wish to bring his name down to the dirt  marian who was really a trustworthy girl though of coarser grain than tess promised anything she asked  this is paynight she said and if you were to come with me you would know at once  i be real sorry that you are not happy but tis because hes away i know  you couldnt be unhappy if he were here even if he gied ye no moneyeven if he used you like a drudge  thats true i could not  they walked on together and soon reached the farmhouse which was almost sublime in its dreariness there was not a tree within sight there was not at this season a green pasturenothing but fallow and turnips everywhere in large fields divided by hedges plashed to unrelieved levels  tess waited outside the door of the farmhouse till the group of workfolk had received their wages and then marian introduced her the farmer himself it appeared was not at home but his wife who represented him this evening made no objection to hiring tess on her agreeing to remain till old ladyday  female fieldlabour was seldom offered now and its cheapness made it profitable for tasks which women could perform as readily as men  having signed the agreement there was nothing more for tess to do at present than to get a lodging and she found one in the house at whose gablewall she had warmed herself  it was a poor subsistence that she had ensured but it would afford a shelter for the winter at any rate  that night she wrote to inform her parents of her new address in case a letter should arrive at marlott from her husband  but she did not tell them of the sorriness of her situation it might have brought reproach upon him    xliii   there was no exaggeration in marians definition of flintcombash farm as a starveacre place  the single fat thing on the soil was marian herself and she was an importation  of the three classes of village the village cared for by its lord the village cared for by itself and the village uncared for either by itself or by its lord in other words the village of a resident squiress tenantry the village of free or copyholders and the absenteeowners village farmed with the land this place flintcombash was the third  but tess set to work  patience that blending of moral courage with physical timidity was now no longer a minor feature in mrs angel clare and it sustained her  the swedefield in which she and her companion were set hacking was a stretch of a hundred odd acres in one patch on the highest ground of the farm rising above stony lanchets or lynchetsthe outcrop of siliceous veins in the chalk formation composed of myriads of loose white flints in bulbous cusped and phallic shapes  the upper half of each turnip had been eaten off by the livestock and it was the business of the two women to grub up the lower or earthy half of the root with a hooked fork called a hacker that it might be eaten also every leaf of the vegetable having already been consumed the whole field was in colour a desolate drab it was a complexion without features as if a face from chin to brow should be only an expanse of skin  the sky wore in another colour the same likeness a white vacuity of countenance with the lineaments gone  so these two upper and nether visages confronted each other all day long the white face looking down on the brown face and the brown face looking up at the white face without anything standing between them but the two girls crawling over the surface of the former like flies  nobody came near them and their movements showed a mechanical regularity their forms standing enshrouded in hessian wroppers sleeved brown pinafores tied behind to the bottom to keep their gowns from blowing aboutscant skirts revealing boots that reached high up the ankles and yellow sheepskin gloves with gauntlets  the pensive character which the curtained hood lent to their bent heads would have reminded the observer of some early italian conception of the two marys  they worked on hour after hour unconscious of the forlorn aspect they bore in the landscape not thinking of the justice or injustice of their lot  even in such a position as theirs it was possible to exist in a dream  in the afternoon the rain came on again and marian said that they need not work any more  but if they did not work they would not be paid so they worked on  it was so high a situation this field that the rain had no occasion to fall but raced along horizontally upon the yelling wind sticking into them like glass splinters till they were wet through  tess had not known till now what was really meant by that  there are degrees of dampness and a very little is called being wet through in common talk  but to stand working slowly in a field and feel the creep of rainwater first in legs and shoulders then on hips and head then at back front and sides and yet to work on till the leaden light diminishes and marks that the sun is down demands a distinct modicum of stoicism even of valour  yet they did not feel the wetness so much as might be supposed  they were both young and they were talking of the time when they lived and loved together at talbothays dairy that happy green tract of land where summer had been liberal in her gifts in substance to all emotionally to these  tess would fain not have conversed with marian of the man who was legally if not actually her husband but the irresistible fascination of the subject betrayed her into reciprocating marians remarks  and thus as has been said though the damp curtains of their bonnets flapped smartly into their faces and their wrappers clung about them to wearisomeness they lived all this afternoon in memories of green sunny romantic talbothays  you can see a gleam of a hill within a few miles o froom valley from here when tis fine said marian  ah  can you said tess awake to the new value of this locality  so the two forces were at work here as everywhere the inherent will to enjoy and the circumstantial will against enjoyment  marians will had a method of assisting itself by taking from her pocket as the afternoon wore on a pint bottle corked with white rag from which she invited tess to drink  tesss unassisted power of dreaming however being enough for her sublimation at present she declined except the merest sip and then marian took a pull from the spirits  ive got used to it she said and cant leave it off now  tis my only comfortyou see i lost him you didnt and you can do without it perhaps  tess thought her loss as great as marians but upheld by the dignity of being angels wife in the letter at least she accepted marians differentiation  amid this scene tess slaved in the morning frosts and in the afternoon rains  when it was not swedegrubbing it was swedetrimming in which process they sliced off the earth and the fibres with a billhook before storing the roots for future use  at this occupation they could shelter themselves by a thatched hurdle if it rained but if it was frosty even their thick leather gloves could not prevent the frozen masses they handled from biting their fingers still tess hoped  she had a conviction that sooner or later the magnanimity which she persisted in reckoning as a chief ingredient of clares character would lead him to rejoin her  marian primed to a humorous mood would discover the queershaped flints aforesaid and shriek with laughter tess remaining severely obtuse  they often looked across the country to where the var or froom was know to stretch even though they might not be able to see it and fixing their eyes on the cloaking gray mist imagined the old times they had spent out there  ah said marian how i should like another or two of our old set to come here  then we could bring up talbothays every day here afield and talk of he and of what nice times we had there and o the old things we used to know and make it all come back amost in seeming  marians eyes softened and her voice grew vague as the visions returned  ill write to izz huett she said  shes biding at home doing nothing now i know and ill tell her we be here and ask her to come and perhaps retty is well enough now  tess had nothing to say against the proposal and the next she heard of this plan for importing old talbothays joys was two or three days later when marian informed her that izz had replied to her inquiry and had promised to come if she could  there had not been such a winter for years  it came on in stealthy and measured glides like the moves of a chessplayer  one morning the few lonely trees and the thorns of the hedgerows appeared as if they had put off a vegetable for an animal integument  every twig was covered with a white nap as of fur grown from the rind during the night giving it four times its usual stoutness the whole bush or tree forming a staring sketch in white lines on the mournful gray of the sky and horizon  cobwebs revealed their presence on sheds and walls where none had ever been observed till brought out into visibility by the crystallizing atmosphere hanging like loops of white worsted from salient points of the outhouses posts and gates  after this season of congealed dampness came a spell of dry frost when strange birds from behind the north pole began to arrive silently on the upland of flintcombash gaunt spectral creatures with tragical eyeseyes which had witnessed scenes of cataclysmal horror in inaccessible polar regions of a magnitude such as no human being had ever conceived in curdling temperatures that no man could endure which had beheld the crash of icebergs and the slide of snowhills by the shooting light of the aurora been half blinded by the whirl of colossal storms and terraqueous distortions and retained the expression of feature that such scenes had engendered these nameless birds came quite near to tess and marian but of all they had seen which humanity would never see they brought no account  the travellers ambition to tell was not theirs and with dumb impassivity they dismissed experiences which they did not value for the immediate incidents of this homely uplandthe trivial movements of the two girls in disturbing the clods with their hackers so as to uncover something or other that these visitants relished as food  then one day a peculiar quality invaded the air of this open country there came a moisture which was not of rain and a cold which was not of frost  it chilled the eyeballs of the twain made their brows ache penetrated to their skeletons affecting the surface of the body less than its core  they knew that it meant snow and in the night the snow came  tess who continued to live at the cottage with the warm gable that cheered any lonely pedestrian who paused beside it awoke in the night and heard above the thatch noises which seemed to signify that the roof had turned itself into a gymnasium of all the winds  when she lit her lamp to get up in the morning she found that the snow had blown through a chink in the casement forming a white cone of the finest powder against the inside and had also come down the chimney so that it lay soledeep upon the floor on which her shoes left tracks when she moved about  without the storm drove so fast as to create a snowmist in the kitchen but as yet it was too dark outofdoors to see anything  tess knew that it was impossible to go on with the swedes and by the time she had finished breakfast beside the solitary little lamp marian arrived to tell her that they were to join the rest of the women at reeddrawing in the barn till the weather changed  as soon therefore as the uniform cloak of darkness without began to turn to a disordered medley of grays they blew out the lamp wrapped themselves up in their thickest pinners tied their woollen cravats round their necks and across their chests and started for the barn the snow had followed the birds from the polar basin as a white pillar of a cloud and individual flakes could not be seen  the blast smelt of icebergs arctic seas whales and white bears carrying the snow so that it licked the land but did not deepen on it  they trudged onwards with slanted bodies through the flossy fields keeping as well as they could in the shelter of hedges which however acted as strainers rather than screens  the air afflicted to pallor with the hoary multitudes that infested it twisted and spun them eccentrically suggesting an achromatic chaos of things  but both the young women were fairly cheerful such weather on a dry upland is not in itself dispiriting  haha the cunning northern birds knew this was coming said marian  depend upont they keep just in front ot all the way from the north star  your husband my dear is i make no doubt having scorching weather all this time  lord if he could only see his pretty wife now  not that this weather hurts your beauty at allin fact it rather does it good  you mustnt talk about him to me marian said tess severely  well butsurely you care forn  do you  instead of answering tess with tears in her eyes impulsively faced in the direction in which she imagined south america to lie and putting up her lips blew out a passionate kiss upon the snowy wind  well well i know you do  but pon my body it is a rum life for a married couple  therei wont say another word  well as for the weather it wont hurt us in the wheatbarn but reeddrawing is fearful hard workworse than swedehacking  i can stand it because im stout but you be slimmer than i  i cant think why maister should have set ee at it  they reached the wheatbarn and entered it  one end of the long structure was full of corn the middle was where the reeddrawing was carried on and there had already been placed in the reedpress the evening before as many sheaves of wheat as would be sufficient for the women to draw from during the day  why heres izz said marian  izz it was and she came forward  she had walked all the way from her mothers home on the previous afternoon and not deeming the distance so great had been belated arriving however just before the snow began and sleeping at the alehouse  the farmer had agreed with her mother at market to take her on if she came today and she had been afraid to disappoint him by delay  in addition to tess marian and izz there were two women from a neighbouring village two amazonian sisters whom tess with a start remembered as dark car the queen of spades and her junior the queen of diamondsthose who had tried to fight with her in the midnight quarrel at trantridge  they showed no recognition of her and possibly had none for they had been under the influence of liquor on that occasion and were only temporary sojourners there as here  they did all kinds of mens work by preference including wellsinking hedging ditching and excavating without any sense of fatigue  noted reeddrawers were they too and looked round upon the other three with some superciliousness  putting on their gloves all set to work in a row in front of the press an erection formed of two posts connected by a crossbeam under which the sheaves to be drawn from were laid ears outward the beam being pegged down by pins in the uprights and lowered as the sheaves diminished  the day hardened in colour the light coming in at the barndoors upwards from the snow instead of downwards from the sky  the girls pulled handful after handful from the press but by reason of the presence of the strange women who were recounting scandals marian and izz could not at first talk of old times as they wished to do presently they heard the muffled tread of a horse and the farmer rode up to the barndoor  when he had dismounted he came close to tess and remained looking musingly at the side of her face  she had not turned at first but his fixed attitude led her to look round when she perceived that her employer was the native of trantridge from whom she had taken flight on the highroad because of his allusion to her history  he waited till she had carried the drawn bundles to the pile outside when he said so you be the young woman who took my civility in such ill part  be drowned if i didnt think you might be as soon as i heard of your being hired  well you thought you had got the better of me the first time at the inn with your fancyman and the second time on the road when you bolted but now i think ive got the better you  he concluded with a hard laugh  tess between the amazons and the farmer like a bird caught in a clapnet returned no answer continuing to pull the straw  she could read character sufficiently well to know by this time that she had nothing to fear from her employers gallantry it was rather the tyranny induced by his mortification at clares treatment of him upon the whole she preferred that sentiment in man and felt brave enough to endure it  you thought i was in love with ee i suppose  some women are such fools to take every look as serious earnest  but theres nothing like a winter afield for taking that nonsense out o young wenches heads and youve signed and agreed till ladyday  now are you going to beg my pardon  i think you ought to beg mine  very wellas you like  but well see which is master here  be they all the sheaves youve done today  yes sir  tis a very poor show  just see what theyve done over there pointing to the two stalwart women  the rest too have done better than you  theyve all practised it before and i have not  and i thought it made no difference to you as it is task work and we are only paid for what we do  oh but it does  i want the barn cleared  i am going to work all the afternoon instead of leaving at two as the others will do  he looked sullenly at her and went away  tess felt that she could not have come to a much worse place but anything was better than gallantry  when two oclock arrived the professional reeddrawers tossed off the last halfpint in their flagon put down their hooks tied their last sheaves and went away  marian and izz would have done likewise but on hearing that tess meant to stay to make up by longer hours for her lack of skill they would not leave her looking out at the snow which still fell marian exclaimed now weve got it all to ourselves  and so at last the conversation turned to their old experiences at the dairy and of course the incidents of their affection for angel clare  izz and marian said mrs angel clare with a dignity which was extremely touching seeing how very little of a wife she was i cant join in talk with you now as i used to do about mr clare you will see that i cannot because although he is gone away from me for the present he is my husband  izz was by nature the sauciest and most caustic of all the four girls who had loved clare  he was a very splendid lover no doubt she said but i dont think he is a too fond husband to go away from you so soon  he had to gohe was obliged to go to see about the land over there pleaded tess  he might have tided ee over the winter  ahthats owing to an accidenta misunderstanding and we wont argue it tess answered with tearfulness in her words  perhaps theres a good deal to be said for him  he did not go away like some husbands without telling me and i can always find out where he is  after this they continued for some long time in a reverie as they went on seizing the ears of corn drawing out the straw gathering it under their arms and cutting off the ears with their billhooks nothing sounding in the barn but the swish of the straw and the crunch of the hook  then tess suddenly flagged and sank down upon the heap of wheatears at her feet  i knew you wouldnt be able to stand it cried marian  it wants harder flesh than yours for this work  just then the farmer entered  oh thats how you get on when i am away he said to her  but it is my own loss she pleaded  not yours  i want it finished he said doggedly as he crossed the barn and went out at the other door  dont ee mind him theres a dear said marian  ive worked here before  now you go and lie down there and izz and i will make up your number  i dont like to let you do that  im taller than you too  however she was so overcome that she consented to lie down awhile and reclined on a heap of pulltailsthe refuse after the straight straw had been drawnthrown up at the further side of the barn  her succumbing had been as largely owning to agitation at the reopening the subject of her separation from her husband as to the hard work she lay in a state of percipience without volition and the rustle of the straw and the cutting of the ears by the others had the weight of bodily touches  she could hear from her corner in addition to these noises the murmur of their voices  she felt certain that they were continuing the subject already broached but their voices were so low that she could not catch the words  at last tess grew more and more anxious to know what they were saying and persuading herself that she felt better she got up and resumed work  then izz huett broke down  she had walked more than a dozen miles the previous evening had gone to bed at midnight and had risen again at five oclock  marian alone thanks to her bottle of liquor and her stoutness of build stood the strain upon back and arms without suffering  tess urged izz to leave off agreeing as she felt better to finish the day without her and make equal division of the number of sheaves  izz accepted the offer gratefully and disappeared through the great door into the snowy track to her lodging  marian as was the case every afternoon at this time on account of the bottle began to feel in a romantic vein  i should not have thought it of himnever she said in a dreamy tone  and i loved him so  i didnt mind his having you  but this about izz is too bad  tess in her start at the words narrowly missed cutting off a finger with the billhook  is it about my husband she stammered  well yes  izz said dont ee tell her but i am sure i cant help it  it was what he wanted izz to do  he wanted her to go off to brazil with him  tesss face faded as white as the scene without and its curves straightened  and did izz refuse to go she asked  i dont know  anyhow he changed his mind  poohthen he didnt mean it  twas just a mans jest  yes he did for he drove her a goodways towards the station  he didnt take her  they pulled on in silence till tess without any premonitory symptoms burst out crying  there said marian  now i wish i hadnt told ee  no  it is a very good thing that you have done  i have been living on in a thirtover lackaday way and have not seen what it may lead to  i ought to have sent him a letter oftener  he said i could not go to him but he didnt say i was not to write as often as i liked i wont dally like this any longer  i have been very wrong and neglectful in leaving everything to be done by him  the dim light in the barn grew dimmer and they could see to work no longer  when tess had reached home that evening and had entered into the privacy of her little whitewashed chamber she began impetuously writing a letter to clare  but falling into doubt she could not finish it  afterwards she took the ring from the ribbon on which she wore it next her heart and retained it on her finger all night as if to fortify herself in the sensation that she was really the wife of this elusive lover of hers who could propose that izz should go with him abroad so shortly after he had left her  knowing that how could she write entreaties to him or show that she cared for him any more    xliv   by the disclosure in the barn her thoughts were led anew in the direction which they had taken more than once of lateto the distant emminster vicarage  it was through her husbands parents that she had been charged to send a letter to clare if she desired and to write to them direct if in difficulty  but that sense of her having morally no claim upon him had always led tess to suspend her impulse to send these notes and to the family at the vicarage therefore as to her own parents since her marriage she was virtually nonexistent  this selfeffacement in both directions had been quite in consonance with her independent character of desiring nothing by way of favour or pity to which she was not entitled on a fair consideration of her deserts  she had set herself to stand or fall by her qualities and to waive such merely technical claims upon a strange family as had been established for her by the flimsy fact of a member of that family in a season of impulse writing his name in a churchbook beside hers  but now that she was stung to a fever by izzs tale there was a limit to her powers of renunciation  why had her husband not written to her  he had distinctly implied that he would at least let her know of the locality to which he had journeyed but he had not sent a line to notify his address  was he really indifferent  but was he ill  was it for her to make some advance  surely she might summon the courage of solicitude call at the vicarage for intelligence and express her grief at his silence  if angels father were the good man she had heard him represented to be he would be able to enter into her heartstarved situation  her social hardships she could conceal  to leave the farm on a weekday was not in her power sunday was the only possible opportunity  flintcombash being in the middle of the cretaceous tableland over which no railway had climbed as yet it would be necessary to walk  and the distance being fifteen miles each way she would have to allow herself a long day for the undertaking by rising early  a fortnight later when the snow had gone and had been followed by a hard black frost she took advantage of the state of the roads to try the experiment  at four oclock that sunday morning she came downstairs and stepped out into the starlight  the weather was still favourable the ground ringing under her feet like an anvil  marian and izz were much interested in her excursion knowing that the journey concerned her husband  their lodgings were in a cottage a little further along the lane but they came and assisted tess in her departure and argued that she should dress up in her very prettiest guise to captivate the hearts of her parentsinlaw though she knowing of the austere and calvinistic tenets of old mr clare was indifferent and even doubtful  a year had now elapsed since her sad marriage but she had preserved sufficient draperies from the wreck of her then full wardrobe to clothe her very charmingly as a simple country girl with no pretensions to recent fashion a soft gray woollen gown with white crape quilling against the pink skin of her face and neck and a black velvet jacket and hat  tis a thousand pities your husband cant see ee nowyou do look a real beauty said izz huett regarding tess as she stood on the threshold between the steely starlight without and the yellow candlelight within  izz spoke with a magnanimous abandonment of herself to the situation she could not beno woman with a heart bigger than a hazelnut could beantagonistic to tess in her presence the influence which she exercised over those of her own sex being of a warmth and strength quite unusual curiously overpowering the less worthy feminine feelings of spite and rivalry  with a final tug and touch here and a slight brush there they let her go and she was absorbed into the pearly air of the foredawn they heard her footsteps tap along the hard road as she stepped out to her full pace  even izz hoped she would win and though without any particular respect for her own virtue felt glad that she had been prevented wronging her friend when momentarily tempted by clare  it was a year ago all but a day that clare had married tess and only a few days less than a year that he had been absent from her still to start on a brisk walk and on such an errand as hers on a dry clear wintry morning through the rarefied air of these chalky hogsbacks was not depressing and there is no doubt that her dream at starting was to win the heart of her motherinlaw tell her whole history to that lady enlist her on her side and so gain back the truant  in time she reached the edge of the vast escarpment below which stretched the loamy vale of blackmoor now lying misty and still in the dawn  instead of the colourless air of the uplands the atmosphere down there was a deep blue  instead of the great enclosures of a hundred acres in which she was now accustomed to toil there were little fields below her of less than halfadozen acres so numerous that they looked from this height like the meshes of a net  here the landscape was whiteybrown down there as in froom valley it was always green  yet it was in that vale that her sorrow had taken shape and she did not love it as formerly  beauty to her as to all who have felt lay not in the thing but in what the thing symbolized  keeping the vale on her right she steered steadily westward passing above the hintocks crossing at rightangles the highroad from shertonabbas to casterbridge and skirting dogbury hill and highstoy with the dell between them called the devils kitchen still following the elevated way she reached crossinhand where the stone pillar stands desolate and silent to mark the site of a miracle or murder or both  three miles further she cut across the straight and deserted roman road called longash lane leaving which as soon as she reached it she dipped down a hill by a transverse lane into the small town or village of evershead being now about halfway over the distance  she made a halt here and breakfasted a second time heartily enoughnot at the sowandacorn for she avoided inns but at a cottage by the church  the second half of her journey was through a more gentle country by way of benvill lane  but as the mileage lessened between her and the spot of her pilgrimage so did tesss confidence decrease and her enterprise loom out more formidably  she saw her purpose in such staring lines and the landscape so faintly that she was sometimes in danger of losing her way  however about noon she paused by a gate on the edge of the basin in which emminster and its vicarage lay  the square tower beneath which she knew that at that moment the vicar and his congregation were gathered had a severe look in her eyes  she wished that she had somehow contrived to come on a weekday  such a good man might be prejudiced against a woman who had chosen sunday never realizing the necessities of her case but it was incumbent upon her to go on now  she took off the thick boots in which she had walked thus far put on her pretty thin ones of patent leather and stuffing the former into the hedge by the gatepost where she might readily find them again descended the hill the freshness of colour she had derived from the keen air thinning away in spite of her as she drew near the parsonage  tess hoped for some accident that might favour her but nothing favoured her  the shrubs on the vicarage lawn rustled uncomfortably in the frosty breeze she could not feel by any stretch of imagination dressed to her highest as she was that the house was the residence of near relations and yet nothing essential in nature or emotion divided her from them in pains pleasures thoughts birth death and afterdeath they were the same  she nerved herself by an effort entered the swinggate and rang the doorbell  the thing was done there could be no retreat  no the thing was not done  nobody answered to her ringing  the effort had to be risen to and made again  she rang a second time and the agitation of the act coupled with her weariness after the fifteen miles walk led her support herself while she waited by resting her hand on her hip and her elbow against the wall of the porch  the wind was so nipping that the ivyleaves had become wizened and gray each tapping incessantly upon its neighbour with a disquieting stir of her nerves  a piece of bloodstained paper caught up from some meatbuyers dustheap beat up and down the road without the gate too flimsy to rest too heavy to fly away and a few straws kept it company  the second peal had been louder and still nobody came  then she walked out of the porch opened the gate and passed through  and though she looked dubiously at the housefront as if inclined to return it was with a breath of relied that she closed the gate  a feeling haunted her that she might have been recognized though how she could not tell and orders been given not to admit her  tess went as far as the corner  she had done all she could do but determined not to escape present trepidation at the expense of future distress she walked back again quite past the house looking up at all the windows  ahthe explanation was that they were all at church every one  she remembered her husband saying that his father always insisted upon the household servants included going to morningservice and as a consequence eating cold food when they came home  it was therefore only necessary to wait till the service was over  she would not make herself conspicuous by waiting on the spot and she started to get past the church into the lane  but as she reached the churchyardgate the people began pouring out and tess found herself in the midst of them  the emminster congregation looked at her as only a congregation of small countrytownsfolk walking home at its leisure can look at a woman out of the common whom it perceives to be a stranger  she quickened her pace and ascended the the road by which she had come to find a retreat between its hedges till the vicars family should have lunched and it might be convenient for them to receive her she soon distanced the churchgoers except two youngish men who linked arminarm were beating up behind her at a quick step  as they drew nearer she could hear their voices engaged in earnest discourse and with the natural quickness of a woman in her situation did not fail to recognize in those noises the quality of her husbands tones  the pedestrians were his two brothers forgetting all her plans tesss one dread was lest they should overtake her now in her disorganized condition before she was prepared to confront them for though she felt that they could not identify her she instinctively dreaded their scrutiny  the more briskly they walked the more briskly walked she  they were plainly bent upon taking a short quick stroll before going indoors to lunch or dinner to restore warmth to limbs chilled with sitting through a long service  only one person had preceded tess up the hilla ladylike young woman somewhat interesting though perhaps a trifle guindée and prudish  tess had nearly overtaken her when the speed of her brothersinlaw brought them so nearly behind her back that she could hear every word of their conversation  they said nothing however which particularly interested her till observing the young lady still further in front one of them remarked there is mercy chant let us overtake her  tess knew the name  it was the woman who had been destined for angels lifecompanion by his and her parents and whom he probably would have married but for her intrusive self  she would have known as much without previous information if she had waited a moment for one of the brothers proceeded to say ah poor angel poor angel i never see that nice girl without more and more regretting his precipitancy in throwing himself away upon a dairymaid or whatever she may be  it is a queer business apparently  whether she has joined him yet or not i dont know but she had not done so some months ago when i heard from him  i cant say  he never tells me anything nowadays  his illconsidered marriage seems to have completed that estrangement from me which was begun by his extraordinary opinions  tess beat up the long hill still faster but she could not outwalk them without exciting notice  at last they outsped her altogether and passed her by  the young lady still further ahead heard their footsteps and turned  then there was a greeting and a shaking of hands and the three went on together  they soon reached the summit of the hill and evidently intending this point to be the limit of their promenade slackened pace and turned all three aside to the gate whereat tess had paused an hour before that time to reconnoitre the town before descending into it during their discourse one of the clerical brothers probed the hedge carefully with his umbrella and dragged something to light  heres a pair of old boots he said  thrown away i suppose by some tramp or other  some imposter who wished to come into the town barefoot perhaps and so excite our sympathies said miss chant  yes it must have been for they are excellent walkingbootsby no means worn out what a wicked thing to do  ill carry them home for some poor person  cuthbert clare who had been the one to find them picked them up for her with the crook of his stick and tesss boots were appropriated  she who had heard this walked past under the screen of her woollen veil till presently looking back she perceived that the church party had left the gate with her boots and retreated down the hill  thereupon our heroine resumed her walk  tears blinding tears were running down her face  she knew that it was all sentiment all baseless impressibility which had caused her to read the scene as her own condemnation nevertheless she could not get over it she could not contravene in her own defenceless person all those untoward omens  it was impossible to think of returning to the vicarage angels wife felt almost as if she had been hounded up that hill like a scorned thing by thoseto hersuperfine clerics  innocently as the slight had been inflicted it was somewhat unfortunate that she had encountered the sons and not the father who despite his narrowness was far less starched and ironed than they and had to the full the gift of charity  as she again thought of her dusty boots she almost pitied those habiliments for the quizzing to which they had been subjected and felt how hopeless life was for their owner  ah she said still sighing in pity of herself they didnt know that i wore those over the roughest part of the road to save these pretty ones he bought for menothey did not know it  and they didnt think that he chose the colour o my pretty frocknohow could they  if they had known perhaps they would not have cared for they dont care much for him poor thing  then she grieved for the beloved man whose conventional standard of judgement had caused her all these latter sorrows and she went her way without knowing that the greatest misfortune of her life was this feminine loss of courage at the last and critical moment through her estimating her fatherinlaw by his sons  her present condition was precisely one which would have enlisted the sympathies of old mr and mrs clare  their hearts went out of them at a bound towards extreme cases when the subtle mental troubles of the less desperate among mankind failed to win their interest or regard  in jumping at publicans and sinners they would forget that a word might be said for the worries of scribes and pharisees and this defect or limitation might have recommended their own daughterinlaw to them at this moment as a fairly choice sort of lost person for their love  thereupon she began to plod back along the road by which she had come not altogether full of hope but full of a conviction that a crisis in her life was approaching  no crisis apparently had supervened and there was nothing left for her to do but to continue upon that starveacre farm till she could again summon courage to face the vicarage  she did indeed take sufficient interest in herself to throw up her veil on this return journey as if to let the world see that she could at least exhibit a face such as mercy chant could not show  but it was done with a sorry shake of the head it is nothingit is nothing she said  nobody loves it nobody sees it who cares about the looks of a castaway like me  her journey back was rather a meander than a march  it had no sprightliness no purpose only a tendency  along the tedious length of benvill lane she began to grow tired and she leant upon gates and paused by milestones  she did not enter any house till at the seventh or eighth mile she descended the steep long hill below which lay the village or townlet of evershead where in the morning she had breakfasted with such contrasting expectations  the cottage by the church in which she again sat down was almost the first at that end of the village and while the woman fetched her some milk from the pantry tess looking down the street perceived that the place seemed quite deserted  the people are gone to afternoon service i suppose she said  no my dear said the old woman  tis too soon for that the bells haint strook out yet  they be all gone to hear the preaching in yonder barn  a ranter preaches there between the servicesan excellent fiery christian man they say  but lord i dont go to hearn  what comes in the regular way over the pulpit is hot enough for i  tess soon went onward into the village her footsteps echoing against the houses as though it were a place of the dead  nearing the central part her echoes were intruded on by other sounds and seeing the barn not far off the road she guessed these to be the utterances of the preacher  his voice became so distinct in the still clear air that she could soon catch his sentences though she was on the closed side of the barn  the sermon as might be expected was of the extremest antinomian type on justification by faith as expounded in the theology of st paul  this fixed idea of the rhapsodist was delivered with animated enthusiasm in a manner entirely declamatory for he had plainly no skill as a dialectician  although tess had not heard the beginning of the address she learnt what the text had been from its constant iteration      o foolish galatians who hath bewitched you that ye    should not obey the truth before whose eyes jesus christ    hath been evidently set forth crucified among you   tess was all the more interested as she stood listening behind in finding that the preachers doctrine was a vehement form of the view of angels father and her interest intensified when the speaker began to detail his own spiritual experiences of how he had come by those views  he had he said been the greatest of sinners  he had scoffed he had wantonly associated with the reckless and the lewd but a day of awakening had come and in a human sense it had been brought about mainly by the influence of a certain clergyman whom he had at first grossly insulted but whose parting words had sunk into his heart and had remained there till by the grace of heaven they had worked this change in him and made him what they saw him  but more startling to tess than the doctrine had been the voice which impossible as it seemed was precisely that of alec durberville  her face fixed in painful suspense she came round to the front of the barn and passed before it  the low winter sun beamed directly upon the great doubledoored entrance on this side one of the doors being open so that the rays stretched far in over the threshingfloor to the preacher and his audience all snugly sheltered from the northern breeze  the listeners were entirely villagers among them being the man whom she had seen carrying the red paintpot on a former memorable occasion  but her attention was given to the central figure who stood upon some sacks of corn facing the people and the door  the three oclock sun shone full upon him and the strange enervating conviction that her seducer confronted her which had been gaining ground in tess ever since she had heard his words distinctly was at last established as a fact indeed   end of phase the fifth      phase the sixth the convert    xlv   till this moment she had never seen or heard from durberville since her departure from trantridge  the rencounter came at a heavy moment one of all moments calculated to permit its impact with the least emotional shock  but such was unreasoning memory that though he stood there openly and palpably a converted man who was sorrowing for his past irregularities a fear overcame her paralyzing her movement so that she neither retreated nor advanced  to think of what emanated from that countenance when she saw it last and to behold it now   there was the same handsome unpleasantness of mien but now he wore neatly trimmed oldfashioned whiskers the sable moustache having disappeared and his dress was halfclerical a modification which had changed his expression sufficiently to abstract the dandyism from his features and to hinder for a second her belief in his identity  to tesss sense there was just at first a ghastly bizarrerie a grim incongruity in the march of these solemn words of scripture out of such a mouth  this too familiar intonation less than four years earlier had brought to her ears expressions of such divergent purpose that her heart became quite sick at the irony of the contrast  it was less a reform than a transfiguration  the former curves of sensuousness were now modulated to lines of devotional passion the lipshapes that had meant seductiveness were now made to express supplication the glow on the cheek that yesterday could be translated as riotousness was evangelized today into the splendour of pious rhetoric animalism had become fanaticism paganism paulinism the bold rolling eye that had flashed upon her form in the old time with such mastery now beamed with the rude energy of a theolatry that was almost ferocious  those black angularities which his face had used to put on when his wishes were thwarted now did duty in picturing the incorrigible backslider who would insist upon turning again to his wallowing in the mire  the lineaments as such seemed to complain  they had been diverted from their hereditary connotation to signify impressions for which nature did not intend them  strange that their very elevation was a misapplication that to raise seemed to falsify  yet could it be so  she would admit the ungenerous sentiment no longer  durberville was not the first wicked man who had turned away from his wickedness to save his soul alive and why should she deem it unnatural in him  it was but the usage of thought which had been jarred in her at hearing good new words in bad old notes  the greater the sinner the greater the saint it was not necessary to dive far into christian history to discover that  such impressions as these moved her vaguely and without strict definiteness  as soon as the nerveless pause of her surprise would allow her to stir her impulse was to pass on out of his sight  he had obviously not discerned her yet in her position against the sun  but the moment that she moved again he recognized her  the effect upon her old lover was electric far stronger than the effect of his presence upon her  his fire the tumultuous ring of his eloquence seemed to go out of him  his lip struggled and trembled under the words that lay upon it but deliver them it could not as long as she faced him  his eyes after their first glance upon her face hung confusedly in every other direction but hers but came back in a desperate leap every few seconds  this paralysis lasted however but a short time for tesss energies returned with the atrophy of his and she walked as fast as she was able past the barn and onward  as soon as she could reflect it appalled her this change in their relative platforms  he who had wrought her undoing was now on the side of the spirit while she remained unregenerate  and as in the legend it had resulted that her cyprian image had suddenly appeared upon his altar whereby the fire of the priest had been well nigh extinguished  she went on without turning her head  her back seemed to be endowed with a sensitiveness to ocular beamseven her clothingso alive was she to a fancied gaze which might be resting upon her from the outside of that barn  all the way along to this point her heart had been heavy with an inactive sorrow now there was a change in the quality of its trouble  that hunger for affection too long withheld was for the time displaced by an almost physical sense of an implacable past which still engirdled her  it intensified her consciousness of error to a practical despair the break of continuity between her earlier and present existence which she had hoped for had not after all taken place  bygones would never be complete bygones till she was a bygone herself  thus absorbed she recrossed the northern part of longash lane at right angles and presently saw before her the road ascending whitely to the upland along whose margin the remainder of her journey lay its dry pale surface stretched severely onward unbroken by a single figure vehicle or mark save some occasional brown horsedroppings which dotted its cold aridity here and there  while slowly breasting this ascent tess became conscious of footsteps behind her and turning she saw approaching that wellknown formso strangely accoutred as the methodistthe one personage in all the world she wished not to encounter alone on this side of the grave  there was not much time however for thought or elusion and she yielded as calmly as she could to the necessity of letting him overtake her  she saw that he was excited less by the speed of his walk than by the feelings within him  tess he said  she slackened speed without looking round  tess he repeated  it is ialec durberville  she then looked back at him and he came up  i see it is she answered coldly  wellis that all  yet i deserve no more  of course he added with a slight laugh there is something of the ridiculous to your eyes in seeing me like this  buti must put up with that   i heard you had gone away nobody knew where  tess you wonder why i have followed you  i do rather and i would that you had not with all my heart  yesyou may well say it he returned grimly as they moved onward together she with unwilling tread  but dont mistake me i beg this because you may have been led to do so in noticingif you did notice ithow your sudden appearance unnerved me down there  it was but a momentary faltering and considering what you have been to me it was natural enough  but will helped me through itthough perhaps you think me a humbug for saying itand immediately afterwards i felt that of all persons in the world whom it was my duty and desire to save from the wrath to comesneer if you likethe woman whom i had so grievously wronged was that person  i have come with that sole purpose in viewnothing more  there was the smallest vein of scorn in her words of rejoinder have you saved yourself  charity begins at home they say  i have done nothing said he indifferently heaven as i have been telling my hearers has done all  no amount of contempt that you can pour upon me tess will equal what i have poured upon myselfthe old adam of my former years  well it is a strange story believe it or not but i can tell you the means by which my conversion was brought about and i hope you will be interested enough at least to listen  have you ever heard the name of the parson of emminsteryou must have done doold mr clare one of the most earnest of his school one of the few intense men left in the church not so intense as the extreme wing of christian believers with which i have thrown in my lot but quite an exception among the established clergy the younger of whom are gradually attenuating the true doctrines by their sophistries till they are but the shadow of what they were  i only differ from him on the question of church and statethe interpretation of the text come out from among them and be ye separate saith the lordthats all  he is one who i firmly believe has been the humble means of saving more souls in this country than any other man you can name  you have heard of him  i have she said  he came to trantridge two or three years ago to preach on behalf of some missionary society and i wretched fellow that i was insulted him when in his disinterestedness he tried to reason with me and show me the way  he did not resent my conduct he simply said that some day i should receive the firstfruits of the spiritthat those who came to scoff sometimes remained to pray  there was a strange magic in his words  they sank into my mind  but the loss of my mother hit me most and by degrees i was brought to see daylight since then my one desire has been to hand on the true view to others and that is what i was trying to do today though it is only lately that i have preached hereabout  the first months of my ministry have been spent in the north of england among strangers where i preferred to make my earliest clumsy attempts so as to acquire courage before undergoing that severest of all tests of ones sincerity addressing those who have known one and have been ones companions in the days of darkness  if you could only know tess the pleasure of having a good slap at yourself i am sure  dont go on with it she cried passionately as she turned away from him to a stile by the wayside on which she bent herself  i cant believe in such sudden things  i feel indignant with you for talking to me like this when you knowwhen you know what harm youve done me  you and those like you take your fill of pleasure on earth by making the life of such as me bitter and black with sorrow and then it is a fine thing when you have had enough of that to think of securing your pleasure in heaven by becoming converted  out upon suchi dont believe in youi hate it  tess he insisted dont speak so  it came to me like a jolly new idea  and you dont believe me  what dont you believe  your conversion  your scheme of religion  why  she dropped her voice  because a better man than you does not believe in such  what a womans reason  who is this better man  i cannot tell you  well he declared a resentment beneath his words seeming ready to spring out at a moments notice god forbid that i should say i am a good manand you know i dont say any such thing  i am new to goodness truly but newcomers see furthest sometimes  yes she replied sadly  but i cannot believe in your conversion to a new spirit  such flashes as you feel alec i fear dont last  thus speaking she turned from the stile over which she had been leaning and faced him whereupon his eyes falling casually upon the familiar countenance and form remained contemplating her  the inferior man was quiet in him now but it was surely not extracted nor even entirely subdued  dont look at me like that he said abruptly  tess who had been quite unconscious of her action and mien instantly withdrew the large dark gaze of her eyes stammering with a flush i beg your pardon  and there was revived in her the wretched sentiment which had often come to her before that in inhabiting the fleshly tabernacle with which nature had endowed her she was somehow doing wrong  no no  dont beg my pardon  but since you wear a veil to hide your good looks why dont you keep it down  she pulled down the veil saying hastily it was mostly to keep off the wind  it may seem harsh of me to dictate like this he went on but it is better that i should not look too often on you  it might be dangerous  ssh said tess  well womens faces have had too much power over me already for me not to fear them  an evangelist has nothing to do with such as they and it reminds me of the old times that i would forget  after this their conversation dwindled to a casual remark now and then as they rambled onward tess inwardly wondering how far he was going with her and not liking to send him back by positive mandate frequently when they came to a gate or stile they found painted thereon in red or blue letters some text of scripture and she asked him if he knew who had been at the pains to blazon these announcements  he told her that the man was employed by himself and others who were working with him in that district to paint these reminders that no means might be left untried which might move the hearts of a wicked generation  at length the road touched the spot called crossinhand  of all spots on the bleached and desolate upland this was the most forlorn it was so far removed from the charm which is sought in landscape by artists and viewlovers as to reach a new kind of beauty a negative beauty of tragic tone  the place took its name from a stone pillar which stood there a strange rude monolith from a stratum unknown in any local quarry on which was roughly carved a human hand differing accounts were given of its history and purport  some authorities stated that a devotional cross had once formed the complete erection thereon of which the present relic was but the stump others that the stone as it stood was entire and that it had been fixed there to mark a boundary or place of meeting  anyhow whatever the origin of the relic there was and is something sinister or solemn according to mood in the scene amid which it stands something tending to impress the most phlegmatic passerby  i think i must leave you now he remarked as they drew near to this spot  i have to preach at abbotscernel at six this evening and my way lies across to the right from here  and you upset me somewhat too tessyi cannot will not say why  i must go away and get strength   how is it that you speak so fluently now  who has taught you such good english  i have learnt things in my troubles she said evasively  what troubles have you had  she told him of the first onethe only one that related to him  durberville was struck mute  i knew nothing of this till now he next murmured  why didnt you write to me when you felt your trouble coming on  she did not reply and he broke the silence by adding wellyou will see me again  no she answered  do not again come near me  i will think  but before we part come here  he stepped up to the pillar  this was once a holy cross relics are not in my creed but i fear you at momentsfar more than you need fear me at present and to lessen my fear put your hand upon that stone hand and swear that you will never tempt meby your charms or ways  good godhow can you ask what is so unnecessary  all that is furthest from my thought  yesbut swear it  tess half frightened gave way to his importunity placed her hand upon the stone and swore  i am sorry you are not a believer he continued that some unbeliever should have got hold of you and unsettled your mind  but no more now  at home at least i can pray for you and i will and who knows what may not happen  im off goodbye  he turned to a huntinggate in the hedge and without letting his eyes again rest upon her leapt over and struck out across the down in the direction of abbotscernel  as he walked his pace showed perturbation and byandby as if instigated by a former thought he drew from his pocket a small book between the leaves of which was folded a letter worn and soiled as from much rereading durberville opened the letter  it was dated several months before this time and was signed by parson clare  the letter began by expressing the writers unfeigned joy at durbervilles conversion and thanked him for his kindness in communicating with the parson on the subject  it expressed mr clares warm assurance of forgiveness for durbervilles former conduct and his interest in the young mans plans for the future he mr clare would much have liked to see durberville in the church to whose ministry he had devoted so many years of his own life and would have helped him to enter a theological college to that end but since his correspondent had possibly not cared to do this on account of the delay it would have entailed he was not the man to insist upon its paramount importance  every man must work as he could best work and in the method towards which he felt impelled by the spirit  durberville read and reread this letter and seemed to quiz himself cynically  he also read some passages from memoranda as he walked till his face assumed a calm and apparently the image of tess no longer troubled his mind  she meanwhile had kept along the edge of the hill by which lay her nearest way home  within the distance of a mile she met a solitary shepherd  what is the meaning of that old stone i have passed she asked of him  was it ever a holy cross  crossno twer not a cross  tis a thing of illomen miss  it was put up in wuld times by the relations of a malefactor who was tortured there by nailing his hand to a post and afterwards hung the bones lie underneath  they say he sold his soul to the devil and that he walks at times  she felt the petite mort at this unexpectedly gruesome information and left the solitary man behind her  it was dusk when she drew near to flintcombash and in the lane at the entrance to the hamlet she approached a girl and her lover without their observing her  they were talking no secrets and the clear unconcerned voice of the young woman in response to the warmer accents of the man spread into the chilly air as the one soothing thing within the dusky horizon full of a stagnant obscurity upon which nothing else intruded  for a moment the voices cheered the heart of tess till she reasoned that this interview had its origin on one side or the other in the same attraction which had been the prelude to her own tribulation  when she came close the girl turned serenely and recognized her the young man walking off in embarrassment  the woman was izz huett whose interest in tesss excursion immediately superseded her own proceedings  tess did not explain very clearly its results and izz who was a girl of tact began to speak of her own little affair a phase of which tess had just witnessed  he is amby seedling the chap who used to sometimes come and help at talbothays she explained indifferently  he actually inquired and found out that i had come here and has followed me  he says hes been in love wi me these two years  but ive hardly answered him    xlvi   several days had passed since her futile journey and tess was afield  the dry winter wind still blew but a screen of thatched hurdles erected in the eye of the blast kept its force away from her on the sheltered side was a turnipslicing machine whose bright blue hue of new paint seemed almost vocal in the otherwise subdued scene opposite its front was a long mound or grave in which the roots had been preserved since early winter  tess was standing at the uncovered end chopping off with a billhook the fibres and earth from each root and throwing it after the operation into the slicer a man was turning the handle of the machine and from its trough came the newlycut swedes the fresh smell of whose yellow chips was accompanied by the sounds of the snuffling wind the smart swish of the slicingblades and the choppings of the hook in tesss leathergloved hand  the wide acreage of blank agricultural brownness apparent where the swedes had been pulled was beginning to be striped in wales of darker brown gradually broadening to ribands  along the edge of each of these something crept upon ten legs moving without haste and without rest up and down the whole length of the field it was two horses and a man the plough going between them turning up the cleared ground for a spring sowing  for hours nothing relieved the joyless monotony of things then far beyond the ploughingteams a black speck was seen  it had come from the corner of a fence where there was a gap and its tendency was up the incline towards the swedecutters  from the proportions of a mere point it advanced to the shape of a ninepin and was soon perceived to be a man in black arriving from the direction of flintcombash  the man at the slicer having nothing else to do with his eyes continually observed the comer but tess who was occupied did not perceive him till her companion directed her attention to his approach  it was not her hard taskmaster farmer groby it was one in a semiclerical costume who now represented what had once been the freeandeasy alec durberville  not being hot at his preaching there was less enthusiasm about him now and the presence of the grinder seemed to embarrass him  a pale distress was already on tesss face and she pulled her curtained hood further over it  durberville came up and said quietly  i want to speak to you tess  you have refused my last request not to come near me said she  yes but i have a good reason  well tell it  it is more serious than you may think  he glanced round to see if he were overheard  they were at some distance from the man who turned the slicer and the movement of the machine too sufficiently prevented alecs words reaching other ears  durberville placed himself so as to screen tess from the labourer turning his back to the latter  it is this he continued with capricious compunction  in thinking of your soul and mine when we last met i neglected to inquire as to your worldly condition  you were well dressed and i did not think of it  but i see now that it is hardharder than it used to be when iknew youharder than you deserve  perhaps a good deal of it is owning to me  she did not answer and he watched her inquiringly as with bent head her face completely screened by the hood she resumed her trimming of the swedes  by going on with her work she felt better able to keep him outside her emotions  tess he added with a sigh of discontentyours was the very worst case i ever was concerned in  i had no idea of what had resulted till you told me  scamp that i was to foul that innocent life  the whole blame was minethe whole unconventional business of our time at trantridge  you too the real blood of which i am but the base imitation what a blind young thing you were as to possibilities  i say in all earnestness that it is a shame for parents to bring up their girls in such dangerous ignorance of the gins and nets that the wicked may set for them whether their motive be a good one or the result of simple indifference  tess still did no more than listen throwing down one globular root and taking up another with automatic regularity the pensive contour of the mere fieldwoman alone marking her  but it is not that i came to say durberville went on  my circumstances are these  i have lost my mother since you were at trantridge and the place is my own  but i intend to sell it and devote myself to missionary work in africa  a devil of a poor hand i shall make at the trade no doubt  however what i want to ask you is will you put it in my power to do my dutyto make the only reparation i can make for the trick played you that is will you be my wife and go with me   i have already obtained this precious document  it was my old mothers dying wish  he drew a piece of parchment from his pocket with a slight fumbling of embarrassment  what is it said she  a marriage licence  o no sirno she said quickly starting back  you will not  why is that  and as he asked the question a disappointment which was not entirely the disappointment of thwarted duty crossed durbervilles face  it was unmistakably a symptom that something of his old passion for her had been revived duty and desire ran handinhand  surely he began again in more impetuous tones and then looked round at the labourer who turned the slicer  tess too felt that the argument could not be ended there informing the man that a gentleman had come to see her with whom she wished to walk a little way she moved off with durberville across the zebrastriped field  when they reached the first newlyploughed section he held out his hand to help her over it but she stepped forward on the summits of the earthrolls as if she did not see him  you will not marry me tess and make me a selfrespecting man he repeated as soon as they were over the furrows  i cannot  but why  you know i have no affection for you  but you would get to feel that in time perhapsas soon as you really could forgive me  never  why so positive  i love somebody else  the words seemed to astonish him  you do he cried  somebody else  but has not a sense of what is morally right and proper any weight with you  no no nodont say that  anyhow then your love for this other man may be only a passing feeling which you will overcome  nono  yes yes  why not  i cannot tell you  you must in honour  well then  i have married him  ah he exclaimed and he stopped dead and gazed at her  i did not wish to telli did not mean to she pleaded  it is a secret here or at any rate but dimly known  so will you please will you keep from questioning me  you must remember that we are now strangers  strangersare we  strangers  for a moment a flash of his old irony marked his face but he determinedly chastened it down  is that man your husband he asked mechanically denoting by a sign the labourer who turned the machine  that man she said proudly  i should think not  who then  do not ask what i do not wish to tell she begged and flashed her appeal to him from her upturned face and lashshadowed eyes  durberville was disturbed  but i only asked for your sake he retorted hotly  angels of heavengod forgive me for such an expressioni came here i swear as i thought for your good  tessdont look at me soi cannot stand your looks  there never were such eyes surely before christianity or since  therei wont lose my head i dare not i own that the sight of you had waked up my love for you which i believed was extinguished with all such feelings  but i thought that our marriage might be a sanctification for us both  the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband i said to myself  but my plan is dashed from me and i must bear the disappointment  he moodily reflected with his eyes on the ground  married  married   well that being so he added quite calmly tearing the licence slowly into halves and putting them in his pocket that being prevented i should like to do some good to you and your husband whoever he may be  there are many questions that i am tempted to ask but i will not do so of course in opposition to your wishes  though if i could know your husband i might more easily benefit him and you  is he on this farm  no she murmured  he is far away  far away  from you  what sort of husband can he be  o do not speak against him  it was through you  he found out  ah is it so   thats sad tess  yes  but to stay away from youto leave you to work like this  he does not leave me to work she cried springing to the defence of the absent one with all her fervour  he dont know it  it is by my own arrangement  then does he write  ii cannot tell you  there are things which are private to ourselves  of course that means that he does not  you are a deserted wife my fair tess  in an impulse he turned suddenly to take her hand the buffglove was on it and he seized only the rough leather fingers which did not express the life or shape of those within  you must notyou must not she cried fearfully slipping her hand from the glove as from a pocket and leaving it in his grasp  o will you go awayfor the sake of me and my husbandgo in the name of your own christianity  yes yes i will he said abruptly and thrusting the glove back to her he turned to leave  facing round however he said tess as god is my judge i meant no humbug in taking your hand  a pattering of hoofs on the soil of the field which they had not noticed in their preoccupation ceased close behind them and a voice reached her ear  what the devil are you doing away from your work at this time o day  farmer groby had espied the two figures from the distance and had inquisitively ridden across to learn what was their business in his field  dont speak like that to her said durberville his face blackening with something that was not christianity  indeed mister  and what mid methodist pasons have to do with she  who is the fellow asked durberville turning to tess  she went close up to him  goi do beg you she said  what  and leave you to that tyrant  i can see in his face what a churl he is  he wont hurt me  hes not in love with me  i can leave at ladyday  well i have no right but to obey i suppose  butwell goodbye  her defender whom she dreaded more than her assailant having reluctantly disappeared the farmer continued his reprimand which tess took with the greatest coolness that sort of attack being independent of sex  to have as a master this man of stone who would have cuffed her if he had dared was almost a relief after her former experiences  she silently walked back towards the summit of the field that was the scene of her labour so absorbed in the interview which had just taken place that she was hardly aware that the nose of grobys horse almost touched her shoulders  if so be you make an agreement to work for me till ladyday ill see that you carry it out he growled  od rot the womennow tis one thing and then tis another  but ill put up with it no longer  knowing very well that he did not harass the other women of the farm as he harassed her out of spite for the flooring he had once received she did for one moment picture what might have been the result if she had been free to accept the offer just made her of being the monied alecs wife  it would have lifted her completely out of subjection not only to her present oppressive employer but to a whole world who seemed to despise her  but no no she said breathlessly i could not have married him now  he is so unpleasant to me  that very night she began an appealing letter to clare concealing from him her hardships and assuring him of her undying affection any one who had been in a position to read between the lines would have seen that at the back of her great love was some monstrous fearalmost a desperationas to some secret contingencies which were not disclosed  but again she did not finish her effusion he had asked izz to go with him and perhaps he did not care for her at all  she put the letter in her box and wondered if it would ever reach angels hands  after this her daily tasks were gone through heavily enough and brought on the day which was of great import to agriculturiststhe day of the candlemas fair  it was at this fair that new engagements were entered into for the twelve months following the ensuing ladyday and those of the farming population who thought of changing their places duly attended at the countytown where the fair was held  nearly all the labourers on flintcombash farm intended flight and early in the morning there was a general exodus in the direction of the town which lay at a distance of from ten to a dozen miles over hilly country  though tess also meant to leave at the quarterday she was one of the few who did not go to the fair having a vaguelyshaped hope that something would happen to render another outdoor engagement unnecessary  it was a peaceful february day of wonderful softness for the time and one would almost have thought that winter was over  she had hardly finished her dinner when durbervilles figure darkened the window of the cottage wherein she was a lodger which she had all to herself today  tess jumped up but her visitor had knocked at the door and she could hardly in reason run away  durbervilles knock his walk up to the door had some indescribable quality of difference from his air when she last saw him  they seemed to be acts of which the doer was ashamed  she thought that she would not open the door but as there was no sense in that either she arose and having lifted the latch stepped back quickly  he came in saw her and flung himself down into a chair before speaking  tessi couldnt help it he began desperately as he wiped his heated face which had also a superimposed flush of excitement  i felt that i must call at least to ask how you are  i assure you i had not been thinking of you at all till i saw you that sunday now i cannot get rid of your image try how i may  it is hard that a good woman should do harm to a bad man yet so it is  if you would only pray for me tess  the suppressed discontent of his manner was almost pitiable and yet tess did not pity him  how can i pray for you she said when i am forbidden to believe that the great power who moves the world would alter his plans on my account  you really think that  yes  i have been cured of the presumption of thinking otherwise  cured  by whom  by my husband if i must tell  ahyour husbandyour husband  how strange it seems  i remember you hinted something of the sort the other day  what do you really believe in these matters tess he asked  you seem to have no religionperhaps owing to me  but i have  though i dont believe in anything supernatural  durberville looked at her with misgiving  then do you think that the line i take is all wrong  a good deal of it  hmand yet ive felt so sure about it he said uneasily  i believe in the spirit of the sermon on the mount and so did my dear husband  but i dont believe  here she gave her negations  the fact is said durberville drily whatever your dear husband believed you accept and whatever he rejected you reject without the least inquiry or reasoning on your own part  thats just like you women  your mind is enslaved to his  ah because he knew everything said she with a triumphant simplicity of faith in angel clare that the most perfect man could hardly have deserved much less her husband  yes but you should not take negative opinions wholesale from another person like that  a pretty fellow he must be to teach you such scepticism  he never forced my judgement  he would never argue on the subject with me  but i looked at it in this way what he believed after inquiring deep into doctrines was much more likely to be right than what i might believe who hadnt looked into doctrines at all  what used he to say  he must have said something  she reflected and with her acute memory for the letter of angel clares remarks even when she did not comprehend their spirit she recalled a merciless polemical syllogism that she had heard him use when as it occasionally happened he indulged in a species of thinking aloud with her at his side  in delivering it she gave also clares accent and manner with reverential faithfulness  say that again asked durberville who had listened with the greatest attention  she repeated the argument and durberville thoughtfully murmured the words after her  anything else he presently asked  he said at another time something like this and she gave another which might possibly have been paralleled in many a work of the pedigree ranging from the dictionnaire philosophique to huxleys essays  ahha  how do you remember them  i wanted to believe what he believed though he didnt wish me to and i managed to coax him to tell me a few of his thoughts  i cant say i quite understand that one but i know it is right  hm  fancy your being able to teach me what you dont know yourself  he fell into thought  and so i threw in my spiritual lot with his she resumed  i didnt wish it to be different  whats good enough for him is good enough for me  does he know that you are as big an infidel as he  noi never told himif i am an infidel  wellyou are better off today that i am tess after all  you dont believe that you ought to preach my doctrine and therefore do no despite to your conscience in abstaining  i do believe i ought to preach it but like the devils i believe and tremble for i suddenly leave off preaching it and give way to my passion for you  how  why he said aridly i have come all the way here to see you today  but i started from home to go to casterbridge fair where i have undertaken to preach the word from a waggon at halfpast two this afternoon and where all the brethren are expecting me this minute  heres the announcement  he drew from his breastpocket a poster whereon was printed the day hour and place of meeting at which he durberville would preach the gospel as aforesaid  but how can you get there said tess looking at the clock  i cannot get there  i have come here  what you have really arranged to preach and  i have arranged to preach and i shall not be thereby reason of my burning desire to see a woman whom i once despisedno by my word and truth i never despised you if i had i should not love you now why i did not despise you was on account of your being unsmirched in spite of all you withdrew yourself from me so quickly and resolutely when you saw the situation you did not remain at my pleasure so there was one petticoat in the world for whom i had no contempt and you are she  but you may well despise me now  i thought i worshipped on the mountains but i find i still serve in the groves ha ha  o alec durberville what does this mean  what have i done  done he said with a soulless sneer in the word  nothing intentionally  but you have been the meansthe innocent meansof my backsliding as they call it  i ask myself am i indeed one of those servants of corruption who after they have escaped the pollutions of the world are again entangled therein and overcome whose latter end is worse than their beginning  he laid his hand on her shoulder  tess my girl i was on the way to at least social salvation till i saw you again he said freakishly shaking her as if she were a child  and why then have you tempted me  i was firm as a man could be till i saw those eyes and that mouth againsurely there never was such a maddening mouth since eves  his voice sank and a hot archness shot from his own black eyes  you temptress tess you dear damned witch of babyloni could not resist you as soon as i met you again  i couldnt help your seeing me again said tess recoiling  i know iti repeat that i do not blame you  but the fact remains when i saw you illused on the farm that day i was nearly mad to think that i had no legal right to protect youthat i could not have it whilst he who has it seems to neglect you utterly  dont speak against himhe is absent she cried in much excitement  treat him honourablyhe has never wronged you  o leave his wife before any scandal spreads that may do harm to his honest name  i willi will he said like a man awakening from a luring dream i have broken my engagement to preach to those poor drunken boobies at the fairit is the first time i have played such a practical joke  a month ago i should have been horrified at such a possibility  ill go awayto swearandah can i to keep away then suddenly one clasp tessyone  only for old friendship  i am without defence alec  a good mans honour is in my keeping thinkbe ashamed  pooh  well yesyes  he clenched his lips mortified with himself for his weakness  his eyes were equally barren of worldly and religious faith  the corpses of those old fitful passions which had lain inanimate amid the lines of his face ever since his reformation seemed to wake and come together as in a resurrection  he went out indeterminately  though durberville had declared that this breach of his engagement today was the simple backsliding of a believer tesss words as echoed from angel clare had made a deep impression upon him and continued to do so after he had left her  he moved on in silence as if his energies were benumbed by the hitherto undreamtof possibility that his position was untenable  reason had had nothing to do with his whimsical conversion which was perhaps the mere freak of a careless man in search of a new sensation and temporarily impressed by his mothers death  the drops of logic tess had let fall into the sea of his enthusiasm served to chill its effervescence to stagnation  he said to himself as he pondered again and again over the crystallized phrases that she had handed on to him that clever fellow little thought that by telling her those things he might be paving my way back to her    xlvii   it is the threshing of the last wheatrick at flintcombash farm the dawn of the march morning is singularly inexpressive and there is nothing to show where the eastern horizon lies  against the twilight rises the trapezoidal top of the stack which has stood forlornly here through the washing and bleaching of the wintry weather  when izz huett and tess arrived at the scene of operations only a rustling denoted that others had preceded them to which as the light increased there were presently added the silhouettes of two men on the summit  they were busily unhaling the rick that is stripping off the thatch before beginning to throw down the sheaves and while this was in progress izz and tess with the other womenworkers in their whiteybrown pinners stood waiting and shivering farmer groby having insisted upon their being on the spot thus early to get the job over if possible by the end of the day  close under the eaves of the stack and as yet barely visible was the red tyrant that the women had come to servea timberframed construction with straps and wheels appertaining the threshingmachine which whilst it was going kept up a despotic demand upon the endurance of their muscles and nerves  a little way off there was another indistinct figure this one black with a sustained hiss that spoke of strength very much in reserve the long chimney running up beside an ashtree and the warmth which radiated from the spot explained without the necessity of much daylight that here was the engine which was to act as the primum mobile of this little world  by the engine stood a dark motionless being a sooty and grimy embodiment of tallness in a sort of trance with a heap of coals by his side it was the engineman  the isolation of his manner and colour lent him the appearance of a creature from tophet who had strayed into the pellucid smokelessness of this region of yellow grain and pale soil with which he had nothing in common to amaze and to discompose its aborigines  what he looked he felt  he was in the agricultural world but not of it  he served fire and smoke these denizens of the fields served vegetation weather frost and sun  he travelled with his engine from farm to farm from county to county for as yet the steam threshingmachine was itinerant in this part of wessex  he spoke in a strange northern accent his thoughts being turned inwards upon himself his eye on his iron charge hardly perceiving the scenes around him and caring for them not at all holding only strictly necessary intercourse with the natives as if some ancient doom compelled him to wander here against his will in the service of his plutonic master  the long strap which ran from the drivingwheel of his engine to the red thresher under the rick was the sole tieline between agriculture and him  while they uncovered the sheaves he stood apathetic beside his portable repository of force round whose hot blackness the morning air quivered  he had nothing to do with preparatory labour  his fire was waiting incandescent his steam was at high pressure in a few seconds he could make the long strap move at an invisible velocity  beyond its extent the environment might be corn straw or chaos it was all the same to him  if any of the autochthonous idlers asked him what he called himself he replied shortly an engineer  the rick was unhaled by full daylight the men then took their places the women mounted and the work began  farmer grobyor as they called him hehad arrived ere this and by his orders tess was placed on the platform of the machine close to the man who fed it her business being to untie every sheaf of corn handed on to her by izz huett who stood next but on the rick so that the feeder could seize it and spread it over the revolving drum which whisked out every grain in one moment  they were soon in full progress after a preparatory hitch or two which rejoiced the hearts of those who hated machinery  the work sped on till breakfast time when the thresher was stopped for half an hour and on starting again after the meal the whole supplementary strength of the farm was thrown into the labour of constructing the strawrick which began to grow beside the stack of corn  a hasty lunch was eaten as they stood without leaving their positions and then another couple of hours brought them near to dinnertime the inexorable wheel continuing to spin and the penetrating hum of the thresher to thrill to the very marrow all who were near the revolving wirecage  the old men on the rising strawrick talked of the past days when they had been accustomed to thresh with flails on the oaken barnfloor when everything even to winnowing was effected by handlabour which to their thinking though slow produced better results  those too on the cornrick talked a little but the perspiring ones at the machine including tess could not lighten their duties by the exchange of many words  it was the ceaselessness of the work which tried her so severely and began to make her wish that she had never some to flintcombash  the women on the cornrickmarian who was one of them in particularcould stop to drink ale or cold tea from the flagon now and then or to exchange a few gossiping remarks while they wiped their faces or cleared the fragments of straw and husk from their clothing but for tess there was no respite for as the drum never stopped the man who fed it could not stop and she who had to supply the man with untied sheaves could not stop either unless marian changed places with her which she sometimes did for half an hour in spite of grobys objections that she was too slowhanded for a feeder  for some probably economical reason it was usually a woman who was chosen for this particular duty and groby gave as his motive in selecting tess that she was one of those who best combined strength with quickness in untying and both with staying power and this may have been true  the hum of the thresher which prevented speech increased to a raving whenever the supply of corn fell short of the regular quantity  as tess and the man who fed could never turn their heads she did not know that just before the dinnerhour a person had come silently into the field by the gate and had been standing under a second rick watching the scene and tess in particular  he was dressed in a tweed suit of fashionable pattern and he twirled a gay walkingcane  who is that said izz huett to marian  she had at first addressed the inquiry to tess but the latter could not hear it  somebodys fancyman i spose said marian laconically  ill lay a guinea hes after tess  o no  tis a ranter pason whos been sniffing after her lately not a dandy like this  wellthis is the same man  the same man as the preacher  but hes quite different  he hev left off his black coat and white neckercher and hev cut off his whiskers but hes the same man for all that  dye really think so  then ill tell her said marian  dont  shell see him soon enough goodnow  well i dont think it at all right for him to join his preaching to courting a married woman even though her husband mid be abroad and she in a sense a widow  ohhe can do her no harm said izz drily  her mind can no more be heaved from that one place where it do bide than a stooded waggon from the hole hes in  lord love ee neither courtpaying nor preaching nor the seven thunders themselves can wean a woman when twould be better for her that she should be weaned  dinnertime came and the whirling ceased whereupon tess left her post her knees trembling so wretchedly with the shaking of the machine that she could scarcely walk  you ought to het a quart o drink into ee as ive done said marian  you wouldnt look so white then  why souls above us your face is as if youd been hagrode  it occurred to the goodnatured marian that as tess was so tired her discovery of her visitors presence might have the bad effect of taking away her appetite and marian was thinking of inducing tess to descend by a ladder on the further side of the stack when the gentleman came forward and looked up  tess uttered a short little oh  and a moment after she said quickly i shall eat my dinner hereright on the rick  sometimes when they were so far from their cottages they all did this but as there was rather a keen wind going today marian and the rest descended and sat under the strawstack  the newcomer was indeed alec durberville the late evangelist despite his changed attire and aspect  it was obvious at a glance that the original weltlust had come back that he had restored himself as nearly as a man could do who had grown three or four years older to the old jaunty slapdash guise under which tess had first known her admirer and cousin socalled  having decided to remain where she was tess sat down among the bundles out of sight of the ground and began her meal till byandby she heard footsteps on the ladder and immediately after alec appeared upon the stacknow an oblong and level platform of sheaves  he strode across them and sat down opposite of her without a word  tess continued to eat her modest dinner a slice of thick pancake which she had brought with her  the other workfolk were by this time all gathered under the rick where the loose straw formed a comfortable retreat  i am here again as you see said durberville  why do you trouble me so she cried reproach flashing from her very fingerends  i trouble you  i think i may ask why do you trouble me  sure i dont trouble you anywhen  you say you dont  but you do  you haunt me  those very eyes that you turned upon my with such a bitter flash a moment ago they come to me just as you showed them then in the night and in the day tess ever since you told me of that child of ours it is just as if my feelings which have been flowing in a strong puritanical stream had suddenly found a way open in the direction of you and had all at once gushed through  the religious channel is left dry forthwith and it is you who have done it  she gazed in silence  whatyou have given up your preaching entirely she asked  she had gathered from angel sufficient of the incredulity of modern thought to despise flash enthusiasm but as a woman she was somewhat appalled  in affected severity durberville continued  entirely  i have broken every engagement since that afternoon i was to address the drunkards at casterbridge fair  the deuce only knows what i am thought of by the brethren  ahha  the brethren  no doubt they pray for meweep for me for they are kind people in their way  but what do i care  how could i go on with the thing when i had lost my faith in itit would have been hypocrisy of the basest kind  among them i should have stood like hymenaeus and alexander who were delivered over to satan that they might learn not to blaspheme  what a grand revenge you have taken  i saw you innocent and i deceived you  four years after you find me a christian enthusiast you then work upon me perhaps to my complete perdition  but tess my coz as i used to call you this is only my way of talking and you must not look so horribly concerned of course you have done nothing except retain your pretty face and shapely figure  i saw it on the rick before you saw methat tight pinaforething sets it off and that wingbonnetyou fieldgirls should never wear those bonnets if you wish to keep out of danger he regarded her silently for a few moments and with a short cynical laugh resumed i believe that if the bachelorapostle whose deputy i thought i was had been tempted by such a pretty face he would have let go the plough for her sake as i do  tess attempted to expostulate but at this juncture all her fluency failed her and without heeding he added  well this paradise that you supply is perhaps as good as any other after all  but to speak seriously tess  durberville rose and came nearer reclining sideways amid the sheaves and resting upon his elbow  since i last saw you i have been thinking of what you said that he said  i have come to the conclusion that there does seem rather a want of commonsense in these threadbare old propositions how i could have been so fired by poor parson clares enthusiasm and have gone so madly to work transcending even him i cannot make out  as for what you said last time on the strength of your wonderful husbands intelligencewhose name you have never told meabout having what they call an ethical system without any dogma i dont see my way to that at all  why you can have the religion of lovingkindness and purity at least if you cant havewhat do you call itdogma  o no  im a different sort of fellow from that  if theres nobody to say do this and it will be a good thing for you after you are dead do that and if will be a bad thing for you i cant warm up hang it i am not going to feel responsible for my deeds and passions if theres nobody to be responsible to and if i were you my dear i wouldnt either  she tried to argue and tell him that he had mixed in his dull brain two matters theology and morals which in the primitive days of mankind had been quite distinct  but owing to angel clares reticence to her absolute want of training and to her being a vessel of emotions rather than reasons she could not get on  well never mind he resumed  here i am my love as in the old times  not as thennever as thentis different she entreated  and there was never warmth with me  o why didnt you keep your faith if the loss of it has brought you to speak to me like this  because youve knocked it out of me so the evil be upon your sweet head  your husband little thought how his teaching would recoil upon him  hahaim awfully glad you have made an apostate of me all the same  tess i am more taken with you than ever and i pity you too for all your closeness i see you are in a bad wayneglected by one who ought to cherish you  she could not get her morsels of food down her throat her lips were dry and she was ready to choke  the voices and laughs of the workfolk eating and drinking under the rick came to her as if they were a quarter of a mile off  it is cruelty to me she said  howhow can you treat me to this talk if you care ever so little for me  true true he said wincing a little  i did not come to reproach you for my deeds  i came tess to say that i dont like you to be working like this and i have come on purpose for you  you say you have a husband who is not i  well perhaps you have but ive never seen him and youve not told me his name and altogether he seems rather a mythological personage  however even if you have one i think i am nearer to you than he is  i at any rate try to help you out of trouble but he does not bless his invisible face  the words of the stern prophet hosea that i used to read come back to me dont you know them tessand she shall follow after her lover but she shall not overtake him and she shall seek him but shall not find him then shall she say i will go and return to my first husband for then was it better with me than now   tess my trap is waiting just under the hill anddarling mine not hisyou know the rest  her face had been rising to a dull crimson fire while he spoke but she did not answer  you have been the cause of my backsliding he continued stretching his arm towards her waist you should be willing to share it and leave that mule you call husband for ever  one of her leather gloves which she had taken off to eat her skimmercake lay in her lap and without the slightest warning she passionately swung the glove by the gauntlet directly in his face it was heavy and thick as a warriors and it struck him flat on the mouth  fancy might have regarded the act as the recrudescence of a trick in which her armed progenitors were not unpractised  alec fiercely started up from his reclining position  a scarlet oozing appeared where her blow had alighted and in a moment the blood began dropping from his mouth upon the straw  but he soon controlled himself calmly drew his handkerchief from his pocket and mopped his bleeding lips  she too had sprung up but she sank down again now punish me she said turning up her eyes to him with the hopeless defiance of the sparrows gaze before its captor twists its neck  whip me crush me you need not mind those people under the rick  i shall not cry out  once victim always victimthats the law  o no no tess he said blandly  i can make full allowance for this  yet you most unjustly forget one thing that i would have married you if you had not put it out of my power to do so  did i not ask you flatly to be my wifehey  answer me  you did  and you cannot be  but remember one thing  his voice hardened as his temper got the better of him with the recollection of his sincerity in asking her and her present ingratitude and he stepped across to her side and held her by the shoulders so that she shook under his grasp  remember my lady i was your master once  i will be your master again  if you are any mans wife you are mine  the threshers now began to stir below  so much for our quarrel he said letting her go  now i shall leave you and shall come again for your answer during the afternoon you dont know me yet  but i know you  she had not spoken again remaining as if stunned  durberville retreated over the sheaves and descended the ladder while the workers below rose and stretched their arms and shook down the beer they had drunk  then the threshingmachine started afresh and amid the renewed rustle of the straw tess resumed her position by the buzzing drum as one in a dream untying sheaf after sheaf in endless succession    xlviii   in the afternoon the farmer made it known that the rick was to be finished that night since there was a moon by which they could see to work and the man with the engine was engaged for another farm on the morrow  hence the twanging and humming and rustling proceeded with even less intermission than usual  it was not till nammettime about three oclock that tess raised her eyes and gave a momentary glance round  she felt but little surprise at seeing that alec durberville had come back and was standing under the hedge by the gate  he had seen her lift her eyes and waved his hand urbanely to her while he blew her a kiss it meant that their quarrel was over  tess looked down again and carefully abstained from gazing in that direction  thus the afternoon dragged on  the wheatrick shrank lower and the strawrick grew higher and the cornsacks were carted away  at six oclock the wheatrick was about shoulderhigh from the ground  but the unthreshed sheaves remaining untouched seemed countless still notwithstanding the enormous numbers that had been gulped down by the insatiable swallower fed by the man and tess through whose two young hands the greater part of them had passed  and the immense stack of straw where in the morning there had been nothing appeared as the faeces of the same buzzing red glutton  from the west sky a wrathful shineall that wild march could afford in the way of sunsethad burst forth after the cloudy day flooding the tired and sticky faces of the threshers and dyeing them with a coppery light as also the flapping garments of the women which clung to them like dull flames  a panting ache ran through the rick  the man who fed was weary and tess could see that the red nape of his neck was encrusted with dirt and husks  she still stood at her post her flushed and perspiring face coated with the corndust and her white bonnet embrowned by it she was the only woman whose place was upon the machine so as to be shaken bodily by its spinning and the decrease of the stack now separated her from marian and izz and prevented their changing duties with her as they had done  the incessant quivering in which every fibre of her frame participated had thrown her into a stupefied reverie in which her arms worked on independently of her consciousness  she hardly knew where she was and did not hear izz huett tell her from below that her hair was tumbling down  by degrees the freshest among them began to grow cadaverous and saucereyed  whenever tess lifted her head she beheld always the great upgrown strawstack with the men in shirtsleeves upon it against the gray north sky in front of it the long red elevator like a jacobs ladder on which a perpetual stream of threshed straw ascended a yellow river running uphill and spouting out on the top of the rick  she knew that alec durberville was still on the scene observing her from some point or other though she could not say where  there was an excuse for his remaining for when the threshed rick drew near its final sheaves a little ratting was always done and men unconnected with the threshing sometimes dropped in for that performancesporting characters of all descriptions gents with terriers and facetious pipes roughs with sticks and stones  but there was another hours work before the layer of live rats at the base of the stack would be reached and as the evening light in the direction of the giants hill by abbotscernel dissolved away the whitefaced moon of the season arose from the horizon that lay towards middleton abbey and shottsford on the other side  for the last hour or two marian had felt uneasy about tess whom she could not get near enough to speak to the other women having kept up their strength by drinking ale and tess having done without it through traditionary dread owing to its results at her home in childhood but tess still kept going if she could not fill her part she would have to leave and this contingency which she would have regarded with equanimity and even with relief a month or two earlier had become a terror since durberville had begun to hover round her  the sheafpitchers and feeders had now worked the rick so low that people on the ground could talk to them  to tesss surprise farmer groby came up on the machine to her and said that if she desired to join her friend he did not wish her to keep on any longer and would send somebody else to take her place  the friend was durberville she knew and also that this concession had been granted in obedience to the request of that friend or enemy  she shook her head and toiled on  the time for the ratcatching arrived at last and the hunt began the creatures had crept downwards with the subsidence of the rick till they were all together at the bottom and being now uncovered from their last refuge they ran across the open ground in all directions a loud shriek from the bythistime halftipsy marian informing her companions that one of the rats had invaded her persona terror which the rest of the women had guarded against by various schemes of skirttucking and selfelevation  the rat was at last dislodged and amid the barking of dogs masculine shouts feminine screams oaths stampings and confusion as of pandemonium tess untied her last sheaf the drum slowed the whizzing ceased and she stepped from the machine to the ground  her lover who had only looked on at the ratcatching was promptly at her side  whatafter allmy insulting slap too said she in an underbreath  she was so utterly exhausted that she had not strength to speak louder  i should indeed be foolish to feel offended at anything you say or do he answered in the seductive voice of the trantridge time how the little limbs tremble  you are as weak as a bled calf you know you are and yet you need have done nothing since i arrived how could you be so obstinate  however i have told the farmer that he has no right to employ women at steamthreshing  it is not proper work for them and on all the better class of farms it has been given up as he knows very well  i will walk with you as far as your home  o yes she answered with a jaded gait  walk wi me if you will i do bear in mind that you came to marry me before you knew o my state  perhapsperhaps you are a little better and kinder than i have been thinking you were  whatever is meant as kindness i am grateful for whatever is meant in any other way i am angered at i cannot sense your meaning sometimes  if i cannot legitimize our former relations at least i can assist you  and i will do it with much more regard for your feelings than i formerly showed  my religious mania or whatever it was is over but i retain a little good nature i hope i do  now tess by all thats tender and strong between man and woman trust me  i have enough and more than enough to put you out of anxiety both for yourself and your parents and sisters  i can make them all comfortable if you will only show confidence in me  have you seen em lately she quickly inquired  yes  they didnt know where you were  it was only by chance that i found you here  the cold moon looked aslant upon tesss fagged face between the twigs of the gardenhedge as she paused outside the cottage which was her temporary home durberville pausing beside her  dont mention my little brothers and sistersdont make me break down quite she said  if you want to help themgod knows they need itdo it without telling me  but no no she cried  i will take nothing from you either for them or for me  he did not accompany her further since as she lived with the household all was public indoors  no sooner had she herself entered laved herself in a washingtub and shared supper with the family than she fell into thought and withdrawing to the table under the wall by the light of her own little lamp wrote in a passionate mood      my own husband     let me call you soi musteven if it makes you angry to    think of such an unworthy wife as i  i must cry to you    in my troublei have no one else  i am so exposed to    temptation angel  i fear to say who it is and i do not    like to write about it at all  but i cling to you in a way    you cannot think  can you not come to me now at once    before anything terrible happens  o i know you cannot    because you are so far away  i think i must die if you do    not come soon or tell me to come to you  the punishment    you have measured out to me is deservedi do know that    well deservedand you are right and just to be angry with    me  but angel please please not to be justonly a    little kind to me even if i do not deserve it and come to    me  if you would come i could die in your arms  i would    be well content to do that if so be you had forgiven me     angel i live entirely for you  i love you too much to    blame you for going away and i know it was necessary you    should find a farm  do not think i shall say a word of    sting or bitterness  only come back to me  i am desolate    without you my darling o so desolate i do not mind    having to work but if you will send me one little line    and say i am coming soon i will bide on angelo so    cheerfully     it has been so much my religion ever since we were married    to be faithful to you in every thought and look that even    when a man speaks a compliment to me before i am aware it    seems wronging you  have you never felt one little bit of    what you used to feel when we were at the dairy  if you    have how can you keep away from me  i am the same women    angel as you fell in love with yes the very samenot    the one you disliked but never saw  what was the past to me    as soon as i met you  it was a dead thing altogether  i    became another woman filled full of new life from you  how    could i be the early one  why do you not see this  dear    if you would only be a little more conceited and believe    in yourself so far as to see that you were strong enough to    work this change in me you would perhaps be in a mind to    come to me your poor wife     how silly i was in my happiness when i thought i could trust    you always to love me  i ought to have known that such as    that was not for poor me  but i am sick at heart not only    for old times but for the present  thinkthink how it do    hurt my heart not to see you everever  ah if i could    only make your dear heart ache one little minute of each day    as mine does every day and all day long it might lead you    to show pity to your poor lonely one     people still say that i am rather pretty angel handsome is    the word they use since i wish to be truthful  perhaps i    am what they say  but i do not value my good looks i only    like to have them because they belong to you my dear and    that there may be at least one thing about me worth your    having  so much have i felt this that when i met with    annoyance on account of the same i tied up my face in a    bandage as long as people would believe in it  o angel i    tell you all this not from vanityyou will certainly know    i do notbut only that you may come to me     if you really cannot come to me will you let me come to    you  i am as i say worried pressed to do what i will    not do  it cannot be that i shall yield one inch yet i am    in terror as to what an accident might lead to and i so    defenceless on account of my first error i cannot say more    about thisit makes me too miserable  but if i break down    by falling into some fearful snare my last state will be    worse than my first  o god i cannot think of it  let me    come at once or at once come to me     i would be content ay glad to live with you as your    servant if i may not as your wife so that i could only be    near you and get glimpses of you and think of you as mine     the daylight has nothing to show me since you are not here    and i dont like to see the rooks and starlings in the    field because i grieve and grieve to miss you who used to    see them with me  i long for only one thing in heaven or    earth or under the earth to meet you my own dear  come    to mecome to me and save me from what threatens me     your faithful heartbroken     tess    xlix   the appeal duly found its way to the breakfasttable of the quiet vicarage to the westward in that valley where the air is so soft and the soil so rich that the effort of growth requires but superficial aid by comparison with the tillage at flintcombash and where to tess the human world seemed so different though it was much the same  it was purely for security that she had been requested by angel to send her communications through his father whom he kept pretty well informed of his changing addresses in the country he had gone to exploit for himself with a heavy heart  now said old mr clare to his wife when he had read the envelope if angel proposes leaving rio for a visit home at the end of next month as he told us that he hoped to do i think this may hasten his plans for i believe it to be from his wife  he breathed deeply at the thought of her and the letter was redirected to be promptly sent on to angel  dear fellow i hope he will get home safely murmured mrs clare to my dying day i shall feel that he has been illused  you should have sent him to cambridge in spite of his want of faith and given him the same chance as the other boys had  he would have grown out of it under proper influence and perhaps would have taken orders after all  church or no church it would have been fairer to him  this was the only wail with which mrs clare ever disturbed her husbands peace in respect to their sons  and she did not vent this often for she was as considerate as she was devout and knew that his mind too was troubled by doubts as to his justice in this matter only too often had she heard him lying awake at night stifling sighs for angel with prayers  but the uncompromising evangelical did not even now hold that he would have been justified in giving his son an unbeliever the same academic advantages that he had given to the two others when it was possible if not probable that those very advantages might have been used to decry the doctrines which he had made it his lifes mission and desire to propagate and the mission of his ordained sons likewise  to put with one hand a pedestal under the feet of the two faithful ones and with the other to exalt the unfaithful by the same artificial means he deemed to be alike inconsistent with his convictions his position and his hopes nevertheless he loved his misnamed angel and in secret mourned over this treatment of him as abraham might have mourned over the doomed isaac while they went up the hill together  his silent selfgenerated regrets were far bitterer than the reproaches which his wife rendered audible  they blamed themselves for this unlucky marriage  if angel had never been destined for a farmer he would never have been thrown with agricultural girls  they did not distinctly know what had separated him and his wife nor the date on which the separation had taken place  at first they had supposed it must be something of the nature of a serious aversion  but in his later letters he occasionally alluded to the intention of coming home to fetch her from which expressions they hoped the division might not owe its origin to anything so hopelessly permanent as that  he had told them that she was with her relatives and in their doubts they had decided not to intrude into a situation which they knew no way of bettering  the eyes for which tesss letter was intended were gazing at this time on a limitless expanse of country from the back of a mule which was bearing him from the interior of the southamerican continent towards the coast  his experiences of this strange land had been sad  the severe illness from which he had suffered shortly after his arrival had never wholly left him and he had by degrees almost decided to relinquish his hope of farming here though as long as the bare possibility existed of his remaining he kept this change of view a secret from his parents  the crowds of agricultural labourers who had come out to the country in his wake dazzled by representations of easy independence had suffered died and wasted away  he would see mothers from english farms trudging along with their infants in their arms when the child would be stricken with fever and would die the mother would pause to dig a hole in the loose earth with her bare hands would bury the babe therein with the same natural gravetools shed one tear and again trudge on  angels original intention had not been emigration to brazil but a northern or eastern farm in his own country  he had come to this place in a fit of desperation the brazil movement among the english agriculturists having by chance coincided with his desire to escape from his past existence  during this time of absence he had mentally aged a dozen years what arrested him now as of value in life was less its beauty than its pathos  having long discredited the old systems of mysticism he now began to discredit the old appraisements of morality  he thought they wanted readjusting  who was the moral man  still more pertinently who was the moral woman  the beauty or ugliness of a character lay not only in its achievements but in its aims and impulses its true history lay not among things done but among things willed  how then about tess  viewing her in these lights a regret for his hasty judgement began to oppress him  did he reject her eternally or did he not  he could no longer say that he would always reject her and not to say that was in spirit to accept her now  this growing fondness for her memory coincided in point of time with her residence at flintcombash but it was before she had felt herself at liberty to trouble him with a word about her circumstances or her feelings  he was greatly perplexed and in his perplexity as to her motives in withholding intelligence he did not inquire  thus her silence of docility was misinterpreted  how much it really said if he had understoodthat she adhered with literal exactness to orders which he had given and forgotten that despite her natural fearlessness she asserted no rights admitted his judgement to be in every respect the true one and bent her head dumbly thereto  in the beforementioned journey by mules through the interior of the country another man rode beside him angels companion was also an englishman bent on the same errand though he came from another part of the island  they were both in a state of mental depression and they spoke of home affairs  confidence begat confidence  with that curious tendency evinced by men more especially when in distant lands to entrust to strangers details of their lives which they would on no account mention to friends angel admitted to this man as they rode along the sorrowful facts of his marriage  the stranger had sojourned in many more lands and among many more peoples than angel to his cosmopolitan mind such deviations from the social norm so immense to domesticity were no more than are the irregularities of vale and mountainchain to the whole terrestrial curve  he viewed the matter in quite a different light from angel thought that what tess had been was of no importance beside what she would be and plainly told clare that he was wrong in coming away from her  the next day they were drenched in a thunderstorm angels companion was struck down with fever and died by the weeks end  clare waited a few hours to bury him and then went on his way  the cursory remarks of the largeminded stranger of whom he knew absolutely nothing beyond a commonplace name were sublimed by his death and influenced clare more than all the reasoned ethics of the philosophers  his own parochialism made him ashamed by its contrast his inconsistencies rushed upon him in a flood  he had persistently elevated hellenic paganism at the expense of christianity yet in that civilization an illegal surrender was not certain disesteem surely then he might have regarded that abhorrence of the unintact state which he had inherited with the creed of mysticism as at least open to correction when the result was due to treachery  a remorse struck into him  the words of izz huett never quite stilled in his memory came back to him  he had asked izz if she loved him and she had replied in the affirmative  did she love him more than tess did  no she had replied tess would lay down her life for him and she herself could do no more  he thought of tess as she had appeared on the day of the wedding how her eyes had lingered upon him how she had hung upon his words as if they were a gods  and during the terrible evening over the hearth when her simple soul uncovered itself to his how pitiful her face had looked by the rays of the fire in her inability to realize that his love and protection could possibly be withdrawn  thus from being her critic he grew to be her advocate  cynical things he had uttered to himself about her but no man can be always a cynic and live and he withdrew them  the mistake of expressing them had arisen from his allowing himself to be influenced by general principles to the disregard of the particular instance  but the reasoning is somewhat musty lovers and husbands have gone over the ground before today  clare had been harsh towards her there is no doubt of it  men are too often harsh with women they love or have loved women with men  and yet these harshnesses are tenderness itself when compared with the universal harshness out of which they grow the harshness of the position towards the temperament of the means towards the aims of today towards yesterday of hereafter towards today  the historic interest of her familythat masterful line of durbervilleswhom he had despised as a spent force touched his sentiments now  why had he not known the difference between the political value and the imaginative value of these things  in the latter aspect her durberville descent was a fact of great dimensions worthless to economics it was a most useful ingredient to the dreamer to the moralizer on declines and falls  it was a fact that would soon be forgottenthat bit of distinction in poor tesss blood and name and oblivion would fall upon her hereditary link with the marble monuments and leaded skeletons at kingsbere  so does time ruthlessly destroy his own romances  in recalling her face again and again he thought now that he could see therein a flash of the dignity which must have graced her granddames and the vision sent that aura through his veins which he had formerly felt and which left behind it a sense of sickness  despite her notinviolate past what still abode in such a woman as tess outvalued the freshness of her fellows  was not the gleaning of the grapes of ephraim better than the vintage of abiezer  so spoke love renascent preparing the way for tesss devoted outpouring which was then just being forwarded to him by his father though owing to his distance inland it was to be a long time in reaching him  meanwhile the writers expectation that angel would come in response to the entreaty was alternately great and small  what lessened it was that the facts of her life which had led to the parting had not changedcould never change and that if her presence had not attenuated them her absence could not  nevertheless she addressed her mind to the tender question of what she could do to please him best if he should arrive  sighs were expended on the wish that she had taken more notice of the tunes he played on his harp that she had inquired more curiously of him which were his favourite ballads among those the countrygirls sang  she indirectly inquired of amby seedling who had followed izz from talbothays and by chance amby remembered that amongst the snatches of melody in which they had indulged at the dairymans to induce the cows to let down their milk clare had seemed to like cupids gardens i have parks i have hounds and the break o the day and had seemed not to care for the tailors breeches and such a beauty i did grow excellent ditties as they were  to perfect the ballads was now her whimsical desire she practised them privately at odd moments especially the break o the day      arise arise arise    and pick your love a posy    all o the sweetest flowers    that in the garden grow    the turtle doves and sma birds    in every bough abuilding    so early in the maytime    at the break o the day   it would have melted the heart of a stone to hear her singing these ditties whenever she worked apart from the rest of the girls in this cold dry time the tears running down her cheeks all the while at the thought that perhaps he would not after all come to hear her and the simple silly words of the songs resounding in painful mockery of the aching heart of the singer  tess was so wrapt up in this fanciful dream that she seemed not to know how the season was advancing that the days had lengthened that ladyday was at hand and would soon be followed by old ladyday the end of her term here  but before the quarterday had quite come something happened which made tess think of far different matters  she was at her lodging as usual one evening sitting in the downstairs room with the rest of the family when somebody knocked at the door and inquired for tess through the doorway she saw against the declining light a figure with the height of a woman and the breadth of a child a tall thin girlish creature whom she did not recognize in the twilight till the girl said tess  whatis it lizalu asked tess in startled accents  her sister whom a little over a year ago she had left at home as a child had sprung up by a sudden shoot to a form of this presentation of which as yet lu seemed herself scarce able to understand the meaning her thin legs visible below her oncelong frock now short by her growing and her uncomfortable hands and arms revealed her youth and inexperience  yes i have been traipsing about all day tess said lu with unemotional gravity atrying to find ee and im very tired  what is the matter at home  mother is took very bad and the doctor says shes dying and as father is not very well neither and says tis wrong for a man of such a high family as his to slave and drave at common labouring work we dont know what to do  tess stood in reverie a long time before she thought of asking lizalu to come in and sit down  when she had done so and lizalu was having some tea she came to a decision  it was imperative that she should go home  her agreement did not end till old ladyday the sixth of april but as the interval thereto was not a long one she resolved to run the risk of starting at once  to go that night would be a gain of twelvehours but her sister was too tired to undertake such a distance till the morrow  tess ran down to where marian and izz lived informed them of what had happened and begged them to make the best of her case to the farmer returning she got lu a supper and after that having tucked the younger into her own bed packed up as many of her belongings as would go into a withy basket and started directing lu to follow her next morning    l   she plunged into the chilly equinoctial darkness as the clock struck ten for her fifteen miles walk under the steely stars  in lonely districts night is a protection rather than a danger to a noiseless pedestrian and knowing this tess pursued the nearest course along bylanes that she would almost have feared in the daytime but marauders were wanting now and spectral fears were driven out of her mind by thoughts of her mother  thus she proceeded mile after mile ascending and descending till she came to bulbarrow and about midnight looked from that height into the abyss of chaotic shade which was all that revealed itself of the vale on whose further side she was born  having already traversed about five miles on the upland she had now some ten or eleven in the lowland before her journey would be finished  the winding road downwards became just visible to her under the wan starlight as she followed it and soon she paced a soil so contrasting with that above it that the difference was perceptible to the tread and to the smell  it was the heavy clay land of blackmoor vale and a part of the vale to which turnpikeroads had never penetrated  superstitions linger longest on these heavy soils  having once been forest at this shadowy time it seemed to assert something of its old character the far and the near being blended and every tree and tall hedge making the most of its presence  the harts that had been hunted here the witches that had been pricked and ducked the greenspangled fairies that whickered at you as you passedthe place teemed with beliefs in them still and they formed an impish multitude now  at nuttlebury she passed the village inn whose sign creaked in response to the greeting of her footsteps which not a human soul heard but herself  under the thatched roofs her minds eye beheld relaxed tendons and flaccid muscles spread out in the darkness beneath coverlets made of little purple patchwork squares and undergoing a bracing process at the hands of sleep for renewed labour on the morrow as soon as a hint of pink nebulosity appeared on hambledon hill  at three she turned the last corner of the maze of lanes she had threaded and entered marlott passing the field in which as a clubgirl she had first seen angel clare when he had not danced with her the sense of disappointment remained with her yet  in the direction of her mothers house she saw a light  it came from the bedroom window and a branch waved in front of it and made it wink at her  as soon as she could discern the outline of the housenewly thatched with her moneyit had all its old effect upon tesss imagination  part of her body and life it ever seemed to be the slope of its dormers the finish of its gables the broken courses of brick which topped the chimney all had something in common with her personal character  a stupefaction had come into these features to her regard it meant the illness of her mother  she opened the door so softly as to disturb nobody the lower room was vacant but the neighbour who was sitting up with her mother came to the top of the stairs and whispered that mrs durbeyfield was no better though she was sleeping just then  tess prepared herself a breakfast and then took her place as nurse in her mothers chamber  in the morning when she contemplated the children they had all a curiously elongated look although she had been away little more than a year their growth was astounding and the necessity of applying herself heart and soul to their needs took her out of her own cares  her fathers illhealth was the same indefinite kind and he sat in his chair as usual  but the day after her arrival he was unusually bright  he had a rational scheme for living and tess asked him what it was  im thinking of sending round to all the old antiqueerians in this part of england he said asking them to subscribe to a fund to maintain me  im sure theyd see it as a romantical artistical and proper thing to do  they spend lots o money in keeping up old ruins and finding the bones o things and such like and living remains must be more interesting to em still if they only knowed of me  would that somebody would go round and tell em what there is living among em and they thinking nothing of him  if pason tringham who discovered me had lived hed ha done it im sure  tess postponed her arguments on this high project till she had grappled with pressing matters in hand which seemed little improved by her remittances  when indoor necessities had been eased she turned her attention to external things  it was now the season for planting and sowing many gardens and allotments of the villagers had already received their spring tillage but the garden and the allotment of the durbeyfields were behindhand  she found to her dismay that this was owing to their having eaten all the seed potatoesthat last lapse of the improvident  at the earliest moment she obtained what others she could procure and in a few days her father was well enough to see to the garden under tesss persuasive efforts while she herself undertook the allotmentplot which they rented in a field a couple of hundred yards out of the village  she liked doing it after the confinement of the sick chamber where she was not now required by reason of her mothers improvement violent motion relieved thought  the plot of ground was in a high dry open enclosure where there were forty or fifty such pieces and where labour was at its briskest when the hired labour of the day had ended  digging began usually at six oclock and extended indefinitely into the dusk or moonlight  just now heaps of dead weeds and refuse were burning on many of the plots the dry weather favouring their combustion  one fine day tess and lizalu worked on here with their neighbours till the last rays of the sun smote flat upon the white pegs that divided the plots  as soon as twilight succeeded to sunset the flare of the couchgrass and cabbagestalk fires began to light up the allotments fitfully their outlines appearing and disappearing under the dense smoke as wafted by the wind  when a fire glowed banks of smoke blown level along the ground would themselves become illuminated to an opaque lustre screening the workpeople from one another and the meaning of the pillar of a cloud which was a wall by day and a light by night could be understood  as evening thickened some of the gardening men and women gave over for the night but the greater number remained to get their planting done tess being among them though she sent her sister home  it was on one of the couchburning plots that she laboured with her fork its four shining prongs resounding against the stones and dry clods in little clicks  sometimes she was completely involved in the smoke of her fire then it would leave her figure free irradiated by the brassy glare from the heap  she was oddly dressed tonight and presented a somewhat staring aspect her attire being a gown bleached by many washings with a short black jacket over it the effect of the whole being that of a wedding and funeral guest in one  the women further back wore white aprons which with their pale faces were all that could be seen of them in the gloom except when at moments they caught a flash from the flames  westward the wiry boughs of the bare thorn hedge which formed the boundary of the field rose against the pale opalescence of the lower sky  above jupiter hung like a fullblown jonquil so bright as almost to throw a shade  a few small nondescript stars were appearing elsewhere  in the distance a dog barked and wheels occasionally rattled along the dry road  still the prongs continued to click assiduously for it was not late and though the air was fresh and keen there was a whisper of spring in it that cheered the workers on  something in the place the hours the crackling fires the fantastic mysteries of light and shade made others as well as tess enjoy being there nightfall which in the frost of winter comes as a fiend and in the warmth of summer as a lover came as a tranquillizer on this march day  nobody looked at his or her companions  the eyes of all were on the soil as its turned surface was revealed by the fires  hence as tess stirred the clods and sang her foolish little songs with scarce now a hope that clare would ever hear them she did not for a long time notice the person who worked nearest to hera man in a long smockfrock who she found was forking the same plot as herself and whom she supposed her father had sent there to advance the work she became more conscious of him when the direction of his digging brought him closer  sometimes the smoke divided them then it swerved and the two were visible to each other but divided from all the rest  tess did not speak to her fellowworker nor did he speak to her nor did she think of him further than to recollect that he had not been there when it was broad daylight and that she did not know him as any one of the marlott labourers which was no wonder her absences having been so long and frequent of late years  byandby he dug so close to her that the firebeams were reflected as distinctly from the steel prongs of his fork as from her own  on going up to the fire to throw a pitch of dead weeds upon it she found that he did the same on the other side the fire flared up and she beheld the face of durberville  the unexpectedness of his presence the grotesqueness of his appearance in a gathered smockfrock such as was now worn only by the most oldfashioned of the labourers had a ghastly comicality that chilled her as to its bearing  durberville emitted a low long laugh  if i were inclined to joke i should say how much this seems like paradise he remarked whimsically looking at her with an inclined head  what do you say she weakly asked  a jester might say this is just like paradise  you are eve and i am the old other one come to tempt you in the disguise of an inferior animal  i used to be quite up in that scene of miltons when i was theological  some of it goes      empress the way is ready and not long    beyond a row of myrtles     if thou accept    my conduct i can bring thee thither soon    lead then said eve   and so on  my dear tess i am only putting this to you as a thing that you might have supposed or said quite untruly because you think so badly of me  i never said you were satan or thought it  i dont think of you in that way at all  my thoughts of you are quite cold except when you affront me  what did you come digging here entirely because of me  entirely  to see you nothing more  the smockfrock which i saw hanging for sale as i came along was an afterthought that i mightnt be noticed  i come to protest against your working like this  but i like doing itit is for my father  your engagement at the other place is ended  yes  where are you going to next  to join your dear husband  she could not bear the humiliating reminder  oi dont know she said bitterly  i have no husband  it is quite truein the sense you mean  but you have a friend and i have determined that you shall be comfortable in spite of yourself when you get down to your house you will see what i have sent there for you  o alec i wish you wouldnt give me anything at all  i cannot take it from you  i dont likeit is not right  it is right he cried lightly  i am not going to see a woman whom i feel so tenderly for as i do for you in trouble without trying to help her  but i am very well off  i am only in trouble aboutaboutnot about living at all  she turned and desperately resumed her digging tears dripping upon the forkhandle and upon the clods  about the childrenyour brothers and sisters he resumed ive been thinking of them  tesss heart quiveredhe was touching her in a weak place  he had divined her chief anxiety  since returning home her soul had gone out to those children with an affection that was passionate  if your mother does not recover somebody ought to do something for them since your father will not be able to do much i suppose  he can with my assistance  he must  and with mine  no sir  how damned foolish this is burst out durberville  why he thinks we are the same family and will be quite satisfied  he dont  ive undeceived him  the more fool you  durberville in anger retreated from her to the hedge where he pulled off the long smockfrock which had disguised him and rolling it up and pushing it into the couchfire went away  tess could not get on with her digging after this she felt restless she wondered if he had gone back to her fathers house and taking the fork in her hand proceeded homewards  some twenty yards from the house she was met by one of her sisters  o tessywhat do you think  lizalu is acrying and theres a lot of folk in the house and mother is a good deal better but they think father is dead  the child realized the grandeur of the news but not as yet its sadness and stood looking at tess with roundeyed importance till beholding the effect produced upon her she said  what tess shant we talk to father never no more  but father was only a little bit ill exclaimed tess distractedly  lizalu came up  he dropped down just now and the doctor who was there for mother said there was no chance for him because his heart was growed in  yes the durbeyfield couple had changed places the dying one was out of danger and the indisposed one was dead  the news meant even more than it sounded  her fathers life had a value apart from his personal achievements or perhaps it would not have had much it was the last of the three lives for whose duration the house and premises were held under a lease and it had long been coveted by the tenantfarmer for his regular labourers who were stinted in cottage accommodation  moreover liviers were disapproved of in villages almost as much as little freeholders because of their independence of manner and when a lease determined it was never renewed  thus the durbeyfields once durbervilles saw descending upon them the destiny which no doubt when they were among the olympians of the county they had caused to descend many a time and severely enough upon the heads of such landless ones as they themselves were now  so do flux and refluxthe rhythm of changealternate and persist in everything under the sky    li   at length it was the eve of old ladyday and the agricultural world was in a fever of mobility such as only occurs at that particular date of the year  it is a day of fulfilment agreements for outdoor service during the ensuing year entered into at candlemas are to be now carried out  the labourersor workfolk as they used to call themselves immemorially till the other word was introduced from withoutwho wish to remain no longer in old places are removing to the new farms  these annual migrations from farm to farm were on the increase here when tesss mother was a child the majority of the fieldfolk about marlott had remained all their lives on one farm which had been the home also of their fathers and grandfathers but latterly the desire for yearly removal had risen to a high pitch  with the younger families it was a pleasant excitement which might possibly be an advantage  the egypt of one family was the land of promise to the family who saw it from a distance till by residence there it became it turn their egypt also and so they changed and changed  however all the mutations so increasingly discernible in village life did not originate entirely in the agricultural unrest  a depopulation was also going on  the village had formerly contained side by side with the argicultural labourers an interesting and betterinformed class ranking distinctly above the formerthe class to which tesss father and mother had belongedand including the carpenter the smith the shoemaker the huckster together with nondescript workers other than farmlabourers a set of people who owed a certain stability of aim and conduct to the fact of their being lifeholders like tesss father or copyholders or occasionally small freeholders  but as the long holdings fell in they were seldom again let to similar tenants and were mostly pulled down if not absolutely required by the farmer for his hands cottagers who were not directly employed on the land were looked upon with disfavour and the banishment of some starved the trade of others who were thus obliged to follow  these families who had formed the backbone of the village life in the past who were the depositaries of the village traditions had to seek refuge in the large centres the process humorously designated by statisticians as the tendency of the rural population towards the large towns being really the tendency of water to flow uphill when forced by machinery  the cottage accommodation at marlott having been in this manner considerably curtailed by demolitions every house which remained standing was required by the agriculturist for his workpeople  ever since the occurrence of the event which had cast such a shadow over tesss life the durbeyfield family whose descent was not credited had been tacitly looked on as one which would have to go when their lease ended if only in the interests of morality  it was indeed quite true that the household had not been shining examples either of temperance soberness or chastity  the father and even the mother had got drunk at times the younger children seldom had gone to church and the eldest daughter had made queer unions  by some means the village had to be kept pure  so on this the first ladyday on which the durbeyfields were expellable the house being roomy was required for a carter with a large family and widow joan her daughters tess and lizalu the boy abraham and the younger children had to go elsewhere  on the evening preceding their removal it was getting dark betimes by reason of a drizzling rain which blurred the sky  as it was the last night they would spend in the village which had been their home and birthplace mrs durbeyfield lizalu and abraham had gone out to bid some friends goodbye and tess was keeping house till they should return  she was kneeling in the windowbench her face close to the casement where an outer pane of rainwater was sliding down the inner pane of glass  her eyes rested on the web of a spider probably starved long ago which had been mistakenly placed in a corner where no flies ever came and shivered in the slight draught through the casement tess was reflecting on the position of the household in which she perceived her own evil influence  had she not come home her mother and the children might probably have been allowed to stay on as weekly tenants  but she had been observed almost immediately on her return by some people of scrupulous character and great influence they had seen her idling in the churchyard restoring as well as she could with a little trowel a babys obliterated grave  by this means they had found that she was living here again her mother was scolded for harbouring her sharp retorts had ensued from joan who had independently offered to leave at once she had been taken at her word and here was the result  i ought never to have come home said tess to herself bitterly  she was so intent upon these thoughts that she hardly at first took note of a man in a white mackintosh whom she saw riding down the street  possibly it was owing to her face being near to the pane that he saw her so quickly and directed his horse so close to the cottagefront that his hoofs were almost upon the narrow border for plants growing under the wall  it was not till he touched the window with his ridingcrop that she observed him  the rain had nearly ceased and she opened the casement in obedience to his gesture  didnt you see me asked durberville  i was not attending she said  i heard you i believe though i fancied it was a carriage and horses i was in a sort of dream  ah you heard the durberville coach perhaps  you know the legend i suppose  no  mysomebody was going to tell it me once but didnt  if you are a genuine durberville i ought not to tell you either i suppose  as for me im a sham one so it doesnt matter  it is rather dismal  it is that this sound of a nonexistent coach can only be heard by one of durberville blood and it is held to be of illomen to the one who hears it  it has to do with a murder committed by one of the family centuries ago  now you have begun it finish it  very well  one of the family is said to have abducted some beautiful woman who tried to escape from the coach in which he was carrying her off and in the struggle he killed heror she killed himi forget which  such is one version of the tale  i see that your tubs and buckets are packed  going away arent you  yes tomorrowold lady day  i heard you were but could hardly believe it it seems so sudden why is it  fathers was the last life on the property and when that dropped we had no further right to stay  though we might perhaps have stayed as weekly tenantsif it had not been for me  what about you  i am not aproper woman  durbervilles face flushed  what a blasted shame  miserable snobs  may their dirty souls be burnt to cinders he exclaimed in tones of ironic resentment thats why you are going is it  turned out  we are not turned out exactly but as they said we should have to go soon it was best to go now everybody was moving because there are better chances  where are you going to  kingsbere  we have taken rooms there  mother is so foolish about fathers people that she will go there  but your mothers family are not fit for lodgings and in a little hole of a town like that  now why not come to my gardenhouse at trantridge  there are hardly any poultry now since my mothers death but theres the house as you know it and the garden  it can be whitewashed in a day and your mother can live there quite comfortably and i will put the children to a good school  really i ought to do something for you  but we have already taken the rooms at kingsbere she declared and we can wait there  waitwhat for  for that nice husband no doubt  now look here tess i know what men are and bearing in mind the grounds of your separation i am quite positive he will never make it up with you  now though i have been your enemy i am your friend even if you wont believe it  come to this cottage of mine well get up a regular colony of fowls and your mother can attend to them excellently and the children can go to school  tess breathed more and more quickly and at length she said  how do i know that you would do all this  your views may changeand thenwe should bemy mother would behomeless again  o nono  i would guarantee you against such as that in writing if necessary  think it over  tess shook her head  but durberville persisted she had seldom seen him so determined he would not take a negative  please just tell your mother he said in emphatic tones  it is her business to judgenot yours  i shall get the house swept out and whitened tomorrow morning and fires lit and it will be dry by the evening so that you can come straight there  now mind i shall expect you  tess again shook her head her throat swelling with complicated emotion  she could not look up at durberville  i owe you something for the past you know he resumed  and you cured me too of that craze so i am glad  i would rather you had kept the craze so that you had kept the practice which went with it  i am glad of this opportunity of repaying you a little  tomorrow i shall expect to hear your mothers goods unloading  give me your hand on it nowdear beautiful tess  with the last sentence he had dropped his voice to a murmur and put his hand in at the halfopen casement  with stormy eyes she pulled the staybar quickly and in doing so caught his arm between the casement and the stone mullion  damnationyou are very cruel he said snatching out his arm no noi know you didnt do it on purpose  well i shall expect you or your mother and children at least  i shall not comei have plenty of money she cried  where  at my fatherinlaws if i ask for it  if you ask for it  but you wont tess i know you youll never ask for ityoull starve first  with these words he rode off  just at the corner of the street he met the man with the paintpot who asked him if he had deserted the brethren  you go to the devil said durberville  tess remained where she was a long while till a sudden rebellious sense of injustice caused the region of her eyes to swell with the rush of hot tears thither  her husband angel clare himself had like others dealt out hard measure to her surely he had  she had never before admitted such a thought but he had surely  never in her lifeshe could swear it from the bottom of her soulhad she ever intended to do wrong yet these hard judgements had come  whatever her sins they were not sins of intention but of inadvertence and why should she have been punished so persistently  she passionately seized the first piece of paper that came to hand and scribbled the following lines      o why have you treated me so monstrously angel i do    not deserve it  i have thought it all over carefully    and i can never never forgive you  you know that i    did not intend to wrong youwhy have you so wronged    me  you are cruel cruel indeed  i will try to forget    you  it is all injustice i have received at your    hands                                   t  she watched till the postman passed by ran out to him with her epistle and then again took her listless place inside the windowpanes  it was just as well to write like that as to write tenderly  how could he give way to entreaty  the facts had not changed there was no new event to alter his opinion  it grew darker the firelight shining over the room  the two biggest of the younger children had gone out with their mother the four smallest their ages ranging from threeandahalf years to eleven all in black frocks were gathered round the hearth babbling their own little subjects  tess at length joined them without lighting a candle  this is the last night that we shall sleep here dears in the house where we were born she said quickly  we ought to think of it oughtnt we  they all became silent with the impressibility of their age they were ready to burst into tears at the picture of finality she had conjured up though all the day hitherto they had been rejoicing in the idea of a new place  tess changed the subject  sing to me dears she said  what shall we sing  anything you know i dont mind  there was a momentary pause it was broken first in one little tentative note then a second voice strengthened it and a third and a fourth chimed in unison with words they had learnt at the sundayschool        here we suffer grief and pain      here we meet to part again        in heaven we part no more   the four sang on with the phlegmatic passivity of persons who had long ago settled the question and there being no mistake about it felt that further thought was not required  with features strained hard to enunciate the syllables they continued to regard the centre of the flickering fire the notes of the youngest straying over into the pauses of the rest  tess turned from them and went to the window again  darkness had now fallen without but she put her face to the pane as though to peer into the gloom  it was really to hide her tears  if she could only believe what the children were singing if she were only sure how different all would now be how confidently she would leave them to providence and their future kingdom  but in default of that it behoved her to do something to be their providence for to tess as to not a few millions of others there was ghastly satire in the poets lines                         not in utter nakedness      but trailing clouds of glory do we come   to her and her like birth itself was an ordeal of degrading personal compulsion whose gratuitousness nothing in the result seemed to justify and at best could only palliate  in the shades of the wet road she soon discerned her mother with tall lizalu and abraham  mrs durbeyfields pattens clicked up to the door and tess opened it  i see the tracks of a horse outside the window said joan  hev somebody called  no said tess  the children by the fire looked gravely at her and one murmured  why tess the gentleman ahorseback  he didnt call said tess  he spoke to me in passing  who was the gentleman asked the mother  your husband  no  hell never never come answered tess in stony hopelessness  then who was it  oh you neednt ask  youve seen him before and so have i  ah  what did he say said joan curiously  i will tell you when we are settled in our lodging at kingsbere tomorrowevery word  it was not her husband she had said  yet a consciousness that in a physical sense this man alone was her husband seemed to weigh on her more and more    lii   during the small hours of the next morning while it was still dark dwellers near the highways were conscious of a disturbance of their nights rest by rumbling noises intermittently continuing till daylightnoises as certain to recur in this particular first week of the month as the voice of the cuckoo in the third week of the same they were the preliminaries of the general removal the passing of the empty waggons and teams to fetch the goods of the migrating families for it was always by the vehicle of the farmer who required his services that the hired man was conveyed to his destination that this might be accomplished within the day was the explanation of the reverberation occurring so soon after midnight the aim of the carters being to reach the door of the outgoing households by six oclock when the loading of their movables at once began  but to tess and her mothers household no such anxious farmer sent his team  they were only women they were not regular labourers they were not particularly required anywhere hence they had to hire a waggon at their own expense and got nothing sent gratuitously  it was a relief to tess when she looked out of the window that morning to find that though the weather was windy and louring it did not rain and that the waggon had come  a wet ladyday was a spectre which removing families never forgot damp furniture damp bedding damp clothing accompanied it and left a train of ills  her mother lizalu and abraham were also awake but the younger children were let sleep on  the four breakfasted by the thin light and the houseridding was taken in hand  it proceeded with some cheerfulness a friendly neighbour or two assisting  when the large articles of furniture had been packed in position a circular nest was made of the beds and bedding in which joan durbeyfield and the young children were to sit through the journey  after loading there was a long delay before the horses were brought these having been unharnessed during the ridding but at length about two oclock the whole was under way the cookingpot swinging from the axle of the waggon mrs durbeyfield and family at the top the matron having in her lap to prevent injury to its works the head of the clock which at any exceptional lurch of the waggon struck one or oneandahalf in hurt tones  tess and the next eldest girl walked alongside till they were out of the village  they had called on a few neighbours that morning and the previous evening and some came to see them off all wishing them well though in their secret hearts hardly expecting welfare possible to such a family harmless as the durbeyfields were to all except themselves  soon the equipage began to ascend to higher ground and the wind grew keener with the change of level and soil  the day being the sixth of april the durbeyfield waggon met many other waggons with families on the summit of the load which was built on a wellnigh unvarying principle as peculiar probably to the rural labourer as the hexagon to the bee  the groundwork of the arrangement was the family dresser which with its shining handles and fingermarks and domestic evidences thick upon it stood importantly in front over the tails of the shafthorses in its erect and natural position like some ark of the covenant that they were bound to carry reverently  some of the households were lively some mournful some were stopping at the doors of wayside inns where in due time the durbeyfield menagerie also drew up to bait horses and refresh the travellers  during the halt tesss eyes fell upon a threepint blue mug which was ascending and descending through the air to and from the feminine section of a household sitting on the summit of a load that had also drawn up at a little distance from the same inn  she followed one of the mugs journeys upward and perceived it to be clasped by hands whose owner she well knew  tess went towards the waggon  marian and izz she cried to the girls for it was they sitting with the moving family at whose house they had lodged  are you houseridding today like everybody else  they were they said  it had been too rough a life for them at flintcombash and they had come away almost without notice leaving groby to prosecute them if he chose  they told tess their destination and tess told them hers  marian leant over the load and lowered her voice  do you know that the gentleman who follows eeyoull guess who i meancame to ask for ee at flintcomb after you had gone  we didnt telln where you was knowing you wouldnt wish to see him  ahbut i did see him tess murmured  he found me  and do he know where you be going  i think so  husband come back  no  she bade her acquaintance goodbyefor the respective carters had now come out from the innand the two waggons resumed their journey in opposite directions the vehicle whereon sat marian izz and the ploughmans family with whom they had thrown in their lot being brightly painted and drawn by three powerful horses with shining brass ornaments on their harness while the waggon on which mrs durbeyfield and her family rode was a creaking erection that would scarcely bear the weight of the superincumbent load one which had known no paint since it was made and drawn by two horses only the contrast well marked the difference between being fetched by a thriving farmer and conveying oneself whither no hirer waited ones coming  the distance was greattoo great for a days journeyand it was with the utmost difficulty that the horses performed it  though they had started so early it was quite late in the afternoon when they turned the flank of an eminence which formed part of the upland called greenhill  while the horses stood to stale and breathe themselves tess looked around  under the hill and just ahead of them was the halfdead townlet of their pilgrimage kingsbere where lay those ancestors of whom her father had spoken and sung to painfulness kingsbere the spot of all spots in the world which could be considered the durbervilles home since they had resided there for full five hundred years  a man could be seen advancing from the outskirts towards them and when he beheld the nature of their waggonload he quickened his steps  you be the woman they call mrs durbeyfield i reckon he said to tesss mother who had descended to walk the remainder of the way  she nodded  though widow of the late sir john durberville poor nobleman if i cared for my rights and returning to the domain of his forefathers  oh  well i know nothing about that but if you be mrs durbeyfield i am sent to tell ee that the rooms you wanted be let  we didnt know that you was coming till we got your letter this morningwhen twas too late  but no doubt you can get other lodgings somewhere  the man had noticed the face of tess which had become ashpale at his intelligence  her mother looked hopelessly at fault  what shall we do now tess she said bitterly  heres a welcome to your ancestors lands  however lets try further  they moved on into the town and tried with all their might tess remaining with the waggon to take care of the children whilst her mother and lizalu made inquiries  at the last return of joan to the vehicle an hour later when her search for accommodation had still been fruitless the driver of the waggon said the goods must be unloaded as the horses were halfdead and he was bound to return part of the way at least that night  very wellunload it here said joan recklessly  ill get shelter somewhere  the waggon had drawn up under the churchyard wall in a spot screened from view and the driver nothing loth soon hauled down the poor heap of household goods  this done she paid him reducing herself to almost her last shilling thereby and he moved off and left them only too glad to get out of further dealings with such a family  it was a dry night and he guessed that they would come to no harm  tess gazed desperately at the pile of furniture  the cold sunlight of this spring evening peered invidiously upon the crocks and kettles upon the bunches of dried herbs shivering in the breeze upon the brass handles of the dresser upon the wickercradle they had all been rocked in and upon the wellrubbed clockcase all of which gave out the reproachful gleam of indoor articles abandoned to the vicissitudes of a roofless exposure for which they were never made  round about were deparked hills and slopesnow cut up into little paddocksand the green foundations that showed where the durberville mansion once had stood also an outlying stretch of egdon heath that had always belonged to the estate  hard by the aisle of the church called the durberville aisle looked on imperturbably  isnt your family vault your own freehold said tesss mother as she returned from a reconnoitre of the church and graveyard  why of course tis and thats where we will camp girls till the place of your ancestors finds us a roof  now tess and liza and abraham you help me  well make a nest for these children and then well have another look round  tess listlessly lent a hand and in a quarter of an hour the old fourpost bedstead was dissociated from the heap of goods and erected under the south wall of the church the part of the building known as the durberville aisle beneath which the huge vaults lay over the tester of the bedstead was a beautiful traceried window of many lights its date being the fifteenth century  it was called the durberville window and in the upper part could be discerned heraldic emblems like those on durbeyfields old seal and spoon  joan drew the curtains round the bed so as to make an excellent tent of it and put the smaller children inside  if it comes to the worst we can sleep there too for one night she said  but let us try further on and get something for the dears to eat  o tess whats the use of your playing at marrying gentlemen if it leaves us like this  accompanied by lizalu and the boy she again ascended the little lane which secluded the church from the townlet  as soon as they got into the street they beheld a man on horseback gazing up and down ahim looking for you he said riding up to them  this is indeed a family gathering on the historic spot  it was alec durberville  where is tess he asked  personally joan had no liking for alec  she cursorily signified the direction of the church and went on durberville saying that he would see them again in case they should be still unsuccessful in their search for shelter of which he had just heard  when they had gone durberville rode to the inn and shortly after came out on foot  in the interim tess left with the children inside the bedstead remained talking with them awhile till seeing that no more could be done to make them comfortable just then she walked about the churchyard now beginning to be embrowned by the shades of nightfall the door of the church was unfastened and she entered it for the first time in her life  within the window under which the bedstead stood were the tombs of the family covering in their dates several centuries  they were canopied altarshaped and plain their carvings being defaced and broken their brasses torn from the matrices the rivetholes remaining like martinholes in a sandcliff  of all the reminders that she had ever received that her people were socially extinct there was none so forcible as this spoliation  she drew near to a dark stone on which was inscribed      ostium sepulchri antiquae familiae durberville   tess did not read churchlatin like a cardinal but she knew that this was the door of her ancestral sepulchre and that the tall knights of whom her father had chanted in his cups lay inside  she musingly turned to withdraw passing near an altartomb the oldest of them all on which was a recumbent figure  in the dusk she had not noticed it before and would hardly have noticed it now but for an odd fancy that the effigy moved  as soon as she drew close to it she discovered all in a moment that the figure was a living person and the shock to her sense of not having been alone was so violent that she was quite overcome and sank down nigh to fainting not however till she had recognized alec durberville in the form  he leapt off the slab and supported her  i saw you come in he said smiling and got up there not to interrupt your meditations  a family gathering is it not with these old fellows under us here  listen  he stamped with his heel heavily on the floor whereupon there arose a hollow echo from below  that shook them a bit ill warrant he continued  and you thought i was the mere stone reproduction of one of them  but no the old order changeth  the little finger of the sham durberville can do more for you than the whole dynasty of the real underneath now command me  what shall i do  go away she murmured  i willill look for your mother said he blandly  but in passing her he whispered mind this youll be civil yet  when he was gone she bent down upon the entrance to the vaults and said  why am i on the wrong side of this door   in the meantime marian and izz huett had journeyed onward with the chattels of the ploughman in the direction of their land of canaan the egypt of some other family who had left it only that morning but the girls did not for a long time think of where they were going their talk was of angel clare and tess and tesss persistent lover whose connection with her previous history they had partly heard and partly guessed ere this  tisnt as though she had never known him afore said marian  his having won her once makes all the difference in the world  twould be a thousand pities if he were to tole her away again  mr clare can never be anything to us izz and why should we grudge him to her and not try to mend this quarrel  if he could ony know what straits shes put to and whats hovering round he might come to take care of his own  could we let him know  they thought of this all the way to their destination but the bustle of reestablishment in their new place took up all their attention then  but when they were settled a month later they heard of clares approaching return though they had learnt nothing more of tess  upon that agitated anew by their attachment to him yet honourably disposed to her marian uncorked the penny inkbottle they shared and a few lines were concocted between the two girls      honourd sir     look to your wife if you do love her as much as she do    love you  for she is sore put to by an enemy in the shape    of a friend  sir there is one near her who ought to be    away  a woman should not be tryd beyond her strength    and continual dropping will wear away a stoneay    morea diamond     from two wellwishers   this was addressed to angel clare at the only place they had ever heard him to be connected with emminster vicarage after which they continued in a mood of emotional exaltation at their own generosity which made them sing in hysterical snatches and weep at the same time   end of phase the sixth      phase the seventh fulfilment    liii   it was evening at emminster vicarage  the two customary candles were burning under their green shades in the vicars study but he had not been sitting there  occasionally he came in stirred the small fire which sufficed for the increasing mildness of the spring and went out again sometimes pausing at the front door going on to the drawingroom then returning again to the front door  it faced westward and though gloom prevailed inside there was still light enough without to see with distinctness  mrs clare who had been sitting in the drawingroom followed him hither  plenty of time yet said the vicar  he doesnt reach chalknewton till six even if the train should be punctual and ten miles of countryroad five of them in crimmercrock lane are not jogged over in a hurry by our old horse  but he has done it in an hour with us my dear  years ago  thus they passed the minutes each well knowing that this was only waste of breath the one essential being simply to wait  at length there was a slight noise in the lane and the old ponychaise appeared indeed outside the railings  they saw alight therefrom a form which they affected to recognize but would actually have passed by in the street without identifying had he not got out of their carriage at the particular moment when a particular person was due  mrs clare rushed through the dark passage to the door and her husband came more slowly after her  the new arrival who was just about to enter saw their anxious faces in the doorway and the gleam of the west in their spectacles because they confronted the last rays of day but they could only see his shape against the light  o my boy my boyhome again at last cried mrs clare who cared no more at that moment for the stains of heterodoxy which had caused all this separation than for the dust upon his clothes  what woman indeed among the most faithful adherents of the truth believes the promises and threats of the word in the sense in which she believes in her own children or would not throw her theology to the wind if weighed against their happiness  as soon as they reached the room where the candles were lighted she looked at his face  o it is not angelnot my sonthe angel who went away she cried in all the irony of sorrow as she turned herself aside  his father too was shocked to see him so reduced was that figure from its former contours by worry and the bad season that clare had experienced in the climate to which he had so rashly hurried in his first aversion to the mockery of events at home  you could see the skeleton behind the man and almost the ghost behind the skeleton he matched crivellis dead christus  his sunken eyepits were of morbid hue and the light in his eyes had waned  the angular hollows and lines of his aged ancestors had succeeded to their reign in his face twenty years before their time  i was ill over there you know he said  i am all right now  as if however to falsify this assertion his legs seemed to give way and he suddenly sat down to save himself from falling  it was only a slight attack of faintness resulting from the tedious days journey and the excitement of arrival  has any letter come for me lately he asked  i received the last you sent on by the merest chance and after considerable delay through being inland or i might have come sooner  it was from your wife we supposed  it was  only one other had recently come  they had not sent it on to him knowing he would start for home so soon  he hastily opened the letter produced and was much disturbed to read in tesss handwriting the sentiments expressed in her last hurried scrawl to him      o why have you treated me so monstrously angel i do    not deserve it  i have thought it all over carefully    and i can never never forgive you  you know that i    did not intend to wrong youwhy have you so wronged    me  you are cruel cruel indeed  i will try to forget    you  it is all injustice i have received at your    hands                                   t  it is quite true said angel throwing down the letter  perhaps she will never be reconciled to me  dont angel be so anxious about a mere child of the soil said his mother  child of the soil  well we all are children of the soil  i wish she were so in the sense you mean but let me now explain to you what i have never explained before that her father is a descendant in the male line of one of the oldest norman houses like a good many others who lead obscure agricultural lives in our villages and are dubbed sons of the soil  he soon retired to bed and the next morning feeling exceedingly unwell he remained in his room pondering  the circumstances amid which he had left tess were such that though while on the south of the equator and just in receipt of her loving epistle it had seemed the easiest thing in the world to rush back into her arms the moment he chose to forgive her now that he had arrived it was not so easy as it had seemed  she was passionate and her present letter showing that her estimate of him had changed under his delaytoo justly changed he sadly ownedmade him ask himself if it would be wise to confront her unannounced in the presence of her parents supposing that her love had indeed turned to dislike during the last weeks of separation a sudden meeting might lead to bitter words  clare therefore thought it would be best to prepare tess and her family by sending a line to marlott announcing his return and his hope that she was still living with them there as he had arranged for her to do when he left england  he despatched the inquiry that very day and before the week was out there came a short reply from mrs durbeyfield which did not remove his embarrassment for it bore no address though to his surprise it was not written from marlott      sir     j write these few lines to say that my daughter is away    from me at present and j am not sure when she will    return but j will let you know as soon as she do    j do not feel at liberty to tell you where she is    temperly biding  j should say that me and my family    have left marlott for some time     yours     j durbeyfield   it was such a relief to clare to learn that tess was at least apparently well that her mothers stiff reticence as to her whereabouts did not long distress him  they were all angry with him evidently  he would wait till mrs durbeyfield could inform him of tesss return which her letter implied to be soon  he deserved no more  his had been a love which alters when it alteration finds he had undergone some strange experiences in his absence he had seen the virtual faustina in the literal cornelia a spiritual lucretia in a corporeal phryne he had thought of the woman taken and set in the midst as one deserving to be stoned and of the wife of uriah being made a queen and he had asked himself why he had not judged tess constructively rather than biographically by the will rather than by the deed  a day or two passed while he waited at his fathers house for the promised second note from joan durbeyfield and indirectly to recover a little more strength  the strength showed signs of coming back but there was no sign of joans letter  then he hunted up the old letter sent on to him in brazil which tess had written from flintcombash and reread it  the sentences touched him now as much as when he had first perused them       i must cry to you in my troublei have no one    else   i think i must die if you do not come    soon or tell me to come to you please please    not to be justonly a little kind to me   if    you would come i could die in your arms  i would    be well content to do that if so be you had forgiven    me  if you will send me one little line and say    i am coming soon i will bide on angelo so    cheerfully  think how it do hurt my heart not to    see you everever  ah if i could only make your    dear heart ache one little minute of each day as mine    does every day and all day long it might lead you to    show pity to your poor lonely one   i would be    content ay glad to live with you as your servant    if i may not as your wife so that i could only be    near you and get glimpses of you and think of you    as mine   i long for only one thing in heaven    or earth or under the earth to meet you my own    dear  come to mecome to me and save me from what    threatens me   clare determined that he would no longer believe in her more recent and severer regard of him but would go and find her immediately  he asked his father if she had applied for any money during his absence his father returned a negative and then for the first time it occurred to angel that her pride had stood in her way and that she had suffered privation  from his remarks his parents now gathered the real reason of the separation and their christianity was such that reprobates being their especial care the tenderness towards tess which her blood her simplicity even her poverty had not engendered was instantly excited by her sin  whilst he was hastily packing together a few articles for his journey he glanced over a poor plain missive also lately come to handthe one from marian and izz huett beginning  honourd sir look to your wife if you do love her as much as she do love you and signed from two wellwishers    liv   in a quarter of an hour clare was leaving the house whence his mother watched his thin figure as it disappeared into the street he had declined to borrow his fathers old mare well knowing of its necessity to the household  he went to the inn where he hired a trap and could hardly wait during the harnessing  in a very few minutes after he was driving up the hill out of the town which three or four months earlier in the year tess had descended with such hopes and ascended with such shattered purposes  benvill lane soon stretched before him its hedges and trees purple with buds but he was looking at other things and only recalled himself to the scene sufficiently to enable him to keep the way  in something less than an hourandahalf he had skirted the south of the kings hintock estates and ascended to the untoward solitude of crossinhand the unholy stone whereon tess had been compelled by alec durberville in his whim of reformation to swear the strange oath that she would never wilfully tempt him again  the pale and blasted nettlestems of the preceding year even now lingered nakedly in the banks young green nettles of the present spring growing from their roots  thence he went along the verge of the upland overhanging the other hintocks and turning to the right plunged into the bracing calcareous region of flintcombash the address from which she had written to him in one of the letters and which he supposed to be the place of sojourn referred to by her mother  here of course he did not find her and what added to his depression was the discovery that no mrs clare had ever been heard of by the cottagers or by the farmer himself though tess was remembered well enough by her christian name  his name she had obviously never used during their separation and her dignified sense of their total severance was shown not much less by this abstention than by the hardships she had chosen to undergo of which he now learnt for the first time rather than apply to his father for more funds  from this place they told him tess durbeyfield had gone without due notice to the home of her parents on the other side of blackmoor and it therefore became necessary to find mrs durbeyfield  she had told him she was not now at marlott but had been curiously reticent as to her actual address and the only course was to go to marlott and inquire for it  the farmer who had been so churlish with tess was quite smoothtongued to clare and lent him a horse and man to drive him towards marlott the gig he had arrived in being sent back to emminster for the limit of a days journey with that horse was reached  clare would not accept the loan of the farmers vehicle for a further distance than to the outskirts of the vale and sending it back with the man who had driven him he put up at an inn and next day entered on foot the region wherein was the spot of his dear tesss birth it was as yet too early in the year for much colour to appear in the gardens and foliage the socalled spring was but winter overlaid with a thin coat of greenness and it was of a parcel with his expectations  the house in which tess had passed the years of her childhood was now inhabited by another family who had never known her  the new residents were in the garden taking as much interest in their own doings as if the homestead had never passed its primal time in conjunction with the histories of others beside which the histories of these were but as a tale told by an idiot  they walked about the garden paths with thoughts of their own concerns entirely uppermost bringing their actions at every moment in jarring collision with the dim ghosts behind them talking as though the time when tess lived there were not one whit intenser in story than now  even the spring birds sang over their heads as if they thought there was nobody missing in particular  on inquiry of these precious innocents to whom even the name of their predecessors was a failing memory clare learned that john durbeyfield was dead that his widow and children had left marlott declaring that they were going to live at kingsbere but instead of doing so had gone on to another place they mentioned  by this time clare abhorred the house for ceasing to contain tess and hastened away from its hated presence without once looking back  his way was by the field in which he had first beheld her at the dance  it was as bad as the houseeven worse  he passed on through the churchyard where amongst the new headstones he saw one of a somewhat superior design to the rest  the inscription ran thus     in memory of john durbeyfield rightly durberville of   the once powerful family of that name and direct   descendant through an illustrious line from sir pagan   durberville one of the knights of the conqueror  died   march 10th 18                  how are the mighty fallen   some man apparently the sexton had observed clare standing there and drew nigh  ah sir now thats a man who didnt want to lie here but wished to be carried to kingsbere where his ancestors be  and why didnt they respect his wish  ohno money  bless your soul sir whythere i wouldnt wish to say it everywhere buteven this headstone for all the flourish wrote upon en is not paid for  ah who put it up  the man told the name of a mason in the village and on leaving the churchyard clare called at the masons house  he found that the statement was true and paid the bill  this done he turned in the direction of the migrants  the distance was too long for a walk but clare felt such a strong desire for isolation that at first he would neither hire a conveyance nor go to a circuitous line of railway by which he might eventually reach the place  at shaston however he found he must hire but the way was such that he did not enter joans place till about seven oclock in the evening having traversed a distance of over twenty miles since leaving marlott  the village being small he had little difficulty in finding mrs durbeyfields tenement which was a house in a walled garden remote from the main road where she had stowed away her clumsy old furniture as best she could  it was plain that for some reason or other she had not wished him to visit her and he felt his call to be somewhat of an intrusion  she came to the door herself and the light from the evening sky fell upon her face  this was the first time that clare had ever met her but he was too preoccupied to observe more than that she was still a handsome woman in the garb of a respectable widow  he was obliged to explain that he was tesss husband and his object in coming there and he did it awkwardly enough  i want to see her at once he added  you said you would write to me again but you have not done so  because sheve not come home said joan  do you know if she is well  i dont  but you ought to sir said she  i admit it  where is she staying  from the beginning of the interview joan had disclosed her embarrassment by keeping her hand to the side of her cheek  idont know exactly where she is staying she answered she wasbut  where was she  well she is not there now  in her evasiveness she paused again and the younger children had by this time crept to the door where pulling at his mothers skirts the youngest murmured  is this the gentleman who is going to marry tess  he has married her joan whispered  go inside  clare saw her efforts for reticence and asked  do you think tess would wish me to try and find her  if not of course  i dont think she would  are you sure  i am sure she wouldnt  he was turning away and then he thought of tesss tender letter  i am sure she would he retorted passionately  i know her better than you do  thats very likely sir for i have never really known her  please tell me her address mrs durbeyfield in kindness to a lonely wretched man  tesss mother again restlessly swept her cheek with her vertical hand and seeing that he suffered she at last said is a low voice  she is at sandbourne  ahwhere there  sandbourne has become a large place they say  i dont know more particularly than i have saidsandbourne  for myself i was never there  it was apparent that joan spoke the truth in this and he pressed her no further  are you in want of anything he said gently  no sir she replied  we are fairly well provided for  without entering the house clare turned away  there was a station three miles ahead and paying off his coachman he walked thither the last train to sandbourne left shortly after and it bore clare on its wheels    lv   at eleven oclock that night having secured a bed at one of the hotels and telegraphed his address to his father immediately on his arrival he walked out into the streets of sandbourne  it was too late to call on or inquire for any one and he reluctantly postponed his purpose till the morning  but he could not retire to rest just yet  this fashionable wateringplace with its eastern and its western stations its piers its groves of pines its promenades and its covered gardens was to angel clare like a fairy place suddenly created by the stroke of a wand and allowed to get a little dusty an outlying eastern tract of the enormous egdon waste was close at hand yet on the very verge of that tawny piece of antiquity such a glittering novelty as this pleasure city had chosen to spring up within the space of a mile from its outskirts every irregularity of the soil was prehistoric every channel an undisturbed british trackway not a sod having been turned there since the days of the caesars  yet the exotic had grown here suddenly as the prophets gourd and had drawn hither tess  by the midnight lamps he went up and down the winding way of this new world in an old one and could discern between the trees and against the stars the lofty roofs chimneys gazebos and towers of the numerous fanciful residences of which the place was composed it was a city of detached mansions a mediterranean loungingplace on the english channel and as seen now by night it seemed even more imposing than it was  the sea was near at hand but not intrusive it murmured and he thought it was the pines the pines murmured in precisely the same tones and he thought they were the sea  where could tess possibly be a cottagegirl his young wife amidst all this wealth and fashion  the more he pondered the more was he puzzled  were there any cows to milk here  there certainly were no fields to till she was most probably engaged to do something in one of these large houses and he sauntered along looking at the chamberwindows and their lights going out one by one and wondered which of them might be hers  conjecture was useless and just after twelve oclock he entered and went to bed   before putting out his light he reread tesss impassioned letter  sleep however he could notso near her yet so far from herand he continually lifted the windowblind and regarded the backs of the opposite houses and wondered behind which of the sashes she reposed at that moment  he might almost as well have sat up all night  in the morning he arose at seven and shortly after went out taking the direction of the chief postoffice  at the door he met an intelligent postman coming out with letters for the morning delivery  do you know the address of a mrs clare asked angel  the postman shook his head  then remembering that she would have been likely to continue the use of her maiden name clare said  of a miss durbeyfield  durbeyfield  this also was strange to the postman addressed  theres visitors coming and going every day as you know sir he said and without the name of the house tis impossible to find em  one of his comrades hastening out at that moment the name was repeated to him  i know no name of durbeyfield but there is the name of durberville at the herons said the second  thats it cried clare pleased to think that she had reverted to the real pronunciation  what place is the herons  a stylish lodginghouse  tis all lodginghouses here bless ee  clare received directions how to find the house and hastened thither arriving with the milkman  the herons though an ordinary villa stood in its own grounds and was certainly the last place in which one would have expected to find lodgings so private was its appearance  if poor tess was a servant here as he feared she would go to the backdoor to that milkman and he was inclined to go thither also  however in his doubts he turned to the front and rang  the hour being early the landlady herself opened the door  clare inquired for teresa durberville or durbeyfield  mrs durberville  yes  tess then passed as a married woman and he felt glad even though she had not adopted his name  will you kindly tell her that a relative is anxious to see her  it is rather early  what name shall i give sir  angel  mr angel  no angel  it is my christian name  shell understand  ill see if she is awake  he was shown into the front roomthe diningroomand looked out through the spring curtains at the little lawn and the rhododendrons and other shrubs upon it  obviously her position was by no means so bad as he had feared and it crossed his mind that she must somehow have claimed and sold the jewels to attain it  he did not blame her for one moment  soon his sharpened ear detected footsteps upon the stairs at which his heart thumped so painfully that he could hardly stand firm  dear me what will she think of me so altered as i am he said to himself and the door opened  tess appeared on the thresholdnot at all as he had expected to see herbewilderingly otherwise indeed  her great natural beauty was if not heightened rendered more obvious by her attire  she was loosely wrapped in a cashmere dressinggown of graywhite embroidered in halfmourning tints and she wore slippers of the same hue  her neck rose out of a frill of down and her wellremembered cable of darkbrown hair was partially coiled up in a mass at the back of her head and partly hanging on her shoulderthe evident result of haste  he had held out his arms but they had fallen again to his side for she had not come forward remaining still in the opening of the doorway  mere yellow skeleton that he was now he felt the contrast between them and thought his appearance distasteful to her  tess he said huskily can you forgive me for going away  cant youcome to me  how do you get to belike this  it is too late said she her voice sounding hard through the room her eyes shining unnaturally  i did not think rightly of youi did not see you as you were he continued to plead  i have learnt to since dearest tessy mine  too late too late she said waving her hand in the impatience of a person whose tortures cause every instant to seem an hour  dont come close to me angel  noyou must not  keep away  but dont you love me my dear wife because i have been so pulled down by illness  you are not so ficklei am come on purpose for youmy mother and father will welcome you now  yeso yes yes  but i say i say it is too late  she seemed to feel like a fugitive in a dream who tries to move away but cannot  dont you know alldont you know it  yet how do you come here if you do not know  i inquired here and there and i found the way  i waited and waited for you she went on her tones suddenly resuming their old fluty pathos  but you did not come  and i wrote to you and you did not come he kept on saying you would never come any more and that i was a foolish woman  he was very kind to me and to mother and to all of us after fathers death he  i dont understand  he has won me back to him  clare looked at her keenly then gathering her meaning flagged like one plaguestricken and his glance sank it fell on her hands which once rosy were now white and more delicate  she continued  he is upstairs  i hate him now because he told me a liethat you would not come again and you have come  these clothes are what hes put upon me i didnt care what he did wi me  butwill you go away angel please and never come any more  they stood fixed their baffled hearts looking out of their eyes with a joylessness pitiful to see  both seemed to implore something to shelter them from reality  ahit is my fault said clare  but he could not get on  speech was as inexpressive as silence  but he had a vague consciousness of one thing though it was not clear to him till later that his original tess had spiritually ceased to recognize the body before him as hersallowing it to drift like a corpse upon the current in a direction dissociated from its living will  a few instants passed and he found that tess was gone  his face grew colder and more shrunken as he stood concentrated on the moment and a minute or two after he found himself in the street walking along he did not know whither    lvi   mrs brooks the lady who was the householder at the herons and owner of all the handsome furniture was not a person of an unusually curious turn of mind she was too deeply materialized poor woman by her long and enforced bondage to that arithmetical demon profitandloss to retain much curiousity for its own sake and apart from possible lodgers pockets  nevertheless the visit of angel clare to her wellpaying tenants mr and mrs durberville as she deemed them was sufficiently exceptional in point of time and manner to reinvigorate the feminine proclivity which had been stifled down as useless save in its bearings to the letting trade  tess had spoken to her husband from the doorway without entering the diningroom and mrs brooks who stood within the partlyclosed door of her own sittingroom at the back of the passage could hear fragments of the conversationif conversation it could be calledbetween those two wretched souls  she heard tess reascend the stairs to the first floor and the departure of clare and the closing of the front door behind him  then the door of the room above was shut and mrs brooks knew that tess had reentered her apartment  as the young lady was not fully dressed mrs brooks knew that she would not emerge again for some time  she accordingly ascended the stairs softly and stood at the door of the front rooma drawingroom connected with the room immediately behind it which was a bedroom by foldingdoors in the common manner  this first floor containing mrs brookss best apartments had been taken by the week by the durbervilles  the back room was now in silence but from the drawingroom there came sounds  all that she could at first distinguish of them was one syllable continually repeated in a low note of moaning as if it came from a soul bound to some ixionian wheel  ooo  then a silence then a heavy sigh and again  ooo  the landlady looked through the keyhole  only a small space of the room inside was visible but within that space came a corner of the breakfast table which was already spread for the meal and also a chair beside  over the seat of the chair tesss face was bowed her posture being a kneeling one in front of it her hands were clasped over her head the skirts of her dressinggown and the embroidery of her nightgown flowed upon the floor behind her and her stockingless feet from which the slippers had fallen protruded upon the carpet it was from her lips that came the murmur of unspeakable despair  then a mans voice from the adjoining bedroom  whats the matter  she did not answer but went on in a tone which was a soliloquy rather than an exclamation and a dirge rather than a soliloquy mrs brooks could only catch a portion  and then my dear dear husband came home to me  and i did not know it   and you had used your cruel persuasion upon me  you did not stop using itnoyou did not stop my little sisters and brothers and my mothers needsthey were the things you moved me by  and you said my husband would never come backnever and you taunted me and said what a simpleton i was to expect him   and at last i believed you and gave way   and then he came back now he is gone  gone a second time and i have lost him now for ever  and he will not love me the littlest bit ever any moreonly hate me  o yes i have lost him nowagain because ofyou  in writhing with her head on the chair she turned her face towards the door and mrs brooks could see the pain upon it and that her lips were bleeding from the clench of her teeth upon them and that the long lashes of her closed eyes stuck in wet tags to her cheeks  she continued and he is dyinghe looks as if he is dying   and my sin will kill him and not kill me   o you have torn my life all to pieces  made me be what i prayed you in pity not to make me be again   my own true husband will never nevero godi cant bear thisi cannot  there were more and sharper words from the man then a sudden rustle she had sprung to her feet  mrs brooks thinking that the speaker was coming to rush out of the door hastily retreated down the stairs  she need not have done so however for the door of the sittingroom was not opened  but mrs brooks felt it unsafe to watch on the landing again and entered her own parlour below  she could hear nothing through the floor although she listened intently and thereupon went to the kitchen to finish her interrupted breakfast  coming up presently to the front room on the ground floor she took up some sewing waiting for her lodgers to ring that she might take away the breakfast which she meant to do herself to discover what was the matter if possible  overhead as she sat she could now hear the floorboards slightly creak as if some one were walking about and presently the movement was explained by the rustle of garments against the banisters the opening and the closing of the front door and the form of tess passing to the gate on her way into the street  she was fully dressed now in the walking costume of a welltodo young lady in which she had arrived with the sole addition that over her hat and black feathers a veil was drawn  mrs brooks had not been able to catch any word of farewell temporary or otherwise between her tenants at the door above  they might have quarrelled or mr durberville might still be asleep for he was not an early riser  she went into the back room which was more especially her own apartment and continued her sewing there  the lady lodger did not return nor did the gentleman ring his bell  mrs brooks pondered on the delay and on what probable relation the visitor who had called so early bore to the couple upstairs  in reflecting she leant back in her chair  as she did so her eyes glanced casually over the ceiling till they were arrested by a spot in the middle of its white surface which she had never noticed there before  it was about the size of a wafer when she first observed it but it speedily grew as large as the palm of her hand and then she could perceive that it was red  the oblong white ceiling with this scarlet blot in the midst had the appearance of a gigantic ace of hearts  mrs brooks had strange qualms of misgiving  she got upon the table and touched the spot in the ceiling with her fingers it was damp and she fancied that it was a blood stain  descending from the table she left the parlour and went upstairs intending to enter the room overhead which was the bedchamber at the back of the drawingroom  but nerveless woman as she had now become she could not bring herself to attempt the handle  she listened  the dead silence within was broken only by a regular beat  drip drip drip  mrs brooks hastened downstairs opened the front door and ran into the street  a man she knew one of the workmen employed at an adjoining villa was passing by and she begged him to come in and go upstairs with her she feared something had happened to one of her lodgers  the workman assented and followed her to the landing  she opened the door of the drawingroom and stood back for him to pass in entering herself behind him  the room was empty the breakfasta substantial repast of coffee eggs and a cold hamlay spread upon the table untouched as when she had taken it up excepting that the carvingknife was missing  she asked the man to go through the foldingdoors into the adjoining room  he opened the doors entered a step or two and came back almost instantly with a rigid face  my good god the gentleman in bed is dead  i think he has been hurt with a knifea lot of blood had run down upon the floor  the alarm was soon given and the house which had lately been so quiet resounded with the tramp of many footsteps a surgeon among the rest  the wound was small but the point of the blade had touched the heart of the victim who lay on his back pale fixed dead as if he had scarcely moved after the infliction of the blow  in a quarter of an hour the news that a gentleman who was a temporary visitor to the town had been stabbed in his bed spread through every street and villa of the popular wateringplace    lvii   meanwhile angel clare had walked automatically along the way by which he had come and entering his hotel sat down over the breakfast staring at nothingness  he went on eating and drinking unconsciously till on a sudden he demanded his bill having paid which he took his dressingbag in his hand the only luggage he had brought with him and went out  at the moment of his departure a telegram was handed to hima few words from his mother stating that they were glad to know his address and informing him that his brother cuthbert had proposed to and been accepted by mercy chant  clare crumpled up the paper and followed the route to the station reaching it he found that there would be no train leaving for an hour and more  he sat down to wait and having waited a quarter of an hour felt that he could wait there no longer  broken in heart and numbed he had nothing to hurry for but he wished to get out of a town which had been the scene of such an experience and turned to walk to the first station onward and let the train pick him up there  the highway that he followed was open and at a little distance dipped into a valley across which it could be seen running from edge to edge  he had traversed the greater part of this depression and was climbing the western acclivity when pausing for breath he unconsciously looked back  why he did so he could not say but something seemed to impel him to the act  the tapelike surface of the road diminished in his rear as far as he could see and as he gazed a moving spot intruded on the white vacuity of its perspective  it was a human figure running  clare waited with a dim sense that somebody was trying to overtake him  the form descending the incline was a womans yet so entirely was his mind blinded to the idea of his wifes following him that even when she came nearer he did not recognize her under the totally changed attire in which he now beheld her  it was not till she was quite close that he could believe her to be tess  i saw youturn away from the stationjust before i got thereand i have been following you all this way  she was so pale so breathless so quivering in every muscle that he did not ask her a single question but seizing her hand and pulling it within his arm he led her along  to avoid meeting any possible wayfarers he left the high road and took a footpath under some firtrees  when they were deep among the moaning boughs he stopped and looked at her inquiringly  angel she said as if waiting for this do you know what i have been running after you for  to tell you that i have killed him a pitiful white smile lit her face as she spoke  what said he thinking from the strangeness of her manner that she was in some delirium  i have done iti dont know how she continued  still i owed it to you and to myself angel  i feared long ago when i struck him on the mouth with my glove that i might do it some day for the trap he set for me in my simple youth and his wrong to you through me he has come between us and ruined us and now he can never do it any more  i never loved him at all angel as i loved you  you know it dont you  you believe it  you didnt come back to me and i was obliged to go back to him  why did you go awaywhy did youwhen i loved you so  i cant think why you did it  but i dont blame you only angel will you forgive me my sin against you now i have killed him  i thought as i ran along that you would be sure to forgive me now i have done that  it came to me as a shining light that i should get you back that way  i could not bear the loss of you any longeryou dont know how entirely i was unable to bear your not loving me  say you do now dear dear husband say you do now i have killed him  i do love you tesso i doit is all come back he said tightening his arms round her with fervid pressure  but how do you meanyou have killed him  i mean that i have she murmured in a reverie  what bodily  is he dead  yes  he heard me crying about you and he bitterly taunted me and called you by a foul name and then i did it  my heart could not bear it  he had nagged me about you before  and then i dressed myself and came away to find you  by degrees he was inclined to believe that she had faintly attempted at least what she said she had done and his horror at her impulse was mixed with amazement at the strength of her affection for himself and at the strangeness of its quality which had apparently extinguished her moral sense altogether  unable to realize the gravity of her conduct she seemed at last content and he looked at her as she lay upon his shoulder weeping with happiness and wondered what obscure strain in the durberville blood had led to this aberrationif it were an aberration  there momentarily flashed through his mind that the family tradition of the coach and murder might have arisen because the durbervilles had been known to do these things  as well as his confused and excited ideas could reason he supposed that in the moment of mad grief of which she spoke her mind had lost its balance and plunged her into this abyss  it was very terrible if true if a temporary hallucination sad  but anyhow here was this deserted wife of his this passionatelyfond woman clinging to him without a suspicion that he would be anything to her but a protector  he saw that for him to be otherwise was not in her mind within the region of the possible  tenderness was absolutely dominant in clare at last  he kissed her endlessly with his white lips and held her hand and said  i will not desert you  i will protect you by every means in my power dearest love whatever you may have done or not have done  they then walked on under the trees tess turning her head every now and then to look at him  worn and unhandsome as he had become it was plain that she did not discern the least fault in his appearance to her he was as of old all that was perfection personally and mentally  he was still her antinous her apollo even his sickly face was beautiful as the morning to her affectionate regard on this day no less than when she first beheld him for was it not the face of the one man on earth who had loved her purely and who had believed in her as pure  with an instinct as to possibilities he did not now as he had intended make for the first station beyond the town but plunged still farther under the firs which here abounded for miles  each clasping the other round the waist they promenaded over the dry bed of firneedles thrown into a vague intoxicating atmosphere at the consciousness of being together at last with no living soul between them ignoring that there was a corpse  thus they proceeded for several miles till tess arousing herself looked about her and said timidly  are we going anywhere in particular  i dont know dearest  why  i dont know  well we might walk a few miles further and when it is evening find lodgings somewhere or otherin a lonely cottage perhaps  can you walk well tessy  o yes  i could walk for ever and ever with your arm round me  upon the whole it seemed a good thing to do  thereupon they quickened their pace avoiding high roads and following obscure paths tending more or less northward  but there was an unpractical vagueness in their movements throughout the day neither one of them seemed to consider any question of effectual escape disguise or long concealment  their every idea was temporary and unforefending like the plans of two children  at midday they drew near to a roadside inn and tess would have entered it with him to get something to eat but he persuaded her to remain among the trees and bushes of this halfwoodland halfmoorland part of the country till he should come back  her clothes were of recent fashion even the ivoryhandled parasol that she carried was of a shape unknown in the retired spot to which they had now wandered and the cut of such articles would have attracted attention in the settle of a tavern  he soon returned with food enough for halfadozen people and two bottles of wineenough to last them for a day or more should any emergency arise  they sat down upon some dead boughs and shared their meal  between one and two oclock they packed up the remainder and went on again  i feel strong enough to walk any distance said she  i think we may as well steer in a general way towards the interior of the country where we can hide for a time and are less likely to be looked for than anywhere near the coast clare remarked  later on when they have forgotten us we can make for some port  she made no reply to this beyond that of grasping him more tightly and straight inland they went  though the season was an english may the weather was serenely bright and during the afternoon it was quite warm  through the latter miles of their walk their footpath had taken them into the depths of the new forest and towards evening turning the corner of a lane they perceived behind a brook and bridge a large board on which was painted in white letters this desirable mansion to be let furnished particulars following with directions to apply to some london agents  passing through the gate they could see the house an old brick building of regular design and large accommodation  i know it said clare  it is bramshurst court  you can see that it is shut up and grass is growing on the drive  some of the windows are open said tess  just to air the rooms i suppose  all these rooms empty and we without a roof to our heads  you are getting tired my tess he said  well stop soon  and kissing her sad mouth he again led her onwards  he was growing weary likewise for they had wandered a dozen or fifteen miles and it became necessary to consider what they should do for rest  they looked from afar at isolated cottages and little inns and were inclined to approach one of the latter when their hearts failed them and they sheered off  at length their gait dragged and they stood still  could we sleep under the trees she asked  he thought the season insufficiently advanced  i have been thinking of that empty mansion we passed he said let us go back towards it again  they retraced their steps but it was half an hour before they stood without the entrancegate as earlier  he then requested her to stay where she was whilst he went to see who was within  she sat down among the bushes within the gate and clare crept towards the house  his absence lasted some considerable time and when he returned tess was wildly anxious not for herself but for him  he had found out from a boy that there was only an old woman in charge as caretaker and she only came there on fine days from the hamlet near to open and shut the windows  she would come to shut them at sunset  now we can get in through one of the lower windows and rest there said he  under his escort she went tardily forward to the main front whose shuttered windows like sightless eyeballs excluded the possibility of watchers  the door was reached a few steps further and one of the windows beside it was open clare clambered in and pulled tess in after him  except the hall the rooms were all in darkness and they ascended the staircase  up here also the shutters were tightly closed the ventilation being perfunctorily done for this day at least by opening the hallwindow in front and an upper window behind clare unlatched the door of a large chamber felt his way across it and parted the shutters to the width of two or three inches a shaft of dazzling sunlight glanced into the room revealing heavy oldfashioned furniture crimson damask hangings and an enormous fourpost bedstead along the head of which were carved running figures apparently atalantas race  rest at last said he setting down his bag and the parcel of viands  they remained in great quietness till the caretaker should have come to shut the windows as a precaution putting themselves in total darkness by barring the shutters as before lest the woman should open the door of their chamber for any casual reason  between six and seven oclock she came but did not approach the wing they were in  they heard her close the windows fasten them lock the door and go away  then clare again stole a chink of light from the window and they shared another meal till byandby they were enveloped in the shades of night which they had no candle to disperse    lviii   the night was strangely solemn and still  in the small hours she whispered to him the whole story of how he had walked in his sleep with her in his arms across the froom stream at the imminent risk of both their lives and laid her down in the stone coffin at the ruined abbey  he had never known of that till now  why didnt you tell me next day he said  it might have prevented much misunderstanding and woe  dont think of whats past said she  i am not going to think outside of now  why should we  who knows what tomorrow has in store  but it apparently had no sorrow  the morning was wet and foggy and clare rightly informed that the caretaker only opened the windows on fine days ventured to creep out of their chamber and explore the house leaving tess asleep  there was no food on the premises but there was water and he took advantage of the fog to emerge from the mansion and fetch tea bread and butter from a shop in a little place two miles beyond as also a small tin kettle and spiritlamp that they might get fire without smoke  his reentry awoke her and they breakfasted on what he had brought  they were indisposed to stir abroad and the day passed and the night following and the next and next till almost without their being aware five days had slipped by in absolute seclusion not a sight or sound of a human being disturbing their peacefulness such as it was  the changes of the weather were their only events the birds of the new forest their only company  by tacit consent they hardly once spoke of any incident of the past subsequent to their weddingday  the gloomy intervening time seemed to sink into chaos over which the present and prior times closed as if it never had been  whenever he suggested that they should leave their shelter and go forwards towards southampton or london she showed a strange unwillingness to move  why should we put an end to all thats sweet and lovely she deprecated  what must come will come  and looking through the shutterchink all is trouble outside there inside here content  he peeped out also  it was quite true within was affection union error forgiven outside was the inexorable  andand she said pressing her cheek against his i fear that what you think of me now may not last  i do not wish to outlive your present feeling for me i would rather not  i would rather be dead and buried when the time comes for you to despise me so that it may never be known to me that you despised me  i cannot ever despise you  i also hope that  but considering what my life has been i cannot see why any man should sooner or later be able to help despising me  how wickedly mad i was  yet formerly i never could bear to hurt a fly or a worm and the sight of a bird in a cage used often to make me cry  they remained yet another day  in the night the dull sky cleared and the result was that the old caretaker at the cottage awoke early the brilliant sunrise made her unusually brisk she decided to open the contiguous mansion immediately and to air it thoroughly on such a day  thus it occurred that having arrived and opened the lower rooms before six oclock she ascended to the bedchambers and was about to turn the handle of the one wherein they lay  at that moment she fancied she could hear the breathing of persons within  her slippers and her antiquity had rendered her progress a noiseless one so far and she made for instant retreat then deeming that her hearing might have deceived her she turned anew to the door and softly tried the handle  the lock was out of order but a piece of furniture had been moved forward on the inside which prevented her opening the door more than an inch or two  a stream of morning light through the shutterchink fell upon the faces of the pair wrapped in profound slumber tesss lips being parted like a halfopened flower near his cheek  the caretaker was so struck with their innocent appearance and with the elegance of tesss gown hanging across a chair her silk stockings beside it the pretty parasol and the other habits in which she had arrived because she had none else that her first indignation at the effrontery of tramps and vagabonds gave way to a momentary sentimentality over this genteel elopement as it seemed  she closed the door and withdrew as softly as she had come to go and consult with her neighbours on the odd discovery  not more than a minute had elapsed after her withdrawal when tess woke and then clare  both had a sense that something had disturbed them though they could not say what and the uneasy feeling which it engendered grew stronger  as soon as he was dressed he narrowly scanned the lawn through the two or three inches of shutterchink  i think we will leave at once said he  it is a fine day and i cannot help fancying somebody is about the house  at any rate the woman will be sure to come today  she passively assented and putting the room in order they took up the few articles that belonged to them and departed noiselessly when they had got into the forest she turned to take a last look at the house  ah happy housegoodbye she said  my life can only be a question of a few weeks  why should we not have stayed there  dont say it tess  we shall soon get out of this district altogether  well continue our course as weve begun it and keep straight north  nobody will think of looking for us there  we shall be looked for at the wessex ports if we are sought at all  when we are in the north we will get to a port and away  having thus persuaded her the plan was pursued and they kept a beeline northward  their long repose at the manorhouse lent them walking power now and towards midday they found that they were approaching the steepled city of melchester which lay directly in their way  he decided to rest her in a clump of trees during the afternoon and push onward under cover of darkness  at dusk clare purchased food as usual and their night march began the boundary between upper and midwessex being crossed about eight oclock  to walk across country without much regard to roads was not new to tess and she showed her old agility in the performance  the intercepting city ancient melchester they were obliged to pass through in order to take advantage of the town bridge for crossing a large river that obstructed them  it was about midnight when they went along the deserted streets lighted fitfully by the few lamps keeping off the pavement that it might not echo their footsteps the graceful pile of cathedral architecture rose dimly on their left hand but it was lost upon them now  once out of the town they followed the turnpikeroad which after a few miles plunged across an open plain  though the sky was dense with cloud a diffused light from some fragment of a moon had hitherto helped them a little  but the moon had now sunk the clouds seemed to settle almost on their heads and the night grew as dark as a cave  however they found their way along keeping as much on the turf as possible that their tread might not resound which it was easy to do there being no hedge or fence of any kind  all around was open loneliness and black solitude over which a stiff breeze blew  they had proceeded thus gropingly two or three miles further when on a sudden clare became conscious of some vast erection close in his front rising sheer from the grass  they had almost struck themselves against it  what monstrous place is this said angel  it hums said she  hearken  he listened  the wind playing upon the edifice produced a booming tune like the note of some gigantic onestringed harp  no other sound came from it and lifting his hand and advancing a step or two clare felt the vertical surface of the structure  it seemed to be of solid stone without joint or moulding  carrying his fingers onward he found that what he had come in contact with was a colossal rectangular pillar by stretching out his left hand he could feel a similar one adjoining  at an indefinite height overhead something made the black sky blacker which had the semblance of a vast architrave uniting the pillars horizontally  they carefully entered beneath and between the surfaces echoed their soft rustle but they seemed to be still out of doors  the place was roofless  tess drew her breath fearfully and angel perplexed said  what can it be  feeling sideways they encountered another towerlike pillar square and uncompromising as the first beyond it another and another  the place was all doors and pillars some connected above by continuous architraves  a very temple of the winds he said  the next pillar was isolated others composed a trilithon others were prostrate their flanks forming a causeway wide enough for a carriage and it was soon obvious that they made up a forest of monoliths grouped upon the grassy expanse of the plain  the couple advanced further into this pavilion of the night till they stood in its midst  it is stonehenge said clare  the heathen temple you mean  yes  older than the centuries older than the durbervilles  well what shall we do darling  we may find shelter further on  but tess really tired by this time flung herself upon an oblong slab that lay close at hand and was sheltered from the wind by a pillar  owing to the action of the sun during the preceding day the stone was warm and dry in comforting contrast to the rough and chill grass around which had damped her skirts and shoes  i dont want to go any further angel she said stretching out her hand for his  cant we bide here  i fear not  this spot is visible for miles by day although it does not seem so now  one of my mothers people was a shepherd hereabouts now i think of it  and you used to say at talbothays that i was a heathen  so now i am at home  he knelt down beside her outstretched form and put his lips upon hers  sleepy are you dear  i think you are lying on an altar  i like very much to be here she murmured  it is so solemn and lonelyafter my great happinesswith nothing but the sky above my face  it seems as if there were no folk in the world but we two and i wish there were notexcept lizalu  clare though she might as well rest here till it should get a little lighter and he flung his overcoat upon her and sat down by her side  angel if anything happens to me will you watch over lizalu for my sake she asked when they had listened a long time to the wind among the pillars  i will  she is so good and simple and pure  o angeli wish you would marry her if you lose me as you will do shortly  o if you would  if i lose you i lose all  and she is my sisterinlaw  thats nothing dearest  people marry sisterlaws continually about marlott and lizalu is so gentle and sweet and she is growing so beautiful  o i could share you with her willingly when we are spirits  if you would train her and teach her angel and bring her up for your own self   she had all the best of me without the bad of me and if she were to become yours it would almost seem as if death had not divided us  well i have said it  i wont mention it again  she ceased and he fell into thought  in the far northeast sky he could see between the pillars a level streak of light  the uniform concavity of black cloud was lifting bodily like the lid of a pot letting in at the earths edge the coming day against which the towering monoliths and trilithons began to be blackly defined  did they sacrifice to god here asked she  no said he  who to  i believe to the sun  that lofty stone set away by itself is in the direction of the sun which will presently rise behind it  this reminds me dear she said  you remember you never would interfere with any belief of mine before we were married  but i knew your mind all the same and i thought as you thoughtnot from any reasons of my own but because you thought so  tell me now angel do you think we shall meet again after we are dead  i want to know  he kissed her to avoid a reply at such a time  o angeli fear that means no said she with a suppressed sob and i wanted so to see you againso much so much  whatnot even you and i angel who love each other so well  like a greater than himself to the critical question at the critical time he did not answer and they were again silent  in a minute or two her breathing became more regular her clasp of his hand relaxed and she fell asleep  the band of silver paleness along the east horizon made even the distant parts of the great plain appear dark and near and the whole enormous landscape bore that impress of reserve taciturnity and hesitation which is usual just before day the eastward pillars and their architraves stood up blackly against the light and the great flameshaped sunstone beyond them and the stone of sacrifice midway  presently the night wind died out and the quivering little pools in the cuplike hollows of the stones lay still  at the same time something seemed to move on the verge of the dip eastwarda mere dot  it was the head of a man approaching them from the hollow beyond the sunstone  clare wished they had gone onward but in the circumstances decided to remain quiet  the figure came straight towards the circle of pillars in which they were  he heard something behind him the brush of feet  turning he saw over the prostrate columns another figure then before he was aware another was at hand on the right under a trilithon and another on the left  the dawn shone full on the front of the man westward and clare could discern from this that he was tall and walked as if trained  they all closed in with evident purpose  her story then was true  springing to his feet he looked around for a weapon loose stone means of escape anything  by this time the nearest man was upon him  it is no use sir he said  there are sixteen of us on the plain and the whole country is reared  let her finish her sleep he implored in a whisper of the men as they gathered round  when they saw where she lay which they had not done till then they showed no objection and stood watching her as still as the pillars around  he went to the stone and bent over her holding one poor little hand her breathing now was quick and small like that of a lesser creature than a woman  all waited in the growing light their faces and hands as if they were silvered the remainder of their figures dark the stones glistening greengray the plain still a mass of shade  soon the light was strong and a ray shone upon her unconscious form peering under her eyelids and waking her  what is it angel she said starting up  have they come for me  yes dearest he said  they have come  it is as it should be she murmured  angel i am almost gladyes glad  this happiness could not have lasted  it was too much  i have had enough and now i shall not live for you to despise me  she stood up shook herself and went forward neither of the men having moved  i am ready she said quietly    lix   the city of wintoncester that fine old city aforetime capital of wessex lay amidst its convex and concave downlands in all the brightness and warmth of a july morning  the gabled brick tile and freestone houses had almost dried off for the season their integument of lichen the streams in the meadows were low and in the sloping high street from the west gateway to the mediæval cross and from the mediæval cross to the bridge that leisurely dusting and sweeping was in progress which usually ushers in an oldfashioned marketday  from the western gate aforesaid the highway as every wintoncestrian knows ascends a long and regular incline of the exact length of a measured mile leaving the houses gradually behind  up this road from the precincts of the city two persons were walking rapidly as if unconscious of the trying ascentunconscious through preoccupation and not through buoyancy  they had emerged upon this road through a narrow barred wicket in a high wall a little lower down  they seemed anxious to get out of the sight of the houses and of their kind and this road appeared to offer the quickest means of doing so  though they were young they walked with bowed heads which gait of grief the suns rays smiled on pitilessly  one of the pair was angel clare the other a tall budding creaturehalf girl half womana spiritualized image of tess slighter than she but with the same beautiful eyesclares sisterinlaw lizalu  their pale faces seemed to have shrunk to half their natural size  they moved on hand in hand and never spoke a word the drooping of their heads being that of giottos two apostles  when they had nearly reached the top of the great west hill the clocks in the town struck eight  each gave a start at the notes and walking onward yet a few steps they reached the first milestone standing whitely on the green margin of the grass and backed by the down which here was open to the road  they entered upon the turf and impelled by a force that seemed to overrule their will suddenly stood still turned and waited in paralyzed suspense beside the stone  the prospect from this summit was almost unlimited  in the valley beneath lay the city they had just left its more prominent buildings showing as in an isometric drawingamong them the broad cathedral tower with its norman windows and immense length of aisle and nave the spires of st thomass the pinnacled tower of the college and more to the right the tower and gables of the ancient hospice where to this day the pilgrim may receive his dole of bread and ale behind the city swept the rotund upland of st catherines hill further off landscape beyond landscape till the horizon was lost in the radiance of the sun hanging above it  against these far stretches of country rose in front of the other city edifices a large redbrick building with level gray roofs and rows of short barred windows bespeaking captivity the whole contrasting greatly by its formalism with the quaint irregularities of the gothic erections  it was somewhat disguised from the road in passing it by yews and evergreen oaks but it was visible enough up here  the wicket from which the pair had lately emerged was in the wall of this structure  from the middle of the building an ugly flattopped octagonal tower ascended against the east horizon and viewed from this spot on its shady side and against the light it seemed the one blot on the citys beauty  yet it was with this blot and not with the beauty that the two gazers were concerned  upon the cornice of the tower a tall staff was fixed  their eyes were riveted on it  a few minutes after the hour had struck something moved slowly up the staff and extended itself upon the breeze  it was a black flag  justice was done and the president of the immortals in aeschylean phrase had ended his sport with tess  and the durberville knights and dames slept on in their tombs unknowing  the two speechless gazers bent themselves down to the earth as if in prayer and remained thus a long time absolutely motionless the flag continued to wave silently  as soon as they had strength they arose joined hands again and went on
