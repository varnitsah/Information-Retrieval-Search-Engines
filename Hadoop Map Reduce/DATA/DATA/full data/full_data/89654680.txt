89654680	the tapestried chamber  by sir walter scott     introduction  this is another little story from the keepsake of 1828 it was told to me many years ago by the late miss anna seward who among other accomplishments that rendered her an amusing inmate in a country house had that of recounting narratives of this sort with very considerable effectmuch greater indeed than any one would be apt to guess from the style of her written performances there are hours and moods when most people are not displeased to listen to such things and i have heard some of the greatest and wisest of my contemporaries take their share in telling them  august 1831     the tapestried chamber  or  the lady in the sacque  the following narrative is given from the pen so far as memory permits in the same character in which it was presented to the authors ear nor has he claim to further praise or to be more deeply censured than in proportion to the good or bad judgment which he has employed in selecting his materials as he has studiously avoided any attempt at ornament which might interfere with the simplicity of the tale  at the same time it must be admitted that the particular class of stories which turns on the marvellous possesses a stronger influence when told than when committed to print the volume taken up at noonday though rehearsing the same incidents conveys a much more feeble impression than is achieved by the voice of the speaker on a circle of fireside auditors who hang upon the narrative as the narrator details the minute incidents which serve to give it authenticity and lowers his voice with an affectation of mystery while he approaches the fearful and wonderful part it was with such advantages that the present writer heard the following events related more than twenty years since by the celebrated miss seward of litchfield who to her numerous accomplishments added in a remarkable degree the power of narrative in private conversation in its present form the tale must necessarily lose all the interest which was attached to it by the flexible voice and intelligent features of the gifted narrator yet still read aloud to an undoubting audience by the doubtful light of the closing evening or in silence by a decaying taper and amidst the solitude of a halflighted apartment it may redeem its character as a good ghost story miss seward always affirmed that she had derived her information from an authentic source although she suppressed the names of the two persons chiefly concerned i will not avail myself of any particulars i may have since received concerning the localities of the detail but suffer them to rest under the same general description in which they were first related to me and for the same reason i will not add to or diminish the narrative by any circumstance whether more or less material but simply rehearse as i heard it a story of supernatural terror  about the end of the american war when the officers of lord cornwalliss army which surrendered at yorktown and others who had been made prisoners during the impolitic and illfated controversy were returning to their own country to relate their adventures and repose themselves after their fatigues there was amongst them a general officer to whom miss s gave the name of browne but merely as i understood to save the inconvenience of introducing a nameless agent in the narrative he was an officer of merit as well as a gentleman of high consideration for family and attainments  some business had carried general browne upon a tour through the western counties when in the conclusion of a morning stage he found himself in the vicinity of a small country town which presented a scene of uncommon beauty and of a character peculiarly english  the little town with its stately old church whose tower bore testimony to the devotion of ages long past lay amidst pastures and cornfields of small extent but bounded and divided with hedgerow timber of great age and size there were few marks of modern improvement the environs of the place intimated neither the solitude of decay nor the bustle of novelty the houses were old but in good repair and the beautiful little river murmured freely on its way to the left of the town neither restrained by a dam nor bordered by a towingpath  upon a gentle eminence nearly a mile to the southward of the town were seen amongst many venerable oaks and tangled thickets the turrets of a castle as old as the walls of york and lancaster but which seemed to have received important alterations during the age of elizabeth and her successor it had not been a place of great size but whatever accommodation it formerly afforded was it must be supposed still to be obtained within its walls at least such was the inference which general browne drew from observing the smoke arise merrily from several of the ancient wreathed and carved chimneystalks the wall of the park ran alongside of the highway for two or three hundred yards and through the different points by which the eye found glimpses into the woodland scenery it seemed to be well stocked other points of view opened in successionnow a full one of the front of the old castle and now a side glimpse at its particular towers the former rich in all the bizarrerie of the elizabethan school while the simple and solid strength of other parts of the building seemed to show that they had been raised more for defence than ostentation  delighted with the partial glimpses which he obtained of the castle through the woods and glades by which this ancient feudal fortress was surrounded our military traveller was determined to inquire whether it might not deserve a nearer view and whether it contained family pictures or other objects of curiosity worthy of a strangers visit when leaving the vicinity of the park he rolled through a clean and wellpaved street and stopped at the door of a wellfrequented inn  before ordering horses to proceed on his journey general browne made inquiries concerning the proprietor of the chateau which had so attracted his admiration and was equally surprised and pleased at hearing in reply a nobleman named whom we shall call lord woodville how fortunate much of brownes early recollections both at school and at college had been connected with young woodville whom by a few questions he now ascertained to be the same with the owner of this fair domain he had been raised to the peerage by the decease of his father a few months before and as the general learned from the landlord the term of mourning being ended was now taking possession of his paternal estate in the jovial season of merry autumn accompanied by a select party of friends to enjoy the sports of a country famous for game  this was delightful news to our traveller frank woodville had been richard brownes fag at eton and his chosen intimate at christ church their pleasures and their tasks had been the same and the honest soldiers heart warmed to find his early friend in possession of so delightful a residence and of an estate as the landlord assured him with a nod and a wink fully adequate to maintain and add to his dignity nothing was more natural than that the traveller should suspend a journey which there was nothing to render hurried to pay a visit to an old friend under such agreeable circumstances  the fresh horses therefore had only the brief task of conveying the generals travelling carriage to woodville castle a porter admitted them at a modern gothic lodge built in that style to correspond with the castle itself and at the same time rang a bell to give warning of the approach of visitors apparently the sound of the bell had suspended the separation of the company bent on the various amusements of the morning for on entering the court of the chateau several young men were lounging about in their sporting dresses looking at and criticizing the dogs which the keepers held in readiness to attend their pastime as general browne alighted the young lord came to the gate of the hall and for an instant gazed as at a stranger upon the countenance of his friend on which war with its fatigues and its wounds had made a great alteration but the uncertainty lasted no longer than till the visitor had spoken and the hearty greeting which followed was such as can only be exchanged betwixt those who have passed together the merry days of careless boyhood or early youth  if i could have formed a wish my dear browne said lord woodville it would have been to have you here of all men upon this occasion which my friends are good enough to hold as a sort of holiday do not think you have been unwatched during the years you have been absent from us i have traced you through your dangers your triumphs your misfortunes and was delighted to see that whether in victory or defeat the name of my old friend was always distinguished with applause  the general made a suitable reply and congratulated his friend on his new dignities and the possession of a place and domain so beautiful  nay you have seen nothing of it as yet said lord woodville and i trust you do not mean to leave us till you are better acquainted with it it is true i confess that my present party is pretty large and the old house like other places of the kind does not possess so much accommodation as the extent of the outward walls appears to promise but we can give you a comfortable oldfashioned room and i venture to suppose that your campaigns have taught you to be glad of worse quarters  the general shrugged his shoulders and laughed i presume he said the worst apartment in your chateau is considerably superior to the old tobaccocask in which i was fain to take up my nights lodging when i was in the bush as the virginians call it with the light corps there i lay like diogenes himself so delighted with my covering from the elements that i made a vain attempt to have it rolled on to my next quarters but my commander for the time would give way to no such luxurious provision and i took farewell of my beloved cask with tears in my eyes  well then since you do not fear your quarters said lord woodville you will stay with me a week at least of guns dogs fishingrods flies and means of sport by sea and land we have enough and to spareyou cannot pitch on an amusement but we will find the means of pursuing it but if you prefer the gun and pointers i will go with you myself and see whether you have mended your shooting since you have been amongst the indians of the back settlements  the general gladly accepted his friendly hosts proposal in all its points after a morning of manly exercise the company met at dinner where it was the delight of lord woodville to conduce to the display of the high properties of his recovered friend so as to recommend him to his guests most of whom were persons of distinction he led general browne to speak of the scenes he had witnessed and as every word marked alike the brave officer and the sensible man who retained possession of his cool judgment under the most imminent dangers the company looked upon the soldier with general respect as on one who had proved himself possessed of an uncommon portion of personal couragethat attribute of all others of which everybody desires to be thought possessed  the day at woodville castle ended as usual in such mansions the hospitality stopped within the limits of good order music in which the young lord was a proficient succeeded to the circulation of the bottle cards and billiards for those who preferred such amusements were in readiness but the exercise of the morning required early hours and not long after eleven oclock the guests began to retire to their several apartments  the young lord himself conducted his friend general browne to the chamber destined for him which answered the description he had given of it being comfortable but oldfashioned the bed was of the massive form used in the end of the seventeenth century and the curtains of faded silk heavily trimmed with tarnished gold but then the sheets pillows and blankets looked delightful to the campaigner when he thought of his mansion the cask there was an air of gloom in the tapestry hangings which with their wornout graces curtained the walls of the little chamber and gently undulated as the autumnal breeze found its way through the ancient lattice window which pattered and whistled as the air gained entrance the toilet too with its mirror turbaned after the manner of the beginning of the century with a coiffure of murreycoloured silk and its hundred strangeshaped boxes providing for arrangements which had been obsolete for more than fifty years had an antique and in so far a melancholy aspect but nothing could blaze more brightly and cheerfully than the two large wax candles or if aught could rival them it was the flaming bickering fagots in the chimney that sent at once their gleam and their warmth through the snug apartment which notwithstanding the general antiquity of its appearance was not wanting in the least convenience that modern habits rendered either necessary or desirable  this is an oldfashioned sleeping apartment general said the young lord but i hope you find nothing that makes you envy your old tobaccocask  i am not particular respecting my lodgings replied the general yet were i to make any choice i would prefer this chamber by many degrees to the gayer and more modern rooms of your family mansion believe me that when i unite its modern air of comfort with its venerable antiquity and recollect that it is your lordships property i shall feel in better quarters here than if i were in the best hotel london could afford  i trusti have no doubtthat you will find yourself as comfortable as i wish you my dear general said the young nobleman and once more bidding his guest goodnight he shook him by the hand and withdrew  the general once more looked round him and internally congratulating himself on his return to peaceful life the comforts of which were endeared by the recollection of the hardships and dangers he had lately sustained undressed himself and prepared for a luxurious nights rest  here contrary to the custom of this species of tale we leave the general in possession of his apartment until the next morning  the company assembled for breakfast at an early hour but without the appearance of general browne who seemed the guest that lord woodville was desirous of honouring above all whom his hospitality had assembled around him he more than once expressed surprise at the generals absence and at length sent a servant to make inquiry after him the man brought back information that general browne had been walking abroad since an early hour of the morning in defiance of the weather which was misty and ungenial  the custom of a soldier said the young nobleman to his friends many of them acquire habitual vigilance and cannot sleep after the early hour at which their duty usually commands them to be alert  yet the explanation which lord woodville thus offered to the company seemed hardly satisfactory to his own mind and it was in a fit of silence and abstraction that he waited the return of the general it took place near an hour after the breakfast bell had rung he looked fatigued and feverish his hair the powdering and arrangement of which was at this time one of the most important occupations of a mans whole day and marked his fashion as much as in the present time the tying of a cravat or the want of one was dishevelled uncurled void of powder and dank with dew his clothes were huddled on with a careless negligence remarkable in a military man whose real or supposed duties are usually held to include some attention to the toilet and his looks were haggard and ghastly in a peculiar degree  so you have stolen a march upon us this morning my dear general said lord woodville or you have not found your bed so much to your mind as i had hoped and you seemed to expect how did you rest last night  oh excellently well remarkably well never better in my life said general browne rapidly and yet with an air of embarrassment which was obvious to his friend he then hastily swallowed a cup of tea and neglecting or refusing whatever else was offered seemed to fall into a fit of abstraction  you will take the gun today general said his friend and host but had to repeat the question twice ere he received the abrupt answer no my lord i am sorry i cannot have the opportunity of spending another day with your lordship my post horses are ordered and will be here directly  all who were present showed surprise and lord woodville immediately replied post horses my good friend what can you possibly want with them when you promised to stay with me quietly for at least a week  i believe said the general obviously much embarrassed that i might in the pleasure of my first meeting with your lordship have said something about stopping here a few days but i have since found it altogether impossible  that is very extraordinary answered the young nobleman you seemed quite disengaged yesterday and you cannot have had a summons today for our post has not come up from the town and therefore you cannot have received any letters  general browne without giving any further explanation muttered something about indispensable business and insisted on the absolute necessity of his departure in a manner which silenced all opposition on the part of his host who saw that his resolution was taken and forbore all further importunity  at least however he said permit me my dear browne since go you will or must to show you the view from the terrace which the mist that is now rising will soon display  he threw open a sashwindow and stepped down upon the terrace as he spoke the general followed him mechanically but seemed little to attend to what his host was saying as looking across an extended and rich prospect he pointed out the different objects worthy of observation thus they moved on till lord woodville had attained his purpose of drawing his guest entirely apart from the rest of the company when turning round upon him with an air of great solemnity he addressed him thus  richard browne my old and very dear friend we are now alone let me conjure you to answer me upon the word of a friend and the honour of a soldier how did you in reality rest during last night  most wretchedly indeed my lord answered the general in the same tone of solemnityso miserably that i would not run the risk of such a second night not only for all the lands belonging to this castle but for all the country which i see from this elevated point of view  this is most extraordinary said the young lord as if speaking to himself then there must be something in the reports concerning that apartment again turning to the general he said for gods sake my dear friend be candid with me and let me know the disagreeable particulars which have befallen you under a roof where with consent of the owner you should have met nothing save comfort  the general seemed distressed by this appeal and paused a moment before he replied my dear lord he at length said what happened to me last night is of a nature so peculiar and so unpleasant that i could hardly bring myself to detail it even to your lordship were it not that independent of my wish to gratify any request of yours i think that sincerity on my part may lead to some explanation about a circumstance equally painful and mysterious to others the communication i am about to make might place me in the light of a weakminded superstitious fool who suffered his own imagination to delude and bewilder him but you have known me in childhood and youth and will not suspect me of having adopted in manhood the feelings and frailties from which my early years were free here he paused and his friend replied  do not doubt my perfect confidence in the truth of your communication however strange it may be replied lord woodville i know your firmness of disposition too well to suspect you could be made the object of imposition and am aware that your honour and your friendship will equally deter you from exaggerating whatever you may have witnessed  well then said the general i will proceed with my story as well as i can relying upon your candour and yet distinctly feeling that i would rather face a battery than recall to my mind the odious recollections of last night  he paused a second time and then perceiving that lord woodville remained silent and in an attitude of attention he commenced though not without obvious reluctance the history of his nights adventures in the tapestried chamber  i undressed and went to bed so soon as your lordship left me yesterday evening but the wood in the chimney which nearly fronted my bed blazed brightly and cheerfully and aided by a hundred exciting recollections of my childhood and youth which had been recalled by the unexpected pleasure of meeting your lordship prevented me from falling immediately asleep i ought however to say that these reflections were all of a pleasant and agreeable kind grounded on a sense of having for a time exchanged the labour fatigues and dangers of my profession for the enjoyments of a peaceful life and the reunion of those friendly and affectionate ties which i had torn asunder at the rude summons of war  while such pleasing reflections were stealing over my mind and gradually lulling me to slumber i was suddenly aroused by a sound like that of the rustling of a silken gown and the tapping of a pair of highheeled shoes as if a woman were walking in the apartment ere i could draw the curtain to see what the matter was the figure of a little woman passed between the bed and the fire the back of this form was turned to me and i could observe from the shoulders and neck it was that of an old woman whose dress was an oldfashioned gown which i think ladies call a sacquethat is a sort of robe completely loose in the body but gathered into broad plaits upon the neck and shoulders which fall down to the ground and terminate in a species of train  i thought the intrusion singular enough but never harboured for a moment the idea that what i saw was anything more than the mortal form of some old woman about the establishment who had a fancy to dress like her grandmother and who having perhaps as your lordship mentioned that you were rather straitened for room been dislodged from her chamber for my accommodation had forgotten the circumstance and returned by twelve to her old haunt under this persuasion i moved myself in bed and coughed a little to make the intruder sensible of my being in possession of the premises she turned slowly round but gracious heaven my lord what a countenance did she display to me there was no longer any question what she was or any thought of her being a living being upon a face which wore the fixed features of a corpse were imprinted the traces of the vilest and most hideous passions which had animated her while she lived the body of some atrocious criminal seemed to have been given up from the grave and the soul restored from the penal fire in order to form for a space a union with the ancient accomplice of its guilt i started up in bed and sat upright supporting myself on my palms as i gazed on this horrible spectre the hag made as it seemed a single and swift stride to the bed where i lay and squatted herself down upon it in precisely the same attitude which i had assumed in the extremity of horror advancing her diabolical countenance within half a yard of mine with a grin which seemed to intimate the malice and the derision of an incarnate fiend  here general browne stopped and wiped from his brow the cold perspiration with which the recollection of his horrible vision had covered it  my lord he said i am no coward i have been in all the mortal dangers incidental to my profession and i may truly boast that no man ever knew richard browne dishonour the sword he wears but in these horrible circumstances under the eyes and as it seemed almost in the grasp of an incarnation of an evil spirit all firmness forsook me all manhood melted from me like wax in the furnace and i felt my hair individually bristle the current of my lifeblood ceased to flow and i sank back in a swoon as very a victim to panic terror as ever was a village girl or a child of ten years old how long i lay in this condition i cannot pretend to guess  but i was roused by the castle clock striking one so loud that it seemed as if it were in the very room it was some time before i dared open my eyes lest they should again encounter the horrible spectacle when however i summoned courage to look up she was no longer visible my first idea was to pull my bell wake the servants and remove to a garret or a hayloft to be ensured against a second visitation nay i will confess the truth that my resolution was altered not by the shame of exposing myself but by the fear that as the bellcord hung by the chimney i might in making my way to it be again crossed by the fiendish hag who i figured to myself might be still lurking about some corner of the apartment  i will not pretend to describe what hot and cold feverfits tormented me for the rest of the night through broken sleep weary vigils and that dubious state which forms the neutral ground between them a hundred terrible objects appeared to haunt me but there was the great difference betwixt the vision which i have described and those which followed that i knew the last to be deceptions of my own fancy and overexcited nerves  day at last appeared and i rose from my bed ill in health and humiliated in mind i was ashamed of myself as a man and a soldier and still more so at feeling my own extreme desire to escape from the haunted apartment which however conquered all other considerations so that huddling on my clothes with the most careless haste i made my escape from your lordships mansion to seek in the open air some relief to my nervous system shaken as it was by this horrible rencounter with a visitant for such i must believe her from the other world your lordship has now heard the cause of my discomposure and of my sudden desire to leave your hospitable castle in other places i trust we may often meet but god protect me from ever spending a second night under that roof  strange as the generals tale was he spoke with such a deep air of conviction that it cut short all the usual commentaries which are made on such stories lord woodville never once asked him if he was sure he did not dream of the apparition or suggested any of the possibilities by which it is fashionable to explain supernatural appearances as wild vagaries of the fancy or deceptions of the optic nerves on the contrary he seemed deeply impressed with the truth and reality of what he had heard and after a considerable pause regretted with much appearance of sincerity that his early friend should in his house have suffered so severely  i am the more sorry for your pain my dear browne he continued that it is the unhappy though most unexpected result of an experiment of my own you must know that for my father and grandfathers time at least the apartment which was assigned to you last night had been shut on account of reports that it was disturbed by supernatural sights and noises when i came a few weeks since into possession of the estate i thought the accommodation which the castle afforded for my friends was not extensive enough to permit the inhabitants of the invisible world to retain possession of a comfortable sleeping apartment i therefore caused the tapestried chamber as we call it to be opened and without destroying its air of antiquity i had such new articles of furniture placed in it as became the modern times yet as the opinion that the room was haunted very strongly prevailed among the domestics and was also known in the neighbourhood and to many of my friends i feared some prejudice might be entertained by the first occupant of the tapestried chamber which might tend to revive the evil report which it had laboured under and so disappoint my purpose of rendering it a useful part or the house i must confess my dear browne that your arrival yesterday agreeable to me for a thousand reasons besides seemed the most favourable opportunity of removing the unpleasant rumours which attached to the room since your courage was indubitable and your mind free of any preoccupation on the subject i could not therefore have chosen a more fitting subject for my experiment  upon my life said general browne somewhat hastily i am infinitely obliged to your lordshipvery particularly indebted indeed i am likely to remember for some time the consequences of the experiment as your lordship is pleased to call it  nay now you are unjust my dear friend said lord woodville you have only to reflect for a single moment in order to be convinced that i could not augur the possibility of the pain to which you have been so unhappily exposed i was yesterday morning a complete sceptic on the subject of supernatural appearances nay i am sure that had i told you what was said about that room those very reports would have induced you by your own choice to select it for your accommodation it was my misfortune perhaps my error but really cannot be termed my fault that you have been afflicted so strangely  strangely indeed said the general resuming his good temper and i acknowledge that i have no right to be offended with your lordship for treating me like what i used to think myselfa man of some firmness and courage but i see my post horses are arrived and i must not detain your lordship from your amusement  nay my old friend said lord woodville since you cannot stay with us another daywhich indeed i can no longer urgegive me at least half an hour more you used to love pictures and i have a gallery of portraits some of them by vandyke representing ancestry to whom this property and castle formerly belonged i think that several of them will strike you as possessing merit  general browne accepted the invitation though somewhat unwillingly it was evident he was not to breathe freely or at ease till he left woodville castle far behind him he could not refuse his friends invitation however and the less so that he was a little ashamed of the peevishness which he had displayed towards his wellmeaning entertainer  the general therefore followed lord woodville through several rooms into a long gallery hung with pictures which the latter pointed out to his guest telling the names and giving some account of the personages whose portraits presented themselves in progression general browne was but little interested in the details which these accounts conveyed to him they were indeed of the kind which are usually found in an old family gallery here was a cavalier who had ruined the estate in the royal cause there a fine lady who had reinstated it by contracting a match with a wealthy roundhead there hung a gallant who had been in danger for corresponding with the exiled court at saint germains here one who had taken arms for william at the revolution and there a third that had thrown his weight alternately into the scale of whig and tory  while lord woodville was cramming these words into his guests ear against the stomach of his sense they gained the middle of the gallery when he beheld general browne suddenly start and assume an attitude of the utmost surprise not unmixed with fear as his eyes were suddenly caught and riveted by a portrait of an old lady in a sacque the fashionable dress of the end of the seventeenth century  there she is he exclaimedthere she is in form and features though inferior in demoniac expression to the accursed hag who visited me last night  if that be the case said the young nobleman there can remain no longer any doubt of the horrible reality of your apparition that is the picture of a wretched ancestress of mine of whose crimes a black and fearful catalogue is recorded in a family history in my charterchest the recital of them would be too horrible it is enough to say that in yon fatal apartment incest and unnatural murder were committed i will restore it to the solitude to which the better judgment of those who preceded me had consigned it and never shall any one so long as i can prevent it be exposed to a repetition of the supernatural horrors which could shake such courage as yours  thus the friends who had met with such glee parted in a very different moodlord woodville to command the tapestried chamber to be unmantled and the door built up and general browne to seek in some less beautiful country and with some less dignified friend forgetfulness of the painful night which he had passed in woodville castle  end of the tapestried chamber        death of the lairds jock  by sir walter scott   the manner in which this trifle was introduced at the time to mr f m reynolds editor of the keepsake of 1828 leaves no occasion for a preface  august 1831   to the editor of the keepsake  you have asked me sir to point out a subject for the pencil and i feel the difficulty of complying with your request although i am not certainly unaccustomed to literary composition or a total stranger to the stores of history and tradition which afford the best copies for the painters art but although sicut pictura poesis is an ancient and undisputed axiomalthough poetry and painting both address themselves to the same object of exciting the human imagination by presenting to it pleasing or sublime images of ideal scenesyet the one conveying itself through the ears to the understanding and the other applying itself only to the eyes the subjects which are best suited to the bard or taleteller are often totally unfit for painting where the artist must present in a single glance all that his art has power to tell us the artist can neither recapitulate the past nor intimate the future the single now is all which he can present and hence unquestionably many subjects which delight us in poetry or in narrative whether real or fictitious cannot with advantage be transferred to the canvas  being in some degree aware of these difficulties though doubtless unacquainted both with their extent and the means by which they may be modified or surmounted i have nevertheless ventured to draw up the following traditional narrative as a story in which when the general details are known the interest is so much concentrated in one strong moment of agonizing passion that it can be understood and sympathized with at a single glance i therefore presume that it may be acceptable as a hint to some one among the numerous artists who have of late years distinguished themselves as rearing up and supporting the british school  enough has been said and sung about    the wellcontested ground   the warlike borderland  to render the habits of the tribes who inhabited it before the union of england and scotland familiar to most of your readers the rougher and sterner features of their character were softened by their attachment to the fine arts from which has arisen the saying that on the frontiers every dale had its battle and every river its song a rude species of chivalry was in constant use and single combats were practised as the amusement of the few intervals of truce which suspended the exercise of war the inveteracy of this custom may be inferred from the following incident  bernard gilpin the apostle of the north the first who undertook to preach the protestant doctrines to the border dalesmen was surprised on entering one of their churches to see a gauntlet or mailglove hanging above the altar upon inquiring the meaning of a symbol so indecorous being displayed in that sacred place he was informed by the clerk that the glove was that of a famous swordsman who hung it there as an emblem of a general challenge and gage of battle to any who should dare to take the fatal token down reach it to me said the reverend churchman the clerk and the sexton equally declined the perilous office and the good bernard gilpin was obliged to remove the glove with his own hands desiring those who were present to inform the champion that he and no other had possessed himself of the gage of defiance but the champion was as much ashamed to face bernard gilpin as the officials of the church had been to displace his pledge of combat  the date of the following story is about the latter years of queen elizabeths reign and the events took place in liddesdale a hilly and pastoral district of roxburghshire which on a part of its boundary is divided from england only by a small river  during the good old times of rugging and rivingthat is tugging and tearingunder which term the disorderly doings of the warlike age are affectionately remembered this valley was principally cultivated by the sept or clan of the armstrongs the chief of this warlike race was the laird of mangerton at the period of which i speak the estate of mangerton with the power and dignity of chief was possessed by john armstrong a man of great size strength and courage while his father was alive he was distinguished from others of his clan who bore the same name by the epithet of the lairds jockthat is to say the lairds son jock or jack this name he distinguished by so many bold and desperate achievements that he retained it even after his fathers death and is mentioned under it both in authentic records and in tradition some of his feats are recorded in the minstrelsy of the scottish border and others are mentioned in contemporary chronicles  at the species of singular combat which we have described the lairds jock was unrivalled and no champion of cumberland westmoreland or northumberland could endure the sway of the huge twohanded sword which he wielded and which few others could even lift this awful sword as the common people term it was as dear to him as durindana or fushberta to their respective masters and was nearly as formidable to his enemies as those renowned falchions proved to the foes of christendom the weapon had been bequeathed to him by a celebrated english outlaw named hobbie noble who having committed some deed for which he was in danger from justice fled to liddesdale and became a follower or rather a brotherinarms to the renowned lairds jock till venturing into england with a small escort a faithless guide and with a light singlehanded sword instead of his ponderous brand hobbie noble attacked by superior numbers was made prisoner and executed  with this weapon and by means of his own strength and address the lairds jock maintained the reputation of the best swordsman on the border side and defeated or slew many who ventured to dispute with him the formidable title  but years pass on with the strong and the brave as with the feeble and the timid in process of time the lairds jock grew incapable of wielding his weapons and finally of all active exertion even of the most ordinary kind the disabled champion became at length totally bedridden and entirely dependent for his comfort on the pious duties of an only daughter his perpetual attendant and companion  besides this dutiful child the lairds jock had an only son upon whom devolved the perilous task of leading the clan to battle and maintaining the warlike renown of his native country which was now disputed by the english upon many occasions the young armstrong was active brave and strong and brought home from dangerous adventures many tokens of decided success still the ancient chief conceived as it would seem that his son was scarce yet entitled by age and experience to be entrusted with the twohanded sword by the use of which he had himself been so dreadfully distinguished  at length an english champion one of the name of foster if i rightly recollect had the audacity to send a challenge to the best swordsman in liddesdale and young armstrong burning for chivalrous distinction accepted the challenge  the heart of the disabled old man swelled with joy when he heard that the challenge was passed and accepted and the meeting fixed at a neutral spot used as the place of rencontre upon such occasions and which he himself had distinguished by numerous victories he exulted so much in the conquest which he anticipated that to nerve his son to still bolder exertions he conferred upon him as champion of his clan and province the celebrated weapon which he had hitherto retained in his own custody  this was not all when the day of combat arrived the lairds jock in spite of his daughters affectionate remonstrances determined though he had not left his bed for two years to be a personal witness of the duel his will was still a law to his people who bore him on their shoulders wrapped in plaids and blankets to the spot where the combat was to take place and seated him on a fragment of rock which is still called the lairds jocks stone there he remained with eyes fixed on the lists or barrier within which the champions were about to meet his daughter having done all she could for his accommodation stood motionless beside him divided between anxiety for his health and for the event of the combat to her beloved brother ere yet the fight began the old men gazed on their chief now seen for the first time after several years and sadly compared his altered features and wasted frame with the paragon of strength and manly beauty which they once remembered the young men gazed on his large form and powerful make as upon some antediluvian giant who had survived the destruction of the flood  but the sound of the trumpets on both sides recalled the attention of every one to the lists surrounded as they were by numbers of both nations eager to witness the event of the day the combatants met in the lists it is needless to describe the struggle the scottish champion fell foster placing his foot on his antagonist seized on the redoubted sword so precious in the eyes of its aged owner and brandished it over his head as a trophy of his conquest the english shouted in triumph but the despairing cry of the aged champion who saw his country dishonoured and his sword long the terror of their race in the possession of an englishman was heard high above the acclamations of victory he seemed for an instant animated by all his wonted power for he started from the rock on which he sat and while the garments with which he had been invested fell from his wasted frame and showed the ruins of his strength he tossed his arms wildly to heaven and uttered a cry of indignation horror and despair which tradition says was heard to a preternatural distance and resembled the cry of a dying lion more than a human sound  his friends received him in their arms as he sank utterly exhausted by the effort and bore him back to his castle in mute sorrow while his daughter at once wept for her brother and endeavoured to mitigate and soothe the despair of her father but this was impossible the old mans only tie to life was rent rudely asunder and his heart had broken with it the death of his son had no part in his sorrow if he thought of him at all it was as the degenerate boy through whom the honour of his country and clan had been lost and he died in the course of three days never even mentioning his name but pouring out unintermitted lamentations for the loss of his noble sword  i conceive that the moment when the disabled chief was roused into a last exertion by the agony of the moment is favourable to the object of a painter he might obtain the full advantage of contrasting the form of the rugged old man in the extremity of furious despair with the softness and beauty of the female form the fatal field might be thrown into perspective so as to give full effect to these two principal figures and with the single explanation that the piece represented a soldier beholding his son slain and the honour of his country lost the picture would be sufficiently intelligible at the first glance if it was thought necessary to show more clearly the nature of the conflict it might be indicated by the pennon of saint george being displayed at one end of the lists and that of saint andrew at the other  i remain sir  your obedient servant  the author of waverley
