34719615	collection  of  ancient and modern  british authors  vol cxliv       a  residence in france  with an  excursion up the rhine  and a  second visit to switzerland  by j fenimore cooper esq  author of the pilot the spy c   paris  baudrys european library  rue du coq near the louvre  sold also by amyot rue de la paix truchy boulevard des italiens  theophile barrois jun rue richelieu librairie des etrangers  rue neuvesaintaugustin and heideloff and campe  rue vivienne  1836     preface  the introduction to part i of the sketches of switzerland leaves very little for the author to say in addition the reader will be prepared to meet with a long digression that touches on the situation and interests of another country and it is probable he will understand the authors motive for thus embracing matter that is not strictly connected with the principal subject of the work  the first visit of the writer to switzerland was paid in 1828 that which is related in these two volumes in 1832 while four years had made no changes in the sublime nature of the region they had seriously affected the political condition of all europe they had also produced a variance of feeling and taste in the author that is the unavoidable consequences of time and experience four years in europe are an age to the american as are four years in america to the european jefferson has somewhere said that no american ought to be more than five years at a time out of his own country lest he get behind it this may be true as to its facts but the author is convinced that there is more danger of his getting before it as to opinion it is not improbable that this book may furnish evidence of both these truths  some one in criticising the first part of switzerland has intimated that the writer has a purpose to serve with the trades unions by the purport of some of his remarks as this is a country in which the avowal of a tolerably sordid and base motive seems to be indispensable even to safety the writer desires to express his sense of the critics liberality as it may save him from a much graver imputation  there is really a painful humiliation in the reflection that a citizen of mature years with as good natural and accidental means for preferment as have fallen to the share of most others may pass his life without a fact of any sort to impeach his disinterestedness and yet not be able to express a generous or just sentiment in behalf of his fellowcreatures without laying himself open to suspicions that are as degrading to those who entertain them as they are injurious to all

lafayettethe juste milieumonarchy not inconsistent with republican institutionsparty in favour of the duc de bordeaux   paris february 1832  dear   your speculations concerning the influence of the late revolution on the social habits of the french are more ingenious than true while the mass of this nation has obtained less than they had a right to expect by the severe political convulsions they have endured during the last forty years they have notwithstanding gained something in their rights and what is of far more importance they have gained in a better appreciation of those rights as well as in the knowledge of the means to turn them to a profitable and practical account the end will show essential improvements in their condition or rather the present time shows it already the change in polite society has been less favourable although even this is slowly gaining in morals and in a healthier tone of thought no error can be greater than that of believing france has endured so much without a beneficial return  in making up my opinions of the old regime i have had constant recourse to general lafayette for information the conversations and anecdotes already sent you will have prepared you for the fine tone and perfect candour with which he speaks even of his bitterest enemies nor can i remember in the many confidential and frank communications with which i have been favoured a single instance where there has been the smallest reason to suspect he has viewed men through the medium of personal antipathies and prejudices the candour and simplicity of his opinions form beautiful features in his character and the bienséance of his mind if one may use such an expression throws a polish over his harshest strictures that is singularly adapted to obtain credit for his judgment  your desire to know more of the private life of this extraordinary man is quite natural but he has been so long before the public that it is not easy to say anything new i may however give you a trait or two to amuse you  i have seen more of him this winter than the last owing to the circumstance of a committee of americans that have been appointed to administer succour to the exiled poles meeting weekly at my house and it is rare indeed that he is not present on these benevolent occasions he has discontinued his own soirées too and having fewer demands on his time through official avocations i gain admittance to him during his simple and quiet dinners whenever it is asked  these dinners indeed are our usual hours of meeting for the occupations of the general in the chamber usually keep him engaged in the morning nor am i commonly at leisure myself until about this hour of the day in paris every one dines nominally at six but the deputies being often detained a little later whenever i wish to see him i hurry from my own table and generally reach the rue danjou in sufficient season to find him still at his  on quitting the hôtel de letat major after being dismissed so unceremoniously from the command of the national guard lafayette returned to his own neat but simple lodgings in the rue danjou the hotel itself is one of some pretensions but his apartments though quite sufficient for a single person are not among the best it contains lying on the street which is rarely or never the case with the principal rooms the passage to them communicates with the great staircase and the door is one of those simple retired entrances that in paris so frequently open on the abodes of some of the most illustrious men of the age here have i seen princes marshals and dignitaries of all degrees ringing for admission no one appearing to think of aught but the great man within these things are permitted here where the mind gets accustomed to weigh in the balance all the different claims to distinction but it would scarcely do in a country in which the pursuit of money is the sole and engrossing concern of life a show of expenditure becoming necessary to maintain it  the apartments of lafayette consist of a large antechamber two salons and an inner room where he usually sits and writes and in which of late he has had his bed these rooms are en suite and communicate laterally with one or two more and the offices his sole attendants in town are the german valet named bastien who accompanied him in his last visit to america the footman who attends him with the carriage and the coachman there may be a cook but i never saw a female in the apartments neither wears a livery although all his appointments carriages horses and furniture are those of a gentleman one thing has struck me as a little singular notwithstanding his strong attachment to america and to her usages lafayette while the practice is getting to be common in paris has not adopted the use of carpets i do not remember to have seen one at la grange or in town  when i show myself at the door bastien who usually acts as porter and who has become quite a diplomatist in these matters makes a sign of assent and intimates that the general is at dinner of late he commonly dispenses with the ceremony of letting it be known who has come but i am at once ushered into the bedroom here i find lafayette seated at a table just large enough to contain one cover and a single dish or a table in other words so small as to be covered with a napkin his little white lapdog is his only companion as it is always understood that i have dined no ceremony is used but i take a seat at the chimney corner while he goes on with his dinner his meals are quite frugal though good a poulet rôti invariably making one dish there are two or three removes a dish at a time and the dinner usually concludes with some preserves or dried fruits especially dates of which he is extremely fond i generally come in for one or two of the latter  all this time the conversation is on what has transpired in the chambers during the day the politics of europe nullification in america or the gossip of the chateau of which he is singularly well informed though he has ceased to go there  the last of these informal interviews with general lafayette was one of peculiar interest i generally sit but half an hour leaving him to go to his evening engagements which by the way are not frequent but on this occasion he told me to remain and i passed nearly two hours with him  we chatted a good deal of the state of society under the old regime curious to know his opinions of their private characters i asked a good many questions concerning the royal family louis xvi he described as awellmeaning man addicted a little too much to the pleasures of the table but who would have done well enough had he not been surrounded by bad advisers i was greatly surprised by one of his remarks louis xvi observed lafayette owed his death as much to the bad advice of gouverneur morris as to any one other thing you may be certain i did not let this opinion go unquestioned for on all other occasions in speaking of mr morris his language had been kind and even grateful he explained himself by adding that mr morris coming from a country like america was listened to with great respect and that on all occasions he gave his opinions against democracy advising resistance when resistance was not only too late but dangerous he did not call in question the motives of mr morris to which he did full justice but merely affirmed that he was a bad adviser he gave me to understand that the representatives of america had not always been faithful to the popular principle and even went into details that it would be improper for me to repeat i have mentioned this opinion of mr morris because his aristocratical sentiments were no secret because they were mingled with no expressions of personal severity and because i have heard them from other quarters he pronounced a strong eulogium on the conduct of mr crawford which he said was uniformly such as became an american minister  there is nothing however novel in these instances of our representatives proving untrue to the prominent feeling of the country on the subject of popular rights it is the subject of very frequent comment in europe and sometimes of complaint on the part of those who are struggling for what they conceive to be their just privileges many of them having told me personally that our agents frequently stand materially in their way  louis xviii lafayette pronounced to be the falsest man he had ever met with to use his own expression lhomme le plus faux he gave him credit for a great deal of talent but added that his duplicity was innate and not the result of his position for it was known to his young associates in early youth and that they used to say among themselves as young men and in their ordinary gaieties that it would be unsafe to confide in the comte de provence  of charles x he spoke kindly giving him exactly a different character he thought him the most honest of the three brothers though quite unequal to the crisis in which he had been called to reign he believed him sincere in his religious professions and thought the charge of his being a professed jesuit by no means improbable  marie antoinette he thought an injured woman on the subject of her reputed gallantries he spoke cautiously premising that as an american i ought to make many allowances for a state of society that was altogether unknown in our country treating this matter with the discrimination of a man of the world and the delicacy of a gentleman he added that he entirely exonerated her from all of the coarse charges that had proceeded from vulgar clamour while he admitted that she had betrayed a partiality for a young swede1 that was at least indiscreet for one in her situation though he had no reason to believe her attachment had led her to the length of criminality  footnote 1 a count koningsmarke  i asked his opinion concerning the legitimacy of the duc de bordeaux but he treated the rumour to the contrary as one of those miserable devices to which men resort to effect the ends of party and as altogether unworthy of serious attention  i was amused with the simplicity with which he spoke of his own efforts to produce a change of government during the last reign on this subject he had been equally frank even before the recent revolution though there would have been a manifest impropriety in my repeating what had then passed between us this objection is now removed in part and i may recount one of his anecdotes though i can never impart to it the cool and quiet humour with which it was related we were speaking of the attempt of 1822 or the plot which existed in the army in reply to a question of mine he saidwell i was to have commanded in that revolution and when the time came i got into my carriage without a passport and drove across the country to  where i obtained posthorses and proceeded as fast as possible towards  at  a courier met me with the unhappy intelligence that our plot was discovered and that several of our principal agents were arrested i was advised to push for the frontier as fast as i could but we turned round in the road and i went to paris and took my seat in the chamber of deputies they looked very queer and a good deal surprised when they saw me and i believe they were in great hopes that i had run away the party of the ministers were loud in their accusations against the opposition for encouraging treason and perier and constant and the rest of them made indignant appeals against such unjust accusations i took a different course i went into the tribune and invited the ministers to come and give a history of my political life of my changes and treasons as they called them and said that when they had got through i would give the character and history of theirs this settled the matter for i heard no more from them i inquired if he had not felt afraid of being arrested and tried not much was his answer they knew i denied the right of foreigners to impose a government on france and they also knew they had not kept faith with france under the charter i made no secret of my principles and frequently put letters unsealed into the post office in which i had used the plainest language about the government on the whole i believe they were more afraid of me than i was of them  it is impossible to give an idea in writing of the pleasant manner he has of relating these thingsa manner that receives additional piquancy from his english which though good is necessarily broken he usually prefers the english in such conversations  by the way he suddenly asked me where was the idea of harvey birch in the spy found i told him that the thought had been obtained from an anecdote of the revolution related to me by governor jay some years before the book was written he laughingly remarked that he could have supplied the hero of a romance in the person of a negro named harry i believe though the name has escaped me who acted as a spy both for him and lord cornwallis during the time he commanded against that officer in virginia this negro he represented as being true to the american cause and as properly belonging to his service though permitted occasionally to act for lord cornwallis for the sake of gaining intelligence after the surrender of the latter he called on general lafayette to return a visit harry was in an anteroom cleaning his masters boots as lord cornwallis entered ha master harry exclaimed the latter you are here are you oh yes masser cornwallismuss try to do little for de country was the answer this negro he said was singularly clever and bold and of sterling patriotism  he made me laugh with a story that he said the english officers had told him of general knyphausen who commanded the hessian mercenaries in 1776 this officer a rigid martinet knew nothing of the sea and not much more of geography on the voyage between england and america he was in the ship of lord howe where he passed several uncomfortable weeks the fleet having an unusually long passage on account of the bad sailing of some of the transports at length knyphausen could contain himself no longer but marching stiffly up to the admiral one day he commenced withmy lord i know it is the duty of a soldier to be submissive at sea but being entrusted with the care of the troops of his serene highness my master i feel it my duty just to inquire if it be not possible that during some of the dark nights we have lately had we may have sailed past america  i asked him if he had been at the chateau lately his reply was very brief and expressive the king denies my account of the programme of the hôtel de ville and we stand in the position of two gentlemen who in substance have given each other the lie circumstances prevent our going to the bois de boulogne to exchange shots he added smiling but they also prevent our exchanging visits i then ventured to say that i had long foreseen what would be the result of the friendship of louisphilippe and for the first time in the course of our conversations i adverted to my own visit to the palace in his company an account of which i will extract for your benefit from my notebook2  footnote 2 the period referred to was in 1830                                       in the morning i received a note from general lafayette in which he informed me that mr mlane who is here on a visit from london was desirous of being presented that there was a reception in the evening at which he intended to introduce the minister to england mr rives not having yet received his new credentials and of course not appearing in matters of ceremony general lafayette pressed me so strongly to be of the party in compliment to mr mlane that though but an indifferent courtier and though such a visit was contrary to my quiet habits i could do nothing but comply  at the proper hour general lafayette had the good nature to call and take me up and we proceeded at once for mr mlane with this gentleman we drove to the palais royal my old brother officer mr t who was included in the arrangement following in his own carriage  we found the inner court crowded and a throng about the entrance to the great staircase but the appearance of lafayette cleared the way and there was a movement in the crowd which denoted his great personal popularity i heard the words des américains passing from one to another showing how completely he was identified with us and our principles in the public mind one or two of the younger officers of the court were at the foot of the stairs to receive him though whether their presence was accidental or designed i cannot say but i suspect the latter at all events the general was received with the profoundest respect and the most smiling assiduity  the antechamber was already crowded but following our leader his presence cleared the way for us until he got up quite near to the doors where some of the most distinguished men of france were collected i saw many in the throng whom i knew and the first minute or two were passed in nods of recognition my attention was however soon attracted to a dialogue between marshal soult and lafayette that was carried on with the most perfect bonhomie and simplicity i did not hear the commencement but found they were speaking of their legs which both seemed to think the worse for wear but you have been wounded in the leg monsieur observed lafayette this limb was a little mal traité at genoa returned the marshal looking down at a leg that had a very game look but you general you too were hurt in america oh that was nothing it happened more than fifty years ago and then it was in a good causeit was the fall and the fracture that made me limp just at this moment the great doors flew open and this quasi republican court standing arrayed before us the two old soldiers limped forward  the king stood near the door dressed as a general of the national guards entirely without decorations and pretty well tricoloured the queen madame adelaide the princesses and several of the children were a little farther removed the two former standing in front and the latter being grouped behind them but one or two ladies were present nor did i see anything at the commencement of the evening of the ducs dorléans and de nemours  lafayette was one of the first that entered and of course we kept near him the king advanced to meet him with an expression of pleasurei thought it studiedbut they shook hands quite cordially we were then presented by name and each of us had the honour of shaking hands if that can be considered an honour which fell to the share of quite half of those who entered the press was so great that there was no opportunity to say anything i believe we all met with the usual expressions of welcome and there the matter ended  soon after we approached the queen with whom our reception had a more measured manner most of those who entered did little more than make a distant bow to this group but the queen manifesting a desire to say something to our party mr mlane and myself approached them she first addressed my companion in french a language he did not speak and i was obliged to act as interpreter but the queen instantly said she understood english though she spoke it badly and begged he would address her in his own tongue madame adelaide seemed more familiar with our language but the conversation was necessarily short and not worth repeating  queen amélie is a woman of a kind and i think intelligent countenance she has the bourbon rather than the austrian outline of face she seemed anxious to please and in her general air and carriage has some resemblance to the duchess of st leu3 she has the reputation of being an excellent wife and mother and really not to fall too precipitately into the vice of a courtier she appears as if she may well deserve it she is thin but graceful and i can well imagine that she has been more than pretty in her youth  footnote 3 hortense  i do not remember a more frank intelligent and winning countenance than that of madame adelaide who is the kings sister she has little beauty left except that of expression but this must have made her handsome once as it renders her singularly attractive now her manner was less nervous than that of the queen and i should think her mind had more influence over her exterior  the princess louise the queen of belgium and the princess marie are pretty with the quiet subdued manner of wellbred young persons the first is pale has a strikingly bourbon face resembling the profiles on the french coins while the latter has an italian and classical outline of features with a fine colour  they were all dressed with great simplicity scarcely in high dinner dress the queen and madame adelaide wearing evening hats the princesses as is uniformly the case with unmarried french girls of rank were without any ornaments wearing their hair in the usual manner  after the ceremonies of being presented were gone through i amused myself with examining the company this was a levee not a drawingroom and there were no women among the visitors the men who did not appear in uniform were in common evening dress which has degenerated of late into black stocks and trousers  accident brought me next to an old man who had exactly that revolutionary air which has become so familiar to us by the engravings of bonaparte and his generals that were made shortly after the italian campaign the face was nearly buried in neckcloth the hair was long and wild and the coat was glittering but illfitting and stiff it was however the coat of a maréchal and what rendered it still more singular it was entirely without orders i was curious to know who this relic of 1797 might be for apart from his rank which was betrayed by his coat he was so singularly ugly as scarcely to appear human on inquiry it proved to be marshal jourdan  there was some amusement in watching the different individuals who came to pay their court to the new dynasty many were personally and familiarly known to me as very loyal subjects of the last reign soldiers who would not have hesitated to put louisphilippe au fil de lépée three months before at the command of charles x but times were changed they now came to show themselves to the new sovereign most of them to manifest their disposition to be put in the way of preferment some to reconnoitre others to conceal their disaffection and all to subserve their own interests it was laughably easy to discern who were confident of their reception by being of the ruling party who distrusted and who were indifferent the last class was small a general officer whom i personally knew looked like one who had found his way into a wrong house by mistake he was a bonapartist by his antecedents and in his true way of thinking but accident had thrown him into the hands of the bourbons and he had now come to see what might be gleaned from the house of orleans his reception was not flattering and i could only compare the indecision and wavering of his manner to that of a regiment that falters before an unexpected volley  after amusing ourselves some time in the great throng which was densest near the king we went towards a secondary circle that had formed in another part of the room where the duke of orleans had appeared he was conversing with lafayette who immediately presented us all in succession the prince is a genteel handsome young man with a face much more austrian than that of any of his family so far as one can judge of what his younger brothers are likely to be hereafter in form stature and movements he singularly resembles w and there is also a good deal of likeness in the face though in this particular the latter has the advantage he was often taken for the duc de chartres during our former residence at paris our reception was gracious the heir to the throne appearing anxious to please every one  the amusing part of the scene is to follow fatigued with standing we had got chairs in a corner of the room behind the throng where the discourtesy of being seated might escape notice the king soon after withdrew and the company immediately began to go away threefourths perhaps were gone when an aidedecamp came up to us and inquired if we were not the three americans who had been presented by general lafayette being answered in the affirmative he begged us to accompany him he led us near a door at the other end of the salle a room of great dimensions where we found general lafayette in waiting the aide or officer of the court whichever might be his station passed through the door out of which the king immediately came it appeared to me as if the general was not satisfied with our first reception and wished to have it done over again the king looked grave not to say discontented and i saw at a glance that he could have dispensed with this extra attention mr mlane standing next the door he addressed a few words to him in english which he speaks quite readily and without much accent indeed he said little to any one else and the few words that he did utter were exceedingly general and unmeaning once he got as far as t whom he asked if he came from new york and he looked hard at me who stood farther from the door mumbled something bowed to us all and withdrew i was struck with his manner which seemed vexed and unwilling and the whole thing appeared to me to be awkward and uncomfortable i thought it a bad omen for the influence of the general  by this time the great salle was nearly empty and we moved off together to find our carriages general lafayette preceded us of course and as he walked slowly and occasionally stopped to converse we were among the last in the antechamber in passing into the last or outer antechamber the general stopped nearly in the door to speak to some one mr mlane and mr t being at his side they so nearly stopped the way that i remained some distance in the rear in order not to close it entirely my position would give an ordinary observer reason to suppose that i did not belong to the party a young officer of the court i call them aides though i believe they were merely substitutes for chamberlains dignitaries to which this republican reign has not yet given birth was waiting in the outer room to pass but appeared unwilling to press too closely on a group of which general lafayette formed the principal person he fidgeted and chafed evidently but still kept politely at a distance after two or three minutes the party moved on but i remained stationary watching the result room was no sooner made than the officer brushed past and gave vent to his feelings by saying quite loudly and distinctly adieu lamérique  it is a pretty safe rule to believe that in the tone of courtiers is reflected the feeling of the monarch the attention to general lafayette had appeared to me as singularly affected and forced and the manner of the king anything but natural and several little occurrences during the evening had tended to produce the impression that the real influence of the former at the palace might be set down as next to nothing i never had any faith in a republican king from the commencement but this near view of the personal intercourse between the parties served to persuade me that general lafayette had been the dupe of his own good faith and kind feelings  in descending the great stairs i mentioned the occurrence just related to mr mlane adding that i thought the days of our friend were numbered and that a few months would produce a schism between him and louisphilippe everything at the moment however looked so smiling and so much outward respect was lavished on general lafayette that this opinion did not find favour with my listener though i believe he saw reason to think differently after another visit to court we all got invitations to dine at the palace in a day or two                                       i did not however touch upon the adieu lamérique with general lafayette which i have always deemed a subject too delicate to be mentioned  he startled me by suddenly putting the question whether i thought an executive in which there should be but one agent as in the united states or an executive in which there should be three or five would best suit the condition of france though so well acquainted with the boldness and steadiness of his views i was not prepared to find his mind dwelling on such a subject at the present moment the state of france however is certainly extremely critical and we ought not to be surprised at the rising of the people at any moment  i told general lafayette that in my poor judgment the question admitted of a good deal of controversy names did not signify much but every administration should receive its main impulses subject to the common wishes and interests from a close conformity of views whether there were one incumbent or a dozen the english system certainly made a near approach to a divided executive but the power was so distributed as to prevent much clashing and when things went wrong the ministers resigned parliament in effect holding the control of the executive as well as of the legislative branches of the government now i did not think france was prepared for such a polity the french being accustomed to see a real as well as a nominal monarch and the disposition to intrigue would for a long time to come render their administrations fluctuating and insecure a directory would either control the chambers or be controlled by them in the former case it would be apt to be divided in itself in the latter to agitate the chambers by factions that would not have the ordinary outlet of majorities to restore the equilibrium  he was of opinion himself that the expedient of a directory had not suited the state of france he asked me what i thought of universal suffrage for this country i told him i thought it altogether unsuited to the present condition of france i did not attach much faith to the old theory of the necessary connexion between virtue and democracy as a cause though it might with the necessary limitations follow as an effect a certain degree of knowledge of its uses action and objects was indispensable to a due exercise of the suffrage not that it was required every elector should be learned in the theory of governments but that he should know enough to understand the general connexion between his vote and his interests and especially his rights this knowledge was not at all difficult of attainment in ordinary cases when one had the means of coming at facts in cases that admit of argument as in all the questions on political economy i did not see that any reasonable degree of knowledge made the matter much better the cleverest men usually ranging themselves on the two extremes of all mooted questions concerning the right of every man who was qualified to use the power to have his interests directly represented in a government it was unnecessary to speak the only question being who had and who had not the means to make a safe use of the right in practice it followed from these views that the great desiderata were to ascertain what these means were  in the present state of the world i thought it absolutely necessary that a man should be able to read in order to exercise the right to vote with a prudent discretion in countries where everybody reads other qualifications might be trusted to provided they were low and within reasonable reach of the mass but in a country like france i would allow no man to vote until he knew how to read if he were as rich as croesus  i felt convinced the present system could not continue long in france it might do for a few years as a reaction but when things were restored to their natural course it would be found that there is an unnatural union between facts that are peculiar to despotism and facts that are peculiarly the adjuncts of liberty as in the provisions of the code napoleon and in the liberty of the press without naming a multitude of other discrepancies the juste milieu that he had so admirably described4 could not last long but the government would soon find itself driven into strong measures or into liberal measures in order to sustain itself men could no more serve god and mammon in politics than in religion i then related to him an anecdote that had occurred to myself the evening of the first anniversary of the present reign  footnote 4 when the term juste milieu was first used by the king and adopted by his followers lafayette said in the chamber that he very well understood what a juste milieu meant in any particular case it meant neither more nor less than the truth in that particular case but as to a political partys always taking a middle course under the pretence of being in a juste milieu he should liken it to a discreet mans laying down the proposition that four and four make eight and a fools crying out sir you are wrong for four and four make ten whereupon the advocate for the juste milieu on system would be obliged to say gentlemen you are equally in extremes four and four make nine it is the fashion to say lafayette wanted esprit this was much the cleverest thing the writer ever heard in the french chambers and generally he knew few men who said more witty things in a neat and unpretending manner than general lafayette indeed this was the bias of his mind which was little given to profound reflections though distinguished for a fort bon sens  on the night in question i was in the tuileries with a view to see the fireworks taking a station a little apart from the crowd i found myself under a tree alone with a frenchman of some sixty years of age after a short parley my companion as usual mistook me for an englishman on being told his error he immediately opened a conversation on the state of things in france he asked me if i thought they would continue i told him no that i thought two or three years would suffice to bring the present system to a close monsieur said my companion you are mistaken it will require ten years to dispossess those who have seized upon the government since the last revolution all the young men are growing up with the new notions and in ten years they will be strong enough to overturn the present order of things remember that i prophesy the year 1840 will see a change of government in france  lafayette laughed at this prediction which he said did not quite equal his impatience he then alluded to the ridicule which had been thrown upon his own idea of a monarchy with republican institutions and asked me what i thought of the system as my answer to this as well as to his other questions will serve to lay before you my own opinions which you have a right to expect from me as a traveller rendering an account of what he has seen i shall give you its substance at length  so far from finding anything as absurd as is commonly pretended in the plan of a throne surrounded by republican institutions it appears to me to be exactly the system best suited to the actual condition of france by a monarchy however a real monarchical government or one in which the power of the sovereign is to predominate is not to be understood in this instance but such a semblance of a monarchy as exists today in england and formerly existed in venice and genoa under their doges la england the aristocracy notoriously rules through the king and i see no reason why in france a constituency with a base sufficiently broad to entitle it to assume the name of a republic might not rule in its turn in the same manner in both cases the sovereign would merely represent an abstraction the sovereign power would be wielded in his name but at the will of the constituency he would be a parliamentary echo to pronounce the sentiment of the legislative bodies whenever a change of men or a change of measures became necessary it is very true that under such a system there would be no real separation in principle between the legislative and the executive branches of government but such is today and such has long been the actual condition of england and her statesmen are fond of saving the plan works well now although the plan does not work half as well in england as is pretended except for those who more especially reap its benefits simply because the legislature is not established on a sufficiently popular basis still it works better on the whole for the public than if the system were reversed as was formerly the case and the king ruled through the parliament instead of the parliament ruling through the king in france the facts are ripe for an extension of this principle in its safest and most salutary manner the french of the present generation are prepared to dispense with a hereditary and political aristocracy in the first place nothing being more odious to them than privileged orders and no nation not even america having more healthful practices or wiser notions on this point than themselves the experience of the last fifteen years has shown the difficulty of creating an independent peerage in france notwithstanding the efforts of the government sustained by the example and wishes of england have been steadily directed to that object still they have the traditions and prestige of a monarchy under such circumstances i see no difficulty in carrying out the idea of lafayette indeed some such polity is indispensable unless liberty is to be wholly sacrificed all experience has shown that a king who is a king in fact as well as name is too strong for law and the idea of restraining such a power by principles is purely chimerical he may be curtailed in his authority by the force of opinion and by extreme constructions of these principles but if this be desirable it would be better to avoid the struggle and begin at once by laying the foundation of the system in such a way as will prevent the necessity of any change  as respects france a peerage in my opinion is neither desirable nor practicable it is certainly possible for the king to maintain a chosen political corps as long as he can maintain himself which shall act in his interests and do his bidding but it is folly to ascribe the attributes that belong to a peerage to such a body of mercenaries they resemble the famous mandamus counsellors who had so great an agency in precipitating our own revolution and are more likely to achieve a similar disservice to their master than any thing else could they become really independent to a point to render them a masculine feature in the state they would soon by their combinations become too strong for the other branches of the government as has been the case in england and france would have a throne surrounded by aristocratic institutions the popular notion that an aristocracy is necessary to a monarchy i take it is a gross error a titular aristocracy in some shape or other is always the consequence of monarchy merely because it is the reflection of the sovereigns favour policy or caprice but political aristocracies like the peerage have nine times in ten proved too strong for the monarch france would form no exception to the rule but as men are apt to run into the delusion of believing it liberty to strip one of power although his mantle is to fall on the few i think it more than probable the popular error would be quite likely to aid the aristocrats in effecting their object after habit had a little accustomed the nation to the presence of such a body this is said however under the supposition that the elements of an independent peerage could be found in france a fact that i doubt as has just been mentioned  if england can have a throne then surrounded by aristocratical institutions what is there to prevent france from having a throne surrounded by republican institutions the word republic though it does not exclude does not necessarily include the idea of a democracy it merely means a polity in which the predominant idea is the public things or common weal instead of the hereditary and inalienable rights of one it would be quite practicable therefore to establish in france such an efficient constituency as would meet the latter conditions and yet to maintain the throne as the machinery necessary in certain cases to promulgate the will of this very constituency this is all that the throne does in england and why need it do more in france by substituting then a more enlarged constituency for the borough system of england the idea of lafayette would be completely fulfilled the reform in england itself is quite likely to demonstrate that his scheme was not as monstrous as has been affirmed the throne of france should be occupied as corsica is occupied not for the affirmative good it does the nation so much as to prevent harm from its being occasionally vacant  in the course of the conversation i gave to general lafayette the following outline of the form of government i could wish to give to france were i a frenchman and had i a voice in the matter i give it to you on the principle already avowed or as a traveller furnishing his notions of the things he has seen and because it may aid in giving you a better insight into my views of the state of this country  i would establish a monarchy and henry v should be the monarch i would select him on account of his youth which will admit of his being educated in the notions necessary to his duty and on account of his birth which would strengthen his nominal government and by necessary connexion the actual government for i believe that in their hearts and notwithstanding the professions to the contrary nearly half of france would greatly prefer the legitimate line of their ancient kings to the actual dynasty this point settled i would extend the suffrage as much as facts would justify certainly so as to include a million or a million and a half of electors all idea of the représentation of property should be relinquished as the most corrupt narrow and vicious form of polity that has ever been devised invariably tending to array one portion of the community against another and endangering the very property it is supposed to protect a moderate property qualification might be adopted in connexion with that of intelligence the present scheme in france unites in my view of the case precisely the two worst features of admission to the suffrage that could be devised the qualification of an elector is a given amount of direct contribution this qualification is so high as to amount to représentation and france is already so taxed as to make a diminution of the burdens one of the first objects at which a good government would aim it follows that as the ends of liberty are attained its foundations would be narrowed and the représentation of property would be more and more assured a simple property qualification would therefore i think be a better scheme than the present  each department should send an allotted number of deputies the polls being distributed on the american plan respecting the term of service there might arise various considerations but it should not exceed five years and i would prefer three the present house of peers should be converted into a senate its members to sit as long as the deputies i see no use in making the term of one body longer than the other and i think it very easy to show that great injury has arisen from the practice among ourselves neither do i see the advantage of having a part go out periodically but on the contrary a disadvantage as it leaves a representation of old and perhaps rejected opinions to struggle with the opinions of the day such collisions have invariably impeded the action and disturbed the harmony of our own government i would have every french elector vote for each senator thus the local interests would be protected by the deputies while the senate would strictly represent france this united action would control all things and the ministry would be an emanation of their will of which the king should merely be the organ  i have no doubt the action of our own system would be better could we devise some plan by which a ministry should supersede the present executive the project of mr hillhouse that of making the senators draw lots annually for the office of president is in my opinion better than the elective system but it would be in a manner liable to the old objection of a want of harmony between the different branches of the government france has all the machinery of royalty in her palaces her parks and the other appliances of the condition and she has moreover the necessary habits and opinions while we have neither there is therefore just as much reason why france should not reject this simple expedient for naming a ministry as there is for our not adopting it here then would be at once a throne surrounded by republican institutions and although it would not be a throne as powerful as that which france has at present it would i think be more permanent than one surrounded by bayonets and leave france herself more powerful in the end  the capital mistake made in 1830 was that of establishing the throne before establishing the republic in trusting to men instead of trusting to institutions  i do not tell you that lafayette assented to all that i said he had reason for the impracticability of getting aside the personal interests which would be active in defeating such a reform that involved details and a knowledge of character to which i had nothing to say and as respects the duc de bordeaux he affirmed that the reign of the bourbons was over in france the country was tired of them it may appear presumptuous in a foreigner to give an opinion against such high authority but what can we reason but from what we know and truth compels me to say i cannot subscribe to this opinion my own observation imperfect though it be has led to a different conclusion i believe there are thousands even among those who throng the tuileries who would hasten to throw off the mask at the first serious misfortune that should befall the present dynasty and who would range themselves on the side of what is called legitimacy in respect to parties i think the republicans the boldest in possession of the most talents compared to numbers and the least numerous the friends of the king active and passive the least decided and the least connected by principle though strongly connected by a desire to prosecute their temporal interests and more numerous than the republicans the carlists or henriquinquists the most numerous and the most generally but secretly sustained by the rural population particularly in the west and south  lafayette frankly admitted what all now seem disposed to admit that it was a fault not to have made sure of the institutions before the king was put upon the throne he affirmed however it was much easier to assert the wisdom of taking this precaution than to have adopted it in fact the world i believe is in error about most of the political events that succeeded the three days     letter ii  the cholera in parisits frightful ravagesdesertion of the

appearance denoting the arrival of the choleralord robert fitzgeralddinner at the house of madame de b  dear   we have had little to occupy us since my last letter but the cholera which alighted in the heart of this great and crowded metropolis like a bomb since the excursion on the frontiers last year and our success in escaping the quarantine i had thought little of this scourge until the subject was introduced at my own table by a medical man who was among the guests he cautiously informed us that there were unpleasant conjectures among the faculty on the subject and that he was fearful paris was not to go unscathed when apart he privately added that he had actually seen a case which he could impute to no other disease but that of asiatic cholera  the next day a few dark hints were given in the journals and with frightful rapidity reports followed that raised the daily deaths to near a thousand the change in the appearance of the town was magical for the strangers generally fled while most of the habitués of the streets in our immediate vicinity were soon numbered with the dead there was a succession of applewomen seated at the corners between the rue st dominique and the pont royal with whose faces i had become intimate in the course of ps traffic as we passed to and fro between the hotel and the tuileries every one of these disappeared the last i was told dropping from her chair and dying before those who came to her aid had reached the nearest hospital  one case among multitudes will serve to give you a faint idea of the situation of paris at this moment of severe affliction returning from a walk through the deserted streets one morning i saw a small collection of people around the portecochère of our hotel a matchseller had been seized with the disease at the gate and was then sustained on one of the stone seats which are commonly used by the servants i had her carried info the court and made such applications as had been recommended by the faculty the patient was a robust woman of middle age accompanied by her mother both having come in from a distant village to raise a few sous by selling matches in making the applications i had occasion to observe the means by which these poor people sustain life their food consisted of fragments of hard dried bread that had been begged or bought in the course of their progress  while two or three of us were busied about the daughter the mother knelt on the pavement and with streaming eyes prayed for her child for us and for herself there was something indescribably touching in this display of strong natural ties between those who were plunged so deep in misery a piece of five francs was put into the hands of the old woman but though she blessed the donor her look was not averted an instant from the agony depicted in her daughters face nor did she appear conscious of what she possessed a moment after the carriers from the hospital bore the sick woman away and the mother promised to return in a day or two to let me know the result not appearing an inquiry was made at the hospital and the answer was that they were both dead  in this manner some ten or fifteen thousand were swept away in a few weeks not only hotels but in some instances nearly whole streets were depopulated as every one fled who could with convenience or propriety quit the town you may feel surprised that we chose to remain when the deaths increased to eight or nine hundred a day and our own quarter began to be visited i felt it to be a duty to those under my charge to retire to some of the places without the limits of the disease the trunks were packed the carriage was in the court and my passports were signed when a was suddenly taken ill although the disease was not the cholera i began to calculate the chances of any one of us being seized myself for instance in one of the villages of the environs and the helpless condition of a family of females in a foreign country under such circumstances the result was a determination to remain and to trust to providence we have consequently staid in our apartments through it all although two slight cases have occurred in the hotel and hundreds around it  the manner in which individuals known to us have vanished as it were from before our eyes has been shockingly sudden today the report may be that the milkman is gone yesterday it was the butchers boy the day before the poulterer and presently a new servant appears with a message from a friend and on inquiring for his predecessor we learn that he is dead ten or fifteen cases of this sort have occurred among those with whom we are in constant and immediate connexion  the deaths in the higher classes at first were comparatively few but of late several of the most distinguished men of france have been seized among them are m perier the prime minister and the general lamarque prince castelcicala too the neapolitan ambassador is dead in our neighbourhood as indeed are very many others there is one short street quite near us out of which it is said between seventy and eighty dead have been carried the situation of all this faubourg is low and that of the street particularly so  dr s of north carolina who with several other young physicians has done credit to himself by his selfdevotion and application brought in the report of the appearance of things once or twice a week judging of the state of the disease more from the aspect of the hospitals than from the published returns which are necessarily and perhaps designedly imperfect he thinks of the first hundred that were admitted at the hotel dieu all but one died and that one he does not think was a case of asiatic cholera at all  all this time the more frequented streets of paris presented in the height of the usual season too the most deserted aspect i have frequently walked on the terrace of the tuileries when there were not a dozen others in the whole garden and driven from my own hotel in the rue st dominique to the place vendôme without meeting half a dozen vehicles including fiacres and cabriolets de place  i was returning one day from the rue de la paix on foot during the height of the disease at the time when this gay and magnificent part of the town looked peculiarly deserted there was scarcely a soul in the street but the laquais de place the garçons and the chambermaids of the public hotels that abound in this quarter these were at the gateways with folded arms a picture in themselves of the altered condition of the town two travelling carriages drove in from the rue de rivoli and there was at once a stir among those who are so completely dependent on travellers for their bread on part was at first the common and mournful call from one group to another until the mud on the carriagewheels caught the attention of some one who cried out on arrive the appearance of the strangers under such circumstances seemed to act like a charm i felt no little surprise at seeing them and more when a hand beckoned to me from a carriage window it was mr h of new york an old schoolfellow and a friend of whom we had seen a good deal during our travels in europe he had just come from england with his family and appeared astonished to find paris so deserted he told me that mr van buren was in the other carriage he had chosen an unfortunate moment for his visit i went to see the hs next morning and it was arranged that they should come and pass the succeeding day in the rue st dominique but they disappointed us the day following i got a letter from h dated amiens written on his way to england they had been imprudent in coming and wise in hurrying away from the frightful scene i believe that mr van buren remained but a day or two  although most of our acquaintances quitted the town a few thought it safer to remain in their own comfortable apartments than to run the hazards of travelling for in a short time most of the north of france was suffering under the same grievous affliction the authorities conducted themselves well and there have been very many instances of noble selfdevotion on the part of private individuals the french character never appearing to better advantage in this respect notwithstanding the general impression to the contrary i am inclined to believe after a good deal of inquiry that paris has acquitted itself better than london the french certainly are less disposed as a rule to hide their light under a bushel than most other people but on the spot and a lookeron my respect for their feelings and philanthropy has been greatly raised by their conduct during this terrible calamity  notwithstanding the horror of the disease some of the more prominent traits of national character have shown themselves lately among other things the artists have taken to caricaturing the cholera one gets to be so hardened by exposure as to be able to laugh at even these proofs of moral obtuseness odd enough traits of character are developed by seeing men under such trying circumstances during one of the worst periods of the disease i met a countryman in the street who though otherwise a clever man has the weakness to think the democracy of america its greatest blot i asked him why he remained in paris having no family nor any sufficient inducement oh said he it is a disease that only kills the rabble i feel no concerndo you i told him that under my peculiar circumstances i felt a great deal of uneasiness though not enough to make an unreflecting flight a few days afterwards i missed him and on inquiry learned that he had fled some nobleman had died in our faubourg when he and one of a fellow feeling finding a taint between the wind and their nobility forthwith beat a retreat  during the height of the malady an old english general officer who had served in india and who was now residing near us sent me an invitation to dinner tired of seeing no one i went here everything was as tranquil as if we were living in the purest atmosphere in europe sir  my host observed that he had got seasoned in india and that he believed good living one of the best preventives against the disease the count de  came in just before dinner was announced and whispered to me that some twelve or fifteen hundred had been buried the previous day although less than a thousand had been reported this gentleman told a queer anecdote which he said came from very respectable authority and which he gave as he had heard it about ten days before the cholera appeared a friend of his had accompanied one of the polish generals who are now in paris a short distance into the country to dine on quitting the house the pole stopped to gaze intently at the horizon his companion inquired what he saw when pointing to a hazy appearance in the atmosphere of rather an unusual kind the other said you will have the cholera here in less than ten days such appearances always preceded it in the north as m de  observed i tell it as i heard it  sir  did me the favour on that occasion to introduce me to a mild gentlemanlike old man who greatly resembled one of the quiet old school of our own which is so fast disappearing before the bustling fussy moneygetting race of the day it was lord robert fitzgerald a brother of the unfortunate lord edward and the brother of whom he so pleasantly speaks in his natural and amiable letters as plenipo bob this gentleman is since dead having as i hear fallen a victim to the cholera  i went to one other dinner during this scene of destruction given by madame de b a woman who has so much vogue as to assemble in her house people of the most conflicting opinions and opposite characters on this occasion i was surprised to hear from marshal  one of the guests that many believe the cholera to be contagious that such an opinion should prevail among the mass was natural enough but i was not prepared to hear it from so high a quarter  a gentleman mentioned at this dinner that the destruction among the porters had been fearful a friend of his was the proprietor of five hotels and the porters of all are dead     letter iii  insecurity of the governmentlouisphilippe and the

has kept faith with no one and the mass looks coldly on at the political agitation that is excited in all quarters by the carlists and the republicans the bold movement of the duchess of berri

fortuitous events than probably ever fell to the fortune of one in his situation the death of the duke of reichstadt the arrest and peculiar position of the duchess of berri the failure of the different attempts to assassinate and seize him and the sudden death of the young napoleon bonaparte in italy the son of louis are among the number  in a country where the cholera could not escape being caricatured you will readily imagine that the king has fared no better the lower part of the face of louisphilippe is massive while his forehead without being mean narrows in a way to give the outline a shape not unlike that of a pear an editor of one of the publications of caricatures being on trial for a libel in his defence produced a large pear in order to illustrate his argument which ran as followspeople fancied they saw a resemblance in some one feature of a caricature to a particular thing this thing again might resemble another thing that thing a third and thus from one to another until the face of some distinguished individual might be reached he put it to the jury whether such forced constructions were safe this gentlemen he continued is a common pear a fruit well known to all of you by culling here and here using his knife as he spoke something like a resemblance to a human face is obtained by clipping here again and shaping there one gets a face that some may fancy they know and should i hereafter publish an engraving of a pear why everybody will call it a caricature of a man you will understand that by a dexterous use of the knife such a general resemblance to the countenance of the king was obtained that it was instantly recognised the man was rewarded for his cleverness by an acquittal and since that time by an implied convention a rude sketch of a pear is understood to allude to the king the fruit abounds in a manner altogether unusual for the season and at this moment i make little doubt that some thousands of pears are drawn in chalk coal or other substances on the walls of the capital during the carnival masquers appeared as pears with pears for caps and carrying pears and all this with a boldness and point that must go far to convince the king that the extreme license he has affected hitherto to allow cannot very well accord with his secret intentions to bring france back to a government of coercion the discrepancies that necessarily exist in the present system will sooner or later destroy it  little can be said in favour of caricatures they address themselves to a faculty of the mind that is the farthest removed from reason and by consequence from the right and it is a prostitution of the term to suppose that they are either cause or effect as connected with liberty such things may certainly have their effect as means but every good cause is so much the purer for abstaining from the use of questionable agencies au reste there is really a fatality of feature and expression common to the public men of this country that is a strong provocative to caricature the revolution and empire appear to have given rise to a state of feeling that has broken out with marked sympathy in the countenance the french as a nation are far from handsome though brilliant exceptions exist and it strikes me that they who appear in public life are just among the ugliest of the whole people  not long since i dined at the table of mr de  in company with mr b of new york the company consisted of some twenty men all of whom had played conspicuous parts in the course of the last thirty years i pointed out the peculiarity just mentioned to my companion and asked him if there was a single face at table which had the placid dignified and contented look which denotes the consciousness of right motives a frank independence and a mind at peace with itself we could not discover one i have little doubt that national physiognomy is affected by national character  you may form some idea on the other hand of the perfect simplicity and good taste that prevails in french society by a little occurrence on the day just mentioned a gentleman of singularly forbidding countenance sat next us and in the course of the conversation he mentioned the fact that he had once passed a year in new york of which place he conversed with interest and vivacity b was anxious to know who this gentleman might be i could only say that he was a man of great acuteness and knowledge whom i had often met in society but as to his name i did not remember ever to have heard it he had always conducted himself in the simple manner that he witnessed and it was my impression that he was the private secretary of the master of the house who was a dignitary of the state for i had often met him at the same table here the matter rested for a few days  the following week we removed into the rue st dominique directly opposite to the portecochère of our hotel was the portecochère of an hotel that had once belonged to the princes of conti a day or two after the removal i saw the unknown gentleman coming out of the gateway opposite as i was about to enter our own he bowed saluted me by name and passed on believing this a good occasion to ascertain who he was i crossed the street and asked the porter for the name of the gentleman who had just gone out mais cest monsieur le duc dukewhat duke why monsieur le duc de valmy the proprietor of this hotel it was the younger kellerman the hero of marengo6  footnote 6 he is since dead  but i could fill volumes with anecdotes of a similar nature for in these countries in which men of illustrious deeds abound one is never disturbed in society by the fussy pretension and swagger that is apt to mark the presence of a lucky speculator in the stocks battles unlike bargains are rarely discussed in society i have already told you how little sensation is produced in paris by the presence of a celebrity though in no part of the world is more delicate respect paid to those who have earned renown whether in letters arts or arms like causes however notoriously produce like effects and i think under the new regime which is purely a moneypower system directed by a mind whose ambition is wealth that one really meets here more of that swagger of stocks and lucky speculations in the world than was formerly the case society is decidedly less graceful more careworn and of a worse tone today than it was previously to the revolution of 1830 i presume the elements are unchanged but the ebullition of the times is throwing the scum to the surface a natural but temporary consequence of the present state of things  while writing to you in this desultory manner i shall seize the occasion to give the outline of a little occurrence of quite recent date and which is in some measure of personal interest to myself a controversy concerning the cost of government was commenced some time in november last under the following circumstances and has but just been concluded as early as the july preceding a writer in the employment of the french government produced a laboured article in which he attempted to show that head for head the americans paid more for the benefits of government than the french having the field all to himself both as to premises and conclusions this gentleman did not fail to make out a strong case against us and as a corollary to this proposition which was held to be proved he and others of his party even went so far as to affirm that a republic in the nature of things must be a more expensive polity than a monarchy  this extravagant assertion had been considered as established by a great many perfectly wellmeaning people for some months before i even knew that it had ever been made a very intelligent and a perfectly candid frenchman mentioned it one day in my presence admitting that he had been staggered by the boldness of the proposition as well as by the plausibility of the arguments by which it had been maintained it was so contrary to all previous accounts of the matter and was especially so much opposed to all i had told him in our frequent disquisitions on america that he wished me to read the statements and to refute them should it seem desirable about the same time general lafayette made a similar request sending me the number of the periodical that contained the communication and suggesting the expediency of answering it i never for an instant doubted the perfect right of an american or any one else to expose the errors that abounded in this pretended statistical account but i had little disposition for the task having however good reason to think it was aimed covertly at general lafayette with the intention to prove his ignorance of the america he so much applauded i yielded to his repeated requests and wrote a hasty letter to him dissecting as well as my knowledge and limited access to authorities permitted the mistakes of the other side this letter produced replies and the controversy was conducted through different channels and by divers agents up to a time when the varying and conflicting facts of our opponents appeared to be pretty well exhausted it was then announced that instructions had been sent to america to obtain more authentic information and we were promised a farther exposure of the weakness of the american system when the other side should receive this reenforcement to their logic7  footnote 7 no such exposure has ever been made and the writer understood some time before he quitted france that the information received from america proved to be so unsatisfactory that the attempt was abandoned the writer in managing his part of the discussion confined himself principally to the state of new york being in possession of more documents in reference to his own state than to any other official accounts since published have confirmed the accuracy of his calculations the actual returns varying but a few sous a head from his own estimates which were in so much too liberal or against his own side of the question  i have no intention of going over this profitless controversy with you and have adverted to it here solely with a view to make you acquainted with a state of feeling in a portion of our people that it may be useful not only to expose but correct8  footnote 8 see my letter to general lafayette published by

with a courtiersuppression of the revolt   dear   events have thickened since my last letter the cholera gradually disappeared until it ceased to be the subject of conversation as soon as the deaths diminished to two or three hundred a day most people became easy and when they got below a hundred the disease might be said to be forgotten but though the malady virtually disappeared the public was constantly reminded of its passage by the deaths of those who by force of extraordinary care had been lingering under its fatal influence m casimir perier was of the number and his death has been seized on as a good occasion to pass a public judgment on the measures of the government of the juste milieu of which he has been popularly supposed to be the inventor as well as the chief promoter this opinion i believe however to be erroneous the system of the juste milieu means little more than to profess one thing and to do another it is a stupendous fraud and sooner or later will be so viewed and appropriately rewarded it is a profession of liberty with a secret intention to return to a government of force availing itself of such means as offer of which the most obvious at present are the stagnation of trade and the pressing necessities of all who depend on industry in a country that is taxed nearly beyond endurance neither m perier nor any other man is the prime mover of such a system for it depends on the father of lies who usually employs the most willing agents he can discover the inventor of the policy sub diabolo is now in london m perier had the merits of decision courage and business talents and so far from being the founder of the present system he had a natural frankness the usual concomitant of courage that under other circumstances i think would have indisposed him to its deceptions but he was a manufacturer and his spinningjennies were very closely connected with his political faith another state of the market would most probably have brought him again into the liberal ranks  the funeral obsequies of m perier having been loudly announced as a test of public opinion i walked out the morning they took place to view the pomp it amounted to little more than the effect which the patronage of the ministry can at any time produce there was a display of troops and of the employés of the government but little apparent sympathy on the part of the mass of the population as the deceased was a man of many good qualities this indifference was rather studied proceeding from the discipline and collision of party politics as an attempt to prove that the juste milieu met with popular approbations i think the experiment was a failure  very different was the result in a similar attempt made by the opposition at the funeral of general lamarque this distinguished officer fell also a victim to the cholera and his interment took place on the 4th of june the journals of the opposition had called upon its adherents to appear on this occasion in order to convince the king and his ministers that they were pursuing a dangerous course and one in which they were not sustained by the sentiment of the nation the preparations wore a very different appearance from those made on the previous occasion then everything clearly emanated from authority now the government was visible in little besides its arrangements to maintain its own ascendency the military rank of the deceased entitled him to a military escort and this was freely accorded to his friends perhaps the more freely from the fact that it sanctioned the presence of so many more bayonets than were believed to be at the command of the ministers it was said there were twenty thousand of the national guards present in uniform wearing however only their sidearms this number may have been exaggerated but there certainly were a great many the whole procession including the troops has been estimated at a hundred thousand men the route was by the boulevards to the jardin des plantes where the body was to be delivered to the family of the deceased in order to be transported to the south of france for interment having other engagements i merely viewed the preparations and the commencement of the ceremonies when i returned to our own quiet quarter of the town to pursue my own quiet occupations  the day passed quietly enough with us for the faubourg st germain has so many large hotels and so few shops that crowds are never common and on this occasion all the floating population appeared to have completely deserted us to follow the procession of poor lamarque i do not remember to have alluded to the change produced in this particular by the cholera in the streets of paris it is supposed that at least ten thousand of those who have no other abodes except the holes into which they crept at night were swept out of them by this fell disease  about five oclock i had occasion to go to the rue de rivoli and i found the streets and the garden with much fewer people in them than was usual at that hour there i heard a rumour that a slight disturbance had taken place on the boulevard des italiens in consequence of a refusal of the duc de fitzjames a leading carlist to take off his hat to the body of lamarque as he stood at a balcony i had often met m de fitzjames in society and although a decided friend of the old regime i knew his tone of feeling and manners to be too good to credit a tale so idle by a singular coincidence the only time i had met with general lamarque in private was at a little dinner given by madame de m at which monsieur de fitzjames was also a guest we were but five or six at table and nothing could be more amicable or in better taste than the spirit of conciliation and moderation that prevailed between men so widely separated by opinion this was not long before gen lamarque was attacked by his final disease and as there appeared to me to be improbability in the rumour of the affair of the boulevards i quite rightly set it down as one of the exaggerations that daily besiege our ears it being near six i consequently returned home to dinner supposing that the day would end as so many had ended before  we were at table or it was about halfpast six oclock when the drum beat the rappel at one period scarcely a day passed that we did not hear this summons indeed so frequent did it become that i make little doubt the government resorted to it as an expedient to strengthen itself by disgusting the national guards with the frequency of the calls but of late the regular weekly parades excepted we had heard nothing of it a few minutes later françois who had been sent to the portecochère returned with the intelligence that a soldier of the national guard had just passed it bleeding at a wound in the head on receiving this information i left the hotel and proceeded towards the river in the rue du bac the great thoroughfare of the faubourg i found a few men and most of the women at their shopdoors and portescochères but no one could say what was going on in the more distant quarters of the town there were a few people on the quays and bridges and here and there a solitary national guard was going to his place of rendezvous i walked rapidly through the garden which at that hour was nearly empty as a matter of course and passing under the arch of the palace crossed the court and the carrousel to la rue de richelieu a profound calm reigned in and about the chateau the sentinels and loungers of the guards seeming as tranquil as usual there was no appearance of any coming and going with intelligence and i inferred that the royal family was either at st cloud or at neuilly very few people were in the place or in the streets but those who were paused occasionally looking about them with curiosity and almost uniformly in a bewildered and inquiring manner  i had reached the colonnade of the théâtre français when a strong party of gendarmes à cheval went scouring up the street at a full gallop their passage was so swift and sudden that i cannot say in which direction they came or whither they went with the exception that they took the road to the boulevards a gendarme à pied was the only person near me and i asked him if he could explain the reason of the movement je nen sais rien in the brusque manner that the french soldiers are a little apt to assume when it suits their humours was all the reply i got  i walked leisurely into the galleries of the palais royal which i had never before seen so empty there was but a single individual in the garden and he was crossing it swiftly in the direction of the theatre a head was now and then thrust out of a shopdoor but i never before witnessed such a calm in this place which is usually alive with people passing part of the way through one of the glazed galleries i was started by a general clatter that sprung up all around me in every direction and which extended itself entirely around the whole of the long galleries the interruption to the previous profound quiet was as sudden as the report of a gun and it became general as it were in an instant i can liken the effect after allowing for the difference in the noises to that of letting fly sheets tacks and halyards on board a vessel of war in a squall and to a sudden call to shorten sail the place was immediately filled with men women and children and the clatter proceeded from the windowshutters that were going up all over the vast edifice at the same moment in less than five minutes there was not a shopwindow exposed  still there was no apparent approach of danger the drums had almost ceased beating and as i reached the carrousel on my way back to the rue st dominique i saw nothing in the streets to justify all this alarm which was either the result of a panic or was calculated for political effect artifice acting on apprehension a few people were beginning to collect on the bridges and quays and there was evidently a greater movement towards the pont neuf than in the lower parts of the town as i crossed the pont royal a brigade of light artillery came up the quays from the ecole militaire the horses on the jump and the men seated on the carriages or mounted as belongs to this arm the noise and hurry of their passage was very exciting and it gave an impulse to the shopkeepers of the rue du bac most of whom now began to close their windows the guns whirled across the bridge and dashed into the carrousel on a gallop by the guichet of the louvre  continuing down the rue du bac the street was full of people chiefly females who were anxiously looking towards the bridge one garçon as he aided his master in closing the shopwindow was edifying him with anathemas against ces messieurs les républicains who were believed to be at the bottom of the disturbance and for whom he evidently thought that the artillery augured badly the next day he would be ready to shout vive la république under a new impulse but at present it is vive le commerce  on reaching the hotel i gave my account of what was going on pacified the apprehensions that had naturally been awakened and sallied forth a second time to watch the course of events  by this time some forty or fifty national guards were collected on the quay by the pont royal a point where there ought to have been several hundreds this was a sinister omen for the government nor was the appearance of the crowd much more favourable tens of thousands now lined the quays and loaded the bridges nor were these people rabble or sans culottes but decent citizens most of whom observed a grave and as i thought a portentous silence i make no manner of doubt that had a thousand determined men appeared among them at that moment headed by a few leaders of known character the government of louisphilippe would have dissolved like melting snow neither the national guard the army nor the people were with it every one evidently waited the issue of events without manifesting much concern for the fate of the present regime indeed it is not easy to imagine greater apathy or indifference to the result than was nearly everywhere visible a few shopkeepers alone seemed troubled  on the pont royal a little crowd was collected around one or two men of the labouring classes who were discussing the causes of the disturbance first questioning a respectablelooking bystander as to the rumours i mingled with the throng in order to get an idea of the manner in which the people regarded the matter it would seem that a collision had taken place between the troops and a portion of the citizens and that a charge had been made by a body of cavalry on some of the latter without having observed the formalities required by the law some of the people had raised the cry aux arms several corps de garde had been disarmed and many thousands were rallying in defence of their liberties in short everything wore the appearance of the commencement of another revolution the point discussed by the crowd was the right of the dragoons to charge a body of citizens without reading the riot act or making what the french call the sommations i was struck with the plain common sense of one or two of the speakers who were of the class of artisans and who uttered more good reason and displayed more right feeling in the five minutes i listened than one is apt to meet with on the same subjects in a year in the salons of paris i was the more struck by this circumstance in consequence of the manner in which the same topic had been broached quite lately in the chamber of deputies  in one of the recent affairs in the east of france the troops had fired on a crowd without the previous sommations in consequence as was alleged of some stones being hurled from the crowd against themselves every one who has the smallest knowledge of a government of laws understands its action in an affair of this sort ten thousand people are in a street in their own right and half a dozen of them commit an outrage military force becomes necessary but before it is applied certain forms are required to notify the citizen that his ordinary rights are suspended in the interests of public order and to warn him to go away this is a provision that the commonest intellect can understand and yet some of the leading administration men lawyers too maintained that soldiers had the rights of other men and if stones were hurled at them from a crowd they were perfectly justifiable in using their arms against that crowd it is only necessary you will perceive to employ an agent or two to cast a few stones from a crowd to place every collection of citizens at the mercy of an armed force on this doctrine a soldier has the right of a citizen to defend himself beyond dispute against the man who assails him but a citizen who is assailed from a crowd has no right to discharge a pistol into that crowd by way of defending himself but this is of a piece with most of the logic of the friends of exclusion their cause is bad and their reasoning is necessarily bad also  from the pont royal i proceeded to the pont neuf where the collection of people was still more numerous every eye being fastened on the quays in the direction of the place de la bastille near which the disturbance had commenced nothing however was visible though once or twice we heard a scattering fire of musketry i waited here an hour but nothing farther was heard and according to promise i returned to the hotel to repeat the little i had seen and gathered in passing i observed that the number of national guards at the pont royal had increased to about a hundred  after quieting the apprehensions of my family i proceeded to quiet those of a lady of my acquaintance who was nearly alone in her lodgings i found her filled with apprehensions and firmly believing that the present government was to be overturned among other things she told me that the populace had drawn general lafayette in triumph to his own house and that previously to the commencement of the conflict he had been presented with a bonnet rouge which he had put upon his head the bonnet rouge you will understand with all frenchmen is a symbol of extreme jacobinism and of the reign of terror i laughed at her fears and endeavoured to convince her that the idle tale about general lafayette could not be true so far from wishing to rule by terror it was his misfortune not to resort to the measures of caution that were absolutely necessary to maintain his own legal ascendancy whenever he got into power he was an enthusiast for liberty and acted on the principle that others were as well disposed and as honest as himself but to all this she turned a deaf ear for though an amiable and a sensible woman she had been educated in the prejudices of a caste being the daughter and sister of peers of france  i found the tale about general lafayette quite rife on going again into the streets the disposition to give credit to vulgar reports of this nature is not confined to those whose condition in life naturally dispose them to believe the worst of all above them for the vulgarminded form a class more numerous than one might be induced to think on glancing a look around him liberality and generosity of feeling is the surest test of a gentleman but in addition to those of training and of a favourable association except in very peculiar cases they are apt to require some strong natural advantages to help out the tendencies of breeding and education every one who has seen much of the world must have remarked the disposition on the part of those who have not had the same opportunities to cavil at opinions and usages that they cannot understand merely because they do not come within the circle of their own everyday and familiar usages our own country abounds with these rustic critics and i can remember the time when there was a species of moral impropriety attached to practices that did not enter into every mans habits it was almost deemed immoral to breakfast or dine at an hour later than ones neighbour now just this sort of feeling one quite as vulgar and much more malignant prevails in europe against those who may see fit to entertain more liberal notions in politics than others of their class in england i have already told you the system is so factitious and has been so artfully constructed by blending church and state that it must be an uncommonly clever man who in politics can act vigorously on the golden rule of christ that of doing unto others as you would have others do unto you and escape the imputation of infidelity a desire to advance the interests of his fellowcreatures by raising them in the social scale is almost certain to cause a man to be set down as destitute of morals and honesty by imputations of this nature the efforts and influence of some of the best men england has ever produced have been nearly neutralized and there is scarcely a distinguished liberal in the kingdom at this moment whom even the wellmeaning of the churchandstate party do not regard with a secret distrust of his intentions and character in the practice of imitation this feeling has even extended though in a mitigated form to america a country in which were the truth felt and understood a man could not possibly fulfil all the obligations of education and superior training without being of the party of the people many gentlemen in america beyond dispute are not of the popular side but i am of opinion that they make a fundamental mistake as gentlemen they have permitted the vulgar feelings generated by contracted associations and the insignificant evils of a neighbourhood to still within them the high feelings and generous tendencies that only truly belong to the caste  in france the english feeling modified by circumstances is very apparent although it is not quite so much the fashion to lay stress on mere morality the struggle of selfishness and interests is less veiled and mystified in france than on the other side of the channel but the selfish principle if anything is more active and few struggle hard for others without being suspected of base motives  by looking back at the publications of the time you will learn the manner in which washington was vituperated by his enemies at the commencement of the revolution graydon in his memoirs of a life spent in pennsylvania mentions a discourse he held with a young english officer who evidently was well disposed and wished to know the truth this gentleman had been taught to believe washington an adventurer who had squandered the property of a young widow whom he had married by gambling and dissipation and who was now ready to embark in any desperate enterprise to redeem his fortune this then was probably the honest opinion the british army in 1776 entertained of the man whom subsequent events have shown to have been uniformly actuated by the noblest sentiments and who instead of being the adventurer represented is known to have put in jeopardy a large estate through disinterested devotion to the country and the prevailing predominant trait of whose character was an inflexible integrity of purpose now lafayette is obnoxious to a great deal of similar vulgar feeling without being permitted by circumstances to render the purity of his motives as manifest as was the better fortune of his great model washington the unhandsome and abrupt manner in which he was dismissed from the command of the national guards though probably a peaceoffering to the allies was also intended to rob him of the credit of a voluntary resignation9but all this time we are losing sight of what is passing in the streets of paris  footnote 9 general lafayette took the republican professions of the king too literally at first and he did not always observe the ménagement perhaps that one seated on a throne even though it be a popular one is apt to expect in 1830 he told the writer the king had that morning said that some about him called the general a maire du palais on being asked if the king appeared to entertain the same notion his answer was well he professes not to do so but then i think he has tant soit peu of the same feeling this was ticklish ground to stand on with a sovereign and perhaps a case without a parallel in france since the days of hugues capet a few weeks later general lafayette related another conversation held with louisphilippe on the subject of his own unceremonious dismissal from office you shall be named honorary commanderinchief of the national guards for life said the king sire how would you like to be an honorary king it is quite apparent that such a friendship could not last for ever  troops of the line began to appear in large bodies as the evening closed and the reports now came so direct as to leave no doubt that there was a sharp contest going on in the more narrow streets of the quartier montmartre all this time the feelings of the crowd on the bridges and quays appeared to be singularly calm there was little or no interest manifested in favour of either side and indeed it would not be easy to say what the side opposed to the government was the carlists looked distrustful the republicans bold and the juste milieu alarmed  i went back to the hotel to make my report again about nine and then proceeded by the quay and the pont louis xvi to the carrousel by the way i believe i have forgotten to say in any of my letters that in crossing the place louis xvi with a french friend a month or two since he informed me he had lately conversed with count who had witnessed the execution of louis xvi and that he was told there was a general error prevalent as regarded the spot where the guillotine was erected on that occasion according to this account which it is difficult to believe is not correct it was placed on the side of the place near the spot where the carriages for versailles usually stand and just within the borgnes that line the road that here diverges towards the quay while correcting popular errors of this sort i will add that m guillotine the inventor of that instrument that bears his name is i believe still living the story of his having been executed on his own machine being pure poetry  passing by the rue de rivoli i went to see an english lady of our acquaintance who resided in this quarter of the town i found her alone uneasy and firmly persuaded that another revolution had commenced she was an aristocrat by position and though reasonably liberal anxious to maintain the present order of things like all the liberal aristocrats who believe it to be the last stand against popular sway she has also friends and connexions about the person of the king and probably considered their fortunes as in some measure involved in those of the court we condoled with each other as a matter of course she because there was a revolution and i because the want of faith and the stupendous frauds practised under the present system rendered it necessary  it was near eleven oclock before i quitted this part of the town the streets were nearly deserted a patrol occasionally passing but the strangers were few scarcely any having yet returned after their flight from the cholera the gates of the garden were closed and i found sentinels at the guichets of the carrousel who prevented my return by the usual route unwilling to make the détour by the way i had come i proceeded by the rue de rivoli as i was walking quite near to the palace in order to avoid some mud i came suddenly on a garde national who was placed behind a sentrybox en faction i cannot describe to you the furious scream with which this man cried allez au large if he took me for a body of bloodyminded republicans rushing forward to disarm him i certainly thought he was some wild beast the man was evidently frightened and just in a condition to take every bush for an enemy it is true the other party was rather actively employed in disarming the different guards but this fellow was within a hundred feet of the etat major and in no sort of danger notwithstanding the presented bayonet i am not quite certain he would not have dropped his arms had i lifted my walkingstick though one runs more hazard from a robber or a sentinel who is frightened than from one who is cool there was however no blood shed  finding the carrousel closed to me i passed into the rue st honoré which was also pretty well garnished with troops a few truculent youths were shouting a short distance ahead of me but on the appearance of a patrol they ran off at length i got as far as the rue du coq st honoré and seeing no one in the street i turned short round its corner thinking to get into the court of the louvre and to the other side of the river by the pont des arts instead of effecting this clever movement i ran plump on a body of troops who were drawn up directly across the street in a triple line this was a good position for the men were quite protected from a fire up or down the great thoroughfare while by wheeling on either flank they were ready to act in a moment in either direction  my reception was not flattering but the officer in command was too cool to mistake a solitary individual for a band of rebels and i was suffered to continue up the rue st honoré i got into the rear of this guard by turning through the next opening the court of the louvre was unguarded and empty and passing through it i got a glimpse of a picturesque bivouac of troops in the carrousel seeing no obstruction i went in that direction and penetrated to the very rear of a squadron of cuirassiers who were dismounted forming the outer line of the whole body there may have been three or four thousand men of all arms assembled in this spot chiefly if not all regular troops i stayed among them unobserved or at least unmolested near half an hour watching the effect of the different groups by the light of the camp fires strong patrols principally cavalry went and came constantly and scarcely five minutes passed without the arrival and departure of mounted expresses the headquarters of the national guards being in the palace  it was drawing towards midnight and i bethought me of the uneasiness of those i had left in the rue st dominique i was retiring by the upper guichet the only one unguarded and had nearly reached it when a loud shout was heard on the quay this sounded like service and it was so considered by the troops for the order aux armes was given in a moment the cuirassiers mounted wheeled into platoons and trotted briskly towards the enemy with singular expedition unluckily they directed their advance to the very guichet which i was also approaching the idea of being caught between two fires and that in a quarrel which did not concern me was not agreeable the state of things called for decision and knowing the condition of affairs in the carrousel i preferred siding with the juste milieu for once in my life  the cuirassiers were too much in a hurry to get through the guichet which was a defile and too steady to cut me down in passing and first giving them a few minutes to take the edge off the affair if there was to be any fighting i followed them to the quay  this alarm was real i understood next day but the revolters made their retreat by the pont des arts which is impracticable for cavalry attacking and carrying a corps de garde in the quartier st jacques the cuirassiers were trotting briskly towards the pont neuf in order to get at them when i came out on the quay and profiting by the occasion i got across the river by the pont des arts  it was strange to find myself alone on this bridge at midnight in the heart of a great capital at a moment when its streets were filled with troops while contending factions were struggling for the mastery and perhaps the fate of not only france but of all europe was hanging on the issue excited by these reflections i paused to contemplate the scene  i have often told you how picturesque and beautiful paris appears viewed from her bridges the finest position is that of the pont royal but the pont des arts at night perhaps affords even more striking glimpses of those ancient tall angular buildings along the river that but for their forms and windows would resemble low rocky cliffs in the centre of this mass of dwellings among its damp and narrow streets into which the sun rarely penetrates lay bodies of men sleeping on their arms or merely waiting for the dawn to decide the fate of the country it was carrying one back to the time of the league and the fronde and i involuntarily cast my eyes to that balconied window in the louvre where charles ix is said to have stood when he fired upon the flying protestants the brooding calm that reigned around was both characteristic and strange here was an empire in jeopardy and yet the population had quietly withdrawn into their own abodes awaiting the issue with as much apparent tranquillity as if the morrow was to be like another day use and a want of sympathy between the governed and their governors had begotten this indifference  when i reached the quai voltaire not a man was visible except a picket on the pont royal not knowing but some follower of the house of orleans more loyal than usual might choose to detain me because i came from america i passed down one of the first streets entering the rue du bac at some distance from the bridge i met but half a dozen people between the quays and the hotel de  and all the shops were hermetically sealed as soon as i entered the porter shut and barred the gate of our own hotel and we retired to rise and see what a night might bring forth  les canons grondent dans les rues monsieur was the remark of the porter as i passed out into the street next morning the population was circulating freely in our part of the town the shops too were reopened and it appeared to be pretty generally understood that no fighting was to take place in that vicinity passing up the rue du bac i met three gardes nationaux who by their conversation were fresh from the field having passed the night in what may be called the enemys country they were full of marvels and in their own opinion full of glory  the streets were now alive with people the quays and bridges being still resorted to on account of their affording an unobstructed avenue to the sounds that came from the quarter where the conflict was going on occasionally a discharge of musketry reached these spots and once or twice i heard the report of a gun but the firing was desultory far from heavy and irregular  in the carrousel i met an english acquaintance and we agreed to go towards the scene of action together in order to learn what was going on my companion was loud in his complaints against the revolters who he said would retard the progress of liberty half a century by their rashness the government would put them down and profit by its victory to use strong measures i have learned to distrust the liberalism of some of the english who are too apt to consult their own national interests in regarding the rights of their neighbours this you will say is no more than human nature which renders all men selfish true but the concerns of few nations being as extensive varied and artificial as those of england the people of other countries are not liable to be influenced by so many appeals to divert them from a sound and healthful state of feeling england as a nation has never been a friend of liberty in other nations as witness her long and bitter hostility to ourselves to france and holland and her close alliance with turkey persia etc etc just at this moment apprehension of russia causes her to dilate a little more than usual on the encouragement of liberty but it is a mystification that can deceive no one of the least observation of whatever sins england is to be accused as a nation she cannot be accused of that of political propagandism even her own recent progress in liberty has been the result of foreign and external example i now speak of the state which extends its influence very far into society but there are many individuals who carry their principles as far as any men on earth this latter class moreover is largely and rapidly on the increase has always effected and will still effect far more than the slate itself in favour of freedom  we went by the palais royal the passages vivienne and du panorama to the boulevards the streets were filled with people as on a fête and there appeared still to be a good deal of anxiety as to the result there were plenty of troops report saying that sixty thousand men were under arms on the side of the government half that number would suffice to assure its success unless there should prove to be disaffection had a single regiment of the line declared against the king the previous day or even on the 6th of june louisphilippe in my opinion would have been dethroned but so far as i can learn none of the principal persons of the opposition appeared against him on this occasion or seemed to have any connexion with the affair  my companion left me on the boulevards and i proceeded towards the porte st denis where there was evidently something like a contest there was a little firing and i met one or two wounded men who were retiring to their casernes one was shot through the body but the affair at the porte st denis proved to be nothing serious and was soon over the revolters had retired into the rue st méry where they were closely encircled by large bodies of troops and whither i did not deem it prudent to follow them the struggle in that direction was much sharper and we occasionally heard cannon  you will probably be curious to know if one did not feel uneasy in walking about the streets of a town while so many men were contending in its streets a moments reflection will show you that there was little or no danger one could find a cover in a moment the streets were thronged and it was little probable that either party would wantonly fire on the mass the contest was confined to a particular part of the town and then a man of ordinary discretion would hardly be so silly as to expose himself unnecessarily in a quarrel with which he had no concern women and children were certainly killed on this occasion but it was probably under circumstances that did not in the least affect the great body of the inhabitants  the cafés were frequented as usual and a little distance from the scene of action everything wore the air of an ordinary sunday on which the troops were to be reviewed the morning passed in this manner when about four oclock i again found myself at the pont royal after paying a visit to the hotel here i met two american friends and we walked by the quay of the palace towards the pont neuf the people were in a dense crowd and it was even difficult to penetrate the mass just before we reached the bridge we heard shouts and cries of vive le roi and presently i saw m de chabotrohan the first honorary aidedecamp a gentleman whom i personally knew and who usually led the cortege of the king it would seem that louisphilippe had arrived from the country and had passed by the boulevards to the place de la bastille whence he was now returning to the tuileries by the quays his appearance in the streets during such a scene has been much lauded and the firmness necessary to the occasion much dwelt on in the papers a very timid man might certainly have been afraid to expose his person in this manner but the risk was by no means as great as has been supposed the cortege was nowhere under fire nor but for a few minutes near the scene of action and it was not easy to assassinate a man moving through streets that were filled with troops au reste there is no reason whatever to suppose the king would not have behaved personally well in far more critical circumstances10 the royal party passed into the carrousel by the court of the louvre while we turned upon the bridge  footnote 10 i once asked general lafayette his opinion of the nerve of the duc dorleans egalité he laughed and said the king had made an appeal to him quite lately on the same subject and the answer i told his majesty that i believed his father was a brave man but you may be sure i was glad be did not ask me if i thought he was an honest one too  the pont neuf was crowded with troops who occupied the trottoirs and with men women and children there had been some skirmishing at the place de grève and the scene of the principal contest the rue st méry was near by we were slowly threading the crowd with our faces towards the island when a discharge of musketry four or five pieces at most directly behind us and quite near set everybody in motion a flock of sheep would not have scattered in greater confusion at the sudden appearance of a strange dog among them than the throng on the bridge began to scamper fear is the most contagious of all diseases and for a moment we found ourselves running with the rest a jump or two sufficed however and we stopped two soldiers one a national guard and the other a young conscript belonging to the line caught my eye and knowing there was no danger we had time to stop and laugh at them the national guard was a little mayeuxlooking fellow with an abdomen like a pumpkin and he had caught hold of his throat as if it were actually to prevent his heart from jumping out of his mouth a caricature of fright could scarcely be more absurd the young conscript a fair redhaired youth was as white as a sheet and he stood with his eyes and mouth open like one who thought he saw a ghost immoveable as a statue he was sadly frightened too the boy would probably have come to and proved a good soldier in the end but as for mr mayeux although scarcely five feet high he appeared as if he could never make himself short enough he had evidently fancied the whole affair a good joke up to that precise moment when for the first time the realities of a campaign burst upon his disordered faculties the troops in general while they pricked up their ears disdained even to shoulder their arms for those on the bridge there was in truth no danger although the nearness of the volley and the suddenness of the alarm were well adapted to set a crowd in motion the papers next day said one or two had been slain by this discharge which actually came from the revolters  you will probably be surprised when i tell you that i had an engagement to dine today with a gentleman who fills a high situation near the person of the king he had sent me no notice of a postponement and as i had seen him pass in the cortège i was reminded that the hour to dress was near accordingly i returned home in order to prove to him that i was as indifferent as any frenchman could be to the events we had all just witnessed i found a dozen people assembled in the drawingroom of madame  at six oclock precisely the same as if paris were quite tranquil the general had not yet returned but i was enabled to report that he had entered the palace in safety a moment before the dinner was announced he returned and brought the information that the revolt was virtually suppressed a few desperate individuals who had thrown themselves into a church alone holding out he was in high spirits and evidently considered the affair a triumph to louisphilippe     letter v  national guards in the court

the carrousela refractory private of the national guard  dear   the day after the contest was closed i went to the louvre where i usually met mr m who was busy copying he was almost alone in the long and gorgeous galleries as in the days of the cholera but we got a view of the national guards that had been concerned in the affair of the previous day who were drawn up in the court of the palace to receive the thanks of the king there could not have been five thousand of them but all might not have been present  from the louvre i went to took at the principal scene of action a collection of some of the unclaimed dead was in the morgue and every one was allowed to enter there were fifty or sixty bodies in this place and among them were a few women and children who had probably been killed by accident nearly all had fallen by gunshot wounds principally musketballs but a few had been killed by grape as the disaffected had fought under cover most of the time i fancy the cavalry did little in this affair it was whispered that agents of the police were present to watch the countenances and actions of the spectators with a view to detect the disaffected  as we had several of napoleons soldiers at dinner yesterday and they had united to praise the military character of the position taken by the revellers i was curious to examine it the rue st méry is narrow and the houses are high the tower of the church is a little advanced so as to enfilade it in a manner and the pavingstones had been used to make barricades as in 1830 these stones are much larger than our own are angular and of a size that works very well into a wall and the materials being plenty a breastwork that is proof against everything but artillery is soon formed by a crowd two streets entered the rue st méry near each other but not in a right line so that the approach along each is commanded by the house that stands across its end one of these houses appears to have been a citadel of the disaffected and most of the fighting was at and near this spot artillery had been brought up against the house in question which was completely riddled though less injured by roundshot than one could have thought possible the windows were broken and the ceilings of the upper rooms were absolutely torn to pieces by musketballs that had entered on the rise some twenty or thirty dead were found in this dwelling  i had met col in the course of the morning and we visited this spot together he told me that curiosity had led him to penetrate as far as this street which faces the citadel of the revolters the previous day and he showed me a portecochère under which he had taken shelter during a part of the attack the troops engaged were a little in advance of him and he described them as repeatedly recoiling from the fire of the house which at times was rather sharp the troops however were completely exposed and fought to great disadvantage several hundreds must have been killed and wounded at and near this spot  there existed plain proof of the importance of nerve in battle in a shot that just appeared sticking in the wall of one of the lateral buildings nearly opposite the portecochère where colhad taken shelter the artillerist who pointed the gun from which it had been discharged had the two sides of the street to assist his range and yet his shot had hit one of the lateral buildings at no great distance from the gun and at a height that would have sent it far above the chimneys of the house at which it was fired but any one in the least acquainted with life knows that great allowances must be made for the poetry when he reads of charges free use of the bayonet and braving murderous discharges of grape old and steady troops do sometimes display extraordinary fortitude but i am inclined to think that the most brilliant things are performed by those who have been drilled just long enough to obey orders and act together but who are still so young as not to know exactly the amount of the risk they run extraordinary acts of intrepidity are related of the revolters on this occasion which are most probably true as this desperate selfdevotion under a state of high excitement enters fully into the composition of the character of the french who are more distinguished for their dashing than for their enduring qualities  the rue st méry exhibited proofs of the late contest for some distance but nowhere had the struggle been so fierce as at the house just mentioned the church had been yielded the last but it did not strike me that there had been as sharp fighting near it as at the other place  it was a strange spectacle to witness the population of a large town crowding through its streets curious to witness the scene of a combat that so nearly touched their own interests and yet apparently regarding the whole with entire indifference to everything but the physical results i thought the sympathies of the throng were with the conquered rather than with their conquerors and this more from admiration of their prowess than from any feeling of a political character for no one appeared to know who the revolters were  in the course of the morning i metin the street he is one of the justestminded men of my acquaintance and i have never known him attempt to exaggerate the ill conduct of his political opponents or to extenuate the errors of those to whom he belongs speaking of this affair he was of opinion that the government had endeavoured to bring it on with the certainly that success would strengthen them but at the same time he thought it useless to deny that there was a plot to overturn the present dynasty according to his impressions the spontaneous movements of the disaffected were so blended with those that proceeded from the machinations of the government to provoke a premature explosion that it was not easy to say which predominated or where the line of separation was to be drawn i presume this is the true state of the case for it is too much to say that france is ever free from political plots  the public had been alarmed this morning by rumours of an intention on the part of government to declare paris in a state of siege which is tantamount to bringing us all under martial law this savours more of the regime napoleon than of the promised liberty that was to emanate from the three days the opposition are beginning to examine the charter in order to ascertain what their rights are on paper but what avails a written compact or indeed any other compact against the wants and wishes of those who have the power the cour de cassation however is said to be composed of a majority of carlists and by way of commentary on the wants of the last two years the friends of liberty have some hopes yet from these nominees of the bourbons we live in a droll world dear  and one scarcely knows on which side he is to look for protection among the political weathercocks of the period in order to comprehend the point you will understand that a clause of the charter expressly stipulates that no one shall be condemned by any but his natural judges which clearly means that no extraordinary or unusual courts shall be established for the punishment of ordinary crimes now while it is admitted that martial law brings with it military tribunals and military punishments it is contended that there is no pretext for declaring martial law in the capital at a moment when the power of the present government is better assured than it has been at any time since its organization but the charter solemnly stipulates that the conscription shall be abolished while conscripts are and have been regularly drafted yearly ever since the signature of louis xviii was affixed to the instrument  the shops were all open today and business and pleasure are resuming their regular rounds the national guards of the banlieue who were actively engaged yesterday are befêted and bepraised while the lookerson affirm that some of them believe they have just been fighting against the carlists and that some think they have crushed the jacobins all believe they have done a good turn to liberty  i was returning through the carrousel when chance made me the spectator of a laughable scene a body of these troops honest wellintentioned countrymen with very equivocal equipments were still in the court of the palace it would seem that one warrior had strayed outside the railing where he was enjoying a famous gossip with some neighbours whom he was paying for their cheer by a narrative of the late campaign a sergeant was summoning him back to his colours but the love of good wine and a good gossip were too strong for discipline the more dignified the sergeant became the more refractory was his neighbour until at last the affair ended in a summons as formal as that which would be made to a place besieged the answer was truly heroic being rendered into the vernacular i wont an old woman advanced from the crowd to reason with the sergeant but she could get no farther than ecoutez mons le sergeantfor like all in authority he was unreasonable and impatient when his power was called in question he returned to the battalion and tried to get a party to arrest the delinquent but this was easier said than done the troops evidently had no mind to disturb a neighbour who had just done the state good service and who was now merely enjoying himself the officer returned alone and once more summoned the truant if possible more solemnly than ever by this time the mouth of the delinquent was too full to answer and he just turned his back on the dignitary by way of letting him see that his mind was made up in the end the soldier got the best of it compelling the other to abandon the point  the country people of whom there were a good many present looked on the matter seriously but the parisians laughed outright i mention this little incident for it shows that men are the same everywhere and because this was an instance of military insubordination directly under the windows of the palace of the king of france at the precise moment when his friends were boasting that the royal authority was triumphant which had it occurred in the interior of america would have been quoted as proof of the lawlessness of democracy i apprehend that militia taken from their daily occupations and embodied and this too under the orders of their friends and neighbours are pretty much alike in their leading characteristics all over the world     letter vi  aspect of parisvisit to lafayettehis demeanourhis account of the

of paying a visit to the rue danjou indeed i was under the impression that general lafayette was at la grange for i had understood that he only remained at paris to attend the funeral of lamarque there were rumours of his having been arrested but these i set down to the marvelmongers who are always busy when extraordinary events occur just at dusk i heard by accident there was still a chance of finding him in his apartment and i walked across the river in order to ascertain the fact for myself  what a difference between the appearance of the streets this evening and that which they had made on the night of the 5th now the bridges were deserted the garden was empty and the part of the population that was visible seemed uneasy and suspicious the rumour that the government intended to declare paris in a state of siege and to substitute military for the ordinary civil tribunals was confirmed though the measure was not yet officially announced this act was in direct opposition to a clause in the charter as i have told you and the pretence in a town in which fifty thousand troops had just quelled a rising of a few hundred men was as frivolous as the measure itself is illegal it has however the merit of throwing aside the mask and of showing the world in what manner the present authorities understand a government of the people  a dead calm reigned in the rue danjou apart from the line of cabriolets de place of which there were but three not a carriage nor a human being was visible in the street nothing stood before the portecochère of no 6 a thing so unusual more especially in critical moments that i suspected i had been misled and that i should have a bootless walk the gate was open and entering without knocking i was just turning off the great staircase to ascend the humbler flight that leads to the wellknown door that door through which i had so lately seen so many dignitaries pressing to enter when the porter called to me to give an account of myself he recognised me however by the light of the lamp and nodded an assent  i waited a minute or more after ringing before the door was opened by bastien the honest fellow let me in on the instant and without proceeding to announce me led the way through the salons to the bedroom of his master the general was alone with the husband of his granddaughter françois de corcelles the former was seated with his back to the door as i entered the latter was leaning against the mantelpiece the bonsoir mon ami of the first was frank and kind as usual but i was immediately struck with a change in his manner he was calm and he held out his hand as bastien mentioned my name but although not seated at his table he did not rise glancing my eyes at him as i passed on to salute monsieur de corcelles i thought i had never before seen lafayette wearing so fine an air of majesty his large noble form was erect and swelling and that eye whose fire age had not quenched was serenely proud he seemed prepared to meet important events with the dignity and sternness that marked his principles  a perfect knowledge of these principles and the intimacy that he had so kindly encouraged emboldened me to speak frankly after a few minutes conversation i laughingly inquired what he had done with the bonnet rouge the question was perfectly understood and i was surprised to learn that in the present instance there was more foundation for the report than is usually the case with vulgar rumour he gave the following account of what occurred at la place de la bastille  when the procession halted and the funeral discourses were being delivered the tumult commenced in what manner he was unable to say in the midst of the commotion a man appeared on horseback wearing the dreaded bonnet rouge some one approached him and invited him to repair to the hôtel de ville in short to put himself again at the head of the revolt and offered him a bonnet rouge he took the cap and threw it into the mud after this he entered his carriage to return home when a portion of the populace took out the horses and drew him to the rue danjou on reaching the hotel the people peaceably withdrew  you will readily suppose i was curious to learn the opinion of general lafayette concerning the events of the week the journals of the opposition had not hesitated to ascribe the affair to the machinations of the police which justly or not is openly accused of having recourse to expedients of this nature with a view to alarm the timid and to drive them to depend for the security of their persons and the maintenance of order on the arm of a strong government in the recent case it had also been said that aware of the existence of plots the ministry had thought it a favourable occasion to precipitate their explosion taking the precaution to be in readiness with a force sufficient to secure the victory  i have often alluded to that beautiful and gentlemanlike feature in the character of lafayette which appears to render him incapable of entertaining a low prejudice against those to whom he is opposed in politics this is a trait that i conceive to be inseparable from the lofty feelings which are the attendant of high moral qualities and it is one that i have a hundred times had occasion to admire in lafayette i do not now allude to that perfect bon ton which so admirably regulates all his words and deportment but to a discriminating judgment that does not allow interest or passion to disarm his sense of right it certainly is a weakness in him not to distinguish sufficiently between the virtuous and the viciousthose who are actuated like himself by philanthropy and a desire to do good and those who seek their own personal ends but this is a sacrifice perhaps that all must make who aim at influencing men by the weight of personal popularity jefferson has accused lafayette of a too great desire to live in the esteem of others11 and perhaps the accusation is not altogether false but the peculiar situation in which this extraordinary man has been placed must be kept in view while we decide on the merits of his system his principles forbid his having recourse to the agencies usually employed by those who loose sight of the means in the object and his opponents are the great of the earth a man who is merely sustained by truth and the purity of his motives whatever visionaries may say would be certain to fail popularity is indispensable to the success of lafayette for thousands now support him who in despite of his principles would become his enemies were he to fall back sternly on the truth and turn his back on all whose acts and motives would not perhaps stand the test of investigation the very beings he wished to serve would desert him were he to let them see he drew a stern but just distinction between the meritorious and the unworthy then the power of his adversaries must be remembered there is nothing generous or noble in the hostility of modern aristocrats who are mere graspers after gain the most debasing of all worldly objects and he who would resist them successfully must win golden opinions of his fellows or they will prove too much for him  footnote 11 was mr jefferson himself free from a similar charge  but i am speculating on principles when you most probably wish for facts or if you must have opinions for those of lafayette in preference to my own when i ventured to ask him if he thought the government had had any agency in producing the late struggle his answer was given with the integrity and fearlessness that so eminently characterize the man  he was of opinion that there was a plot but he also thought it probable that the agents of the government were more or less mixed up with it he suspected at the moment that the man who offered him the bonnet rouge was one of these agents though he freely admitted that the suspicion was founded more on past experience than on any knowledge of present facts the individual himself was an utter stranger to him it had been his intention to quit town immediately after the funeral obsequies were completed but added the old man proudly they had spread a rumour of an intention to cause me to be arrested and i wish to save them the trouble of going to la grange to seek me  he then went on to tell me what he and his political friends had expected from the demonstration of public opinion that they had prepared for this important occasion things were approaching a crisis and we wished to show the government that it must change its system and that france had not made a revolution to continue the principles of the holy alliance the attempt to obtain signs of popular support at the funeral of casimir perier was a failure while so great was our success at this procession in honour of lamarque that there must have been a new ministry and new measures had not this unfortunate event occurred as it is the government will profit by events i do not wish to wake any unjust accusations but with my knowledge of men and things it is impossible not to feel distrust12  footnote 12 it appeared subsequently by means of a public prosecution that vidocq with a party of his followers were among the revolters disguised as countrymen a government that has an intimation of the existence of a plot to effect its own overthrow has an unquestionable right to employ spies to counteract the scheme but if it proceed so far as to use incentives to revolt it exceeds its legitimate powers  while we were conversing general  whom i had not seen since the dinner of the previous day was announced and admitted he stayed but a few minutes for though his reception was kind the events of the last week had evidently cast a restraint about the manners of both parties the visit appeared to me to be one of respect and delicacy on the part of the guest but recent occurrences and his close connexion with the king rendered it constrained and though there appeared no evident want of good feeling on either side little was said during this visit touching the two days as the 5th and 6th of june are now termed but that little served to draw from lafayette a stronger expression of political hostility than i had ever yet heard from his lips in allusion to the possibility of the liberal party connecting itself with the government of louisphilippe he saidà présent un ruisseau de sang nous sépare13 i thought generalconsidered this speech as a strong and a decisive one for he soon after rose and took his leave  footnote 13 we are now separated by a rivulet of blood  lafayette spoke favourably of the personal qualities and probity of his visitor when he had withdrawn but said that he was too closely incorporated with the juste milieu to be any longer classed among his political friends i asked him if he had ever known a true liberal in politics who had been educated in the school of napoleon the general laughingly admitted that he was certainly a bad master to study under and then added it had been intended to offer general  a portfolio that of the public works i understood him to say had they succeeded in overturning the ministry  this conversation insensibly led to one on the subject of the revolution of july and on his own connexion with the events of that important moment i despair of doing justice to the language of general lafayette on this occasion and still less so to his manner which though cool and dignified had a roman sternness about it that commanded the deepest respect indeed i do not remember ever to have seen him with so much of the externals of a great man as on this evening for no one in common is less an actor with his friends or of simpler demeanour but he now felt strongly and his expressions were forcible while his countenance indicated a portion of that which was evidently working within you must be satisfied however with receiving a mere outline of what fell from his lips in an uninterrupted explanation that lasted fully half an hour  he accused his opponents in general terms of distorting his words and of misrepresenting his acts the celebrated saying of voici la meilleure des républiques in particular had been falsely rendered while the circumstances under which he spoke and acted at all had been studiously kept out of view it was apropos of this saying that he entered into the explanations of the causes of the change of dynasty  the crisis which drove the cabinet of charles x to the extreme measures that overturned the throne had been produced by a legislative combination to effect their end nearly every opinion and all the shades of opposition had united many even of those who were personally attached to the bourbons resisting their project of reestablishing the ancien régime most of the capitalists in particular and more especially those who were engaged in pursuits that were likely to be deranged by political convulsions were secretly disposed to support the dynasty while they were the most zealously endeavouring to reduce its power the object of these men was to maintain peace to protect commerce and industry more especially their own and at the same time to secure to property the control of affairs in short england and her liberty were their models though some among them had too much good sense to wish to retrograde as is the case with a party in america in order to make the imitation more perfect those who were for swallowing the english system whole were called the doctrinaires from their faith in a theory while the different shades of dissenting opinions were distributed among all those who looked more to facts and less to reasoning than their credulous coadjutors but all were zealous in opposing government under its present system and with its palpable views  you know that the result was the celebrated ordinances and a rising of the people so little was either of these events foreseen that the first probably astonished and alarmed the friends of the bourbons quite as much as it did their enemies the second was owing chiefly to the courage and zeal of the young men connected with the press sustained by the pride and daring of the working classes of paris the emergency was exactly suited to the élan of the french character which produced the sympathy necessary to the occasion among the different degrees of actors with the movements that followed those who had brought about the state of things which existed by their parliamentary opposition had little or nothing to do lafayette himself was at la grange nor did he reach paris until the morning of the second day so far from participating in the course of events most of the deputies were seriously alarmed and their first efforts were directed to an accommodation but events were stronger than calculations and the bourbons were virtually dethroned before any event or plan could be brought to bear upon the issue in either the offensive or defensive  you are now to imagine the throne vacant the actors in the late events passive spectators of what was to follow and opportunity for a recurrence to parliamentary tactics men had leisure to weigh consequences another political crusade menaced france and it is probable that nothing prevented its taking place but the manifestations of popular sympathy in england and on the rhine then there was danger too that the bankers and manufacturers and great landed proprietors would lose the stake for which they had been playing by permitting a real ascendancy of the majority up to that moment the mass had looked to the opposition in the deputies as to their friends in order to entice all parties or at least as many as possible the cry had been la charte and the opposition had become identified with its preservation the new chambers had been convened and after the struggle was over the population naturally turned to those who had hitherto appeared in their ranks as leaders this fragment of the representation became of necessity the repository of all power  lafayette had thus far been supported by the different sections of the opposition for his influence with the mass to suppress violence was looked to as of the last importance by even his enemies the very men who accused him of jacobinical principles and a desire to unsettle society felt a security under his protection that they would not have felt without him louisphilippe you will remember made use of him until the trial of the ministers was ended when he was unceremoniously dismissed from the command of the national guards by the suppression of the office14 it would have been in my power to declare a republic he continued in the course of his explanations and sustained by the populace of paris backed by the national guards i might have placed myself at its head but six weeks would have closed my career and that of the republic the governments of europe would have united to put us down and the bourbons had to a great degree disarmed france we were not in a state to resist the two successful invasions had diminished the confidence of the nation which moreover would have been nearly equally divided in itself but allowing that we might have overcome our foreign enemies a result i admit to have been possible by the aid of the propaganda and the general disaffection there would have been a foe at home that certainly would have prevailed against us those gentlemen of the chambers to whom a large portion of the people looked up with confidence would have thwarted every important measure i attempted and were there no other means to prevent a republic they would have thrown me into the river  footnote 14 the writer has had a hundred occasions to learn since his return to america how much truth is perverted in crossing the atlantic and how little is really known of even prominent european facts on this side of the water it has suited some one to say that lafayette resigned the office of commanderinchief of the national guards and the fact is thus stated in most of our publications the office was suppressed without consulting him and it was his impression at the instigation of the allied powers something like an awkward explanation and a permission to resign was subsequently attempted  this last expression is literal and was twice uttered in the course of the evening he then went on to add that seeing the impossibility of doing as he could wish he had been compelled to acquiesce in the proposal that came nearest to his own views the friends of the duke of orleans were active particularly m lafitte who enjoyed a great deal of his own confidence and the duke himself was free in the expression of the most liberal sentiments under these circumstances he thought it possible to establish a government that should be monarchical in form and republican in fact such or nearly such is the case in england and he did not see why such might not be the case in france it is true the english republic is aristocratical but this is a feature that depends entirely on the breadth and independence of the constituency there was no sufficient reason why france should imitate england in that essential point and by erecting a different constituency she would virtually create another polity in fact adhering always to the same general form  as respects the expression so often cited he said his words were voici la meilleure des républics pour nous distinctly alluding to the difficulties and embarrassments under which he acted all this time he made no pretension to not having been deceived in the king who had led him to think he entertained very different principles from those which events have shown to be his real sentiments  something was then said of the état de siége and of the intentions of the government i shall go to la grange in a few days observed the general smiling unless they arrest me there to remain until the 4th of july when we shall have our usual dinner i hope i told him that the long fever under which a had suffered rendered a change of air necessary and that i was making my preparations to quit france temporarily on another tour he pressed me to remain until the 4th and when i told him that we might all be shot for sedition under the present state of things if we drunk liberal toasts he laughed and answered that their bark was worse than their bite  it was near tea when i took my leave and returned to the rue st dominique the streets were gloomy and deserted and i scarcely met a single individual in walking the mile between the two hotels  there was a wild pleasure in viewing a town in such an extraordinary state and i could not help comparing its present moody silence to the scenes we had witnessed when the government was still so young and dependent as to feel the necessity of courting the people i have already mentioned to you many of the events of that period but some of them have been omitted and some too which quite naturally suggest themselves at this moment when the king has established military tribunals in his very capital  on one occasion in particular i was walking in the tuileries when a noise attracted me towards a crowd it was louisphilippe taking a walk this you will understand was intended for effectrepublican effectand to show the lieges that he had the outward conformation of another man he wore a white hat carried an umbrella i am not sure that it was red and walked in as negligent a manner as a man could walk who was working as hard as possible to get through with an unpleasant task in short he was condescending with all his might a gentleman or two in attendance could barely keep up with him and as for the rabble it was fairly obliged to trot to gratify its curiosity this was about the time the king of england electrified london after a reign of exclusion by suddenly appearing in its streets walking about like another man whether there was any concert in this coincidence or not i do not know  on another occasion a and myself drove out at night to view a bivouac in the carrousel we got ourselves entangled in a dense crowd in the rue st honoré and were obliged to come to a stand while stationary the crowd set up a tremendous cry of vive le roi and a body of dismounted cavalry of the national guard passed the carriage windows flourishing their sabres and yelling like madmen looking out i saw the king in their midst patrolling the streets of his good city of paris on foot now he has declared us all under martial law and is about to shoot those he dislikes  the fleurdelis as you know is the distinctive symbol of the family of france so much stress is laid on trifles of this nature here that napoleon with his grinding military despotism never presumed to adopt one for himself during the whole of his reign the coins of the country were decorated on one side with no more than an inscription and a simple wreath though the gradual progress of his power and the slow degress by which he brought forward the public on these points may yet be traced on these very coins the first that were struck bore his head as first consul with république française on the reverse after a time it was empereur with république française at length he was emboldened to put empire français on the reverse feeling a true royal antipathy to the word republic  during the existing events that first succeeded the last revolution no one thought of the fleurdelis with which the bourbons had sprinkled everything in and about the capital not to say france this omission attracted the attention of some demagogue and there was a little émeute before the arch of the carrousel with threats of destroying these ornaments soon after workmen were employed to deface everything like a fleurdelis in paris the hotel of the treasury had many hundreds of them in large stone rosettes every one of which disappeared before the chisel the king actually laid down his family arms causing the brush to be put to all his carriages speaking to lafayette on this subject he remarked pithilywell i told his majesty i would have done this before there was a mob and i would not have done it afterwards  the bourbons usually drove with eight horses but this king rarely appears with even six though that number is not offensive the other being the regal style some time since before the approach of the late crisis i saw the coachman of the palace quite early or before the public was stirring exercising with eight it is to be presumed that the aspect of things the pears and the duchess of berri compelled the leaders to be taken off  a day or two after this event i dined in company with a deputy who is also a distinguished advocate who made me laugh with an account of a recent freak of another sovereign that has caused some mirth here this advocate was employed in the affair professionally and his account may be depended on  you know that shortly after the revolution of 1830 the people of brunswick rose and deposed their duke bestowing the throne or armchair for i know not the official term on his brother this duke of brunswick is the grandson of him who figured in the wars of the old revolution and the son of him who was killed at quatre bras his grandmother was a sister of george iii and his aunt was the wife of george iv the latter being his cousin his uncle and his guardian  the deposed prince retired to paris if it can be called retirement to come from brunswick here after some time the police was informed that he was busy in enrolling men to make a counterrevolution in his own states he was warned of the consequences and commanded to desist the admonition was disregarded and after exhausting its patience the government proceeded so far as to order him to quit paris it was not obeyed  i must now tell you that a few years previously the duke of brunswick had visited paris and apprehending assassination for some cause that was not explained he had obtained from the police one of its agents to look out for the care of his person the man had been several weeks in this employment and knowing the person of the contumacious prince when it was determined to resort to force he was sent with the gendarmes expressly that he might be identified  a party accordingly presented themselves one fine morning at the hotel which had the honour to contain his serene highness demanding access to his person in the name of the police no one was hardy enough to deny such an application and the officers were introduced they found the indomitable prince in his morning gown and slippers as composed as if he were still reigning in brunswick or even more so he was made acquainted with their errand which was neither more nor less than to accompany him to the frontier  the greatnephew of george iii the cousin and nephew of george iv the cousin of william iv and the exduke of brunswick received this intelligence with a calm entirely worthy of his descent and his collaterals treating the commissary of police de haut en bas in plain english he gave them to understand he should not budge reverence for royal blood was at last overcome by discipline and seeing no alternative the gendarmes laid their sacrilegious hands on the person of the prince and fairly carried him down stairs and put him dressinggown slippers and all into a fiacre  it was a piteous sight to see a youth of such high expectations of a lineage so ancient of a duchy so remote treated in this rude and inhospitable manner like cæsar who bore up against his enemies until he felt the dagger of brutus he veiled his face with his handkerchief and submitted with dignity when he ascertained how far it was the intention of the minister of the interior to push matters m  did not tell us whether or not he exclaimed et tu montalivet the people of the hotel manifested a proper sympathy at the cruel scene the filles de chambre weeping in the corridors as filles de chambre who witnessed such an indecent outrage naturally would do  the duke was no sooner in the fiacre than he was carried out of town to a posthouse on the road to switzerland here he was put in a caleche and transported forthwith to the nearest frontier  on reaching the end of the journey the duke of brunswick was abandoned to his fate with the indifference that marked the whole outrage or as might have been expected from the servants of a prince who had so lately shown his respect for rank by sending his own relatives out of his kingdom very much in the same fashion happily the unfortunate duke fell into the hands of republicans who as a matter of course hastened to pay their homage to him the mayor of the commune appeared and offered his civilities all the functionaries went forth with alacrity and the better to show their sympathy a young german traveller was produced that he might console the injured prince by enabling him to pour out his griefs in the vernacular of his country this bit of delicate attention however was defeated by an officious valet who declared that ever since his dethronement his master had taken such an aversion to the german language that it threw him into fits even to hear it of course the traveller had the politeness to withdraw  while these things were in progress the duke suddenly disappeared no one knew whither the public journals soon announced the fact and the common conjecture was that he had returned to paris  after several weeks m  was employed to negotiate an amnesty promising on the part of his principal that no further movements against the duchy should be attempted in france the minister was so far prevailed on as to say he could forgive all had not the duke reentered the kingdom after having been transported to switzerland by the order of the government in the manner you have heard m  assured the minister parole dhonneur that this was altogether a mistake well then convince me of this and his serene highness shall have permission to remain here as long as he pleases his serene highness having never left france cannot have reentered it not left francewas he not carried into switzerland not at all liking paris better he chose to remain here the person you deported was a young associate of the same stature of the duke a frenchman who cannot speak a word of german  a compromise was made on the spot for this was a matter to be hushed up ridicule being far more potent in paris than reason this is what you may have heard alluded to in some of the journals of the day as the escapade of the duke of brunswick

courtmartial had made considerable progress in condemning men to be shot but appeals were made to the carlist court of cassation which finally adjudged the whole proceedings to be illegal in the mean time we got up the dinner for the 4th lafayette coming from la grange expressly to make one among us as for this dinner i have only to say that one of its incidents went to prove how completely a body of americans are subject to common and inconsiderate impulses let the motive be right or wrongof how low estimate character is getting to be among us and to determine me never to be present at another it is a painful confession but truth compels me to say that i believe for the want of a condensed class that are accustomed to sustain each other in a high tone of feeling and thinking and perhaps from ignorance of the world no other people above the illiterate and downright debased are so easily practised on and cajoled as the great mass of our own i hope i have never been addicted to the vice of winning golden opinions by a sacrifice of sentiments or principles but this dinner has given me a surfeit of what is called popularity among a people who while affecting to reduce everything to a standard of their own creating do not give themselves time or opportunity to ascertain facts or weigh consequences  the weather was pleasant and warm for several weeks about the close of june and the commencement of july and although a slight shade has been cast over our enjoyments by the reappearance of the cholera in a greatly diminished degree however i do not remember to have passed the same period of time in paris with so much satisfaction to myself the town has been empty in the usual signification of the term and the world has left us entirely to ourselves after completing the mornings task i have strolled in the gardens visited the churches loitered on the quays rummaged the shops of the dealers in old furniture and other similar objects the number of these shops is great and their stores of curious things incredible it appears to me that all france has poured her relics of the old system into the warehouses of the capital the plunder of the chateaux and hotels has enriched them to a degree that must be witnessed to be understood and to me it is matter of surprise that some of our wealthy travellers do not transfer many of these treasures to the other side of the atlantic  i usually spend an our or two with m in the gallery of the louvre from two to four he returns home with me to dinner and at seven which at this season in this latitude is still broad day we issue forth for a promenade paris i have often told you is a picturesque town and offers endless sources of satisfaction beyond its living throngs its society its theatres and its boulevards the public displays at the academy and its meetings of science taste and philanthropy are little to my taste being too artificial and affected and i have found most enjoyment in parts of this little world that i believe travellers usually overlook  the churches of paris want the odour the genial and ecclesiastical atmosphere and the devout superstition that rendered those of italy so strikingly soothing and pleasant but they are huge piles and can always be visited with pleasure notre dame de paris is a noble monument and now that the place of the archbishop is destroyed one is likely to get better views of it than is apt to be the case with these venerable edifices a few evenings since m and myself ascended the towers and seating ourselves on the leads looked down for near an hour on the extraordinary picture beneath the maze of roofs outtopped here and there by black lacqueredlooking towers domes pavilions of palaces and as is the case with the tuileries and louvre literally by a mile of continuous structures the fissures of streets resembling gaping crevices in rocks the river meandering through the centre of all and spanned by bridges thronged by mites of men and pigmy carriages the crowds of images of the past the historical eminences that surround the valley of the capital the knowledge of its interior our acquaintance with the past and the present together with conjectures for the future contributed to render this a most impressive evening the distant landscape was lost and even quarters of the town itself were getting to be obscure before we descended helping singularly to increase the effect produced by our speculations on those ages in which paris had been the scene of so many momentous events  we have also wandered among the other relics of antiquity for the present structure of notre dame is said to have already stood seven centuries the place royale is one of the most singular quarters of the town and although often visited before we have again examined it for we are beginning to regard objects with the interest that one is apt to feel on leaving a favourite spot perhaps for ever this square unique in its kind occupies the site of the ancient residences of the kings of france who abandoned it in consequence of the death of henri ii in a tournament henri iv caused the present area to be enclosed by hotels which are all of brick a novelty in paris and built in the style of his reign fashion has however been stronger than the royal will and noble ranges of rooms are to be hired here at a fourth of the prices that are paid for small and crowded apartments near the tuileries the celebrated arsenal where sully so often received his royal master is near this place and the bastile stood at no great distance in short the world has moved within the last two centuries directly across the town  i can never tire of speaking of the bridges of paris by day and by night have i paused on them to gaze at their views the word not being too comprehensive for the crowds and groupings of objects that are visible from their arches they are less stupendous and magnificent as public works than the bridges of london florence dresden bordeaux and many other european towns the stream they have to span being inconsiderable but their number the variety of their models even the very quaintness of some among them render them as a whole i think more interesting than any others that i know the pont de jena is as near perfection in all respects perhaps as a bridge well can be i greatly prefer it to the celebrated ponte della trinità at florence some enormous statues are about to be placed on the pont louis xvi which if they do not escape criticism will at least i think help the picturesque  i have now known paris a sufficient time to watch with interest the progress of the public works the arch at the barrière de neuilly has within my observation risen several feet and approaches its completion the wing a counterpart of the gallery that is to enclose the carrousel and finally to convert the louvre and the tuileries into a single edifice has advanced a long distance and preparations are making to clear the area of the few buildings that still remain when this design shall be executed the palace of the kings of france will contain considerably more than a mile of continuous buildings which will be erected around a large vacant area the single room of the picturegallery is of itself a quarter of a mile in length  during the heat of the late finance discussion all sorts of unpleasant things were said of america for the moneypower acts here as it does everywhere else proving too strong even for french bon ton and failing of facts and logic some of the government writers had recourse to the old weapon of the trader abuse and vituperation among other bold assertions one of them affirmed with a view to disparage the vaunted enterprise of the americans that while they attempted so much in the way of public works nothing was ever finished he cited the capitol a building commenced in 1800 and which had been once destroyed by fire in the interval as an example  as one of the controversionalists on this occasion i certainly had no disposition to debase my mind or to descend from the level of a gentleman who was compelled to bow before no political master in order to retort in kind but as is apt to be the case under provocations of this sort the charge induced me to look about in order to see what advantages the subjects of a monarchy possess over us in this particular the result has made several of my french friends laugh and acknowledge that they who live in glass houses should not throw stones  the new palace of the louvre was erected more than two centuries since it is a magnificent pile surrounding a court of more than a quarter of a mile in circumference possessing many good statues fine basreliefs and a noble colonnade in some respects it is one of the finest palaces in europe the interior is however unfinished though in the course of slow embellishment now a principal and very conspicuous window in the pavilion that caps the entrance to the carrousel is unglazed the weather being actually excluded by the use of coarse unplaned boards precisely in the manner in which one is apt to see a shingle palace embellished at home one hundred francs would conceal this deformity  the palace of the tuileries was built by catherine di medici who was dead before the present united states were first peopled it is a lanternlike tasteless edifice composed of different pavilions connected by corps de bâtimens of different sizes but of pretty uniform ugliness the stone of this vicinity is so easily wrought that it is usual to set it up in blocks and to work out the capitals and other ornaments in the wall on a principal portion of this palace these unwrought blocks still remain just enough being finished to tell the observer that the design has never been completed i shall not go beyond the palaces to make out our case though all europe abounds with these discrepancies in taste and with similar neglect as a rule i believe we more uniformly push through our public undertakings than any other people though they are not always executed with the same taste on the same scale or as permanently perhaps as the public works that are undertaken here when they yield profit however we need turn our backs on no nation  it is a curious commentary on the change in the times that louisphilippe has dared to do that which napoleon with all his power did not deem it expedient to undertake though it is known that he chafed under the inconvenience which it was desirable to both to be rid of until quite lately the public could approach as near the palace windows as one usually gets to those of any considerable dwelling that stands on a common street the emperor complained that he could not look out of a window into his own gardens without attracting a crowd under this evil however he reigned as consul and emperor fourteen years for there was no obvious way of remedying it but by taking possession of a part of that garden which so long had been thrown open to the public that it now considered it as its own sustained by the congregated wealth of france and secretly by those nations with whom his predecessor had to contend louisphilippe has boldly broken ground by forming two little gardens beneath the palace windows which he has separated from the public promenade by ditches and low railings but which serves effectually to take possession to keep the tiger at a distance and to open the way for farther improvement in the end there will probably be a wing of the palace thrown forward into the garden unless indeed the whole of the present structure should be destroyed to make place for one more convenient and of purer architecture  paris enjoys a high reputation for the style of its public edifices and while there is a very great deal to condemn compared with other capitals i think it is entitled to a distinguished place in this particular the church of the magdalen napoleons temple de la gloire on which the names of distinguished frenchmen were to be embossed in letters of bronze is one of the finest modern edifices of europe it is steadily advancing to completion having been raised from beneath the cornices during my visit it is now roofed and they are chiseling the basreliefs on the pediment the gardesmeubles two buildings which line one entire side of the place louis seize or de la concorde as it is now termed and which are separated by the rue royale are among the best structures of the town some of their ornaments are a little meretricious but the prevalent french features of their architecture are more happy than common only one of these edifices belongs to the public and is now the hotel of the admiralty the other having been erected for symmetry though occupied as private dwellings and actually private property the bourse or exchange is another modern building that has an admirable general effect  of the private hotels and private gardens of paris a stranger can scarcely give a just account although it is now six years since i have been acquainted with the place they occasion surprise daily by their number beauty and magnificence relatively rome and florence and venice and genoa may surpass it in the richness and vastness of some of their private residences but rome excepted none of them enjoy such gardens nor does rome even in absolute connection with the town abodes of her nobles the roman villas15 are almost always detached from the palaces and half of them are without the walls as i have already described to you the private gardens of paris certainly cannot compare with these villas nor indeed can those which belong to the public but then there is a luxury and a quiet and a beauty about the five or six acres that are so often enclosed and planted in the rear of the hotels here that i do not think any other christian city can show in equal affluence the mode of living which places the house between court and garden as it is termed here is justly esteemed the perfection of a town residence for while it offers security by means of the gate and withdraws the building from the streeta desideratum with all above the vulgarit gives space and room for exercise and beauty by means of the verdure shrubbery trees and walks it is no unusual thing for the french to take their repasts in summer within the retirement of their gardens and this in the heart of one of the most populous and crowded towns of europe the miserable and minute subdivisions of our own towns preclude the possibility of our ever enjoying a luxury as great and yet as reasonable as this and if by chance some lucky individual should find the means to embellish his own abode and his neighbourhood in this way some speculation half a league off would compel him to admit an avenue through his laurels and roses in order to fill the pockets of a club of projectors in america everybody sympathises with him who makes money for it is a common pursuit and touches a chord that vibrates through the whole community but few indeed are they who can enter into the pleasures of him who would spend it elegantly rationally and with good taste if this were the result of simplicity it would at least be respectable but every one knows that the passion at home is for displayfinery at the expense of comfort and fitness being a prevalent evil  footnote 15 this word has a very different signification in italian from that which we have given it in english it means a garden in the country the house not being necessarily any part of it although there is usually a casino or pavilion  the private hotels are even more numerous than the private gardens land not always having been attainable of course these buildings vary in size and magnificence according to the rank and fortune of those who caused them to be constructed but the very smallest are usually of greater dimensions than our largest townhouses and infinitely better disposed though we have a finish in many of the minor articles such as the hinges locks and the woodwork in general and latterly in marbles that is somewhat uncommon even in the best houses of france when the question however is of magnificence we can lay no claim to it for want of arrangement magnitude and space  many american travellers will render you a different account of these things but few of our people stay long enough to get accurate notions of what they see and fewer still have free access to the sort of dwellings of which i now speak  these hotels bear the names of their several owners in the instances of the high nobility it was usual to build a smaller hotel near the principal structure which was inhabited by the inferior branches of the family and sometimes by favoured dependants for the french unlike ourselves are fond of maintaining the domestic relations to the last several generations frequently dwelling under the same roof and which it is the fashion to call the petit hôtel  our first apartments were in one of these petits hôtels which had once belonged to the family of montmorency16 the great hotel which joined it was inhabited and i believe owned by an american who had reversed the usual order of things by coming to europe to seek his fortune our next abode was the hôtel jumilliac in a small garden of a remote part of the faubourg st germain this was a hotel of the smaller size and our apartments were chiefly on the second floor or in what is called the third story in america where we had six rooms besides the offices our saloon diningroom c had formerly been the bedchamber dressingroom and antechamber of madame la marquise and gave one a very respectful opinion of the state of a woman of quality of a secondary class though i believe that this family too was highly allied from the rue st maur we went into a small countryhouse on the bank of the seine about a league from the gates of paris which a century since was inhabited by a prince de soubise as grand veneur of louis xv who used to go there occasionally and eat his dinner in a very good apartment that served us for a drawingroom here we were well lodged having some two or threeandtwenty wellfurnished rooms offices included from this place we went into the rue des champselysées where we had a few rooms in a hotel of some size oddly enough our predecessor in a portion of these rooms was the prince polignac and our successor marshal marmont two men who are now proscribed in france we have been in one or two apartments in nameless edifices since our return from germany and we are now in a small hotel in the rue st dominique where in some respects we are better lodged than ever though compelled to occupy three floors here the salon is near thirty feet in length and seventeen high it is panelled in wood and above all the doors of which real and false there are six are allegories painted on canvass and enclosed in wrought gilded frames four large mirrors are fixtures and the windows are vast and descend to the floor the diningroom which opens on a garden is of the same size but even loftier this hotel formerly had much interior gilding but it has chiefly been painted over it was built by the physician of the duc dorléans who married madame de montesson and from this fact you may form some idea of the style maintained by the nobles of the period a physician at that time being but a very inferior personage in europe  footnote 16 this ancient family still exists though much shorn of its splendour by the alienation of its estates in consequence of the marriage of charlotte de montmorency heiress of the eldest line with a prince of condé two centuries since by this union the estates and chateaux of chantilly ecouen etc ancient possessions of the house passed into a junior branch of the royal family in this manner enghien a seigneurie of the montmorencies came to be the title of a prince of the blood in the person of the unfortunate descendant of charlotte of that name at the present time besides the duc de montmorency the duc de lavalmontmorency the duc de luxembourg the prince de bauffremont the prince de tancarville and one or two more are members of this family and most of them are or were before the late revolution peers of france the writer knew at paris a colonel de montmorency an irishman by birth who claimed to be the head of this celebrated family as a descendant of a cadet who followed the conqueror into england there are two irish peers who have also pretensions of the same sort though the french branches of the family look coolly on the claim the title of first christian baron is not derived from antiquity ancient as the house unquestionably is but from the circumstance that the barony of montmorency from its local position in sight of paris aided by the great power of the family rendered the barons the first in importance to their sovereign the family of talleyrandperigord is so ancient that in the middle ages when a king demanded of its head who made you count de perigord he was asked by way of reply who made you king of francegod i think i should have hesitated on the score of taste about establishing myself in a house of the montmorencies but jonathan has usually no such scruples our own residence was but temporary the hotel being public  in describing these residences which have necessarily been suited to very moderate means i have thought you might form some idea of the greater habitations first and last i may have been in a hundred and while the italian towns do certainly possess a few private dwellings of greater size and magnificence i believe paris contains in proportion more noble abodes than any other place in europe london in this particular will not compare with it i have been in some of the best houses in the british capital but very few of them rise to the level of these hotels in magnificence and state though nearly all surpass them in comfort i was at a ball given by the count  when thirteen rooms en suite were opened the duke of devonshire can hardly exceed this prince borghese used on great occasions to open twenty if i remember right at florence one of which was as large as six or eight of our ordinary drawingrooms although as a whole nothing can be more inconvenient or irrational than an ordinary townhouse in new york even we excel the inhabitants of these stately abodes in many of the minor points of domestic economy particularly in the offices and in the sleepingrooms of the second class  your question as to the comparative expense of living at home and of living in europe is too comprehensive to be easily answered for the prices vary so materially that it is difficult to make intelligent comparisons as between paris and new york so long as one keeps within the usual limits of american life or is disposed to dispense with a multitude of little elegancies the advantage is essentially with the latter while no money will lodge a family in anything like style or with suites of rooms antechambers c in new york for the simple reason that buildings which possess these elegancies or indeed with fine apartments at all have never yet been erected in the country a family can be better lodged in a genteel part of the town for less money than it can be lodged with equal room and equal comforts in a genteel quarter of paris always excepting the inferior distribution of the rooms and other little advantages such as the convenience of a porter c all of which are in favour of the latter place17 food of all kinds is much the cheapest with us bread alone excepted wines can be had as a whole better and cheaper in new york if obtained from the winemerchant than in any european town we have yet inhabited even french wines can be had as cheap as they can be bought here for the entranceduty into the country is actually much less than the charges at the gates of paris the transportation from bordeaux or champagne or burgundy is not as a whole essentially less than that to new york if indeed it be any less all the minor articles of table luxuries unless they happen to be of french growth or french fabrications are immeasurably cheaper in america than here clothes are nominally much cheaper here than with us but neither the french nor the english use habitually as good clothes as we nor are the clothes generally as well made you are not however to suppose from this that the americans are a welldressed people on the contrary we are greatly behind the english in this particular nor are our men usually as well attired as those of paris this is a consequence of a want of servants negligent habits greediness of gain which monopolizes so much of our time as to leave little for relaxation and the high prices of articles which prevent our making as frequent calls on the tailor as is the practice here my clothes have cost me more in europe however than they did at home for i am compelled to have a greater variety and to change them oftener  footnote 17 in new york the writer has a house with two drawingrooms a diningroom eight bedrooms dressingrooms four good servants rooms with excellent cellars cisterns wells baths waterclosets etc for the same money that he had an apartment in paris of one drawingroom a cabinet four small and inferior bedrooms diningroom and antechamber the kitchens offices cellars etc being altogether in favour of the new york residence in paris water was bought in addition and a tax of forty dollars a year was paid for inhabiting an apartment or a certain amount of rent a tax that was quite independent of the taxes on the house doors and windows which in both cases were paid by the landlord  our women do not know what high dress is and consequently they escape many demands on the purse to which those of paris are compelled to submit it would not do moreover for a french belle to appear every other night for a whole season in the same robe and that too looking bedraggled and as jaded as its pretty wearer silks and the commoner articles of female attire are perhaps as cheap in our own shops as in those of paris but when it comes to the multitude of little elegances that ornament the person the salon or the boudoir in this country they are either wholly unknown in america or are only to be obtained by paying treble and quadruple the prices at which they may be had here we absolutely want the caste of shopkeepers as it exists in europe by shopkeepers i mean that humble class of traders who are content with moderate profits looking forward to little more than a respectable livelihood and the means of placing their children in situations as comfortable as their own this is a consequence of the upward tendency of things in a young and vigorous community in which society has no artificial restrictions or as few as will at all comport with civilization and the buoyancy of hope that is its concomitant the want of the class notwithstanding deprives the americans of many elegancies and some comforts which would be offered to them at as low rates as they are sold in the countries in which they are made were it not for the principle of speculative value which enters into nearly all of our transactions in paris the man or woman who sells a duchess an elegant bauble is half the time content to eat his humble dinner in a small room adjoining his shop to sleep in an entresol over it and to limit his profits by his wants the pressure of society reduces him to this level with us the thing is reversed and the consumer is highly taxed as a necessary result as we become more familiar with the habits of european life the demand will gradually reduce the value of these minor articles and we shall obtain them at the same relative prices as ordinary silks and shawls are now to be had at present it must be confessed that our shops make but indifferent figures compared with those of london and paris i question if the best of them would pass for more than fourthrate in london or for more than thirdrate here though the silkmercers at home might possibly be an exception to the rule  the amount of all my experience on this point is to convince me that so long as one is willing to be satisfied with the habits of american life which include a great abundance many comforts and even some few elegancies that are not known here such as the general use of carpets and that of many foreign articles which are excluded from the european markets by the different protective systems but which also do not know a great many embellishments of living that are common all over europe he can get along with a good deal less money in new york than in paris certainly with less if he mix much with the world     excursion up the rhine c   letter

undetermined health and pleasure being the objects though a portion of our party having never seen belgium it was settled to visit that country in the commencement of the journey let it end where it might the old caleche was repaired for the purpose fitted with a new rumble to contain francois and jetty the saxon femme de chambre hired in germany the vache was crammed sacks stowed passport signed and orders were sent for horses we are a little apt to boast of the facilities for travelling in america and certainly so long as one can keep in the steamboats or on the railroads and be satisfied with mere velocity no part of the world can probably compete with us the distances considered but we absolutely want the highest order of motion which i think beyond all question is the mode of travelling post by this method your privacy is sacred you are master of your own hours going where you please and stopping when you please and as for speed you can commonly get along at the rate of ten miles in the hour by paying a trifle in addition or you can go at half that rate should it better suit your humour a good servant and a good carriage are indispensable and both are to be had at very reasonable rates in this part of the world  i never felt the advantage of this mode of travelling and i believe we have now tried nearly all the others or the advantages of the parisian plan of living so strongly as on the present occasion up to the last moment i was undecided by what route to travel the furniture of the apartment was my own and it was our intention to return to paris to pass the winter the luggage had been stowed early in the morning the carriage was in the court ready to hook on and at ten we sat down quietly to breakfast as usual with scarcely a sign of movement about us like old campaigners the baggage had been knowingly reduced to the very minimum admissible no part of the furniture was deranged but everything was in order and you may form some idea of the facilities when you remember that this was the condition of a family of strangers that in half an hour was to start on a journey of several months duration to gothey knew not whither  a few minutes before ten clickclack clickclack gave notice of the approach of the posthorses the portecochère opened and two votaries of the oldfashioned boot enter each riding one and leading another horse all this is done quietly and as a matter of course the cattle are put before the carriage without a question being asked and the two liveried roadsters place themselves by the sides of their respective beasts in the mean time we had entered the caleche said adieu to the cook who was left in charge of the apartment a trust that might however equally well have been confided to the porter kissed our hands to the family of m de v and the other inmates of the hotel who crowded the windows to see us off up to this moment i had not decided even by what road to travel the passport had been taken out for brussels and last year you may recollect we went to that place by dieppe abbeville douay and arras the par quelle route monsieur of the postilion that rode the wheelhorse who stood with a foot in the stirrup ready to get up brought me to a conclusion a st denis the question compelling a decision and all my doubts terminating as doubts are apt to terminate by taking the most beaten path  the day was cool and excessively windy while the thermometer had stood the previous afternoon but one at 93° in the shade we were compelled to travel with the carriagewindows closed the weather being almost wintry as we drove through the streets the common women cried after us they are running away from the cholera an accusation that we felt we did not merit after having stood our ground during the terrible months of april and may but popular impulses are usually just as undiscriminating as the favouritism of the great the mistake is in supposing that one is any better than the other  when we had reached the city where the kings of france are buried it was determined to sleep at senlis which was only four posts further the little town that we visited with so much satisfaction in 1827 this deviation from the more direct road led us by gonesse and through a district of grain country that is less monotonous than most of the great roads that lead from paris we got a good view of the chateau of ecouen looking vast and stately seated on the side of a distant hill i do not know into whose hands this princely pile has fallen since the unhappy death of the last of the condés but it is to be hoped into those of the young duc daumale for i believe he boasts the blood of the montmorencies through some intermarriage or other and if not he comes at least of a line accustomed to dwell in palaces i do not like to see these historical edifices converted into manufactories nor am i so much of a modern utilitarian as to believe the poetry of life is without its correcting and useful influences your cold naked utilitarian holds a sword that bruises as well as cuts and your sneaking trading aristocrat like the pickpocket who runs against you in the crowd before he commits his theft one that cuts as well as bruises  we were at ecouen not long before the death of its last possessor and visited its wide but untenanted halls with strong interest the house was first erected by some montmorency or other at or near the time of the crusades i believe though it has been much altered since still it contains many curious vestiges of the taste of that remote age the old domestic who showed us through the building was as quaint a relic as anything about the place he had accompanied the family into exile and passed many years with them in england in courtesy respect and delicate attention he would have done credit to the court of louis xiv nor was his intelligence unworthy of his breeding this man by the way was the only frenchman whom i ever knew address an englishman or as in my case one whom he mistook for an englishman by the old appelation of milord the practice is gone out so far as my experience extends  i remember to have learned from this courteous old servant the origin of the common term croisée which is as often used in large houses as that of fenêtre at the period when every mans heart and wishes were bound up in the excitement and enterprise of the crusades and it was thought that heaven was to be entered sword in hand the cross was a symbol used as a universal ornament thus the aperture for a window was left in the wall and a stone cross erected in the centre the several compartments in the casements came from the shape of the cross and the term croisée from croix all this is plain enough and perhaps there are few who do not know it but gazing at the ornaments of ecouen my eyes fell on the doors where i detected crosses in the most familiar objects there is scarcely a panelled door twenty years old in all america that does not bear this evidence of the zeal and if you will the superstition of those distant ages the form of the door is made by the exterior stile a cross is then built within it and the open spaces are filled with panels as in the case of the window it is filled with the sash the exactitude of the form the antiquity of the practice its obvious connexion with the common feeling and the inability to account for the usage in any other way leave no doubt in my mind of its origin though i do not remember to have ever met with such an account of it in any author if this conjecture be true we protestants while fastidiously not to say foolishly abstaining from the use of a symbol that prejudice has led us to think peculiarly unsuited to our faith have been unconsciously living with it constantly before our eyes but the days of puritan folly and puritan vice there is nothing more vicious than selfrighteousness and the want of charity it engenders are numbered and men are beginning to distinguish between the exaggerations of fanaticism and the meek toleration of pure christianity i can safely say that the lowest the most degraded and the most vulgar wickedness both as to tone and deed and the most disordered imaginations that it has ever been my evil fortune to witness or to associate with was met with at school among the sons of those pious forefathers who fancied they were not only saints themselves but that they also were to be the progenitors of long lines of saints it is a melancholy truth that a gentlemanlike training does more for the suppression of those abominations than all the dogmas that the pilgrims have imported into the country  we reached senlis in time for dinner and while the repast was getting ready we strolled through the place in order to revive the sensations with which we had visited it five years before but alas these are joys which like those of youth are not renewable at pleasure i could hardly persuade myself it was the same town the walls that i had then fancied lined with the menatarms of the charleses of france and the english henries and edwards had now lost all their peculiarities appearing mean and commonplace and as to the gate from which we had almost heard the trumpets of the heralds and the haughty answer to a bold summons of surrender we absolutely had difficulty in persuading ourselves that we had found it at all half europe had been roamed over since the time when fresh from america we made the former visit predisposed to gaze with enthusiasm at every relic of a former age and a different state of society  if we were disagreeably disappointed in the antiquities of the town we were as agreeably disappointed in the inn it was clean gave us a good dinner and as almost invariably proves to be the case in france also gave us good beds i do not remember ever to have been more fatigued than by the five posts between paris and this place the uneven pavés the random and careless driving of the postillions with whom it is a point of honour to gallop over the broken streets of the villages besides having a strong fellowfeeling for the smiths always makes the eight or ten posts nearest to paris much the most disagreeable part of a journey to or from the french capital  we dined at six exhausted the curiosities of senlis and went to bed by daylight  the next morning was fresh and bland and i walked ahead of the carriage a woodcutter was going to the forests to make faggots and we fell into discourse this man assured me that he should get only ten sous for his days work the view of the principal churchtower of senlis as beautiful and in a slight degree it carried the mind back to the fifteenth century  you have travelled to and from paris with me so often that i can only add we found the same fatiguing monotony on this occasion as on all the others we reached peronne early and ordered beds before dinner we strolled around the ramparts which are pleasant of themselves though the place stands in a marsh which renders its position not only strong but strongly disagreeable we endeavoured in vain to find some features to revive the pictures of quentin durward there was no sign of a soldier in the place though barracks were building the french are evidently less jealous of this frontier than of that on the east or the one next the austrians  the next morning we breakfasted at cambray here we found a garrison and considerable activity the citadel is well placed and the esplanade is a pretty walk we visited the cathedral which contains a monument to fenelon by our friend david we were much gratified by this work which ranks among his best near valenciennes we broke a tire and were detained two hours here the garrison was still stronger the place in better condition and the troops mounted guard with their marching accoutrements about them all of which i presume was owing to the fact that this is the last fortified town on the road we did not get to the frontier until seven and the french postilions broke another bolt before we got fairly rid of them compelling us to wait an hour to have it mended we were now in a low wet country or one perfectly congenial to cholera it was just the hour when the little demons of miasma are said to be the most active and to complete the matter we learned that the disease was in the village the carriagewindows were closed while i walked about from door to door to pacify uneasiness by curiosity use however had made us all tolerably indifferent and little p settled the matter by remarking it was nothing after all for here only two or three died daily while at paris there had been a thousand older heads than his often take material facts more in a lump than this  the change in the national character is so evident immediately on crossing into belgium as to occasion surprise the region was at no remote period all flanders the same language is still spoken the same religion professed in both countries and yet a certain secret moral influence appears to have extended itself from the capital of each country until they have met on the frontier where both have been arrested within their proper geographical limits we had come into this village on a gallop driven with the lighthearted étourderie of french vanity and we left it gravely under the guidance of postilions who philosophically smoked as their cattle trotted along like elephants  it was quite late when we reached mons where we found a good house of unexceptionable neatness of course we were in no haste to quit it the next day the distance to brussels was so short that we took it leisurely reaching the hôtel de leurope at three it was a fête on account of the anniversary of the arrival of leopold who had now reigned just a twelvemonth he passed our window while we were still at table on his way to the theatre the royal cortege was not very brilliant consisting of four carriages each drawn by two horses which by the way are quite enough for any coachman to manage in descending the formidable hill that leads from the great square  you have now been with me three times in brussels and i shall not go over the old ground again we revisited some of the more prominent places of interest and went to a few others that were neglected on former occasions among the rest we took a look at the public picturegallery which greatly disappointed us the flemish school naturally awakened our expectations but a fine gerard douw and a few other old paintings were all that struck us and as a whole we gave a preference to the paintings of the present day  the king appears to be personally popular even those who have no faith in the duration of the present order of things and who politically are his opponents speaking well of him the town has but few strangers though the presence of a court renders it a little more gay than it was last year the aspect of everything is gloomy for the country may be again engaged in a war of existence in a week many still think the affair will end in a partition france prussia and holland getting the principal shares i make no doubt that everybody will profit more by the change than they

the carriage to get a set of entirely new wheels brussels being a coachmaking town and taking a voiture de remise we drove down to antwerp while the horses rested we looked at the pictures in malines the miraculous draught of fishes is thought by many to be the chefdoeuvre of rubens but after conceding it a hardy conception and magnificent colouring i think one finds too much of the coarse mannerism of the artist even for such a subject the most curious part of the study of the different schools is to observe how much all have been influenced by external objects and how completely conventional after all the beau idéal of an artist necessarily becomes it would be impossible for one who knew the several countries to mistake the works of murillo rubens or raphael for the works of artists of different schools and this without reference to their peculiar manners but simply as flemings spaniards and italians rubens however is i think a little apt to outdutch the dutch he appears to me to have delighted in the coarse while raphael revelled in the pretty but raphael could and often did step out of himself and rise to the grand and then he was perfect because his grandeur was chastened  we reached antwerp some time before dinner the situation of the town was singular the dutch holding the citadel the place which was peopled by their enemies as a matter of course lying quite at their mercy the road from brussels is partly commanded by them and we saw their flag rising out of the low moundsfor in flanders the art of fortifying consists in burrowing as deep as possibleas we approached the town several dutch gunboats were in the river off the town and in the reaches of the scheldt below we got glimpses of divers frigates and corvettes riding at anchor as an offset to the works of their enemies the belgians had made a sort of entrenched camp by enclosing the docks with temporary ramparts the defences of the town aiding them in part in effecting their object  one of our first visits was to the cathedral this beautiful edifice had escaped without material damage from the recent conflicts though the garrison of the citadel have thrown a few shots at its tower most probably with a view to drive curious eyes out of it the great height enabling one to get a complete birdseye view of what is going on within their walls the celebrated rubenses were cased in massive timber to render them bombproof and of course were invisible  processions of peasants were passing from church to church the whole day to implore succour against the cholera which by the way and contrary to all rule for a low and moist country is said to be very light here the flemings have the reputation of being among the most bigoted catholics and the most ignorant population of europe this accounts in some measure for the existence of the latter quality among the first inhabitants of new york most of whom were from flanders rather than from holland i have found many of our names in antwerp but scarcely one in holland the language at home too is much nearer the flemish than the dutch though it is to be presumed that there must have been some colonists from holland in a province belonging to that nation i listened today to a fellow vending quack medicines and vilely printed legends to a song which tune and all i am quite sure to have heard in albany when a schoolboy the undeviating character and habits of the people too appear to be very much like those which existed among ourselves before the influx of eastern emigration swallowed up everything even to the suppan i remember to have heard this same quack singing this same song in the very same place in june 1828 when we first visited antwerp the effect was exceedingly ludicrous for it seemed to me that the fellow had been occupying the same spot employed in the same pursuits for the last five years although the country had been revolutionized this is also a little characteristic for some of our own communipaws are said to believe we are still the property of the united provinces  the flemish language has many words that are french in the spelling but which have entirely different meanings representing totally different things or ideas de is one in french this word pronounced der without dwelling on the last letter is a preposition generally meaning of before a name without being incorporated with it it is an invariable sign of nobility being even frequently affixed like the german von to the family name on attaining that rank in flemish it is an article and is pronounced precisely as a dutchman is apt to pronounced the meaning the same thus de witt means the white or white the flemings using the article to express things or qualities in the abstract like the french myn heer de witt is just the same as monsieur le blanc or monsieur du bois in french one of which means monsieur white and the other monsieur wood so nearly does this language resemble the english that i have repeatedly comprehended whole sentences in passing through the streets now in new york we used to think the dutch had become corrupted by the english but i fancy that the corruption has been just the other way  we had made the acquaintance of a flemish artist of extraordinary merit at paris and this gentleman mr wappers kindly called this morning to take us to see the gallery the collection is not particularly large nor is it rich in cabinet pictures being chiefly composed of altarpieces taken from churches the works are principally those of rubens vandyke and a few of the older masters the vandykes i think are the best on the whole it struck me there were more curious than pleasing pictures in this gallery although they are all valuable as belonging to a school the study of the descent from the cross is among them and it gave me more pleasure than anything else vandyke certainly rose in our estimation after this close comparison with his great rival he is altogether more human than rubens who is a sort of dutch giant in the art out of the natural proportions and always a giant  mr wappers permitted us to see his own paintingroom he is of the school of the great flemish masters and i think quite at the head of his profession in many of its leading points it was curious to trace in the works of this young artist the effects of having rubens and vandyke constantly before him corrected by the suggestions of his own genius his style is something between the two broader and bolder than vandyke and less robust than rubens  we went the round of the churches for if italy be the land of marbles belgium is or rather has been the very paradise of those who carved in wood i have seen more delicate and highlyfinished works of this sort in a small way in other countries as in the high reliefs of santa maria della salute at venice but nowhere else is so much attempted or indeed so much achieved in this branch of art as here many of the churches are quite surrounded by oak confessionals that are highly and allegorically ornamented though in general the pulpits contain the most elaborate designs and the greatest efforts of this curious work one at brussels has the conversion of st paul horse rider and all larger than life the whole is well wrought even to the expression but the best specimens of carving in wood that i remember were a few figures over the door of an hospital that we saw in 1828 though i now forget whether it was at gorcum or at breda one often sees statuary of great pretension and a widespread reputation that is wanting in the nature simplicity and repose of these figures  we went to see a collection of pictures owned by mr van lankeren it is a very fine gallery but there are few paintings by very great artists a van der heyden an old new york name by the way surpassed anything i know in its atmosphere poussin and our own artist cole excel in this high merit but this picture of van der heyden has a cold gray transparency that seems actually to have transferred a dutch atmosphere to the canvass  we returned to brussels in time to dine at malines i stood with admiration beneath the great tower which possesses a rare majesty had it been completed according to the original plan i believe it would have been the highest churchtower in europe in the evening we had a call from mr and mrs  and made an appointment to visit the palace of the prince of orange in the morning  i was up betimes next day and took a walk round the park and on the upper boulevards the injuries done in the fight have been in some measure repaired but the place was deserted and melancholy the houses line one side of the boulevards the other being open to the fields which are highly cultivated and unenclosed this practice of cutting off a town like a cheeseparing is very common on the continent of europe and the effect is odd to those who are accustomed to straggling suburbs as in america and england  at ten we went to the palace according to appointment the royal abodes at brussels are very plain edifices being nothing more than long unbroken buildings with very few external ornaments this of the prince of orange stands in the park near that of the king and is a simple parallelogram with two gates the principal apartments are in the same form being an entire suite that are entered on one side and left on the other there is great good taste and elegance in the disposition of the rooms a few are rich especially the salle de bal which is really magnificent the place was kept just as it had been left by its last occupants leopold with good taste not to say good feeling religiously respecting their rights a pair of gloves belonging to the princess were shown us precisely on the spot where she had left them and her shawls and toys were lying carelessly about as if her return were momentarily expected this is true royal courtesy which takes thrones without remorse while it respects the baubles  this palace had many good pictures and among others a raphael there was a paul potter or two and a couple of pictures in the same stile as pendants by a living artist of the name of verboeckhoven whose works sustained the comparison wonderfully well  we were shown the window at which the robber entered who stole the jewels of the princess an event that has given room to the enemies of the house of nassau to torture into an accusation of low guilt against her husband18 i have never met a gentleman here who appeared to think the accusation worthy of any credit or who treated it as more than the gossip of underlings exaggerated by the agents of the press  footnote 18 this affair of the jewels of the princess of orange is one proof among many others of the influence of the vilest portion of mankind over their fellowcreatures it suited the convenience and views of some miscreant who pandered for the press and the world is full of them to throw out a hint that the prince of orange had been guilty of purloining the jewels to pay his gambling debts and the ignorant the credulous and the wondermongers believed a charge of this nature against a frank and generous soldier it was a charge that in the nature of things could only be disproved by detecting the robber and one that a prince and a gentleman would scarcely stoop to deny accident favoured the truth the jewels have oddly enough been discovered in new york and the robber punished now the wretch who first started this groundless calumny against the prince of orange belongs exactly to that school whose members impart to america more than half her notions of the distinguished men of europe  from the palace of the prince of orange we went to the house of prince auguste dahremberg to see his collection this is one of the best private galleries in europe though not particularly large it is rich in the works of teniers19 woovermans both cuyp potter rembrandt and the other masters of the country among others is a firstrate gerard douw another new york name  footnote 19 one hears of occasionally discovering good pictures in the streets an event that actually once occurred to the writer shortly after the revolution of 1830 in passing through the carrousel he bought a female portrait that was covered with dirt but not materially injured finding it beautifully painted curiosity led him to question the man who had sold it this person affirmed that it was a portrait of the wife of david teniers painted by himself he was not believed of course and the thing was forgotten until two picturedealers who accidentally saw it at different times affirmed that it was by teniers though neither knew the original of the likeness on examining the catalogues the writer found that such a picture had existed in paris before the revolution and that it was now lost but this picture was square while that was oval and much larger the dealer was questioned again on the appearance of the picture without giving him any clue to the object and he explained the matter at once by saying that it had once been oval but the canvass getting an injury he had reduced it to its present form since then an engraving has been discovered that scarce leaves a doubt as to the originality of the portrait  i passed the evening at the house of an english gentleman where the master of the lastnamed gallery was one of the company a guest a sir  amused me by the peculiarly british manner in which he conveyed a few remarks on america speaking of a countrywoman of ours who had lately been at brussels he said that she called standing up to dance taking the floor and he was curious to know if it were a usual form of expression with us i had to tell him we said a horse took the track in racing and as this lady came from a racing region she might have used it con amore especially in the gallopade capt  of the navy once called out to the ladies of a quadrille to shove off when he thought the music had got the start of them and it is lucky that this sir  did not hear him or he would have set it down at once as an americanism these people are constantly on the hunt for something peculiar and ridiculous in americans and make no allowance for difference in station provincialisms or traits of character heaven knows that we are not so very original as to be thus ruthlessly robbed of any little

liégeillumination in honour of the king   dear   in the morning the directorgeneral of public instruction called to obtain some information on the subject of the common school system in america i was a little surprised at this application the finance controversy having quite thrown me into the shade at the tuileries and this court being just now so dependent on that of france you will smile at this opinion but even facts are subject to such circumstances and great men submit to very little influences occasionally20 the old ground of explaining the power of the states had to be gone over and the affair was disposed of by agreeing that written querries should be sent to paris i had a similar application from a french functionary not long since a digest of the facts as they are connected with the state of new york was accordingly prepared and handed to the minister of public instruction this gentleman rose in debate with the document in his hand and got on well enough until he came to the number of children in the schools near half a million which appeared to him to be so much out of proportion to whole numbers a little exceeding two millions that without hesitation he reduced them on his own responsibility one half as a proof that no more was meant than to keep within reasonable bounds he immediately added or all there are now this is a fair specimen of the manner in which america is judged her system explained and her facts curtailed in europe everything must be reduced to a european standard to be even received had we been calmucks or kurds any marvel might go down but being deemed merely deteriorated europeans tanned to ebony our facts are kept closely within the current notions such a disproportion between adults and minors being unknown in this hemisphere it was at once set down as an american exaggeration to pretend to have them in the other what were our official returns to a european prejudice  footnote 20 a few months before this a friend not a frenchman called on the writer at paris he began to make inquiries on the subject of american parliamentary law that were entirely out of the track of his usual conversations and finally submitted a series of written questions to be answered when the subject was disposed of the writer asked his friend the object of these unusual investigations and was told that they were for the use of a leading deputy who was thoroughly juste milieu surprised at the name the writer expressed his wonder that the application had not been made to a certain agent of the american government whose name had already figured before the public as authority for statistical and political facts against him the answer was in substance that those facts were intended for effect  not long since an artist of reputation came to me in paris with a view to get a few hints for a map of the hudson that had been ordered as an illustration of one of our books he was shown all the maps in my possession some of which were recent and sufficiently minute i observed some distrust in his manner and in the end he suggested that an old french map of the canadas that he had in his pocket might possibly be more accurate than those which had just been received from america the map was produced and as might have been expected was utterly worthless but an intimation to that effect was not well received as the artist had not been accustomed to consider the americans as mapmakers at length i was compelled to show him poughkeepsie laid down on his map directly opposite to albany and to assure him gravely that i had myself travelled many a time in a north and south direction from sunrise to sunset in order to go from one of these places to the other and that they were eighty miles asunder  we left brussels at noon and reached louvain at three though not taken so completely by surprise as we were last year the townhouse still gave us great pleasure they were at work repairing it and the fresh stones gave it a mottled look but on the whole it is one of the most extraordinary edifices i know it is a sort of condensation of quaintness that is quite without a rival even in this land of laboured and curious architecture the little pavilion of the prince of orange that lies on the road was still deserted and respected i dare say his fishingrods and fowlingpieces are intact while his inheritance is shorn of half its glory  there was a quarantine before entering the prussian states on account of the cholera and having understood that we should gain in time after quitting brussels beyond which the malady has not yet extended we went no farther than thirlemont where we passed the night the place is insignificant and the great square was chiefly occupied by awkward squads of the new levies who were drilling as fast as they could in readiness for the dutch the belgians have reached protocol no 67 and they begin to think it is most time now to have something more substantial they will find king william of the true hardkopping breed  the next morning we posted down to liége in time to take a late breakfast the road from brussels to this place has run through a fertile and wellcultivated country but the scene changed like magic as soon as we got a glimpse of the valley of the meuse liége has beautiful environs and the town is now the seat of industry coalpits abound in the immediate vicinity and iron is wrought in a hundred places as we drove through the antique and striking court of the venerable episcopal palace and emerged on the great square we found the place alive with people and our arrival at the soleil dor produced a sensation that seemed inexplicable landlord laquais populace and all ran to greet us and people were hurrying to the spot in every direction there was nothing to be done but to wait the result patiently and i soon saw by the cold looks of the servants and the shrug of françois who had jumped down to order rooms that there was mutual disappointment everybody turned their backs upon us and there we sat in the shadow of neglect after having momentarily shone in the sunshine of universal observation it had been merely ascertained that we were not the king of the belgians and his brother the grand duke of saxecobourggotha the soleil dor which like other suns is most apt to shine on the great veiled its face from us and we were compelled to quit the great square and to seek more humble lodgings these were soon obtained at the black eagle a clean and good house  i went to the police immediately with my passport and found that one of our five days of quarantine had been comfortably gotten rid of at thirlemont  these quarantines are foolish things and quite easily evaded you have been told the manner in which last year instead of spending five times twentyfour hours in a hut shut up with a russian princess i drove into the court of our own hotel in paris on the evening of the fifth day and m you will remember merely turned the flanks of a sentinel or two by walking a mile in the fields we were advised on this occasion to have our passport viséd at brussels the moment we arrived and the intermediate time would have counted on the frontier but being in no haste we preferred proceeding regularly  the next day the town filled rapidly and about noon the cannon announced the entrance of the king a worse salute was never fired but his majesty is greeted with smiling faces which is probably more to his liking he is certainly a prudent and respectable man if not a great one and just now very popular i met him and his brother in the streets the day after their arrival they were in an open carriage and pair with two boys the sons of the duke on the front seat leopold has a grave and thoughtful face and is far from being as welllooking as his brother who is a large comely man not unlike the duke bernard of saxeweimar so well known in america all the princes of the saxon duchies that i have seen are large wellformed men while those of saxe royal as the kingdom is called are the reverse a diplomatic man here once remarked to me that this rule held good as to most of the protestant and catholic princes throughout europe the close intermarriages of the latter in his opinion affecting the stock the imagination has had something to do with this notion for there are certainly many exceptions on both sides if indeed it be a rule at all i think there is little doubt that the habits of the mind mode of living and climate contribute essentially to vary the physiognomy but i cannot subscribe fully to the influence of these intermarriages which by the way are nearly if not quite as circumscribed among the protestants as among the catholics the portion of europe that is governed by princes is divided among fortyfour different states21 of whom twentyeight are protestant one a greek one a mahomedan and the rest are catholics these fortyfour sovereigns claim to be descended from nineteen different roots thus the direct male descendants of hugh capet occupy the thrones of france spain naples lucca and portugal the latter being derived from an illegitimate son of a duke of burgundy before the accession of the bourbon branch the houses of austria baden tuscany and modena are derived from a duke of alsace who flourished in the seventh century i was mistaken in a former letter in saying that the family of lorraine is different from that of habsbourg for it is said to be derived in the male line equally from this prince of alsace the hohenzollerns are on the throne of prussia and possess the two little principalities of that name while the emperor of russia is merely a prince of holstein these families have been intermarrying for a thousand years and it is not possible that they should have entirely escaped some personal peculiarities still as a whole they are quite as fine physical specimens of humanity as the average of their subjects the princes of russia are singularly fine men the house of denmark welllooking the saxons the royal branch excepted more than usually so the house of wurtemburg very like the english family the bourbons as a family are a fine race the austrians peculiar and less comely though the women are often quite handsome don miguel is a little beauty very mild and gentlemanlike in his appearance though lady  who sat next him at dinner on a certain occasion assured me she saw nothing but blood and rapine in his countenance her father lord  one of the ablest men of his time and one familiar with high political events gravely assured me he gave implicit credence to the tales we have heard of the outrages committed by this prince and which if true render him a fit subject for the gallows but i have seen so much of the exaggeration of factions that incredulity perhaps has got to be a fault with me i longed to tell lord  what i had heard in england under his very nose of himself among other absurdities i had shortly before this very conversation heard a respectable englishman affirm that such was the morgue aristocratique of this nobleman that he compelled his wife and daughters to walk backwards in quitting his presence as is done at court this was said of a man whom i found to be of more simple offhand unpretending gentlemanlike deportment whose demeanour had more of the nice tact which neither offends by superciliousness nor wounds by condescension than that of any other man of rank in england to return to our subjectthe austrian face is certainly getting to be prevalent among the southern catholic families for all of them are closely allied to the house of habsbourg by blood but i do not see any more in the physique of the saxon dukes than the good old saxon stamina nor aught in the peculiar appearance of the royal branch but an accident  footnote 21 this excludes lichtenstein monaco and greece  three or four days of leisure have enabled us to look very thoroughly at the exterior of liége which is certainly an interesting town with lovely environs there are some very good old houses along the banks of the river and a few of the churches are noble edifices the cathedral and the church of st jaques in particular are venerable and interesting structures and i stood beneath their lofty arches listening to the chants of the choir and inhaling the odours of the incense with a satisfaction that never tires i sometimes wish i had been educated a catholic in order to unite the poetry of religion with its higher principles are they necessarily inseparable is man really so much of a philosopher that he can conceive of truth in its abstract purity and divest life and the affections of all the aids of the imagination if they who strip the worship of god of its factious grace earnestly presented themselves in the garb of moral humility rendering their familiar professions conformable to their general tenets and stood before us as destitute of selfesteem as they are of ornament one might not so much feel the nakedness of their rites but as a rule the less graceful the forms and the more intense the spirituality of the minister of the altar become the higher is his tone of denunciation and the more palpable his selfrighteousness in point of fact when the proper spirit prevails forms of themselves become of little account and when men begin to deem them otherwise it is proof rather of the want than of the excess of the humility and charity which are the inseparable companions of faith i do not say that i would imitate all the unmeaning and irreverent practices of the romish church and least of all could one wish to see the devout and solemn manner of the protestant ministering at the altar supplanted by the unintelligible mumblings of the latin breviaries but why have we denounced the holy symbol of the cross the ornaments of the temple the graceful attire and the aid of music it is impossible i think for the american who has visited europe not to feel the want of edifices reared in honour of god which everywhere exists in his own country i do not mean churches in which the comfort and convenience of the pewholders have been mainly consulted for these pious speculations abound but temples to mark a sense of the superiority of the deity and which have been reared in his honour it may be easy enough to account for the absence of such buildings in a country so peopled and still so young but this does not make the deficiency the less obvious  in this hemisphere scarcely a village is approached that the high roof and towers of a church do not form its nucleus the temple appearing to spread its protection over the humbler abodes of men the domes the pointed and lofty arches and the gothic tracery of cathedrals soar above the walls of cities and everywhere man is congregated he appears to seek shelter under the widespreading wings of the church it is no argument to say that true religion may exist without these edifices for infidelity may also exist without them and if it be right or useful to honour god at all in this manner it is a right and a usefulness to which we have not yet attained the loftiest roofs of an american town are invariably its taverns and let metaphysics get over the matter as it may i shall contend that such a thing is at least unseemly to the eye with us it is not gog and magog but grog or no grog we are either a tame plane of roofs or a pyramid in honour of brandy and mintjuleps when it comes to the worship of god each man appears to wish a nutshell to contain himself and his own shades of opinion but when there is question of eating and drinking the tent of pari banou would not be large enough to hold us i prefer large churches and small taverns  there are one or two usages especially of the romish church that are not only beautiful but which must be useful and salutary one is the practice of leaving the church open at all hours for the purposes of prayer i have seldom entered one of these vaulted vast and appropriate houses of god without finding fewer or more devotees kneeling at the different altars another usage is that of periodical prayer in the fields or wherever the peasants may happen to be employed as in the angelus c i remember with pleasure the effect produced by the bell of the village church as it sent its warning voice on such occasions across the plains and over the hills while we were dwellers in french or italian hamlets of all these touching embellishments of life america and i had almost said protestantism is naked and in most cases i think it will be found on inquiry naked without sufficient reason  the population of liége is still chiefly catholic i believe although the reign of the ecclesiastics has ceased they speak an impure french which is the language of the whole region along this frontier scott whose vivid pictures carried with them an impress of truth that misled his readers being by no means a man of either general or accurate attainment out of the immediate circle of his peculiar knowledge which was scottish traditions has represented the people of liége in quentin durward as speaking flemish an error of which they make loud complaints it being a point on which they are a little sensitive a poet may take great licences and it is hypercriticism to lay stress on these minor points when truth is not the aim but this is a blunder that might as well as not have been spared and probably would have been had the author given himself the trouble to inquire into the fact but for the complaints of the liégeois the error would not have been very generally known however certainly not by me had i not visited the place  the women of liége appear to labour even more than usual for this part of europe they are employed in fieldlabour everywhere but in the towns more attention is paid to the great distinctions between the employments of the sexes here however i saw them toiling in the coalyards and performing the offices of the common porters they were much employed in unloading the marketboats and yet they are far from being either coarse or ugly the men are short but sturdy the average stature appears to be about five feet five and a half inches but even this i think exceeds the average stature of the french  the town has been illuminated two nights in succession in honour of the king every one is occupied with his approaching marriage with the princess louisa of france or as it is now the fashion to say the princess louisa of orleansfor since the revolution of 1830 there is no longer a king nor any children of france it would have been better had more essential points been attended to and the old names retained in england matters are differently managed for there the government is always one of king lords and commons though it is constantly fluctuating and two of the parties are usually cyphers     letter xi  leave liégebanks of the mensespabeautiful promenadesrobinson

dear   on the fourth day of our quarantine we left liége if not with clean bills of health with passport bearing proof about it that would enable us to enter prussia the next morning the king and his brother having laid all the horses in requisition we did not get away before two but once on the road our postilions drove like men who had reaped a double harvest  the route lay for some distance along the banks of the meuse and the whole region was one of exquisite landscape beauties an intensely dark verdurea road that meandered through the valley occasionally shifting from bank to bankhillsides covered with fruittrees and fragrant with flowerscountryhouseshamletscottageswith every appearance of abundance and comfort and backgrounds of swelling land that promised equal beauty and equal affluence were the principal features of the scene the day was as fine as possible and everything bearing a leaf having just been refreshed with a recent shower we glided through this fairy region with something like enthusiasm with which we had formerly journeyed in switzerland and italy  the meuse however was soon abandoned for a tributary and after proceeding a few leagues the character of the country gradually changed although it still continued peculiar and beautiful the intensity of the verdure disappeared in a pale but still a decided greenthe forest thickenedthe habitations no longer crowded the wayside and we appeared to be entering a district that was altogether less populous and affluent than the one we had left but which was always neat picturesque and having an air of comfort we were gradually but almost imperceptibly ascending  this lasted for four hours when reaching a countryhouse the road turned suddenly at a right angle and ran for near a mile through an avenue of trees bounded by open meadows at the termination of this avenue we dashed into the streets of a small wellbuilt neat and compact village that contained about one hundred and fifty dwellings besides three or four edifices of rather more than usual pretensions this was the celebrated spa a wateringplace whose reputation was once coextensive with civilization  we drove to an inn where we dined but finding it crowded and uncomfortable i went out and hired a furnished house by the day putting our own servants with an assistant in possession of the kitchen next morning perceiving that i had been too hasty and that our lodgings were too confined i discharged them and took a better we got a diningroom two drawingrooms several bedrooms with offices etc all neat and wellfurnished for a napoleon a day i mention these things as they serve to show you the facilities a traveller enjoys in this part of the world nearly every house in spa is to be had in this manner fitted for the reception of guests the proprietor occupying a small building adjoining and usually keeping a shop where wine and groceries may be had servants can be engaged at any moment and one is thus enabled to set up his own ménage at an hours notice this mode is more economical for a large family than living at an hotel vastly more comfortable and more respectable dinners can be had from the taverns if desired françois being something of a cook with the aid of the spa assistant we lived entirely within ourselves you will remember that in hiring the house by the day i reserved the right to quit it at any moment  spa like most other places that possess chalybeate waters stands in the centre of a country that can boast but little of its fertility still time and cultivation have left it the character of pale verdure of which i have just spoken and which serves for a time to please by its novelty the hue looked neither withered nor sickly but it was rather that of young grasses it was a ghostly green the eye wanders over a considerable extent of naked fields when one is on the steep wooded hills under whose very brows the village is built and i scarcely can recall a spot where a stronger impression of interminable vastness is left than i felt while gazing at the illimitable swells of land that stretch away towards france the country is said to be in the mountains of the ardennes and once there was the forest through which the boar of ardennes was wont to roam but of forest there is now none and if there be a mountain spa must stand on its boundless summit high and broken hills do certainly appear but as a whole it is merely an upland region  the glory of spa has departed time was when the idle the gay and the dissolute crowded to this retired village to intrigue and play under the pretence of drinking the waters when its halls were thronged with princes and nobles and even monarchs frequented its fêtes and partook of its festivities the industrious inhabitants even now spare no pains to render the abode pleasant but the capricious taste of the age lures the traveller to other springs where still pleasanter haunts invite their presence germany abounds with wateringplaces which are usually rendered agreeable by a judicious disposition of walks and by other similar temptations in nothing are the moneygrasping and shiftless habits of america rendered more apparent than in the inferiority of her places of public resort in all these particulars nature has done a good deal for some of them but nowhere has man done anything worth naming  a trifling expenditure has rendered the rude hill which covered chiefly with evergreens overlooks spa a succession of beautiful promenades serpentine walks are led through its thickets agreeable surprises are prepared for the stranger and all the better points of view are ornamented by seats and summerhouses one of these places was covered by a permanent protection against the weather that had a name which amused us though it was appropriate enough so far as the shape went it was called a mushroom it being in fact a sort of wooden umbrella not unlike those which the french marketwomen spread over their heads in the streets of paris and which more sentimental and imaginative they term a robinson in honour of robinson crusoe22 this mushroom was the scene of a remarkable occurrence that it will scarcely do to relate but which taking all together furnishes a ludicrous sample of national manners to say nothing of miracles  footnote 22 pronounced robansown the writer once went to return the call of mr robinson at paris the porter denied that such a person lived in the hotel but here is his card mr robinson n rue  bah looking at the card ceci est monsieur robansown cest autre chose sans doute monsieur a entendu parler du célèbre robansown  the waters and the air together proved to be so much a tonic that we determined to pass a week at spa a who was so weak on leaving paris as scarcely to be able to enter the carriage gaining strength in a way to delight us all the cholera and the quarantine together induce a good many people to come this way and though few remain as long as ourselves the constant arrivals serve to keep attention alive among others the duke of saxecobourg passed a night here on his way home he appeared in the public room for a few minutes but so few were assembled that he retired it was said disappointed there is still some playing in public and occasionally the inhabitants of verviers an affluent manufacturing town near the prussian frontier come over in sufficient numbers to make a tolerably brilliant evening these meetings take place in the redoute a building of moderate dimensions erected in the heart of the place according to a very general german custom wauxhall the ancient scene of revelry standing aloof in the fields deserted and desolate as does a rival edifice of more recent existence the dimensions and style of these structures give one an idea of the former gaiety and magnificence of spa though the only use that either is now put to is to furnish a room for a protestant clergyman to preach in sundays  as health after all is the greatest boon of life we loitered at spa a fortnight endeavouring to while away the time in the best way we could short as was our stay and transient as were the visits we remained long enough to see that it was an epitome of life some intrigued some played and some passed the time at prayer i witnessed trouble in one ménage saw a parson drunk and heard much pious discourse from a captain in the navy  we got little ardennes horses which were constantly parading the streets led by countrymen in blouses to tempt us to mount and took short excursions in the vicinity sometimes we made what is called the tour of the springs of which there are several each differing from the others in its medicinal properties and only one of which is in the village itself the rest being a mile or more distant at other times we lounged in the shops admiring and purchasing the beautiful boxes and ornaments that are known as spa work and which are merely the wood of the hills coloured by being deposited for a time in the spring and then painted and varnished highly similar work is made in other places but nowhere else as beautifully as here  at length ennui got the better of the good air and the invigorating water and i sent for my passport and the horses françois by this time was tired of cooking and he carried the orders for both right joyfully while my bourgeois received his napoleons with many handsome expressions of regret that i dare say were truer than common in the mean time we hurried about with our cards of ppc bidding adieu to some without the slightest expectation of ever meeting them again and promising others to renew the acquaintance on the rhine or among the alps as events might decide at halfpast eleven all was ready and shaking hands with two countrymen who came to see us off we took our places and dashed away from our ménage of a fortnights duration as unceremoniously as we had stepped into it  the dogstar raged with all its fury as we drove through the close and pentup valleys that lie between spa and verviers at the latter place we began to ascend until finally we reached a broad and naked height that overlooked a wide reach of country towards the east this was the region that lies around the ancient capital of charlemagne and is now a part of what m de pradt has described as a façade thrown before europe or the modern and disjointed kingdom of prussia we reached the frontier on the height of land where everything proving to be en règle we met with no obstruction or delay  while crossing the swell of land just mentioned the wind changed with a suddenness that we are apt to think american but which occurs more frequently in this hemisphere or rather in this part of it than in our own the peculiarity of the american climate is its exaggeration rather than its fickleness its passages from extreme heat to extreme cold more than the frequency of its lesser transitions one never thinks of an umbrella in america with a cloudless sky whereas during the spring months in particular there is no security against rain an hour at a time near the western coast of europe more especially north of the bay of biscay on the present occasion we passed in a few minutes from the oven to the icehouse and were travelling with cloaks about us and closed windows long before we reached aixlachapelle at which ancient town we arrived about six unlike spa where we had the choice among a hundred furnished houses aix was so crowded that we got narrow lodgings with great difficulty in a secondrate hotel  as a matter of course although it was going over old ground with most of us we could do no less than look at the sights the environs of aix though exceedingly pretty and well ornamented by countryhouses are less beautiful than those of liege although charlemagne has been buried near a thousand years and there is no longer an emperor of germany or a king of the romans aixlachapelle is still a town of more than 30000 inhabitants it is a crowded and not a particularly neat place though material improvements are making and we have been more pleased with it this year than we were last the townhouse is a very ancient structure one of its towers being supposed to have been built by the romans and it is celebrated as having been the place of meeting of two european congresses that of 1748 and that of our own times it has a gallery of portraits of the different ambassadors a bigwigged if a not bigwitted set  the cathedral though imperfect is a noble and a curious monument the choir is modern that is to say of gothic workmanship and only five hundred years old while the main body is an antique rotunda that dates more than twice as far back or as remotely as the reign of charlemagne himself there is a circular gallery in it around which the thrones of the emperor and electors were formerly placed at the ceremonies of coronations each of these thrones was flanked by small antique columns brought from rome but which during the reign of napoleon in the spirit of monopoly and desecration23 that marked the era had been transferred to paris where some of them are still seen standing in the gallery of the tuileries a chair that was found in charlemagnes tomb stands in this gallery and was long used as a throne for the emperors  footnote 23 extract from the unpublished manuscript of these letters you have lately been at richmond hill said mr  did you admire the view as much as is the fashion to be frank with you i did not the park struck me as being an indifferent specimen of your parks and the view though containing an exquisite bit in the foreground i think as a whole is both tame and confused you are not alone in your opinion though i think otherwise canova walked with me on the terrace without seeming to be conscious there was anything unusual to be seen he scarcely regarded the celebrated view a second time did you know him he was dead before i came to europe poor canovai met him in paris in 1815 in a ludicrous dilemma it rained and i was crossing the carrousel in a fiacre when i saw canova stealing along near the walls covered in a cloak and apparently uncertain how to proceed i drove near him and offered him a seat he was agitated and appeared like a man who had stolen goods about him the amount of it was that they were distributing the pictures to their former owners and having an order to receive la madonna della seggiola he had laid hands on the prize and in his eagerness to make sure of it was carrying it off under his cloak he was afraid of being discovered and mobbed and so i drove home with him to his hotel i think mr  named this particular picture though i have somewhere heard it was never brought to paris having been sent to sicily for security it might therefore have been another painting  the cathedral is said to be rich in relics and among other things it has some of the manna from the desert and a bit of aarons rod it has a window or two in a retired chapel which have a few panes of exquisitely painted glass that are much more precious than either  at noon i sent my passport to the posthouse for horses and in return i had a visit from the postmaster in compliment to the republic of letters we said a few flattering things to each other much to the amusement of a when we took our departure  the country after quitting the valley of aix24 became flat and monotonous and it was in the midst of a vast level district that we found the town of juliers the capital of the ancient duchy buried behind grassy ramparts that were scarcely visible until we were actually passing them it is a tame and insignificant place at present at berghem a post or two further i had another visit from the postmaster and his clerk who made no scruple in asking me if i was the man who wrote books we talk a great deal of our national intelligence in america and certainly with truth when we compare ourselves with these people in many important particulars but blocks are not colder or can have less real reverence for letters arts or indeed cultivation of any kind than the great bulk of the american people there are a few among us who pretend to work themselves up into enthusiasm as respects the first more especially if they can get a foreign name to idolize but it is apparent at a glance that it is not enthusiasm of the pure water for this germany is the land of sensations whether music poetry arms or the more material arts be their object as for myself i can boast of little in this way beyond the homage of my two postmasters which perhaps was more than properly fell to my share but i shall never forget the feeling displayed by a young german at dresden whom chance threw in my way we had lodgings in a house directly opposite the one inhabited by tieck the celebrated novelist and dramatist having no proper means of introduction to this gentleman and unwilling to obtrude myself anywhere i never made his acquaintance but it was impossible not to know in so small a town where so great a celebrity lived next door to us was a swiss confectioner with whom i occasionally took an ice one day a young man entered for a similar purpose and left the room with myself at the door he inquired if i could tell him in which of the neighbouring hotels m tieck resided i showed him the house and paused a moment to watch his manner which was entirely free from pretension but which preserved an indescribable expression of reverence was it possible to get a glimpse of the person of m tieck i feared not some one had told me that he was gone to a wateringplace could i tell him which was the window of his room this i was able to do as he had been pointed out to me at it a few days before i left him gazing at the window and it was near an hour before this quiet exhibition of heartfelt homage ceased by the departure of the young man in my own case i half suspect that my two postmasters expected to see a man of less european countenance than the one i happen to travel with  footnote 24 aachen in german in french it is pronounced aislachapelle  it was near sunset when we reached the margin of the upper terrace where we began to descend to the level of the borders of the rhine here we had a view of the towers of cologne and of the broad plain that environs its walls it was getting to be dark as we drove through the winding entrance among bastions and halfmoons and across bridges up to the gates of the place which we reached just in season to be admitted without the extra formalities     letter

hotel in which we lodged was erected but it was a spacious building with fine lofty rooms and a respectable garden as the language of a country is influenced by its habits and in america everything is so much reduced to the standard of the useful that little of the graceful has yet been produced it may be well to remind you that this word garden signifies pleasuregrounds in europe it way even be questioned if the garden of eden was merely a potager  after breakfasting we began to deliberate as to our future movements here we were at cologne in prussia with the wide world before us uncertain whither to proceed it was soon decided however that a first duty was to look again at the unfinished cathedral that wonder of gothic architecture to make a pilgrimage to the house in which rubens was born to pay a visit to the eleven thousand virgins and to buy some cologne water after which it would be time enough to determine where we should sleep  the first visit was to the bones these relics are let into the walls of the church that contains them and are visible through a sort of pigeonholes which are glazed there is one chapel in particular that is altogether decorated with the bones arranged in this manner the effect being very much like that of an apothecarys shop some of the virgins are honoured with hollow wooden or silver busts lids in the tops of which being opened the true skull is seen within these relics are not as formidable therefore as one would be apt to infer the bones of eleven thousand virgins might be the grinning portion of the skulls being uniformly veiled for proprietys sake i thought it a miracle in itself to behold the bones of all these virgins but as if they were insufficient the cicerone very coolly pointed out to us the jar that had held the water which was converted into wine by the saviour at the marriage of cana it was asiatic in form and may have held both water and wine in its day  the cathedral is an extraordinary structure five hundred years have gone by and there it is less than half finished one of the towers is not forty feet high while the other may be two hundred the crane which is renewed from time to time though a stone has not been raised in years is on the latter the choir or rather the end chapel that usually stands in rear of the choir is perfect and a most beautiful thing it is the long narrow windows that are near a hundred feet in height are exquisitely painted creating the peculiar cathedral atmosphere that ingenious invention of some poet to render solemn architecture imaginative and glorious we could not dispense with looking at the skulls of the magi which are kept in an exceedingly rich reliquary or shrine they are all three crowned as well as being masked like the virgins there is much jewellery though the crowns had a strong glow of tinsel about them instead of the mild lustre of the true things rubens as you know was of gentle birth and the house in which he was born is just such a habitation as you would suppose might have been inhabited by a better sort of burgher it is said that mary of medicis the wife of henry iv died in this building and tradition which is usually a little ambitious of effect has it that she died in the very room in which rubens was born the building is now a publichouse  i do not know that there is a necessary connection between foul smells and cologne water but this place is the dirtiest and most offensive we have yet seen or rather smelt in europe it would really seem that people wish to drive their visitors into the purchase of their great antidote disagreeable as it was we continued to flaner through the streets until near noon visiting among other things the floating bridge where we once more enjoyed the sight of the blue waters of the rhine glancing beneath our feet  like true flaneurs we permitted chance to direct our steps and at twelve tired with foul smells and heat we entered the carriage threaded the halfmoons abbatis and grassy mounds again and issued into the pure air of the unfenced fields on the broad plain that stretches for miles towards the east or in the direction of bonn the day was sultry and we fully enjoyed the transition in this part of germany the postilions are no laggards and we trotted merrily across the wide plain reaching bonn long before it was time to refresh ourselves the horses were changed and we proceeded immediately as we left the town i thought the students who were gasping at the windows of their lodgings envied us the pleasure of motion having so lately accompanied me over this road i shall merely touch upon such points as were omitted before and keep you acquainted with our movements  the afternoon was lovely when passing the conical and castlecrowned steep of godisberg we approached the hills where the road for the first time runs on the immediate borders of the stream opposite to us were the seven mountains topped by the ruins of the drachenfels crag and masonry wearing the appearance of having mouldered together under the slow action of centuries and a little in advance the castle of rolandseck peered above the wooded rocks on our own side of the river two low islands divided the stream and on one of them stood the capacious buildings of a convent every one at all familiar with the traditions of the rhine has heard the story of the crusader who returning from the wars found his betrothed a nun in this asylum it would seem that lies were as rife before the art of printing had been pressed into their service or newspapers known as they are today for she had been taught to think him dead or inconstant it was much the same to her the castle which overlooked the island was built for his abode and here the legend is prudently silent although one is not bound to believe all he hears we are all charmed with the images which such tales create especially when as in this case they are aided by visible and tangible objects in the shape of good stone walls as we trotted along under the brow of the mountain that upholds the ruins of the castle of charlemagnes nephew my eye rested musingly on the silent pile of the convent that convent i called out to the postilion is still inhabited ja mein herr es ist ein gasthaus an innthe thing was soon explained the convent a community of benedictines had been suppressed some fifteen or twenty years and the buildings had been converted into one of your sentimental taverns with the closest scrutiny i could not detect a soul near the spot for junketing in a ruin is my special aversion a hamlet stood on the bank at no great distance above the island the postilion grinned when i asked if it would be possible to get horses to this place in the morning for it saved him a trot all the way to oberwinter he promised to send word in the course of the night to the relay above and the whole affair was arranged in live minutes the carriage was housed and left under the care of françois on the main land a night sack thrown into a skiff and in ten minutes we were afloat on the rhine our little bark whirled about in the eddies and soon touched the upper point of the island  we found convent gasthaus and sentiment without any preoccupants there was not a soul on the island but the innkeeper his wife a child a cook a crone who did all sorts of work and three prussian soldiers who were billeted on the house part of a detachment that we had seen scattered along the road all the way from bonn i do not know which were the most gladdened by the meeting ourselves or the good people of the place we at finding anything like retirement in europe and they at seeing anything like guests the man regretted that we had come so late for a large party had just left him and we felicitated ourselves that we had not come any sooner for precisely the same reason as soon as he comprehended our tastes he very frankly admitted that every room in the convent was empty there is no one but these on the island not a living being herr graf for these people have made a count of me whether or not here then were near two hundred acres environed by the rhine prettily disposed in wood and meadow absolutely at our mercy you can readily imagine with what avidity a party of young parisiennes profited by their liberty while i proceeded forthwith to inspect the ladder and then to inspect the cloisters sooth to say sentiment had a good deal to do with two of the courses of a dinner at nonnenswerth for so is the island called the buildings were spacious and far from mean and it was a pleasant thing to promenade in cloisters that had so lately been trodden by holy nuns and see your dinner preparing in a convent kitchen i could do no less than open a bottle of liebfraumilch in such a place but it proved to be a near neighbour to bonnyclabber  as the evening closed we took possession of our rooms our parlour had been that of the lady abbess and a had her bedchamber these were spacious rooms and well furnished the girls were put into the cells where girls ought never to be put jetty had another near them and these dispositions made i sallied forth alone in quest of a sensation  the intense heat of the day had engendered a gust the thunder was muttering among the seven mountains and occasionally a flash of lightning illumined the pitchy darkness of the night i walked out into the grounds where the wind was fiercely howling through the trees a new flash illumined the hills and i distinctly saw the naked rock of the drachenfels with the broken tower tottering on the halfruined crag looked fearful and supernatural by watching a minute another flash exposed rolandseck looking down upon me with melancholy solicitude big drops began to patter on the leaves and still bent on sensations i entered the buildings  the cloisters were gloomy but i looked into the vast smoked and cavernlike kitchen where the household were consuming the fragments of our dinner a light shone from the door of a low cell in a remote corner of the cloisters and i stole silently to it secretly hoping it would prove to be a supernatural glimmering above some grave the three prussians were eating their cheeseparings and bread by the light of a tallow candle seated on a stone floor it was short work to squeeze all the poetry out of this group  the storm thickened and i mounted to the gallery or the corridor above the cloisters which communicated with our own rooms here i paced back and forth a moment in obscurity until by means of a flash i discovered a door at one extremity of the passage bent on adventure i pushed and it opened as there were only moments when anything could be seen i proceeded in utter darkness using great caution not to fall through a trap had it been my happy fortune to be a foundling who had got his reading and writing by nature i should have expected to return from the adventure a herzog25 at least if not an erzherzog26 perhaps by some inexplicable miracle of romance i might have come forth the lawful issue of roland and the nun  footnote 25 duke  footnote 26 archduke  as it was i looked for no more than sensations of which the hour promised to be fruitful i had not been a minute in the unknown region before i found that if it were not the abode of troubled spirits it at least was worthy to be so you will remember that i am not now dealing in fiction but truth and that unlike those who read when they sing and sing when they read i endeavour to be imaginative in poetry and literal in my facts i am now dealing strictly with the latter which i expect will greatly enhance the interest of this adventure  after taking halfadozen steps with extreme caution i paused a moment for the whole air appeared to be filled by a clatter as if ten thousand bats wings were striking against glass this was evidently within the convent while without the wind howled even louder than ever my hand rested on something i knew not what at first i did not even know whether i was in the open air or not for i felt the wind saw large spaces of dim light and yet could distinguish that something like a vault impended over my head presently a vivid flash of lightning removed all doubt it flickered seemed extinguished and flared up again in a way to let me get some distinct ideas of the locus in quo i had clearly blundered into the convent chapel not upon its pavement which was on a level with the cloisters below but into an open gallery that communicated with the apartments of the nuns and my hand was on the chair of the lady abbess the only one that remained the dim light came from the high arched windows and the bats wings were small broken panes rattling in the gale but i was not alone by the transient light i saw several grim figures some kneeling others with outstretched arms bloody and seared and one appeared to be in the confessional at the sight of these infernal spectres for they came and went with the successive flashes of the lightning by a droll chain of ideas i caught myself shouting rather than singingship ahoy ship ahoywhat cheer what cheer in a voice loud as the winds at last here was a sensation halfadozen flashes rendered me familiar with the diabolicallooking forms and as i now knew where to look for them even their grim countenances were getting to be familiar at this moment when i was about to address them in prose the door by which i had entered the gallery opened slowly and the withered face of an old woman appeared in a flash the thunder came next and the face vanishedship ahoy ship ahoywhat cheer what cheer there was another pausethe door once more opened and the face reappeared i gave a deep and loud groan if you ask me why i can only say because it seemed to be wanting to the general effect of the scene and place the door slammed the face vanished and i was alone again with the demons by this time the gust was over i groped my way out of the gallery stole through the corridor into my own room and went to bed i ought to have had exciting dreams especially after the liebfraumilch but contrary to all rule i slept like a postilion in a cockloft or a midshipman in the middle watch  the next morning at breakfast a had a melancholy tale to relate how the poor old crone who has already been mentioned had been frightened by the gusthow she stole to the chapel to mutter a prayerhow she opened the door of the galleryhow she heard strange sounds and particularly certain groanshow she had dropped the candlehow the door had blown to and she miserable woman had stolen to the bed of her as maid whom she had implored to give her shelter and protection for the night we went in a body to look at the chapel after breakfast and it was admitted all round that it was well suited to produce a sensation in a thunderstorm of a dark night and that it was no wonder jettys bedfellow had been frightened but now everything was calm and peaceful the glass hung in fragments about the leaden sashes the chair and prièredieu of the lady abbess had altogether an innocent and comfortable air and the images of which there were several as horrible as a bungling workman and a bloody imagination could produce though of a suffering appearance were really insensible to pain while we were making this reconnoissance a bugle sounded on the main and looking out we saw the oberwinter postilion coming round the nearest bend in the river on this hint we took our leave of the island not forgetting to apply a little of the universal salve to the bruised spirit of the old woman whose dread of thunder had caused her to pass so comfortless a night  the day was before us and we went leisurely up the stream determined to profit by events the old castles crowned every height as you know and as we had the carriage filled with maps and books we enjoyed every foot of this remarkable road at andernach we stopped to examine the ruins of the palace of the kings of austrasia of whom you have heard before the remains are considerable and some parts of the walls would still admit of being restored the palace has outlasted not only the kingdom but almost its history this edifice was partly built of a reddish freestone very like that which is so much used in new york a material that abounds on the rhine  between andernach and coblentz the road passes over a broad plain at some little distance from the river though the latter is usually in sight it may give you some idea of its breadth if i tell you that as we approached neuwied it became a disputed point in the carriage whether the stream flowed between us and the town or not still the rhine is a mighty river and even imposing when one contemplates its steady flow and remembers its great length it is particularly low at present and is less beautiful than last year the colours of the water being more commonplace than usual  it was still early though we had loitered a good deal by the way to study views and examine ruins when we drew near the fortenvironed town of coblentz the bridge across the moselle was soon passed and we again found ourselves in this important station the territory opposite the city belongs to the duchy of nassau but enough has been ceded to the king of prussia to enable him to erect the celebrated ehrenbreitstein which is one of the strongest forts in the world occupying the summit of a rocky height whose base is washed by the rhine and whose outworks are pushed to all the neighbouring eminences the position of coblentz at the junction of the rhine and the moselle the latter of which penetrates into the ancient electorate of treves now belonging to prussia may render it an important station to that power but it does not strike me as military the enemy that can seize any one of its numerous outworks or forts must essentially command the place as at genoa it seems to me that too much has been attempted to succeed  last night we had a convent that was a parallelogram of six hundred feet by three hundred all to ourselves while this night we were crowded into a small and uncomfortable inn that was overflowing with people the house was noisy and echoish and not inappropriately called the three swiss  we crossed the river by the bridge of boats and ascended the opposite hill to enjoy the view there was another island up the stream with a ruined convent but unhappily it was not an inn the rhine is a frontier for much of its course washing the shores of france darmstadt bavaria baden nassau prussia c c for a long distance and permanent bridges are avoided in most places the floating bridges being constructed of platforms laid on boats that are united by clamps can be taken apart and withdrawn to either shore in an hour or two  we quitted coblentz at ten and now began in truth to enter the fine scenery of the rhine the mountains or rather hills for they scarcely deserve the former name close upon the river a short distance below the town and from that moment with very immaterial exceptions the road follows the windings of the stream keeping generally within a few yards of the water the departures from this rule are not more than sufficient to break the monotony of a perfectly uniform scene i have nothing new to tell you of the ruined castlesthe villages and towns that crowd the narrow strandthe even and wellkept roadsthe vinecovered hillsand the beautiful sinuosities of this great artery of europe to write any thing new or interesting of this wellbeaten path one must linger days among the ruins explore the valleys and dive into the local traditions we enjoyed the passage as a matter of course but it was little varied until we drew near the frontier of prussia when a castle that stood beetling on a crag immediately above the road caught my eye the building unlike most of its sister edifices appeared to be in good order smoke actually arose from a beacongrate that thrust itself out from an advanced tower which was nearly in a perpendicular line above us and the glazed windows and other appliances denoted a perfect and actual residence as usual the postilion was questioned i understood him to say that the place was called the ritterstein but the name is of little moment it was a castle of the middle ages a real hold of the rhine which had been purchased by a brother of the king of prussia who is now the governor of the rhenish provinces this prince had caused the building to be restored rigidly adhering to the ancient style of architecture and to be furnished according to the usages of the middle ages and baronial comfort what was more if the prince were not in his hold as probably would prove not to be the case strangers were permitted to visit it here was an unexpected pleasure and we hastened to alight admiring the governor of rhenish provinces his taste and his liberality with all our hearts  if you remember the satisfaction with which we visited the little huntingtower of the poor prince de condé in 1827 a building whose chief merit was its outward form and the fact that it had been built by the queen blanche you can form some notion of the zeal with which we toiled up the steep ascent on the present occasion the path was good tasteful and sinuous but the buildings stood on crags that were almost perpendicular on three of their sides and at an elevation of near or perhaps quite two hundred feet above the road  we were greeted on reaching the gate not by a warder but by the growl and bark of a ferocious mastiff who would have been more in keeping at his post near a henroost than at the portal of a princely castle one halfgroom halfseneschal and who was withal a little drunk however soon came forth to receive us and after an exhortation to the dog in a dutch that was not quite as sonorous as the growl of the animal he very civilly offered to do the honours of the place  we entered by a small drawbridge but the buildings stand so near the brow of an impending rock as to induce me to think this bridge has been made for effect rather than to renew the original design a good deal of the old wall remains especially in the towers which are mostly round and all that has been done with the exterior has been to fill the gaps and to reattach the balconies and the external staircases which are of iron i can no more give you a clear idea of the irregular form of this edifice with the pen than you would obtain of the intricate tracery of gothic architecture having never seen a gothic edifice or studied a treatise on the style by the same means you will understand the difficulty when you are told that this castle is built on crags whose broken summits are its foundations and give it its form the court is narrow and inconvenient carriages never approaching it but several pretty little terraces in front answer most of the purposes of courts and command lovely glimpses of the rhine in both directions these terraces like the towers and walls were placed just where there was room and the total absence of regularity forms one of the charms of the place  in the interior the ancient arrangement has been studiously respected the furniture is more than imitation for we were told that much of it had been taken from the royal collections of berlin by royal you are not to suppose however that there are any attempts at royal state but merely that the old castles of the barons and counts whose diminutive territories have contributed to rear the modern state of prussia have been ransacked for this end  the ritter saal or knights hall though not large is a curious room indeed it is the only one in the entire edifice that can be called a good room at all the fireplace is hugeso much so that i walked into it with ease and altogether in the ancient style there is a good deal of curious armour hung up in this room and it has many other quaint and rare objects the chandelier was a circle formed by uniting bucks horns which were fitted with lamps there was almost too much good taste about this for feudal times and i suspect it of being one of our modern embellishments a material picture of the past like a poem by scott there may have been some anachronisms in the furniture but we all use furniture of different ages when we are not reduced to the fidgety condition of mere gentility  in one corner of the bitter saal there stood an ancient vessel to hold water and beneath it was a porcelain trough to catch the drippings the water was obtained by turning a cock the chairs tables settees c were all of oak the coverings of the chairs i e backs and bottoms were richly embroidered in golden thread the work of different royal personages the designs were armorial bearings  all the stairs were quaint and remarkable and in one instance we encircled the exterior of a tower by one of them at a giddy elevation of near three hundred feet above the river the tower itself being placed on the uttermost verge of the precipice from this tower the grate of the beacon thrust itself forward and as it still smoked i inquired the reason we were told that the wad of a small piece of artillery that had been fired as a signal to the steamboat had lodged in the grate where it was still burning the signal had been given to enable the prince and his family to embark for they had not left the place an hour when we arrived tempora mutantur since the inhabitants of such a hold can go from bingen to coblentz to dine in a steamer  we saw the bedrooms the prince slept on an inner camp bedstead but the ladies occupied bunks let into the walls as in the olden time the rooms were small the bitter saal excepted and low though there were a good many of them one or two were a little too much modernized perhaps though on the whole the keeping was surprisingly good a severe critic might possibly have objected to a few anachronisms in this romaunt but this in a fault that prince frederic shares in common with shakspeare and sir walter scott  i cannot recall a more delightful hour than that we passed in examining this curiosity which was like handling and feeding and playing with a living cameleopard after having seen a dozen that were stuffed                                       in reference to the controversy touching the expenses of the american government alluded to in page 37 of this volume the following particulars may not be uninteresting  early in the day the party who conducted the controversy for the other side began to make frequent allusions to certain americansplusieurs honorables américains was the favourite expressionwho he alleged had furnished him with information that went to corroborate the truth of his positions and as a matter of course to invalidate the truth of ours secret information reached me also that a part at least of our own legation was busy for the other side at one period m perier the premier of france publicly cited the name of the minister himself at the tribune as having given an opinion against those who conducted the controversy on the side of the american system and in favour of our opponents i understand mr rives declares that m perier had no authority either for using his name or for attributing such sentiments to him although the statement as yet stands uncontradicted before the world you will probably be startled when i tell you that this is the third instance within a few months in which the public agents of america have been openly quoted as giving evidence against the action of the american system the two other cases occurred in the british parliament and in one of them as in this of mr rives the agent was quoted by name it is not in my power to say whether these gentlemen have or have not been wrongfully quoted but all cannot be right when they are quoted at all figure to yourself for a moment what would be the effect of a member of congress quoting the minister of a foreign government at washington as giving an opinion against a material feature of the polity he represented and the disclaimers and discussions not to say quarrels that would succeed how is it that the representatives of exclusion are so much more faithful to the interests of their principals than the representatives of liberal institutions  some will tell you that the condition of europe is critical that our own relations with certain countries are delicate and that it is expedient to temporize in the first place judging from my own observations i do not believe there is any of the muchtalkedof temporizing spirit about all this compliance but that in most of the cases in which the agents of the government disown the distinguishing principles of the institutions and these cases have got to be so numerous as to attract general attention and to become the subject of sneering newspaper comments it is out of the fulness of the heart that the mouth speaketh but allowing that the first position is true and that these gentlemen actually acquiesce for the sake of quiet and with a view to advance what they conceive to be the interests of america i shall maintain that the course is to the last degree impolitic and unworthy our motto is to ask nothing but what is right and to submit to nothing that is wrong apart from the sound morality of this sentiment the wisdom of solomon could not better express the true policy of a nation situated like our own it can hardly be pretended that the right for which we ask ought to be purchased at the disgraceful price of abandoning the truth this would be truly bargaining away a better right for another of less value these gentlemen of expedients may beat their brains as much as they please they will never invent any means so simple and so sure of attaining the great ends included in the political maxim just quoted as by adhering to the plain direct dictates of common honesty each trifling temporary advantage they may gain will certainly and speedily be met by some contingent disadvantage that will render them losers by the exchange27  footnote 27 as respects france the result has shown the impolicy of the temporizing system the french government finding such a disposition to compliance in the agents that were placed near it by america has quite reasonably inferred that the mass at home acted on the same temporizing and selfish policy and has treated a solemn compact that contains a tardy and very insufficient reparation for some of the greatest outrages that were ever committed by one civilized nation on the rights of another as a matter quite within its own control this consequence was foreseen by the writer and foretold in a letter that was written in 1832 and published as far back as the year 1833 it was only necessary to be on the spot and to witness the contempt and indifference engendered by this miserable policy to predict the events which have since occurred the accidental situation of europe has favoured us and we owe the tardy reparation that has been received more to russia than to ourselves  to return to france and the controversy on finance our opponents had at length the indiscretion to publish a document that they said had been furnished them by some of their honorables américains and by which they attempted to prove some one of their various positions for by this time they had taken a great many scarcely any two of which agreed i have no doubt that this document in the present instance did come from americans though it originally came from captain basil hall this gentleman had appended to his travels a table which purported to contain an arranged statement of the cost of the state governments you will form some idea of the value of this table as a political and statistical document by an exposure of one or two of its more prominent errors taking for instance our own state the receipts from the property of the state such as its canal common school literature and other funds necessarily passing through the treasury the sum total is made to figure against us as the annual charge of government which by these means is swelled to five times the real amount every one knows that the receipts of the canals alone the moment that the conditions of the loans effected to construct them shall admit of their application will be more than sufficient to meet the entire charges of the state government twice over but by this mystified statement we are made to appear the poorer for every dollar of properly we possess and yet this is the nature of the evidence that some of our people furnished to the writers on the french side of this question a side that by their own showing was the side of monarchy  but this is not all a citizen has been found willing under his own name to espouse the argument of the french writers of the validity of the statements presented by this gentleman mr leavitt harris of new jersey or of the force of his reasoning i shall say nothing here for his letter and our answers will sufficiently speak for themselves the administration party however have thought the statements of mr harris of sufficient importance to be published in a separate number of their literary organ la revue britannique and to dwell upon it in all their political organs as the production of an american who has been intrusted by his government with high diplomatic missions and who consequently is better authority than an unhonoured citizen like myself who have no claims to attention beyond those i can assemble in my argument28 the odds as you will perceive are greatly against me for in these countries the public know little of the details of government and it gives a high sanction to testimony of this nature to be able to say it comes from one who is or has been connected with an administration standing as i do therefore contradicted by the alleged opinion true or false of mr rives and by this statement of mr harris you will readily conceive that my situation here is not of the most pleasant nature unsalaried and untrusted by my own government opposed in appearance at least by its agents i am thrown for the vindication of truth completely on my own resources so far as any american succour has been furnished and am reduced to the narrow consolation of making this simple record of the facts which possibly at some future day may answer the purpose of an humble protest in favour of the right  footnote 28 the french writers to make the most of their witness exaggerated a little for at that time mr harris had never filled any higher diplomatic station than that of one left chargé des affaires of the legation at st petersburg during the absence of mr adams at ghent shortly after the publication of this letter however he was appointed by the president and the senate of the united states of america to represent it at the king of the french as if expressly to give value to his testimony  this controversy has at least served to remove the mask from this government on the subject of its disposition towards america and her institutions to that pretended feeling i have never been even momentarily a dupe but failing of argumentsfor no talents or ingenuity after all can make the wrong the rightmost of the writers on the other side of the question have endeavoured to enliven their logic with abuse i do not remember anything in the palmy days of the quarterly review that more completely descended to low and childish vituperation than some of the recent attacks on america much of what has been written is unmitigated fraud that has been meant to produce an impression on the public mind careless of any other object than the end but much also i think has really been imagined to be true while it is in fact the offspring of the prejudices that studied misrepresentation has so deeply implanted in the opinions of europe as we are not immaculate of course a greater portion of their charges is true than one could wish some of the allegations are so absurd that it may amuse you to hear them the french consider the sabbath as a day of recreation and after going to mass a duty by the way that few besides women discharge in paris the rest of the time is devoted to dancing and other amusements with a view to act on the rooted opinions of the nation on this subject the american practice of running a chain across the street in front of the churches to prevent the rattling of the carriages from disturbing the worship a practice by the way that is quite as much european as it is american and which has never even been very general among us has been so represented as to induce the french to believe that our streets are in chains and that even walking or using a horse or any vehicle of a sunday is a prohibited thing in addition to a variety of similar absurdities we are boldly charged with most of the grosser vices and in some instances intimations have been given that our moral condition is the natural consequence of our descent from convicted felons  to the american who is a little prone to pride himself on being derived from a stock of peculiar moral purity this imputation on his origin sounds extraordinary and is apt to excite indignation i dare say you are not prepared to learn that it was a common perhaps the prevalent opinion of europe that our states were settled by convicts that this until very lately was the prevalent opinion of europe i entertain no doubt though i think the few last years have produced some change in this respect more of the popular attention most probably having been attracted to us within this period than during the two centuries that preceded it you will smile to hear that the common works of fiction have been the material agents in producing the change information that has been introduced through the medium of amusement making its way where the graver labours of the historian have never been able to penetrate courier the cleverest political writer france has produced perhaps in any age and a staunch republican says it would be quite as unjust to reproach the modern romans with being descended from ravishers and robbers as it is to reproach the americans with being descended from convicts he wishes to remove the stigma from his political brethren but the idea of denying the imputation does not appear to have entered his mind jefferson also alludes to the subject in some of his letters apparently in answer to a philosophical inquiry from one of his friends he estimates the whole number of persons transported to the american colonies under sentence from the courts at about two thousand and taking into consideration their habits he was of opinion half a century ago that their descendants did not probably exceed the original stock i do not know where mr jefferson obtained his data for this estimate but he did not show his ordinary acuteness in ascribing the reason why the convicts left few or no issue women were by far too much in request in america during the first century or two of its political existence to admit of the probability of men so openly stamped with infamy from obtaining wives and i think there existed a physical inability for the propagation of the stock since very few women were transported at any time within the last few months two instances have occurred in the chamber of deputies of members quoting the example of america in enforcing their arguments in favour of the possibility of forming respectable communities by the transportation of criminals  i had no intention of quoting any part of the controversy on finance but on reflection it may serve a good purpose to give one or two extracts from the letter of mr harris in order that this may be done fairly both as it respects the point at issue and the parties concerned it will be necessary to make a brief preliminary explanation m sauliner the principal writer of the other side had made it a charge against our system that nearly all the public money was derived from the customs which he assumed was a bad mode of obtaining revenue let this be as it might my answer was that as between france and america there was no essential variance of system the only difference lying in the fact that the one got all the revenue it could in this manner and that the other got all it wanted i added a tax on exports excepted that all the usual means of raising revenue known to other nations were available at need to the government of the unitedstates to this latter opinion mr harris took exceptions saying in effect that the administration of mr adams the father had been broken down by resorting to excises stampacts and direct taxation and that since his unfortunate experiment no administration in america had dreamed even in time of war of resorting to a mode of obtaining revenue which was so offensive as to produce the revolution of 1776 of course mr harris was reminded that the stampact of which the colonists complained was repealed many years before the epoch of 1776 that the revolution proceeded from a denial of the right in parliament to tax the colonies at all and not from any particular imposition and that excises and a stampact had all been resorted to in the war of 1812 without overturning the administration of mr madison or weakening that of his successor but of what avail was a statement of this kind in opposition to the allegations of one who appeared before europe in the character of an american diplomate mr harris enjoyed the double advantage of giving his testimony as one in the confidence of both the french and the american governmentsan advantage that a quotation from the statutebooks themselves could not overcome  mr harris disposed of one knotty point in this controversy with so much ingenuity that it deserves to be more generally known our adversaries had brought the accusation of luxury against the american government inasmuch as it was said to furnish both a town and a country palace for the presidenta degree of magnificence little suspected in france this point was not treated as a matter of any importance by us though general lafayette had slightly and playfully alluded to it once or twice the words of mr harris shall speak for themselves le général lafayette paraît surtout avoir été frappé de lerreur dans laquelle est tombé lauteur de la revue à légard de la belle maison de campagne dont il a doté la présidence et cest peutêtre là ce qui la porté à faire appel à m le général bernard et à m cooper  lerreur de lauteur de la revue au sujet de la maison de campagne du président est de très peu dimportance personne ne sait mieux que le général lafayette que la résidence affectée par la nation à son president dans le district de columbia est située de manière à jouir des avantages de la ville et de la campagne  here you perceive the intellectual finesse with which we have had to contend we are charged with the undue luxury of supporting a town and country house for a public functionary and disproving the fact our opponents turn upon us with a pernicious subtlety and show to such a condensing point has the effeminate spirit reached among us that we have compressed the essence of two such establishments into one mr harris might have carried out his argument and shown also that to such a pass of selfindulgence have we reached that washington itself is so situated as to enjoy the advantages of both town and country  i have reason to think mr harris gained a great advantage over us by this tour de logique i had however a little better luck with another paragraph of his letter in pages 22 and 23 of this important document is the following the state alluded to being pennsylvania and the money mentioned the cost of the canals which mr harris includes in the cost of government charging by the way not only the interest on the loans as an annual burden but the loans themselves i translate the text the letter having appeared in frenchthe greater part of this sum about twentytwo millions of dollars has been expended during the last twelve yearsthat is to say while the population was half or twothirds less than it is today offering an average of not more than 800000 souls the present population of pennsylvania being 1350161 it follows that each inhabitant has been taxed about two and a half dollars annually for internal improvements during this period  i think under ordinary circumstances and as against a logician who did not appear supported by the confidence and favour of the government of the united states of america i might have got along with this quotation by showing that 800000 is neither the half of nor twothirds less than 1350161 that pennsylvania so far from trebling or even doubling her population in twelve years had not doubled it in twenty that pennsylvania at the commencement of the twelve years named had actually a population more than twentyfive per cent greater than that which mr harris gives as the average of a period during which he affirms that this population has at least doubled and by also showing that money borrowed and invested in public works which are expected to return an ample revenue cannot be presented as an annual charge against the citizen until he is called on to pay it  having said so much about the part that mr harris has had in this controversy i owe it to truth to add that his course has at least the merit of frankness and that he is just so much the more to be commended than that portion of our exagents and actual agents who have taken the same side of the question covertly  i have dwelt on this subject at some length because i think it is connected not only with the truth but with the character of america i have already told you the startling manner in which i was addressed by one of the first men in england on the subject of the tone of our foreign agents and since that time occasions have multiplied to learn the mortifying extent to which this unfavourable opinion of their sincerity has spread if the united states has neither sufficient force nor sufficient dignity to maintain its interests abroad without making these sacrifices of opinion and principle we are in a worse condition than i had believed but you will require no logic from me to understand the effect that must be and is produced by this contradiction between the language that is studiously usedused to nauseous affectationat home and so much of the language that is used by too many of the agents abroad  i very well know that the government of the union guarantees neither the civil nor religious liberty of the citizen except as against its own action that any state may create an establishment or a close hereditary aristocracy tomorrow if it please the general provision that its polity must be that of a republic meaning no more than that there should not be an hereditary monarchy and that is quite within the limits of constitutional possibilities that the base of the national representation should be either purely aristocratical purely democratical or a mixture of both but in leaving this option to the states the constitution has in no manner impaired the force of facts the states have made their election and apart from the anomaly of a slave population the fundamental feature of the general government is democratic now it is indisputably the privilege of the citizen to express the opinions of government that he may happen to entertain the system supposes consultation and choice and it would be mockery to maintain that either can exist without entire freedom of thought and speech if any man prefer a monarchy to the present polity of the nation it is his indefeasible right to declare his opinion and to be exempt from persecution and reproach he who meets such a declaration in any other manner than by a free admission of the right does not feel the nature of the institutions under which he lives for the constitution in its spirit everywhere recognises the principle but one greater than the constitution of america in divine ordinances everywhere denies the right of a man to profess one thing and to mean another there is an implied pledge given by every public agent that he will not misrepresent what he knows to be the popular sentiment at home and which popular sentiment directly or indirectly has clothed his language with the authority it carries in foreign countries and there is every obligation of faith fidelity delicacy and discretion that he should do no discredit to that which he knows to be a distinguishing and vital principle with his constituents as respects our agents in europe i believe little is hazarded in saying that too many have done injury to the cause of liberty i have heard this so often from various quarters of the highest respectability29 it has been so frequently affirmed in public here and i have witnessed so much myself that perhaps the subject presents itself with more force to me on the spot than it will to you who can only look at it through the medium of distance and testimony i make no objection to a rigid neutrality in the strife of opinions that is going on here but i call for the selfdenial of concealing all predilections in favour of the government of one or of the few and should any minister of despotism or political exclusion presume to cite an american agent as being of his way of thinking all motives of forbearance would seem to disappear and if really an american in more than pretension it appears to me the time would be come to vindicate the truth with the frankness and energy of a freeman  footnote 29 in 1833 the writer was in discourse with a person who had filled one of the highest political situations in europe and he was asked who represented the united states at the court of  on being told this person paused and then resumed i am surprised that your government should employ that man he has always endeavoured to ingratiate himself in my favour by depreciating everything in his own country but why name a solitary instance deputies members of parliament peers of france and of england and public men of half the nations of europe have substantially expressed to the writer the same opinion under one circumstance or another in perhaps fifty different instances     letter xiii  ferry across the rhinevillage of

and horses and we were soon comfortably housed in an inn in the village of rudesheim here then we were in the heart of the richest wine region in europe perhaps in the world i looked curiously at mine host to see what effect this fact might have had on him but he did nor appear to have abused the advantage he told me there had just been a sale at which i should have been most welcome complained that much sour liquor was palmed off on the incredulous as being the pure beverage and said that others might prefer johannisberger but for his part good hinterhausen30 was good enough for him would i try a bottle the proposition was not to be declined and with my dinner i did try a bottle of his oldest and best and henceforth i declare myself a convert to rudesheimer hinterhausen one cannot drink a gallon of it with impunity as is the case with some of the french wines but i feel persuaded it is the very article for our market to use the vernacular of a true manhattanese it has body to bear the voyage without being the fiery compound that we drink under the names of madeira and sherry  footnote 30 behind the houses so termed from the vines standing on lower land than the hill behind the village  it is a singular fact that in none but wine growing countries are the true uses of the precious gift understood in them wine is not a luxury but a necessary its use is not often abused and its beneficial effect can scarcely be appreciated without being witnessed i do not mean that there is no drunkenness in these countries for there is probably as much of the vice in france germany italy and switzerland as there is with us but they who drink hard generally drink some of the vile compounds which exist everywhere under the names of brandy agua diente or something else i was one day crossing the bay of naples in my hired craft la divina providenza rowed by a crew of twentyone men who cost me just the price of a carriage and horses for the same time when the padrone who had then been boating about with us several weeks began to be inquisitive concerning america and our manner of living more especially among the labouring classes the answers produced a strong sensation in the boat and when they heard that labourers received a ducat aday for their toil half of the honest fellows declared themselves ready to emigrate et il vino signore quale è il prezzo del vino demanded the padrone i told him wine was a luxury with us and beyond the reach of the labourer the general sneer that followed immediately satisfied me that no emigrants would go from la divina providenza  it is scarcely necessary to tell one of your habits that the wines we call hock are rhenish and that each properly bears the name of its own vintage this rule prevails everywhere the names of claret burgundy and sherry being unknown in france and spain it is true the french have their burgundy wines and the spaniards their xeres wines but vin de bourgogne includes liquors of different colours and very different qualities the same is true of other places what we call claret the french term bordeaux wines though clairet is an old french word still occasionally used signifying a thin weak potation  the rheingau or the part of the nassau in which we now are produces the best wines of the rhine the principal vineyards are those of johannisberg hochheim whence the name of hock geissenheim steinberg and rudesheim johannisberg is now the property of prince metternich geissenheim belongs to the count of ingelheim and hochheim and rudesheim are villages the vines having different proprietors i do not know the situation of steinberg the best wine of johannisberg has the highest reputation that of geissenheim is also delicious and is fast growing in value hochheimer dom or houses growing near the village is also in great request and of the hinterhausen of rudesheim you have already heard dr somerville once told me he had analysed the pure johannisberger and that it contained less acidity than any other wine he knew the steinberger is coming into favour it is the highest flavoured of all the german wines its perfume or bouquet being really too strong  rudesheim was a roman station and it is probable that its wines date from their government there is still a considerable ruin belonging i believe to the count of ingelheim that is supposed to have been built by the romans and which has been partially fitted up by its proprietor as a place of retreat during the vintage this is truly a classical villagiatura it was curious to examine these remains which are extensive so soon after going over the feudal castle and it must be confessed that the sons of the south maintained their long established superiority here as elsewhere ingelheim where charlemagne had a palace and where some pretend he was born is in plain view on the other side of the river but no traces of the palace are visible from this spot such is the difference between the false and the true roman there is also a ruin a small high circular tower that is connected with our inn forming even one of our own rooms and which is very ancient probably as ancient as the great frank  we left rudesheim after breakfast driving quite near to the hill of geissenheim and quitting the main road for the purpose of visiting johannisberg which lies back a mile from the great route we wound our way around the hill which on three sides is shaped like a cone and on the other is an irregular ridge and approached the house by the rear if you happen to have a bottle of the wine of this vineyard real or reputed for in this respect the false simon pure is quite as likely to be true as the real you will find a sufficiently good resemblance of this building on its label  i can give you no other reason why this wine was formerly so little known while that of hochheim had so great a reputation than the fact that the mountain house and vines were all the property of a religious community previously to the french revolution and that the monks probably chose to drink their own liquors in this particular they were unlike the people of brie for walking one day with lafayette over his estate at la grange i expressed surprise at seeing some labourers making wine oh yes my dear friend returned the general we do make wine here but then we take very good care not to drink it the monks of johannisberg most likely both made wine and drank it  johannisberg has changed owners several times shortly after our return from the journey on the rhine of last year chance placed me at paris at table between the chargé daffaires of nassau and the duc de valmy the former observed that i had lately been in nassau and asked how i liked the country under such circumstances one would wish to praise and as i could honestly do so i expressed my admiration of what i had seen among other things i spoke of its rich vineyards and as a matter of course began to extol that of johannisberg the more i praised the graver the diplomate looked until thinking i had not come up to his own feelings i began to be warmer still in my expressions a touch under the table silenced me the chargé soon after gave me to understand that johannisberg produced only sour grapes for my neighbour as napoleon had given the estate to the first duke and the allies had taken it away from his son this was not the first time i have had occasion to see the necessity of being guarded how one speaks lest he offend some political sensibility or other in this quarter of the world  the present owner of johannisberg has fitted up the house which is quite spacious very handsomely though without gorgeousness and there is really a suite of large and commodious rooms i saw few or no signs of the monastery about the building the vines grow all around the conical part of the hill quite up to the windows the best wine is made from those near the house on the southeastern exposure the view was beautiful and very extensive and all that the place wants to make it a desirable residence is shade an advantage however that cannot be enjoyed on the same spot in common with good wine the nakedness of the ground impaired the effect of the dwelling the owner is seldom here as is apparent by the furniture which though fresh and suitable does not extend to the thousand little elegancies that accumulate in a regular abode  the books say that this celebrated vineyard contains sixtythree acres and this is near the extent i should give it from the eye the produce is stated at twentyfive hogsheads of thirteen hundred bottles each some of the wines of the best vintages sell as high as four and even five dollars a bottle i observed that the soil was mixed with stone much decomposed of a shelly appearance and whitish colour the land would be pronounced unsuited to ordinary agriculture i suspect by a majority of farmers  i bought a bottle of wine from a servant who professed to have permission to sell it the price was two florins and a half or a dollar and the quality greatly inferior to the bottle that for the same money issued from the cellar of the host at rudesheim it is probable the whole thing was a deception though the inferior wines of johannisberg are no better than a vast deal of the other common wine of the neighbourhood  from johannisberg we descended to the plain and took the road to biberich this is a small town on the banks of the rhine and is the residence of the duke nassau figures in the tables of the germanic confederation as the fourteenth state having three hundred and thirtyeight thousand inhabitants and furnishing three thousand troops as its contingent the population is probably a little greater the reigning family is of the ancient line of nassau from a junior branch of which i believe the king of holland is derived the duchess is a princess of wurtemberg and a sister of the grandduchess helena of whom i have already spoken so often this little state is one of the fabricated sovereignties of 1814 being composed of divers fragments besides the ancient possessions of the family in short it would seem to be intended for the government and better management of a few capital vineyards  nassau has been much agitated of late with liberal opinions though the government is already what it is the fashion to term representative on this side of the atlantic it is the old theory that small states can better support a popular form of government than a large state this is a theory in which i have no faith and one in my opinion that has been fabricated to suit the accidental situation of europe the danger of popular governments are popular excesses such as those truculent errors that men fall into by a misconception of truth misstatements ignorance of their interests and the sort of villagelike gossip which causes every man to think he is a judge of character when he is not even a judge of facts the abuses of absolutism are straightforward dogged tyranny in which the rights of the mass are sacrificed to the interests and policy of a prince and his favourites now in a large country popular excesses in one part are checked and repressed by the power and interests of the other parts it is not an easy matter to make a popular error that leads to popular excesses extend simultaneously over a very extended surface and they who are tranquil control and finally influence those who are excited in a small state absolutism is held under the checks of neighbourhood and familiarity men disregard accidents and crime in a capital while they reason on them and act on them in the country just so will the sovereign of a small state feel and submit to the authority of an active public opinion if i must have liberty let it come in large draughts like learning and form an atmosphere of its own and if i must be the subject of despotic power heaven send that my sovereign be a small prince the latter is on the supposition that i am an honest man for he who would rise by servility and a sacrifice of his principles had better at once choose the greatest monarch he can find for a master small states are usually an evil in themselves but i think they are least so when the authority is absolute the people of nassau had better be moderate in their progress while they of france should press on to their purpose and yet the people of nassau will probably be the most urgent simply because the power with which they have to contend is so feeble for men rarely take the just medium though they are always talking about it  we entered the palace at biberich which without being larger than usual is an edifice well worth viewing we could not but compare this abode with the presidents house and certainly so far as taste and elegance are concerned the comparison is entirely to the disadvantage of us americans it is easy to write unmeaning anathemas against prodigal expenditures and extorting the hard earnings of the poor on such occasions but i do not know that the castle of biberich was erected by any means so foul the general denunciation of everything that does not happen to enter into our own system has no more connexion with true republicanism than cant has to do with religion abuses of this nature have existed beyond dispute and the public money even among ourselves is not always honestly or prudently expended but these are the errors inseparable from human nature and it is silly to quarrel with all the blandishments of life until we can find faultless substitutes the simple fact that a nation like our own has suffered an entire generation to go by with its chief magistrate living in a house surrounded by grounds almost as naked as a cornfield while it proves nothing in favour of its economy goes to show either that we want the taste and habits necessary to appreciate the privation as is probably the case or the generosity to do a liberal act since it is notorious that we possess the means  the gardens of biberich are extensive and beautiful we are proofs ourselves that they are not reserved in a niggardly spirit for the exclusive uses of a few nor in truth are those of any other prince in europe where we have been the interior of the house is much ornamented by a very peculiar marble that is found in the duchy and which produces a good effect a circular hall in the centre of the building surmounted by a dome is rather striking from having a colonnade of this material  the family was here and the preparations were making for dinner in one of the rooms the whole style of the domestic economy being that of a nobleman of liberal means the house was very quiet and we saw but few menials though we met two of the children accompanied by a governess in the grounds  biberich and the castle or palace stand immediately on the banks of the river which between bingen and mayence is straggling and well covered with islands having an entire breadth of near half a mile the effect when seen from the neighbouring heights is not unlike that of a lake  from biberich we diverged directly into the interior of the rheingau taking the road to wiesbaden which is a wateringplace of some note and the seat of government of the duchy we reached it early for it is no great matter to pass from the frontiers of one of these small states into its centre ordered dinner and went out to see the lions wiesbaden has little to recommend it by nature its waters excepted it stands in a funnel rather than a valley and it is said to be excessively hot in summer though a pleasant winter residence i do not remember a place that so triumphantly proves how much may be made out of a little as the public promenade of wiesbaden the springs are nearly or perhaps quite a mile from the town the intervening land being a gentle inclination from the springs a rivulet scarce large enough to turn a village mill winds its way down to the town the banks of this little stream have been planted artificial obstructions and cascades formed paths cut bridges thrown across the rivulet rocks piled etc and by these simple means one walks a mile in a belt of wood a few rods wide and may fancy himself in a park of two thousand acres ten years would suffice to bring such a promenade to perfection and yet nothing like it exists in all america one can surely smoke cigars drink congress water discuss party politics and fancy himself a statesman whittle clean his nails in company and never out of it swear things are good enough for him without having known any other state of society squander dollars on discomfort and refuse cents to elegance and convenience because he knows no better and call the obliquity of taste patriotism without enjoying a walk in a wood by the side of a murmuring rill he may beyond dispute if such be his sovereign pleasure do all this and so may an esquimaux maintain that whales blubber is preferable to beefsteaks i wonder that these dogged and philosophical patriots do not go back to warlocks scalps and paint  the town of wiesbaden like all german towns of any consequence i have ever been in cologne excepted is neat and clean it is also wellbuilt and evidently improving you may have heard a good deal of the boulevards and similar places of resort in the vicinity of french towns but as a whole they are tasteless and barrenlooking spots even the champs elysées at paris have little beauty of themselves for landscape gardening is but just introduced into france whereas to me it would seem that the germans make more use of it in and near their towns than the english  we left wiesbaden next morning after enjoying its baths and went slowly up to frankfort on the maine a distance of about twenty miles here we took up our old quarters at the white swan a house of a secondrate reputation but of firstrate civility into which chance first threw me and as usual we got a capital dinner and good wine the innkeeper in honour of germany caused a dish that he said was national and of great repute to be served to us pilgrims it was what the french call a jardinière or a partridge garnished with cabbage carrots turnips etc  i seized the opportunity to put myself au courant of the affairs of the world by going to one of the readingrooms that are to be found all over germany under the names of redoutes casinos or something of that sort pipes appear to be proscribed in the casino of frankfort which is altogether a genteel and respectable establishment as usual a stranger must be introduced     letter xiv  boulevards of

badenenter switzerland   dear   i have little new to tell you of frankfort it appeared to be the same busy clean pretty wellbuilt town on this visit as it did at the two others we examined the boulevards a little more closely than before and were even more pleased with them than formerly i have already explained to you that the secret of these tasteful and beautiful walks so near and sometimes in the very heart as at dresden of the large german towns is in the circumstance of the old fortifications being destroyed and the space thus obtained having been wisely appropriated to health and air leipsig in particular enjoys a picturesque garden where formerly there stood nothing but grim guns and frowning ramparts  frankfort has been the subject of recent political disturbances and i heard this morning from a banker that there existed serious discontents all along the rhine as far as i can learn the movement proceeds from a desire in the trading banking and manufacturing classes the nouveaux riches in short to reduce the power and influence of the old feudal and territorial nobility the kingly authority in our time is not much of itself and the principal question has become how many or how few or in short who are to share in its immunities in this simple fact lies the germ of the revolution in france and of reform in england money is changing hands and power must go with it this is has been and ever will be the case except in those instances in which the great political trust is thrown confidingly into the hands of all and even then in half the practical results money will cheat them out of the advantages where the pressure is so great as to produce a recoil it is the poor against the rich and where the poor have rights to stand on the rich are hard at work to get the better of the poor such is the curse of adam and man himself must be changed before the disease can be cured all we can do under the best constructed system is to mitigate the evil  we left frankfort at eleven declining the services of a celebrated voiturier called le petit savoyard whom françois introduced with a warm recommendation of fidelity and zeal these men are extensively known and carry their soubriquets as ships do their names the little savoyard had just discharged a cargo of miladies bound to england after having had them on his charterparty eighteen months and was now on the lookout for a return freight as his whole equipments were four horses the harness and a long whip he was very desirous of the honour of dragging my carriage a hundred leagues or so towards any part of the earth whither it might suit my pleasure to proceed but it is to be presumed that miladies were of full weight for even françois who comes of a family of voituriers and has a fellowfeeling for the craft is obliged to admit that the cattle of le petit appear to have been overworked this negotiation occupied an hour and it ended by sending the passport to the post  we were soon beyond the tower that marks the limits of the territory of frankfort on the road to darmstadt while mounting an ascent we had a distant glimpse of the town of homberg the capital and almost the whole territory of the principality of hesse homberg a state whose last sovereign had the honour of possessing an english princess for a wife truly there must be something in blood after all for this potentate has but twentythree thousand subjects to recommend him  darmstadt is one of those towns which are laid out on so large a scale as to appear mean this is a common fault both in germany and america for the effect of throwing open wide avenues that one can walk through in five minutes is to bring the intention into ludicrous contrast with the result mannheim is another of these abortions the disadvantage however ends with the appearance for darmstadt is spacious airy and neat it is also wellbuilt  the ancient landgraves of hesse darmstadt have become grand dukes with a material accession of territory the present sovereign ruling over some 700000 subjects the old castle is still standing in the heart of the place if a town which is all artery can be said to have any heart and we walked into its gloomy old courts with the intention of examining it but the keeper of the keys was not to be found there is a modern palace of very good architecture near it and as usual extensive gardens laid out so far as we could perceive from the outside in the english taste  a short distance from darmstadt the bergestrasse mountain road commences it is a perfect level but got its name from skirting the foot of the mountain at an elevation to overlook the vast plain of the palatinate for we were now on the verge of this ancient territory which has been merged in the grand duchy of baden by the events of the last half century i may as well add that baden is a respectable state having nearly 1300000 subjects  the bergestrasse has many ruins on the heights that overlook it though the river is never within a league or two of the road here we found postilions worthy of their fine track and to say the truth of great skill in germany you get but one postilion with four horses and as the leaders are always at a great distance from those on the pole it is an exploit of some delicacy to drive eight miles an hour riding the near wheelhorse and governing the team very much by the use of the whip the cattle are taught to travel without blinkers and like men to whom political power is trusted they are the less dangerous for it it is your welltrained animal that is checked up and blinded who runs away with the carriage of state as well as the travelling carriage and breaks the neck of him who rides  it was quite dark when we crossed the bridge of the neckar and plunged into the crowded streets of heidelberg notwithstanding the obscurity we got a glimpse of the proud old ruin overhanging the place looking grand and sombre in the gloom of night  the view from the windows next morning was one of life in the extreme the principal marketplace was directly before the inn and it appeared as if half the peasants of the grand duchy had assembled there to display their fruits and vegetables a market is always a garrulous and noisy place but when the advantage of speaking german is added to it the perfection of confusion is obtained in all good society both men and women speak in subdued voices and there is no need to allude to them but when one descends a little below the élite strength of lungs is rather a german failing31  we went to the ruins while the fogs were still floating around the hilltops i was less pleased with this visit than with that of last year for the surprise was gone and there was leisure to be critical on the whole these ruins are vast rather than fine though the parts of the edifice that were built in the elizabethan taste have the charm of quaintness there is also one picturesque tower but the finest thing certainly is the view from the gardenterrace above an american who remembers the genial soil and climate of his country must mourn over the want of taste that has left and still leaves a great nation numerically great at least ignorant of the enjoyment of those delicious retreats as nelson once said want of frigates would be found written on his heart were he to die i think want of gardens would be found written on mine our cicerone on this occasion was a man who had served in america during the last war as one of the corps of de watteville he was born in baden and says that a large portion of the corps were germans he was in most of the battles of the niagara and shook his head gravely when i hinted at the attack on fort erie according to his account the corps suffered exceedingly in the campaign of 1814 losing the greater portion of its men i asked him how he came to fight us who had never done him any harm and he answered that napoleon had made all europe soldiers or robbers and that he had not stopped to examine the question of right  footnote 31 until the revolution of 1830 the writer never met but one noisy woman in paris since that period however one hears a little more of the tintamarre of the comptoir  we drove up the valley of the neckar after a late breakfast by an excellent road and through a beautiful country for the first post or two we then diverged from the stream ascended into a higher portion of undulating country that gradually became less and less interesting until in the end we all pronounced it the tamest and least inviting region we had yet seen in europe i do not say that the country was particularly sterile but it was commonplace and offered fewer objects of interest than any other we had yet visited until now our destination was not settled though i had almost decided to go to nuremberg and thence by ratisbonne and the danube to vienna but we all came to the opinion that the appearance of things towards the east was too dreary for endurance we had already journeyed through bavaria from its southern to its northern end and we wished to vary the scene a member of its royal family had once told me that wurtemberg offered but little for the traveller at the same time saying a good word for its capital when one gets information from so high authority it is not to be questioned and towards stuttgart it was determined to turn our faces at heilbronn therefore we changed direction from east to south this heilbronn was a quaint old german town and it had a few of its houses painted on the exterior like those already described to you in switzerland weinsberg so celebrated for its wives who saved their husbands at a capitulation by carrying them out of the place on their backs is near this town as there are no walled towns in america and the example could do no good we did not make a pilgrimage to the spot that night we slept at a little town called bessingheim with the neckar which we had again met at heilbronn murmuring beneath our windows  the next morning we were off betimes to avoid the heat and reached ludwigsberg to breakfast here the scene began to change troops were at drill in a meadow as we approached the town and the postilion pointed out to us a portly officer at the duke of wurtemberg a cadet of the royal family who was present with his staff drilling troops from time immemorial has been a royal occupation in germany it is like a manhattanese talking of dollars a source of endless enjoyment  ludwigsberg is the windsor the st denis of the princes of wurtemberg there an extensive palace the place of sepulture and a town of five or six thousand inhabitants we went through the former which is large and imposing with fine courts and some pretty views but it is low and teutonicin plain english squatlike some of the old statues in armour that one sees in the squares of the german towns there is a gallery and a few good pictures particularly a rembrandt or two one of the latter is in the same style as the tributemoney that i possess and greatly encourages me as to the authenticity of that picture the late queen of wurtemberg was the princess royal of england and she inhabited this palace being mistaken for english we were shown her apartments in which she died lately and which were exactly in the condition in which she left them she must have had strong family attachments for her rooms were covered with portraits of her relatives the king of england was omnipresent and as for her own husband of whom by the way one picture would have been quite sufficient for any reasonable woman there were no less than six portraits of him in a single room  as one goes north the style of ornamenting rooms is less graceful and the german and english palaces all have the same formal and antiquated air ludwigsberg does not change the rule though there was an unusual appearance of comfort in the apartments of the late queen which had evidently been anglicised  while we were standing at a balcony that overlooks a very pretty tract of wooded country and garden the guide pointed to a hamlet whose church tower was peering above a bit of forest in a distant valley or rather swell does mein herr see it i doit is no more than a sequestered hamlet that is prettily enough placedit was marbach the birthplace of schiller few men can feel less of the interest that so commonly attaches to the habits habitations and personal appearance of celebrated men than myself the mere sight of a celebrity never creates any sensation yet i do not remember a stronger conviction of the superiority enjoyed by true over factitious greatness than that which flashed on my mind when i was told this fact that sequestered hamlet rose in a moment to an importance that all the appliances and souvenirs of royalty could not give to the palace of ludwigsberg poor schiller in my eyes he is the german genius of the age goethe has got around him one of those factitious reputations that depend as much on gossip and teadrinking as on a high order of genius and he is fortunate in possessing a coddled celebrityfor you must know there is a fashion in this thing that is quite independent of meritwhile schillers fame rests solely on its naked merits my life for it that it lasts the longest and will burn brightest in the end the schools and a prevalent taste and the caprice of fashion can make goethes in dozens at any time but god only creates such men as schiller the germans say we cannot feel goethe but after all a translation is perhaps one of the best tests of genius for though bad translations abound if there is stuff in the original it will find its way even into one of these  from ludwigsberg to stuttgart it is but a single post and we arrived there at twelve the appearance of this place was altogether different from what we had expected although it contains near 30000 inhabitants it has more the air of a thriving swiss town than that of a german capital the abodes and gardens of the royal family excepted by a swiss town i do not mean either such places as geneva and berne and zurich but such towns as herisau and lucerne without including the walls of the latter it stands at the termination of an irregular valley at the base of some mountains and altogether its aspect rustic exterior and position took us by surprise the town however is evidently becoming more european as they say on this side the atlantic every day or in other words it is becoming less peculiar  at and around the palaces there is something already imposing the old feudal castle which i presume is the cradle of the house of wurtemberg stands as a nucleus for the rest of the town it is a strong prisonlike looking pile composed of huge round towers and narrow courts and still serves the purposes of the state though not as a prison i trust another hotel or royal residence is quite near it on one side while the new palace is close at hand on another the latter is a handsome edifice of italian architecture in some respects not unlike the luxembourg at paris and i should think out of all comparison the best royal residence to be found in the inferior states of germany if not in all germany those of prussia and austria excepted  we took a carriage and drove through the grounds to a new classical little palace that crowns an eminence at their other extremity a distance of a mile or two we went through this building which is a little in the style of the trianons at versailles smaller than le grand trianon and larger than le petit trianon this display of royal houses after all struck us as a little dis portioned to the diminutive size and poverty of the country the last is nothing but a maison de plaisance and is well enough if it did not bring taxation with it nor do i know that it did most of the sovereigns have large private fortunes which they are entitled to use the same as others and which are well used in fostering elegant tastes in their subjects  there is a wateringplace near the latter house and preparations were making for the king to dine there with a party of his own choosing this reminded us of our own dinner which had been ordered at six and we returned to eat it while sitting at a window waiting the service a carriage that drove up attracted my attention it was a large and rather elegant post chariot as much ornamented as comported with the road and having a rich blazonry a single female was in it with a maid and valet in the rumble the lady was in a cap and as her equipage drove up appeared to be netting i have frequently met german families travelling along the highway in this sociable manner apparently as much at home as when they were under the domestic roof this lady however had so little luggage that i was induced to enquire who it might be she was a princess of hechingen a neighbouring state that had just trotted over probably to take tea with some of her cousins of wurtemberg  these quasi kingdoms are so diminutive that this sort of intercourse is very practicable and a pure conjecture it may be that german etiquette so notoriously stiff and absurd has been invented to prevent the intercourse from becoming too familiar the mediatising system however has greatly augmented the distances between the capitals though owing to some accidental influence there is still here and there a prince that might be spared whose territories have been encircled without having been absolutely absorbed by those who have been gainers by the change bavaria has risen to be a kingdom of four millions of souls in this manner and the dukes of wurtemberg have become kings though on a more humble scale through the liberality or policy of napoleon the kingdom of the latter contains the two independent principalities of hohenzollern spared on account of some family alliances i believe in its bosom one of the princes of the latter family is married to a mademoiselle murat a niece of joachim  after dinner we went again to the garden where we accidentally were witnesses of the return of the royal party from their picnic the king drove the queen in a pony phaeton at the usual pace of monarchs or just as fast as the little animals could put foot to the ground he was a large and wellwhiskered man with a strong family likeness to the english princes the attendants were two mounted grooms in scarlet liveries a cadet a dark italianlooking personage came soon after in full uniform driving himself also in a sort of barouche after a short time we were benefited by the appearance of the cooks and scullions who passed in a fourgon that contained the remnants and the utensils soon after we got a glimpse of the queen and three or four of the daughters at a balcony of the palace the lady of the network being among them they all appeared to be fine women  at the inn i heard with regret that sir walter scott had passed but two days before he was represented as being extremely ill so much so indeed as to refuse to quit his carriage where he kept himself as much as possible out of view  we left stuttgart early the following morning and as the carriage wound up the mountain that overlooks the town i thought the place one of singular incongruities the hillsides are in vineyards the palace in excellent keeping was warm and sunny while the old feudallooking towers of the castle rudely recalled the mind to ancient germany and the swissish habitations summoned up the images of winter snows and shivering february still i question if a place so sheltered ever endures much cold the town appears to have been built in the nook it occupies expressly to save fuel  we met the neckar again after crossing a range of wooded mountain and at tubingen we once more found a city a university the remains of feodality redoutes pipes and other german appliances here we breakfasted and received a visit from a young countryman whose parents germans i believe had sent him hither to be educated he will probably return with a good knowledge of greek perfect master of metaphysics and the pipe extravagant in his political opinions a sceptic in religion and with some such ideas of the poetry of thought as a new england dancingmaster has of the poetry of motion or a teacher of psalmody of the art of music after all this is better than sending a boy to england whence he would come back with the notions of sir william blackstone to help to overturn or pervert his own institutions and his memory crammed with secondhand anecdotes of lords and ladies we labour under great embarrassments on this point of education for it is not easy to obtain it suited equally to the right and to our own peculiar circumstances either at home or abroad at home we want science research labour tone manners and time abroad we get the accumulated prejudices that have arisen from a factitious state of things or what is perhaps worse their reaction the servility of castes or the truculence of revolution  about a post beyond tubingen a noble ruin of a castle of the middle ages appeared in the distance crowning the summit of a high conical eminence these were the finest remains we had seen in a long time and viewed from the road they were a beautiful object for half an hour this was the castle of hohenzollern erected about the year 980 and the cradle of the house of brandenburg this family some pretend was derived from the ancient dukes of alsace which if true would give it the same origin as those of austria and baden but it is usual and probably much safer to say that the counts of hohenzollern were its founders we must all stop somewhere short of adam  i was musing on the chances that have raised a cadet or a younger branch of the old feudal counts who had once occupied this hold to the fifth throne in europe when we entered an irregular and straggling village of some 3000 souls that was not by any means as well built as one of our own towns of the same size a sign over a door such as would be occupied by a thriving trader with us with department of war on it induced me to open my eyes and look about me we were in hechingen the capital of hohenzollernhechingen an independent state with a prince of its own who is the head of his family in one sense and its tail in another there being besides the king of prussia a prince of hohenzollernsigmaringen adjoining who is his junior in rank and his better in power having some 40 or 50000 subjects while he of hechingen has but 15000 on ascending a hill in the place itself we passed an unfinished house all front that stood on the street with no grounds of any beauty near it and which certainly was not as large nor nearly as well constructed as one of our own principal countryhouses this building we were told was intended for the town residence of the heirapparent who is married to a daughter of eugene beauharnois and of course to a niece of the king of bavaria  all this was an epitome of royalty i had never before witnessed the saxon duchies and bayreuth and anspach now merged in bavaria had been the subjects of curious contemplation to us but they were all the possessions of potentates compared to this principality i inquired for the abode of the prince which could not well be far off without being out of his own dominions it lay behind a wood a mile distant and was not visible from the inn where we stopped here was a capital mistake had the old castle which was but half a mile from the village been kept up and it seemed to be in good condition for a ruin with the title of count of hohenzollern and the war and state departments been put in one of the towers no one could have laughed at the pretension let him try as hard as he pleased but  we had a strong desire to visit the ruin which puts that of habsburg altogether in the shade but were prevented by a thundershower which shook the principality to its centre the knights hall the chapel and the clocktower are said to have been restored and to be now in good condition we could do no more however than cast longing eyes upward as we drove under the hill the ground being still too wet for female accoutrements to venture we had a hechingen postilion in a hechingen livery and although the man was sensible of his dignity and moved with due deliberation we were just one hour in crossing his masters dominions  reentering wurtemberg we slept that night at the village of bahlingen the country next morning was particularly tame though uneven until near noon when it gradually took more interesting forms and spread itself in pretty valleys and wooded hills the day was pleasant and as we trotted merrily through one of the vales a pointed to a little rivulet that meandered through the meadows on our right and praised its beauty i dare say it has a name inquire of the postilion wie ist diesen fluschen mein herr der donau the danube there was something startling in so unexpectedly meeting this mighty stream which we had seen rolling its dark flow through cities and kingdoms a rivulet that i could almost leap across it was to us like meeting one we had known a monarch reduced to the condition of a private man i was musing on the particles of water that were gliding past us on their way to the black sea when we drove up to the door of the inn at tuttlingen  this was in the black forest and what is more there were some trees in it the wood was chiefly larches whence i presume the name our host discovered from the servants that we were americans and he immediately introduced the subject of emigration he told us that many people went from wurtemberg to america and gave us to understand that we ought to be glad of itthey were all so well educated this was a new idea certainly and yet i will not take it on myself to say that the fact is otherwise  while we were at breakfast the innkeeper who was also the postmaster inquired where we meant to sleep and i told him at schaffhausen on the rhine he then gave me to understand that there was a long but not a steep mountain to ascend which separated the waters of the danube from those of the rhine and that two extra horses would add greatly to the facility of getting along taking a look at the road i assented so that we left the inn with the honours of a coach and six the effect was evident from the start and after entering wurtemberg and travelling through it complaining of the dullness of the teams we left it with éclat and at the rate of ten miles the hour the frontier of baden met us again on the summit of the mountain here we got a line and extensive view that included the lake of constance in its sweep the water looked dark and wild and the whole scene had a tint that strongly reminded me of the character of germanic mysteriousness we must have been at a great elevation though the mountains were not prominent objects on the contrary the eye ranged until it found the horizon as at sea in the curvature of the earth the rills near us flowed into the rhine and traversing half europe emptied themselves into the north sea while the stream that wound its way through the valley below took a southeasterly direction towards the confines of asia one gets grand and pleasing images in the associations that are connected with the contemplation of these objects  from this point we began to descend shorn of our honours in the way of quadrupeds for it was with a good deal of difficulty we got three horses at the next relay thus is it with life in which at one moment we are revelling in abundance and at the next suffering with want we got along however as in life in the best manner we could and after driving through a pretty and uneven country that gradually descended we suddenly plunged down to the banks of the rhine and found ourselves once more before an inndoor

rhine from the tameness and monotony of wurtemberg i dare say the latter country has many beautiful districts that it contains much to admire and much to awaken useful reflection but to the mere passerby it is not a land of interest like a boat that has unexpectedly got into a strong adverse current we had put our helm down and steered out of it to the nearest shore here we were then and it became necessary to say where we should be next my own eyes were turned wistfully towards the east following the road by the lake of constance inspruck and saltzbourg to vienna but several of our party were so young when we were in switzerland in 1828 that it seemed ungracious to refuse them this favourable opportunity to carry away lasting impressions of a region that has no parallel it was therefore settled before we slept again to penetrate the cantons next morning  i heard the drumlike sound of the inn once more with great satisfaction for although the house judging from the coronets and armorial bearings about it had once been the abode of a count it was not free from the peculiar echoes of a true swiss tenement any more than it was free from its neatness the drum however did not prevent us all from sleeping soundly and after an early breakfast we went forth on this new pilgrimage to the mountains  there was an end to posting no relays existing in this part of switzerland and i had been compelled to confide in the honesty of an unknown voiturier a class of men who are preeminently subject to the longestablished frailty of all who deal in horses wines lampoil and religion leaving this functionary to follow with the carriage we walked along the banks of the river by a commonplace and dirty road among forges and mills to the cataract of the rhine what accessories to a cataract how long will it be before the imagination of a people who are so fast getting to measure all greatness whether in nature or art by the yardstick will think of those embellishments for niagara fortunately the powers of men are not equal to their wishes and a mill by the side of this wonder of the world will be a mill still whereas these falls of the rhine are nearly reduced to the level of a raceway by the spirit of industry we were less struck with them than ever and left the place with the conviction that aided by a few suitable embellishments they would have been among the prettiest of the pretty cascades that we know but that as matters go they are in danger of soon losing the best part of their charms we saw no reason in this instance to change the impressions made at the former visit but think the volume of water excepted that switzerland has cascades that outdo this cataract  after following the course of the river for a few miles we met the stream buried low in the earth at one of its sudden bends and descending a sharp declivity crossed to its left bank and into the canton of zurich we were taken by surprise by this sudden rencontre and could hardly believe it was the mighty rhine whose dark waters were hurrying beneath us as we passed a covered bridge of merely a hundred or two feet in length one meets with a hundred streams equal to this in width while travelling in america though it is rare to find one anywhere with the same majesty of motion and of its fine cerulean tint  we had travelled an hour or two towards zurich before our eyes were greeted with the sight of peaks capped with snow they looked like the faces of old acquaintances and distance depriving them of their severity they now shone in a mild sublimity we were all walking ahead while the horses were eating when these noble objects came into the view and preceding the rest a little i involuntarily shouted with exultation as turning a knoll they stood ranged along the horizon the rest of the party hurried on and it was like a meeting of dear friends to see those godlike piles encircling the visible earth  the country through which we travelled was the low land of which i have so often spoken nor was it particularly beautiful or well cultivated until we drew near the capital when it assumed the polished look of the environs of a large town and the approach to zurich on this side though less romantic perhaps wanting the lake and mountains we thought if anything was more beautiful than that by which we had come in 1828  we were much gratified with the appearance of zurich more even than in our former visit and not the less so at finding it unusually empty the agitated state of europe particularly of england has kept the usual class of travellers at home though the cantons are said to be pretty well sprinkled with carlists who are accused of assembling here lo plot m de châteaubriand is in the same hotel as ourselves but it has never been my fortune to see this distinguished writer to know him even accidentally although i afterwards learned that on one occasion i had sat for two hours on a bench immediately before him at a meeting of the french academy my luck was no better now for he went away unseen an hour after we arrived some imagine themselves privileged to intrude on a celebrity thinking that those men will pardon the inconvenience for the flattery but i do not subscribe to this opinion i believe that nothing palls sooner than notoriety and that nothing is more grateful to those who have suffered under it than retirement  by a singular concurrence we were at zurich the second time on sunday and almost on the same day of the year in 1828 we drove along the lakeshore august 30th and we now left zurich for the same purpose august 28th after an interval of four years the same objects were assembled under precisely the same circumstances the lake was covered with boats whose tall sails drooped in pure laziness the solemn bells startled the melancholy echoes and the population was abroad now as then in holiday guise or crowding the churches the only perceptible changes in the scene were produced by the change in our own direction then we looked towards the foot of the lake and had its villagelined shores before us and the country that melts away towards the rhine for a background while now after passing the objects in the near view the sight rested on the confused and mysterious mountains of glaris  we took our goûter at the paon and unwilling to cross the bridge in the carriage we all preceded it through the crowded streets of rapperschwyl leaving the voiturier to follow at his leisure we were just half an hour on this bridge which appeared as ticklish as ever though not so much as to stifle the desire of p to see how near its edge he could walk when we entered schweitz the carriage overtook us and we drove to the foot of the mountain which it is necessary to ascend to reach einsiedeln here we took chevaux de renfort and a reinforcement they proved indeed for i do not remember two nobler animals than the voiturier obtained for the occasion they appeared to be moulded on the same scale as the mountains we were much amused by the fellows management for he contrived to check his own cattle in such a way as to throw all the work on the recruits this was not effected without suspicion but he contrived to allay it by giving his own beasts sundry punches in the sides so adroitly bestowed as to render them too restive to work by way of triumph each poke was accompanied by a knowing leer at françois all whose sympathies a tribute to his extraction i have had frequent opportunities of observing to my cost were invariably on the side of the voituriers so evident indeed was this feeling in the gentleman that had i been accustomed to travel much by this mode i should not have kept him a month  it was a mild evening as we travelled our way up this formidable ascent which is one of the severest in switzerland and we had loitered so much along the shores of the lake as to bring us materially behind our time still it was too late to return and we made the best of things as they were it is always more pleasant to ascend than to descend for the purposes of scenery and as picture after picture broke upon us the old touzymouzy was awakened until we once more felt ourselves in a perfect fever of mountain excitement in consequence of diverging by a footpath towards the east in descending this mountain in 1828 i had missed one of the finest reaches of its different views but which we now enjoyed under the most favourable circumstances the entire converging crescent of the north shore of the lake studded with white churches hamlets and cottages was visible and as the evening sun cast its mild light athwart the crowded and affluent landscape we involuntarily exclaimed that this even equalled the neapolitan coast in the twilight the manner in which the obscurity settled on this picture slowly swallowing up tower after tower hamlet cottage and field until the blue expanse of the lake alone reflected the light from the clouds was indescribably beautiful and was one of those fine effects that can only be produced amid a nature as grand as that of the alps  it was dark when we reached the inn at the summit but it was not possible to remain there for it had room for little more than kirschwasser the night came on dark and menacing and for near two hours we crawled up and down the sharp ascents and descents and to make the matter worse it began to rain this was a suitable approach to the abodes of monastic votaries and i had just made the remark when the carriage stopped before the door of my old inn the ox at einsiedeln it was near ten and we ordered a cup of tea and beds immediately  the next morning we visited the church and the convent the first presented a tame picture compared to that i had witnessed in the former visit for there was not a pilgrim present the past year it had been crowded there were however a few groups of the villagers kneeling at the shrine or at the different altars to aid the picturesque we ascended into the upper part of the edifice and walked in those narrow galleries through which i had formerly seen the benedictines stalking in stealthy watchfulness looking down at the devotees beneath i was admitted to the cloisters cells library c but my companions were excluded as a matter of course it is merely a spacious german convent very neat and a little barnish a recent publication caused me to smile involuntarily once or twice as the good father turned over the curiosities of the library and expatiated on the history and objects of his community but the book in question had evidently not yet if indeed it will ever reach this remote spot  we had a little difficulty here in getting along with the french and our german in which by the way some of the party are rather expert had been acquired in saxony and was taken for base coin here the innkeeper was an attentive host and wished to express every thing that was kind and attentive all of which he succeeded in doing wonderfully well by a constant use of the two words par exemple as a specimen of his skill i asked him if an extra horse could be had at einsiedeln and his answer was par exemple monsieur par exemple oui cestàdire par exemple so we took the other horse par exemple and proceeded  our road carried us directly across the meadows that had been formed in the lake of lowertz by the fall of the rossberg when on them they appeared even larger than when seen from the adjacent mountain they are quite uneven and bear a coarse wiry grass though there are a few rocks on their surface crossing the ruin of goldau we passed on a trot from the desolation around it into the beautiful scenery of arth here we dined and witnessed another monastic flirtation  after dinner we drove along the shores of the lake of zug winding directly round the base of the cone of the righi or immediately beneath the point where the traveller gets the sublime view of which you have already heard this was one of the pleasantest bits of road we had then seen in switzerland the water was quite near us on the right and we were absolutely shut in on the left by the precipitous mountain until having doubled it we came out upon an arm of the lake of lucerne at küsnacht to which place we descended by the chemin creux night overtook us again while crossing the beautiful ridge of land that separates the bay of küsnacht from the foot of the lake but the road being excellent we trotted on in security until we alighted at nine oclock in the city of lucerne  the weather appearing unusually fine the next day françois was ordered round to berne with the carriage and luggage and we engaged a guide and took a boat for alpnach at eleven we embarked and pulled up under lovely verdant banks which are occupied by villas till we reached the arm of the lake that stretches towards the southwest here a fair breeze struck us and making sail away we went skimming before it at the rate of eight miles an hour once or twice the wind came with a power that showed how necessary it is to be cautious on a water that is bounded by so many precipitous rocks we passed the solitary tower of stanztad on the wing and reached alpnach in less than two hours after embarking  here we took two of the little vehicles of the country and went on the road carried us through sarnen where my companions who had never before visited the unterwaldens stopped to see the lions i shall not go over these details with you again but press on towards our restingplace for the night on reaching the foot of the rocks which form the natural dam that upholds the lake of lungern p and myself alighted and walked ahead the ascent being short we made so much progress as to reach the upper end of the little sheet a distance of near a league before we were overtaken by the others and when we did meet it was amid general exclamations of delight at the ravishing beauties of the place i cannot recall sensations of purer pleasure produced by any scenery than those i felt myself on this occasion and in which all around me appeared to participate  our pleasures tastes and even our judgments are so much affected by the circumstances under which they are called into action that one has need of diffidence on the subject of their infallibility if it be only to protect himself from the imputation of inconsistency i was pleased with the lake of lungern in 1828 but the term is not strong enough for the gratification it gave me on this return to it perhaps the day the peculiar play of light and shade a buoyancy of spirits or some auxiliary causes may have contributed to produce this state of mind or it is possible that the views were really improved by changing the direction of the route as all connoisseurs in scenery know that the hudson is much finer when descending than when ascending its stream but let the cause be what it might had i then been asked what particular spot in europe had given me most delight by the perfection of its natural beauties taken in connexion with its artificial accessories i should have answered that it was the shores of the lake of lungern nor as i have told you was i alone in this feeling for one and all big and littlein short the whole party joined in pronouncing the entire landscape absolutely exquisite any insignificant change a trifle more or less of humidity in the atmosphere the absence or the intervention of a few clouds a different hour or a different frame of mind may have diminished our pleasure for these are enjoyments which like the flavour of delicate wines or the melody of sweet music are deranged by the condition of the nerves or a want of harmony in the chords  after this explanation you will feel how difficult it will be to describe the causes of our delight the leading features of the landscape however were a road that ran along the shore beneath a forest within ten feet of the water winding losing itself and reappearing with the sinuosities of the bank water limpid as air and blue as the void of the heavens unruffled and even holy in its aspect as if it reflected the pure space above a mountainside on the opposite shore that was high enough to require study to draw objects from its bosom on the distant heights and yet near enough below to seem to be within an arrows flight meadows shorn like lawns scattered over its broad breast woods of larches to cast their gloom athwart the glades and to deepen the shadows brown chalets that seemed to rise out of the sward at the bidding of the eye and here and there a cottage poised on a giddy height with a chapel or two to throw a religious calm over all there was nothing ambitious in this view which was rural in every feature but it was the very bean idéal of rustic beauty and without a single visible blemish to weaken its effect it was some such picture of natural objects as is formed of love by a confiding and ingenuous youth of fifteen  we passed the night in the drum of lungern and found it raining hard when we rose the following morning the water soon ceased to fall in torrents however changing to a drizzle at which time the valley clouded in mists in constant motion was even more beautiful than ever so perfect were the accessories so minute was everything rendered by the mighty scale so even was the grass and so pure the verdure that bits of the mountain pasturages or alps coming into view through the openings in the vapour appeared like highlyfinished flemish paintings and this the more so because all the grouping of objects the chalets cottages c were exactly those that the artist would seize upon to embellish his own work indeed we have daily hourly occasions to observe how largely the dealers in the picturesque have drawn upon the resources of this extraordinary country whether the pallet or poetry in some other form has been the medium of conveying pleasure  the garçon of the inn pointed to some mist that was rolling along a particular mountain and said it was the infallible barometer of lungern we might be certain of getting fair weather within an hour a real barometer corroborated the testimony of the mist but the change was slower than had been predicted and we began to tire of so glorious a picture under an impatience to proceed for one does not like to swallow pleasure even perforce  at ten we were able to quit the inn one half of the party taking the bridlepath attended by two horsekeepers while the rest of us choosing to use our own limbs were led by the guide up the mountains by a shorter cut on foot the view from the brunig was not as fine as i had round it in 1828 perhaps because i was then taken completely by surprise and perhaps because ignorance of the distant objects had then thrown the charm of mystery over its background we now saw the scene in detail too while mounting for though it is better to ascend than descend the finest effects are produced by obtaining the whole at once  we joined the equestrians on the summit where the horses were discharged and we proceeded the remainder of the distance on foot we soon met the bear of berne and entered the great canton the view of the valley of meyringen and of the cataracts greeted us like an old friend and the walk by a path which wound its way through the bushes and impended over this beautiful panorama was of course delightful at length we caught a glimpse of the lake of brientz and hurrying on reached the village before two  here we ordered a goûter and while taking it the first english party we had yet seen entered the inn as we were all seated at the same table the company consisted of this english party ourselves and a solitary frenchman who eyed us keenly but said nothing it soon appeared that some great political crisis was at hand for the englishman began to cry out against the growing democracy of the cantons i did not understand all his allusions nor do i think he had very clear notions about them himself for he wound up one of his denunciatory appeals by the old cant of instead of one tyrant they will now have many which is a sort of reasoning that is not particularly applicable to the overturning of aristocracy anywhere it is really melancholy to perceive how few men are capable of reasoning or feeling on political subjects in any other way than that which is thought most to subserve their own particular interests and selfishness did we not know that the real object of human institutions is to restrain human tendencies one would be almost disposed to give up the point in despair for i do affirm that in all my associations in different countries i do not recollect more than a dozen men who have appeared to me to entertain right notions on this subject or who have seemed capable of appreciating the importance of any changes that were not likely materially to affect their own pockets  the frenchman heard us speaking in his own language which we did with a view of drawing john bull out and he asked a passage in the boat i had ordered as far as interlachen conditioning that he should make the détour to the giesbach his application was admitted and we proceeded forthwith this was the fourth time i had crossed the lake of brientz but the first in which i visited the justly celebrated falls towards which we now steered on quitting the shore  our companion proved to be a merry fellow and well disposed to work his passage by his wit i have long been cured of the notion that the name of an american is a passport all over europe and have learned to understand in its place that on the contrary it is thought to be prima facie evidence of vulgarity ignorance and conceit nor do i think that the french as a nation have any particular regard for us but knowing the inherent dislike of a frenchman for an englishman and that the newfangled fraternity arising out of the tradingprinciple government only renders to a disinterested looker on the old antipathies more apparent i made an occasion indirectly to let our new associate understand that we came from the other side of the atlantic this produced an instantaneous change in his manner and it was now that he began to favour us with specimens of his humour notwithstanding all this facetiousness i soon felt suspicion that the man was an employé of the carlists and that his business in switzerland was connected with political plots he betrayed himself at the very moment when he was most anxious to make us think him a mere amateur of scenery i cannot tell you how but still so clearly as to strike all of us precisely in the same way  the giesbach is a succession of falls whose water comes from a glacier and which are produced by the sinuosities of the leaps and inclined planes of a mountain side aided by rocks and precipices it is very beautiful and may well rank as the third or fourth cascade of switzerland for variety volume of water and general effect a family has established itself among the rocks to pick up a penny by making boxes of larch and singing the different ranz des raches your mountain music does not do so well when it has an air so seriously premeditated and one soon gels to be a little blasé on the subject of entertainments of this sort which can only succeed once and then with the novice alas i have actually stood before the entrance of the cathedral at rouen and the strongest feeling of the moment was that of surprise at the manner in which my nerves had thrilled when it was first seen i do not believe that childhood with its unsophistication and freshness affords the greatest pleasures for every hour tells me how much reason and cultivation enhance our enjoyments but there are certainly gratifications that can be felt but once and if an opera of rossini or meyerbeer grows on us at each representation or a fine poem improves on acquaintance the singing of your swiss nightingales is sweeter in its first notes than in its second  after spending an hour at the giesbach we rowed along the eastern or rather the southern shore of the lake to interlachen the sight of the blue aar revived old recollections and we landed on its banks with infinite pleasure here a few civil speeches passed between the merry frenchman and myself when we separated he disappearing altogether and we taking the way to the great lodginghouse which like most of the other places of resort in switzerland was then nearly empty the grandduchess anna however had come down from ulfnau her residence on the aar for a tour in the oberland and was among the guests we got a glimpse of her coming in from a drive and she appeared to resemble her brother the duke more than her brother the king  in the morning we drove up to lauterbrunnen and i am compelled to say that so completely fickle had we become that i believe all who had seen this valley before pronounced it less beautiful than that of lungern by the way of proving to you how capricious a thing is taste i liked the staubbach better than in the former visit we did not attempt the mountains this time but drove round in our chars to grindewald where we dined and slept either a new approach or improved tastes or some other cause wrought another change here for we now preferred grindewald to lauterbrunnen as a valley the vulgar astonishment was gone and our eyes sought details with critical nicety we went to the lower glacier whose form had not materially changed in four years and we had fine views of both of them from the windows of the inn there was a young moon and i walked out to watch the effect on the high glaciers which were rendered even more than usually unearthly in appearance under its clear bland light these changes of circumstances strangely increase the glories of the mountains  we left grindewald quite early next morning and proceeded towards neuhaus the road led us through a scene of desolation that had been caused by a rising of the waters in 1830 and we examined the devastation with the more interest as some of our acquaintances had nearly perished in the torrent  the family in question were residing temporarily at interlachen when two of the ladies with a child attended by a black servant drove up the gorge of lauterbrunnen for an airing they were overtaken by a tempest of rain and by the torrent which rose so rapidly as to cut off all retreat except by ascending the precipice which to the eye is nearly perpendicular there is however a hamlet on one of the terraces of the mountain and thither the servant was despatched for succour the honest peasants at first believed he was a demon on account of his colour and it was not without difficulty they were persuaded to follow him the ladies eventually escaped up the rocks but our coachman who had acted as the coachman on that occasion assured us it was with the utmost difficulty he saved his horse  this accident which was neither a sac deau nor an avalanche gives one a good idea of the sudden dangers to which the traveller is liable in the midst of a nature so stupendous a large part of the beautiful meadows of interlachen was laid desolate and the calamity was so sudden that it overtook two young and delicate females in their morning drive  we drove directly to the little port at neuhaus and took a boat for thoun pulling cut into the lake with a fresh breeze directly in our teeth the picturesque little chateau of spietz stood on its green promontory and all the various objects that we had formerly gazed at with so much pleasure were there fresh peculiar and attractive as ever at length after a heavy pull we were swept within the current of the aar which soon bore us to the landing  at thoun we breakfasted and taking a return carriage trotted up to berne by the valley of which you have already heard so much françois was in waiting for us and we got comfortable rooms at the crown  our tastes are certainly altering whether there be any improvement or not we are beginning to feel it is vulgar to be astonished and even in scenery i think we rather look for the features that fill up the keeping and make the finish than those which excite wonder we have seen too much to be any longer taken in by your natural claptraps a step in advance that i attribute to a long residence in italy a country in which the sublime is so exquisitely blended with the soft as to create a taste which tells us they ought to be inseparable  in this little excursion to the oberland while many perhaps most of our old impressions are confirmed its relative beauties have not appeared to be entitled to as high praises as we should have given them had they not been seen a second time we had fine weather were all in good spirits and happy and the impression being so general i am inclined to think it is no more than the natural effect which is produced by more experience and greater knowledge i now speak of the valleys however for the high alps are as superior to the caprices of taste as their magnificent dimensions and faultless outline are beyond change     letter xvi  conspiracy discoveredthe austrian government and the french carlistswalk to la lorraineour old friend turcconversation with m wview of the upper alpsjerome bonaparte at la lorrainethe bears of bernescene on the plateforme   dear   soon after we reached berne françois came to me in a mysterious manner to inquire if i had heard any news of importance i had heard nothing and he then told me that many arrests had just taken place and that a conspiracy of the old aristocracy had been discovered which had a counterrevolution for its object i say a counterrevolution for you ought to have heard that great political changes have occurred in switzerland since 1830 france always giving an impulse to the cantons democracy is in the ascendant and divers old opinions laws and institutions have been the sacrifice this in the land of the burgerschaft has necessarily involved great changes and the threatened plot is supposed to be an effort of the old privileged party to regain their power as françois notwithstanding he has seen divers charges of cavalry against the people and has witnessed two or three revolutions is not very clearheaded in such matters i walked out immediately to seek information from rather better authority  the result of my inquiries was briefly as followsneufchâtel whose prince is the king of prussia has receded from the confederation on account of the recent changes and the leaders of the aristocratic party were accused of combining a plan under the protection and with the knowledge of the authorities of this state to produce a counterrevolution in berne well knowing the influence of this canton in the confederation this very day is said to be the one selected for the effort and rumour adds that a large body of the peasants of the oberland were to have crossed the brunig yesterday with a view to cooperate in other sections of the country a merry company we should have been had it been our luck to have fallen in with this escort now rightfully or not the austrian government and the french carlists are openly accused of being concerned in this conspiracy and probably not without some cause the suspicions excited concerning our fellowtraveller through his own acts recurred to me and i now think it probable he was in waiting for the aforesaid peasants most probably to give them a military direction for he had the air and franchise of an old french soldier the plot had been betrayed some were already arrested and some had taken refuge in flight the town was tranquil but the guards were strengthened and the popular party was actively on the alert  the next morning we went forth to look once more at picturesque cloistered verdant berne nothing appeared to be changed though the strangers were but few and there was perhaps less movement than formerly we crossed the aar and walked to la lorraine as we were going through the fields several dogs rushed out against us but when p called out turc the noble animal appeared to know him and we were permitted to proceed escorted rather than troubled by the whole pack this was a good omen and it was grateful to be remembered by even a dog after an absence of four years  we found the same family in possession of the farm though on the point of removing to another place our reception in the house was still more cordial than that given by turk and our gratitude in proportion the old abode was empty and we walked over it with feelings in which pain and pleasure were mingled for poor w who was with us full of youth and spirits when we resided here is now a tenant of père lachaise when we went away all the dogs with turk at their head escorted us to the ferry where they stood looking wistfully at us from the bank until we landed in berne  soon after i met m w in the streets and as he had not been at home i greeted him inviting him to dine with us at the crown the present aspect of things was of course touched upon during the dinner when the worthy member of the burgerschaft lamented the changes in a manner becoming his own opinions while i rejoiced in them in a manner becoming mine he asked me if i really thought that men who were totally inexperienced in the affairs of government could conduct matters properlyan old and favourite appeal with the disciples of political exclusion i endeavoured to persuade him that the art of administering was no great art that there was more danger of rulers knowing too much than of their knowing too little old soldiers proverbially taking better care of themselves than young soldiers that he must not expect too much for they that know the practices of free governments well know it is hopeless to think of keeping pure and disinterested men long in office even as men go there being a corrupting influence about the very exercise of power that forbids the hope and that all which shrewd observers look for in popular institutions is a greater check than common on the selfishness of those to whom authority is confided i told him the man who courts popular favour in a republic would court a prince in a monarchy the elements of a demagogue and a courtier being exactly the same and that under either system except in extraordinary instances it was useless to attempt excluding such men from authority since their selfishness was more active than the feelings of the disinterested that in our own case so long as the impetus of the revolution and the influence of great events lasted we had great men in the ascendant but now that matters were jogging on regularly and under their commonplace aspects we were obliged to take up with merely clever managers that one of the wisest men that had ever lived bacon had said that few men rise to power in a state without a union of great and mean qualities and that this was probably as true at berne as it is at washington and as true at paris as at either that the old system in his country savoured too much of the policy of giving the milk of two cows to one calf and that he must remember it was a system that made very bad as well as very good veal whereas for ordinary purposes it was better to have the same quantity of merely good veal and in short that he himself would soon be surprised at discovering how soon the new rulers would acquire all the useful habits of their predecessors and i advised him to look out that they did not acquire some of their bad ones too  i never flattered myself with producing a change of opinion in the captain who always listened politely but with just such an air of credulity as you might suppose one born to the benefits of the burgerschaft and who had got to be fifty would listen to a dead attack on all his most cherished prejudices  the next day was sunday and we still lingered in our comfortable quarters at the crown i walked on the plateforme before breakfast and got another of those admirable views of the upper alps which notwithstanding the great beauty of its position and immediate environs form the principal attraction of berne the peaks were draped rather than veiled in clouds and it was not easy to say which was the most brilliant the snowwhite vapour that adorned their sides or the icy glaciers themselves still they were distinct from each other forming some such contrast as that which exists between the raised and sunken parts on the faces of new coin  we went to church and listened to some excellent german after which we paid our last visit to la lorraine this house had been hired by king jerome for a short time after his exile in 1814 his brother joseph occupying a neighbouring residence the ws told me that jerome arrived accompanied by his amiable wife like a king with horses chamberlains pages and all the other appliances of royalty and that it was curious as well as painful to witness how fast these followers dropped off as the fate of the family appeared to be settled few besides the horses remained at the end of ten days  on our return from this visit we went in a body to pay our respect to our old friends the bears i believe you have already been told that the city of berne maintains four bears in certain deep pens where it is the practice to feed them with nuts cakes apples etc according to the liberality and humour of the visitor the usage is very ancient and has some connexion with a tradition that has given its name to the canton a bear is also the arms of the state one of these animals is a model of grace waddling about on his hind legs like an alderman in a ballroom you may imagine that p was excessively delighted at the sight of these old friends the bernese have an engraving of the graceful bear in his upright attitude and the stove of our salon at the crown which is of painted tile among a goodly assemblage of gods and goddesses includes bruin as one of its ornaments  françois made his appearance after dinner accompanied by his friend le petit savoyard who had arrived from frankfort and came once more to offer his services to conduct us to lapland should it be our pleasure to travel in that direction it would have been ungracious to refuse so constant a suitor and he was ordered to be in attendance next morning to proceed towards the lake of geneva  in the evening we went on the plateforme to witness the sunset but the mountains were concealed by clouds the place was crowded and refreshments were selling in little pavilions erected for the purpose we are the only protestants who are such rigid observers of the sabbath the scotch perhaps excepted in england there is much less restraint than in america and on the continent the protestants though less gay than the catholics very generally consider it a day of recreation after the services of the church are ended i have heard some of them maintain that we have misinterpreted the meaning of the word holy which obtains its true signification in the term holiday i have never heard any one go so far however as hannah moore says was the case with horace walpole who contended that the ten commandments were not meant for people of quality no one whose mind and habits have got extricated from the fogs of provincial prejudices will deny that we have many odious moral deformities in america that appear in the garb of religious discipline and even religious doctrine but which are no more than the offspring of sectarian fanaticism and which in fact by annihilating charity are so many blows given to the essential feature of christianity but apart from these i still lean to the opinion that we are quite as near the great truths as any other people extant  mr  the english chargé daffaires whom i had known slightly at paris and mr  who had once belonged to the english legation in washington were on the plateforme the latter told me that carroll of carrolton was dead that he had been dead a year and that he had written letters of condolence on the occasion i assured him that the old gentleman was alive on the 4th july last for i had seen one of his letters in the public journals here was a capital windfall for a regular diplomate who now clearly had nothing to do but to hurry home and write letters of felicitation  the late changes in england have produced more than the usual mutations in her diplomatic corps which under ordinary circumstances important trusts excepted has hitherto been considered at the disposal of any minister in america we make it matter of reproach that men are dismissed from office on account of their political opinions and it is usual to cite england as an example of greater liberality all this is singularly unjust because in its spirit like ninetenths of our popular notions of england it is singularly untrue the changes of ministry which merely involve the changes incident on taking power from one clique of the aristocracy to give it to another have not hitherto involved questions of sufficient importance to render it matter of moment to purge all the lists of the disaffected but since the recent serious struggles we have seen changes that do not occur even in america every tory for instance is ousted from the legations if we except nameless subordinates the same purification is going on elsewhere though the english system does not so much insist on the changes of employés as that the employés themselves should change their opinions how long would an english tidewaiter for instance keep his place should he vote against the ministerial candidate i apprehend these things depend on a common principle i e selfinterest everywhere and that it makes little difference in substance what the form of government may happen to be  but of all the charges that have been brought against us the comparative instability of the public favour supposed to be a consequence of fluctuations in the popular will is the most audacious for it is contradicted by the example of every royal government in christendom since the formation of the present american constitution there have been but two changes of administration that have involved changes of principles or changes in popular willthat which placed mr jefferson in the seat of mr adams senior and that which placed mr jackson in the seat of mr adams junior whereas during the short period of my visit to europe i have witnessed six or seven absolute changes of the english ministry and more than twenty in france besides one revolution liberty has been hitherto in the situation of the lion whose picture was drawn by a man but which there was reason to think would receive more favourable touches when the lion himself should take up the pallet     letter xvii  our voiturier and

church and winter churchclergy of the cantonpopulation of vaudelective qualifications of vaud  dear   le petit savoyard was punctual and after breakfasting away we rolled along the even and beaten road towards morat this man and his team were epitomes of the voiturier caste and their fixtures he himself was a firm sunburned compact little fellow just suited to ride a wheeler while the horses were sinewy and so lean that there was no mistaking their vocation every bone in their bodies spoke of the weight of miladi and her heavy english travelling chariot and i really thought they seemed to be glad to get a whole american family in place of an englishwoman and her maid the morning was fine and our last look at the oberland peaks was sunny and pleasant there they stood ranged along the horizon like sentinels not lighthouses of the skies severe chiseled brilliant and grand  another travelling equipage of the gregarious kind or in which the carriage as well as the horses was the property of the voiturier and the passengers mere picnics was before us in ascending a long hill affording an excellent opportunity to dissect the whole party as it is a specimen of the groups one constantly meets on the road i will give you some idea of the component parts  the voiturier was merely a larger brother of le petit savoyard and his horses three in number were walking bundles of chopped straw the carriage was spacious and i dare say convenient though anything but beautiful on the top there was a rail within which effects were stowed beneath an apron leaving an outline not unlike the ridges of the alps the merry rogues within had chosen to take room to themselves and not a package of any sort encumbered their movements and here i will remark that america free and independent is the only country in which i have ever journeyed where the comfort and convenience in the vehicle is the first thing considered that of the baggage the next and that of the passengers the last32 fortunately for the horses there were but four passengers though the vehicle could have carried eight one by his little green cap with a misshapen shade for the eyes light shaggy uncombed hair square high shoulders a coat that appeared to be halfmale halffemale pipe and pouchwas undeniably a german student who was travelling south to finish his metaphysics with a few practical notions of men and things a second was a jew who had trade in every lineament and who belonged so much to the nation that i could not give him to any other nation in particular he was older more wary less joyous and probably much more experienced than either of his companions when they laughed he only smiled when they sang he hummed and when they seemed thoughtful he grew sad i could make nothing out of him except that he ran a thorough bass to the higher pitches of his companions humours the third was italian for a ducat a thick bushy glossy curling head of hair was covered by a little scarlet cap tossed negligently on one side as if lodged there by chance his eye was large mellow black as jet and full of fun and feeling his teeth white as ivory and the sun the glorious sun and the thoughts of italy towards which he was travelling had set all his animal spirits in motion i caught a few words in bad french which satisfied me that he and the german were jeering each other on their respective national peculiarities such is man his egotism and vanity first centre in himself and he is ready to defend himself against the reproofs of even his own mother then his wife his child his brother his friend is admitted in succession within the pale of his selflove according to their affinities with the great centre of the system and finally he can so far expand his affections as to embrace his country when that of another presents its pretensions in hostility when the question arises as between humanity and the beasts of the field he gets to be a philanthropist  footnote 32 the americans are a singularly goodnatured people and probably submit to more impositions that are presented as appeals to the spirit of accommodation than any other people on earth the writer has frequently ridden miles in torture to accommodate a trunk and the steamboats manage matters so to accommodate everybody that everybody is put to inconvenience all this is done with the most indomitable kindness and good nature on all sides the people daily nay hourly exhibiting in all their public relations the truth of the axiom that what is everybodys business is nobodys business  morat with its walls of jericho soon received us and we drove to an inn where chopped straw was ordered for the horses and a more substantial goûter for ourselves leaving the former to discuss their meal after finishing our own we walked ahead and waited the appearance of the little savoyard on the scene of the great battle between the swiss and the burgundians the country has undergone vast changes since the fifteenth century and cultivation has long since caused the marsh in which so many of the latter perished to disappear though it is easy to see where it must have formerly been i have nothing new to say concerning avenche whose roman ruins after rome itself scarce caused us to cast a glance at them and we drove up to the door of the ours at payerne without alighting when we are children we fancy that sweets can never cloy and indignantly repel the idea that tarts and sugarplums will become matters of indifference to us a little later we swear eternal constancy to a first love and form everlasting friendships as time slips away we marry three or four wives shoot a bosomfriend or two and forget the looks of those whose images were to be graven on our hearts for ever you will wonder at this digression which has been excited by the simple fact that i actually caught myself gaping when something was said about queen bertha and her saddle the state of apathy to which one finally arrives is really frightful  we left payerne early and breakfasted at the inevitable inn of moudon here it was necessary to decide in what direction to steer for i had left the charterparty with le petit savoyard open on this essential point the weather was so fine the season of the year so nearly the same and most of the other circumstances so very much like those under which we had made the enchanting passage along the head of the leman four years before that we yielded to the desire to renew the pleasures of such a transit and turned our faces towards vévey  at the point where the roads separate therefore we diverged from the main route which properly leads to lausanne inclining southward we soon were rolling along the margin of the little blue lake that lies on the summit of the hills so famous for its prawns we knew that a few minutes would bring us to the brow of the great declivity and all eyes were busy and all heads eagerly in motion as for myself i took my station on the dickey determined to let nothing escape me in a scene that i remembered with so much enduring delight  contrary to the standing rule in such cases the reality surpassed expectation notwithstanding our long sojourn in italy and the great variety and magnificence of the scenery we had beheld i believe there was not a feeling of disappointment among us all there lay the leman broad blue and tranquil with its surface dotted by sails or shadowed by grand mountains its shores varying from the impending precipice to the sloping and verdant lawn the solemn mysterious and glenlike valley of the rhone the castles towns villages hamlets and towers with all the smiling acclivities loaded with vines villas and churches the remoter pastures out of which the brown chalets rose like subdued basreliefs and the background of dents peaks and glaciers taking it altogether it is one of the most ravishing views of an earth that is only too lovely for its evilminded tenants a world that bears about it in every lineament the impression of its divine creator  one of our friends used to tell an anecdote of the black servant of a visitor at niagara who could express his delight on seeing the falls in no other way than by peals of laughter and perhaps i ought to hesitate to confess it but i actually imitated the negro as this glorious view broke suddenly upon me mine however was a laugh of triumph for i instantly discovered that my feelings were not quite worn out and that it was still possible to awaken enthusiasm within me by the sight of an admirable nature  our first resolution was to pass a month in this beautiful region pointing to a building that stood a thousand feet below us on a little grassy knoll that was washed by the lake and which had the quaint appearance of a tiny chateau of the middle ages we claimed it at once as the very spot suited for the temporary residence of your sceneryhunters we all agreed that nothing could possibly suit us better and we went down the descent among vineyards and cottages not building castles in the air but peopling one in a valley it was determined to dwell in that house if it could be had for love or money or the thing was at all practicable  it was still early when we reached the inn in vévey and i was scarcely on the ground before i commenced the necessary inquiries about the little chateauish house as is usual in some parts of europe i was immediately referred to a female commissionnaire a sort of domestic broker of allwork this woman supplies travelling families with linen and at need with plate and she could greatly facilitate matters by knowing where and to whom to apply for all that was required an improvement in the division of labour that may cause you to smile but which is extremely useful and on the whole like all division of labour economical  the commissionnaire informed us that there were an unusual number of furnished houses to be let in the neighbourhood the recent political movements having driven away their ordinary occupants the english and russians some of the proprietors however might object to the shortness of the time that we could propose for a month as it was customary to let the residences by the year there was nothing like trying however and ordering dinner to be ready against our return we took a carriage and drove along the lakeshore as far as clarens so renowned in the pages of rousseau i ought however to premise that i would not budge a foot until the woman assured me over and over that the little antiquated edifice under the mountain which had actually been a sort of chateau was not at all habitable for a genteel family but had degenerated to a mere coarse farmhouse which in this country like love in a cottage does better in idea than in the reality we gave up our castle under the hill with reluctance and proceeded to clarens where a spacious unshaded building without a spark of poetry about it was first shown us this was refused incontinently we then tried one or two more until the shades of night overtook us at one place the proprietor was chasing a cow through an orchard and probably a little heated with his exercise he rudely repelled the application of the commissionnaire by telling her when he understood the house was wanted for only a month that he did not keep a maison garnie i could not affirm to the contrary and we returned to the inn discomfited for the night  early next morning the search was renewed with zeal we climbed the mountainside in the rear of the town among vines orchards hamlets terraces castles and villas to see one of the latter which was refused on account of its remoteness from the lake we then went to see a spot that was the very beau idéal of an abode for people like ourselves who were out in quest of the picturesque it is called the chateau of piel a small hamlet immediately on the shore of the lake and quite near vévey while it is perfectly retired the house is spacious reasonably comfortable and had some fine old towers built into the modern parts a detached ruin and a long narrow terrace under the windows that overhung the blue leman and which faced the glorious rocks of savoy our application for their residence was also refused on account of the shortness of the time we intended to remain33  footnote 33 it is not easy for the writer to speak of many personal incidents lest the motive might be mistaken in a country where there are so many always disposed to attach a base one if they can but it is so creditable to the advanced state of european civilization and intelligence that at any hazard he will here say that even his small pretensions to literary reputation frequently were of great service to him and in no instance even in those countries whose prejudices be had openly opposed had he any reason to believe it was of any personal disadvantage this feeling prevailed at the english customhouses at the bureaux all over the continent and frequently even at the inns in one instance in italy an apartment that had been denied was subsequently offered to him on his own terms on this account and on the present occasion the proprietor of the chateau de piel who resided at geneva sent a handsome expression of his regret that his agent should have thought it necessary to deny the application of a gentleman of his pursuits even the cowchaser paid a similar homage to letters in short let the truth be said the only country in which the writer has found his pursuits a disadvantage is his own  we had in reserve all this time two or three regular maisons meublées in the town itself and finally took refuge in one called mon repos which stands quite near the lake and in a retired corner of the place a cook was engaged forthwith and in less than twentyfour hours after entering vévey we had set up our household gods and were to be reckoned among them who boiled our pot in the commune this was not quite as prompt as the proceedings had been at spa but here we had been bothered by the picturesque while at spa we consulted nothing but comfort our house was sufficiently large perfectly clean and though without carpets or mats things but little used in switzerland quite as comfortable as was necessary for a travelling bivouac the price was sixty dollars a month including plate and linen of course it might have been got at a much lower rate had we taken it by the year  one of the first measures after getting possession of mon repos was to secure a boat this was soon done as there are several in constant attendance at what is called the port harbour strictly speaking vévey has none though there is a commencement of a mole which scarcely serves to afford shelter to a skiff the crafts in use on the lake are large twomasted boats having decks much broader than their true beam and which carry most of their freight above board the sails are strictly neither latine nor lug but sufficiently like the former to be picturesque especially in the distance these vessels are not required to make good weather as they invariably run for the land when it blows unless the wind happen to be fair and sometimes even then nothing can be more primitive than the outfit of one of these barks and yet they appear to meet the wants of the lake luckily switzerland has no customhouses and the king of sardinia appears to be wise enough to let the savoyards enjoy nearly as much commercial liberty as their neighbours three cantons geneva which embraces its foot vaud which bounds nearly the whole of the northern shore valais which encircles the head together with savoy which lies along the cavity of the crescent are bounded by the lake there are also many towns and villages on the lake among which geneva lausanne and vévey are the principal  this place lies immediately at the foot of the chardonne a high retiring section of the mountains called the jorat and is completely sheltered from the north winds this advantage it possesses in common with the whole district between lausanne and villeneuve a distance of some fifteen miles and the mountains acting as great natural walls the fruits of milder latitudes are successfully cultivated notwithstanding the general elevation of the lake above the sea is near thirteen hundred feet although a good deal frequented by strangers vévey is less a place of fashionable resort than lausanne and is consequently much simpler in its habits and i suppose cheaper as a residence it may have four or five thousand inhabitants and possessing one or two considerable squares it covers rather more ground than places of that population usually do in europe it has no edifice of much pretension and yet it is not badly built  we passed the first three or four days in looking about us and on the whole we have been rather pleased with the place our house is but a stones throw from the water at a point where there is what in the manhattanese dialect would be called a battery34 this battery leads to the mole and the great square at the first corner of the latter stands a small semicastellated edifice with the colours of the canton on the windowshutters which is now in some way occupied for public purposes and which formerly was the residence of the bailli or the local governor that berne formerly sent to rule them in the name of the burgerschaft the square is quite large and usually contains certain piles of boards c that are destined for the foot of the lake lumber being a material article in the commerce of the place on this square also is the ordinary market and several inns the townhouse is an ancient building in a more crowded quarter and at the northern gate are the remains of another structure that has an air of antiquity which i believe also belongs to the public beyond these and its glorious views vévey in itself has but little to attract attention but its environs contain its sources of pride besides the lakeshore which varies in its form and beauties it is not easy to imagine a more charming acclivity than that which lies behind the town the inclination is by no means as great just at this spot at it is both farther east and farther west but it admits of cultivation of sites for hamlets and is much broken by inequalities and spacious natural terraces i cannot speak with certainty of the extent of this acclivity but taking the eye for a guide i should think there is quite a league of the inclined plane in view from the town it is covered with hamlets chateaux countryhouses churches and cottages and besides its vines of which there are many near the town it is highly beautiful from the verdure of its slopes its orchards and its groves of nuttrees  footnote 34 the manner in which the english language is becoming corrupted in america as well as in england is a matter of serious regret some accidental circumstance induced the manhattanese to call a certain enclosure the park this name probably at first was appropriate enough as there might have been an intention really to form a park though the enclosure is now scarcely large enough to be termed a paddock this name however has extended to the enclosures in other areas and we have already in vulgar parlance st johns park washington park and least though not last duanestreet park an enclosure of the shape of and not much larger than a cockedhat the site of an ancient fort on the water has been converted into a promenade and has well enough been called the battery but other similar promenades are projected and the name is extended to them thus in the manhattanese dialect any enclosure in a town off the water that is a park and any similar enclosure on the water a battery the worthy aldermen may call this english but it will not be easy to persuade any but their constituents to believe them  among other objects that crowd this background is a church which stands on a sharp acclivity about a quarter of a mile on the rear of the town it is a stone building of some size and has a convenient artificial terrace that commands as a matter of course a most lovely view we attended service in it the first sunday after our arrival and found the rites homely and naked very much like those of our own presbyterians there was a luxury about this building that you would hardly expect to meet among a people so simple which quite puts the coquetry of our own carpeted cushioned closetlike places of worship to shame this is the summer church of vévey another being used for winter this surpasses the refinement of the roman ladies who had their summer and their winter rings but were satisfied to use the same temples all the year round after all there is something reasonable in this indulgence one may love to go up to a high place to worship whence he can look abroad on the glories of a magnificent nature which always disposes the mind to venerate omnipotence and unable to enjoy the advantage the year round there is good sense in seizing such occasions as offer for the indulgence i have frequently met with churches in switzerland perched on the most romantic sites though this is the first whose distinctive uses i have ascertained there is a monument to the memory of ludlow one of charles judges in this church and an inscription which attributes to him civic and moral merits of a high order  the clergy in this canton as in most if not all the others are supported by the state there is religious toleration much as it formerly existed in new england each citizen being master of his religious professions but being compelled to support religion itself here however the salaries are regulated by a common scale without reference to particular congregations or parishes the pastors at first receive rather less than three hundred dollars a year this allowance is increased about fifty dollars at the end of six years and by the same sum at each successive period of six years until the whole amounts to two thousand swiss or three thousand french francs which is something less than six hundred dollars there is also a house and a garden and pensions are bestowed on the widows and children on the whole the state has too much connexion with this great interest but the system has the allimportant advantage of preventing men from profaning the altar as a pecuniary speculation the population of vaud is about 155000 souls and there are one hundred and fiftyeight protestant pastors besides four catholics or about one clergyman to each thousand souls which is just about the proportion that exists in new york  in conversing with an intelligent vaudois on returning from the church i found that a great deal of interest is excited in this canton by the late conspiracy in berne the vaudois have got that attachment to liberty which is ever the result of a long political dependence and which so naturally disposes the inferior to resist the superior it is not pretended however that the domination of berne was particularly oppressive though as a matter of course whenever the interests of vaud happened to conflict with those of the great canton the former had to succumb still the reaction of a political dependency which lasted more than two centuries and a half had brought about even previously to the late changes a much more popular form of government than was usual in switzerland and the people here really manifest some concern on the subject of this effort of aristocracy as you may like to compare the elective qualifications of one of the more liberal cantons of the confederation with some of our own i will give you an outline of those of vaud copied in the substance from picot  the voter must have had a legal domicile in the canton one year be a citizen twentyfive years old and be of the number of the threefourths of the citizens who pay the highest landtax or have three sons enrolled and serving in the militia domestics persons receiving succour from the parishes bankrupts outlaws and convicted criminals are perpetually excluded from the elective franchise  this system though far better than that of france which establishes a certain amount of direct taxation is radically vicious as it makes property and that of a particular species the test of power it is in truth the old english plan a little modified and the recent revolution that has lately taken place in england under the name of reform goes to prove that it is a system which contains in itself the seeds of vital changes as every political question is strictly one of practice changes become necessary everywhere with the changes of circumstances and these are truly reforms but when they become so serious as to overturn principles they produce the effects of revolutions though possibly in a mitigated form every system therefore should be so framed as to allow of all the alterations which are necessary to convenience with a strict regard to its own permanency as connected with its own governing principle in america in consequence of having attended to this necessity from the commencement we have undergone no revolution in principle in half a century though constantly admitting of minor changes while nearly all europe has either in theory or in practice or in both been effectually revolutionized nor does the short period from which our independent existence dates furnish any argument against us as it is not so much time as the changes of which time is the parent that tries political systems and america has undergone the ordinary changes such as growth extension of interests and the other governing circumstances of society that properly belong to two centuries within the last fifty years america today in all but government is less like the america of 1776 than the france of today is like the france of 1600 while it is the fashion to scout our example as merely that of an untried experiment ours is fast getting to be the oldest political system in christendom as applied to one and the same people nations are not easily destroyedthey exist under a variety of mutations and names last longer than things but i now speak in reference to distinguishing and prominent facts without regard to the various mystifications under which personal interests disguise themselves     letter xviii  neglect of the vine in

for the vineanecdotevines of véveythe american foxgrape   dear   a little incident has lately impressed me with the great wealth of this quarter of the world in wines as compared with our own poverty by poverty i do not mean ignorance of the beverage or a want of good liquors for i believe few nations have so many varieties or varieties so excellent as ourselves certainly it is not common to meet as good bordeaux wines in paris as in new york the other good liquors of france are not so common and yet the best burgundy i ever drank was in america35 this is said without reference to the different qualities of the vineyardsbut by poverty i mean the want of the vines  footnote 35 since his return the author can say the same of rhenish wines though the tavern wines of germany are usually much better than the tavern wines of france  vineyards abound all over the american continent within the proper latitudes except in the portions of it peopled by the colonists who have an english origin to this fact then it is fair to infer that we owe the general neglect of this generous plant among ourselves the swiss german and french emigrants are already thinking of the vine while we have been in possession of the country two centuries without making a cask of wine if this be not literally true it is so nearly true as to render it not less a leading fact i do not attach exactly the same moral consequences to the want of the vine as is usually attributed to the circumstances by political economists though i am of opinion that serious physical evils may be traced to this cause men will seek some stimulus or other if it be attainable place them in what situations you will although wine is forbidden by the koran the mahomedan is often intoxicated and my own eyes have shown me how much drunkenness exists in the vinegrowing countries of europe on this subject it may be well to say a word en passant  i came to europe under the impression that there was more drunkenness among us than in any other country england perhaps excepted a residence of six months in paris changed my views entirely you will judge of my surprise when first i saw a platoon of the royal guardliterally a whole platoon so far as numbers and the order of their promenade was concernedstaggering drunk within plain view of the palace of their master from this time i became more observant and not a day passed that i did not see men and even women in the same situation in the open streets usually when the fact was mentioned to americans they expressed surprise declaring they had never seen such a thing they were too much amused with other sights to regard this and then they had come abroad with different notions and it is easier to float in the current of popular opinion than to stem it in two or three instances i have taken the unbelievers with me into the streets where i have never failed to convince them of their mistake in the course of an hour these experiments too were usually made in the better quarters of the town or near our own residence where one is much less apt to meet with drunkenness than in the other quarters on one occasion a party of four of us went out with this object and we passed thirteen drunken men during a walk of an hour many of them were so far gone as to be totally unable to walk i once saw on the occasion of a festival three men literally wallowing in the gutter before my window a degree of beastly degradation i never witnessed in any other country  the usual reply of a frenchman when the subject has been introduced was that the army of occupation introduced the habit into the capital but i have spoken to you of m a man whose candour is only equalled by his information he laughed at this account of the matter saying that he had now known france nearly sixty years it is his native country and he says that he cannot see any difference in this particular in his time it is probable that during the wars of napoleon when there was so great a demand for men of the lower classes it was less usual to encounter this vice in the open streets than now for want of subjects but by all i can learn there never was a time when drunkards did not abound in france i do assure you that in the course of passing between paris and london i have been more struck by drunkenness in the streets of the former than in those of the latter  not long since i asked a labourer if he ever got grisé and he laughingly told meyes whenever he could he moreover added that a good portion of his associates did the same thing now i take it this word grisé contains the essence of the superiority of wine over whiskey it means fuddled a condition from which one recovers more readily than from downright drunkenness and of which the physical effects are not so injurious i believe the consequences of even total inebriety from wine are not as bad as those which follow inebriety from whiskey and rum but your real amateur here is no more content with wine than he is with us he drinks a white brandy that is pretty near the pure alcohol  the cholera has laid bare the secrets of drunkenness all over europe at first we were astonished when the disease got among the upper classes but with all my experience i confess i was astonished at hearing it whispered of a gentleman as i certainly did in a dozen instancesmais il avait lhabitude de boire trop cholera beyond a question killed many a sober man but it also laid bare the fault of many a devotee of the bottle  drunkenness almost as a matter of course abounds in nearly all if not in all the armies of europe it is peculiarly the soldiers and the sailors vice and some queer scenes have occurred directly under my own eyes here which go to prove it take among others the fact that a whole guard not long since got drunk in the faubourg st germain and actually arrested people in the streets and confined them in the guardhouse the invalids are notorious for staggering back to their quarters and i presume i have seen a thousand of these worthies first and last as happy as if they had all their eyes and arms and legs about them the official reports show ten thousand cases of females arrested for drunkenness in paris during the last yearbut to return to our vineyards  although i am quite certain drunkenness is not prevented by the fact that wine is within the reach of the mass it is easy to see that its use is less injurious physically than that of the stronger compounds and distillations to which the people of the nonvinegrowing regions have recourse as substitutes nature is a better brewer than man and the pure juice of the grape is less injurious than the mixed and fiery beverages that are used in america in reasonable quantities it is not injurious at all fiveandtwenty years since when i first visited europe i was astonished to see wine drunk in tumblers i did not at first understand that half of what i had up to that time been drinking was brandy under the name of wine  while our imported wines are as a whole so good we do not always show the same discrimination in choosing there is very little good champagne for instance drunk in america a vast deal is consumed and we are beginning to understand that it is properly a tablewine or one that is to be taken with the meats but sparkling champagne is ex necessitate a wine of inferior quality no wine mousses as the french term it that has body enough to pass a certain period without fermentation my friend de v is a proprietor of vines at aï and he tells me that the english take most of their good wines which are the still champagnes and the russians and the americans the poor or the sparkling a great deal of the sparkling however is consumed in france the price better suiting french economy but the winegrowers of champagne themselves speak of us as consumers of their secondclass liquors  i drunk at paris as good sparkling champagne as anybody i knew de v having the good nature to let me have it from his cellar for the price at which it is sold to the dealer and exporter or at three francs the bottle the octroi and the transportation bring the price up to about three francs and a half this then is the cost to the restaurateur and the innkeeper these sell it again to their customers at six francs the bottle now a bottle of wine ought not and i presume does not cost the american dealer any more the difference in favour of the duty more than equalling the difference against them in the transportation this wine is sold in our eatinghouses and taverns at two dollars and even at two dollars and a half the bottle in other words the consumer pays three times the amount of the first cost and charges now it happens that there is something very like free trade in this article to use the vernacular and here are its fruits you also see in this fact the truth of what i have told you of our paying for the want of a class of men who wilt be content to be shopkeepers and innkeepers and who do not look forward to becoming anything more i do not say that we are the less respectable for this circumstance but we are certainly as a people less comfortable champagne rhenish and bordeaux wines ought to be sold in new york quite as cheap as they are sold in the great towns of the countries in which they are made they can be bought of the winemerchants nearly as low even as things are  if the innkeepers and steamboat stewards of america would buy and sell lowpriced burgundy wines that as the french call it carry water well as well as some other wines that might be named the custom of drinking this innocent and useful beverage at table would become general attention would then be paid to the vine and in twenty years we should be consumers of the products of our own vineyards  the idea that our winters are too severe can hardly be just there may be mountainous districts where such is the fact but in a country that extends from the 27th to the 47th degrees of latitude it is scarcely possible to suppose the vine cannot flourish i have told you that wine is made on the elbe and it is made in more than half the swiss cantons proper exposures and proper soil are necessary for good wines anywhere but nothing is easier than to have both in america i fear we have hitherto sought land that was too rich or rather land that is wanting in the proper and peculiar richness that is congenial to the vine all the great vineyards i have seen and all of which i can obtain authentic accounts are on thin gravelly soils frequently as is the case in the rheingau on decomposed granite quartz and sienite slate mixed with quartz on a clayish bottom and with basalt is esteemed a good soil as is also marl and gravel the germans use rich manures but i do not think this is the case in france  the grape that makes good wine is rarely fit to eat much care is had to reject the defective fruit when a delicate wine is expected just as we cull apples to make fine cider a really good vineyard is a fortune at once and a tolerable one is as good a disposition as can be made of land all the fine wines of hockheim are said to be the produce of only eight or ten acres there is certainly more land than this in the vine south of the village but the rest is not esteemed to be hockheimer  time is indispensable to fine wines and time is a thing that an american lives too fast to spare the grapes become better by time although periodically renewed and the wine improves in the same way i have told you in these letters that i passed a vineyard on the lake of zurich of which there are records to show it has borne the vine five hundred years five centuries since if historians are to be believed the winters on this lake must have been as severe as they are usually on champlain they are almost as severe even now  extraordinary characters are given to some of the vines here thus some of the moselle wines it is said will not make good vinegar if this be true judging by my own experience vinegar is converted into wines of the moselle i know no story of this sort after all that is more marvellous than one i have heard of the grandfather of a and which i believe to be perfectly true as it is handed down on authority that can scarcely be called in question  a pipe of madeira was sent to him about the year 1750 which proved to be so bad that giving it up as a gone case he ordered it to be put in the sun with a bottle in its bunghole in order that it might at least make good vinegar bis official station compelled him to entertain a great deal and his factotum on these occasions was a negro whose name i have forgotten this fellow a capital servant when sober occasionally did as he saw his betters do and got drunk of course this greatly deranged the economy of the government dinners on one occasion particular care was taken to keep him in his right senses and yet at the critical moment he appeared behind his masters chair as happy as the best of them this matter was seriously inquired into next day when it was discovered that a miracle had been going on out of doors and that the vinegar had been transformed into wine the tradition is that this wine was remarkable for its excellence and that it was long known by the name of the negro as the best wine of a colony where more good wine of the sort was drunk probably than was ever known by the same number of people in the same time anywhere else now should one experimenting on a vineyard in america find vinegar come from his press he would never have patience to let it ferment itself back into good liquor patience i conceive is the only obstacle to our becoming a great winegrowing and a great silkgrowing country  i have been led into these remarks by observing the vineyards here the qualities of wines of course are affected by the positions of the vineyards for all who can make wine do not make good wine but the vines of vévey owing most probably to their exposure are said to be the best of switzerland the best liquor comes from st saphorin a hamlet that is quite near the town which lies at the foot of the acclivity described to you in our approach to this place the little chateaulooking house that so much struck our fancies on that occasion is in fact in the immediate neighbourhood of the spot all these circumstances show how much depends on minor circumstances in the cultivation of the vine and how much may be expected from the plant when care is had to respect them  the heat may be too great for the vineyard as well as the cold in italy there is a practice of causing the vines to run on trees in order to diminish the effect of the heat by means of the shade they create but the good wines are nearly everywhere if not positively everywhere produced from the short clipped standards this fact has induced me to think that we may succeed better with the vine in the middle and even in the eastern than in the southern and western states i take it the cold is of no importance provided it be not so intense as to kill the plant and the season is long enough to permit the fruit to ripen it would be absurd in me who have but a very superficial knowledge of the subject to pretend to be very skillful in this matter but i cannot help thinking that if one had patience to try the experiment it would be found the common the american foxgrape would in time bring a fine wine it greatly resembles the grapes of some of the best vineyards here and the fact of its not being a good eating grape is altogether in its favour  in short i throw it out as a conjecture more than as an ascertained fact it is true but from all i have seen in europe i am induced to think that in making our experiments on the vine we have been too ambitious to obtain a fat soil and too warp of the higher latitudes of the country a gravelly hillside in the interior that has been well stirred and which has the proper exposure i cannot but thing would bring good wine in all the low countries of the middle states     letter xix  the leman lakeexcursions on itthe coast of savoygrandeur and beauty of the rockssunsetevening sceneamerican families residing on the banks of the

fruitful of pleasure the lake with its changeful aspects and movement wears better even than the oberland alps and we have now become thoroughly convinced of our mistake in establishing ourselves at berne beautiful as is that place in 1828 the motive was a desire to be central but switzerland is so small that the distances are of no great moment and i would advise all our friends who intend to pass a summer in the cantons and who have need of a house to choose their station somewhere on the shores of the leman two steamboats ply daily in different directions and it is of little consequence at which end one may happen to be taking everything into consideration mon lac est le premier is true though it may be questioned if m de voltaire ever saw or had occasion to see half of its advantages  we never tire of the leman but spend two or three hours every day in the boat sometimes we row in front of the town which literally stands in the water in some places musing on the quaint old walls and listening to the lore of honest john who moves two crooked oars as leisurely as a lady of the tropic utters but who has seen great events in his time sometimes even this lazy action is too much for the humour of the moment and we are satisfied with drifting along the shore for there is generally current enough to carry us the whole length of vévey in half an hour occasionally we are tossed about like an eggshell the winds at a distance soon throwing this part of the sheet into commotion on the whole however we have as yet had little besides calms and what is unusual in switzerland not a drop of rain  we have no reason to suspect the lake to be unhealthy for we are often out until after sunset without experiencing any ill effects the shores are everywhere bold about vévey though the meadows and the waters meet near the entrance of the rhone some eight or ten miles from this place in a way to raise the thoughts of rushes and lilies and a suspicion of fevers the pure air and excellent food of the mountains however have done us all good thus far and we are looking eagerly forward to the season of grapes which is drawing near and which every body says make those who are perfectly well infinitely better  i have not yet spoken to you of the greatest charm in the scenery of vévey and the one which perhaps has given us the highest degree of satisfaction the coast of savoy immediately opposite the town is a range of magnificent rocks that rises some four or five thousand feet above the surface of the water in general these precipices are nearly perpendicular though their surfaces are broken by huge ravines that may well be termed valleys this is the region that impends over meillerie st gingoulph and evian towns or hamlets that cling to the bases of the mountains and form of themselves beautiful objects from this side of the lake the distance from vévey to the opposite shore agreeably to the authority of old john our boatman is about five miles though the great purity of the atmosphere and the height of the land make it appear less the summit of the rocks of savoy are broken into the most fantastical forms so beautifully and evenly drawn though they are quite irregular and without design that i have termed them natural arabesques no description can give you an accurate idea of their beauty for i know nothing else in nature to compare them to as they lie nearly south of us i cannot account for the unusual glow of the atmosphere behind them at every clear sunset except from the reflection of the glaciers mont blanc lying in that direction at the distance of about fifty miles though invisible now the effect of the outline of these rocks at or after sunset relieved by a soft golden sky is not only one of the finest sights of switzerland but in its way is just the most perfect spectacle i have ever beheld it is not so apt to extort sudden admiration as the rosy tints and spectral hues of the high alps at the same hour but it wins on you in the way the lonely shadows of the apennines grow on the affections and so far from tiring or becoming satisfied with their view each successive evening brings greater delight than the last you may get some idea of what i mean by imagining vast arabesques rounded and drawn in a way that no art can equal standing out huge and dark and grand in high relief blending sublimity with a bewitching softness against a sky whose light is slowly passing from the glow of fiery gold to the mildest tints of evening i scarcely know when this scene is most to be admired when the rocks appear distinct and brown showing their material and the sky is burnished or when the first are nearly black masses on whose surfaces nothing is visible and the void beyond is just pregnant with sufficient light to expose their exquisite forms perhaps this is the perfection of the scene for the gloom of the hour throws a noble mystery over all  these are the sights that form the grandest features in swiss scenery that of the high peaks cut off from the earth by the clouds is perhaps the most extraordinary of them all but i think this of the rocks of savoy the one that wins the most on the affections although this opinion is formed from a knowledge of the general fact that objects which astonish so greatly at first do not as a rule continue the longest to afford pleasure for i never saw the former spectacle but twice and on one of those occasions imperfectly no dilettanti were ever more punctual at the opening of the orchestra than we are at this evening exhibition which very much like a line and expressive harmony grows upon us at each repetition all this end of the lake as we float lazily before the town with the water like a mirror the acclivity behind the town gradually darkening upward under the retiring light the remote alpine pastures just throwing out their chalets the rocks of savoy and the sublime glen of the rhone with the glacier of mont velan in its depths raising its white peak into the broad day long after evening has shadowed everything below forms the most perfect natural picture i have ever seen  you can easily fancy how much we enjoy all this john and his boat have been in requisition nearly every evening since our arrival and the old fellow has dropped so readily into our humours that his oars rise and fall in a way to produce a melancholy ripple and little else the sympathy between us is perfect and i have almost fancied that his oars daily grow more crooked and picturesque  we are not alone however in the possession of so much natural beauty no less than seven american families including ourselves are either temporarily established on or quite near this lake or are leisurely moving around its banks the fame of the beauty of the women has already reached our ears though sooth to say a reputation of that sort is not very difficult of attainment in this part of the world with one of these families we were intimate in italy the tie of country being a little increased by the fact that some of their connexions were also ours they hurried from lausanne to meet us the moment they were apprized of our arrival and the old relations have been reestablished between us since this meeting excursions have been planned and it is probable that i may have something to communicate in reference to them  a day or two since i met a vévaisan on the public promenade with whom business had led to a slight acquaintance we saluted and pursued our walk together the conversation soon turned on the news from america where nullification is just now menacing disunion the swiss are the only people in europe who appear to me to feel any concern in what has been generally considered to be a crisis in our affairs i do not wish to be understood as saying that individuals of other nations do not feel the same friendly interest in our prosperity for perhaps a million such might be enumerated in the different nations of europe the extreme liberals everywhere looking to our example as so much authority in favour of their doctrines but after excluding the mass who have too much to do to live to trouble themselves with concerns so remote so far as my knowledge extends the great majority on this side the atlantic without much distinction of country switzerland excepted are waiting with confidence and impatience for the knell of the union i might repeat to you many mawkish and unmeaning declarations to the contrary of all this but i deem them to be mere phrases of society to which no one in the least acquainted with the world can attach any importance and which as they have never deceived me i cannot wish should be made the means of deceiving you men generally hesitate to avow in terms the selfishness and illiberality that regulate all their acts and wishes and he who is credulous enough to mistake words for deeds or even thoughts in this quarter of the world will soon become the dupe of more than half of those he meets i believe i never mentioned to you an anecdote of sir james mackintosh which bears directly on this subject it was at a dinner given by sir  that some one inquired if he sir james mackintosh had ever discovered the author of a certain libellous attack on himself not absolutely though i have no doubt that  was the person i suspected him at once but meeting him in pall mall soon after the article appeared he turned round and walked the whole length of the street with me covering me with protestations of admiration and esteem and then i felt quite sure of my man  my vévaisan made many inquiries as to the probable result of the present struggle and appeared greatly gratified when i told him that i apprehended no serious danger to the republic i made him laugh by mentioning the opinion of the witty abbé correa who said the americans are great talkers on political subjects you would think they were about to fly to their arms and just as you expect a revolution they go home and drink tea my acquaintance was anxious to know if our government had sufficient strength to put down nullification by force for he had learned there was but a single sloop of war and less than a battalion of troops in the disaffected part of the country i told him we possessed all the means that are possessed in other countries to suppress rebellion although we had not thought it necessary to resort to the same system of organization our government was mild in principle and did not wish to oppress even minorities but i made no doubt of the attachment of a vast majority to the union and when matters really came to a crisis if rational compromise could not effect the object i thought nine men in ten would rally in its defence i did not believe that even civil war was to produce results in america different from what it produced elsewhere men would fight in a republic as they fought in monarchies until they were tired and an arrangement would follow it was not common for a people of the same origin of similar habits and contiguous territory to dismember an empire by civil war unless violence had been used in bringing them together or conquest had first opened the way to disunion i did not know that we were always to escape the evils of humanity any more than others or why they were to fall heavier on us when they proceeded from the same causes than on our neighbours as respects the small force in carolina i thought it argued our comparative strength rather than our comparative weakness here were loud threats of resistance organized and even legal means to effect it and yet the laws were respected when sustained by only a sloop of war and two companies of artillery if france were to recall her battalions from la vendée austria her divisions from italy russia her armies from poland or england her troops from india or ireland we all know that those several countries would be lost in six months to their present possessors as we had our force in reserve it really appeared to me that either our disaffection was very different from the disaffection of europe or that our institutions contained some conservative principle that did not usually exist in this hemisphere my vévaisan was curious to know to which of these circumstances i ascribed the present quiet in carolina i told him to both the opposition in that state as a whole were honest in their views and though some probably meant disunion the greater part did not it was a governing principle of our system to seek redress by appeals to the source of power and the majority were probable looking still to that quarter of relief under other systems rebellion nine times in ten having a different object would not be checked by this expectation  the swiss listened to all this attentively and remarked that america had been much misrepresented in europe and that the opinion was then getting to be general in his country from improper motives he told me that a great deal had been said about the proceedings in the case of rowland stephenson and he frankly asked me to explain them for being a commercial man he admitted that injurious impressions had been made even on himself in relation to that affair this was the third swiss who had alluded to this subject the other two instances occurring at rome in the latter cases i understood pretty distinctly that there were reports current that the americans were so desirous of obtaining rich emigrants that they had rescued a criminal in order to reap the benefit of his gold  of course i explained the matter by simply stating the facts adding that the case was an admirable illustration of the treatment america had received from europe ever since 1776 an englishman a member of parliament by the way had absconded from his own country taking shelter in ours by the mere accident of meeting at sea a swedish brig bound thither a reward was offered for his arrest and certain individuals had taken on themselves instigated by whom i know not to arrest him on a retired road in georgia and to bring him covertly within the jurisdiction of new york with the intention to send him clandestinely on board a packet bound to europe now a grosser abuse than an act like this could not well be committed no form of law was observed and the whole proceeding was a violation of justice and of the sovereignty of the two states interested it is true the man arrested was said to be guilty of gross fraud but where such practices obtain guilt will soon cease to be necessary in order to commit violence the innocent may be arrested wrongfully too as soon as the circumstances became known an application was made to the proper authorities for relief which was granted on a principle that obtained in all civilized countries where right is stronger than might had any one been transferred from canada to england under similar circumstances he would have been entitled to the same relief and there is not a jurist in england who does not know the fact and yet this transaction which if it redound to the discredit of either nation at all an exaggerated opinion i admit must redound to the discredit of that which produced the delinquent and actually preferred him to one of its highest legislative stations has been so tortured all over europe as to leave an impression unfavourable to america  now i tell you dear  as i told my vévaisan that this case is a very fair example of the manner in which for seven years i have now been an attentive observer of the unworthy arts used to bring us into disrepute the power to injure in order to serve their own selfish views which oldestablished and great nations possess over one like our own is not fully appreciated in america nor do we attach sufficient importance to the consequences i am not conscious of a disposition to shut my eyes to our own peculiar national defects more especially since the means of comparison have rendered me more sensible of their nature and existence but nothing can be more apparent to any man of ordinary capacity who has enjoyed the opportunities necessary to form a correct judgment than the fact that the defects usually imputed to us here such as the want of morals honesty order decency liberality and religion are in truth as the world goes the strong points of american character while some of those on which we are a little too apt to pride ourselvesintelligence taste manners and education for instance as applied to all beyond the base of societyare in truth those on which it would most become us to be silent others may tell you differently especially those who are under the influence of the trading humanities a class that is singularly addicted to philanthropy or vituperation as the balancesheet happens to show variations of profit and loss  i told my swiss that one of the reasons why europe made so many blunders in her predictions about america was owing to the fact that she sought her information in sources ill qualified and perhaps ill disposed to impart it most of the information of this nature that either entered or left america came like her goods through two or three great channels or seaports and these were thronged with the natives of half the countries of europe commercial adventurers of whom not one in five ever got to feel or think like americans these men in some places possess even a direct influence over a portion of the press and by these means as well as by their extended correspondence they disseminate erroneous notions of the country abroad the cities themselves as a rule or rather the prominent actors in the towns do not represent the tone of the nation as is proved on nearly every distinctive political question that arises by the towns almost uniformly being found in the minority simply because they are purely trading communities follow the instinct of their varying interests and are ready to shout in the rear of any leader who may espouse them now these foreign merchants as a class are always found on the side which is the most estranged from the regular action of the institutions of the country in america intelligence is not confined to the towns but as a rule there is less of it there than among the rural population as a proof of the errors which obtain on the subject of america in europe i instanced the opinion which betrayed itself in england the nation which ought to know us best during the war of 1812 feeling a commercial jealousy itself its government naturally supposed her enemies were among the merchants and that her friends were to be found in the interior the fact would have exactly reversed this opinion an opinion whose existence is betrayed in a hundred ways and especially in the publications of the day it was under this notion that our invaders made an appeal to the kentuckians for support now there was not probably a portion of the earth where less sympathy was to be found for england than in kentucky or in short along the whole western frontier of america where right or wrong the people attribute most of their indian wars to the instigation of that power few foreigners took sufficient interest in the country to probe such a feeling and england being left to her crude conjectures and to theories of her own had probably been thus led into one of the most absurd of all the blunders of this nature that she could possibly have committed i believe that a large proportion of the erroneous notions which exist in europe concerning american facts proceed from the prejudices of this class of the inhabitants36  footnote 36 this was the opinion of the writer while in europe since his return he has seen much reason to confirm it last year in a free conversation with a foreign diplomatic agent on the state of public feeling in regard to certain political measures the diplomate affirmed that according to his experience the talent property and respectability of the country were all against the government this is the wornout cant of england and yet when reform has been brought to the touchstone its greatest opponents have been found among the parvenus on being requested to mention individuals the diplomatic man in question named three new york merchants all of whom are foreigners by birth neither of whom can speak good english neither of whom could influence a voteneither of whom had probably ever read the constitution or could understand it if he had read it and neither of whom was in principle any more than an everyday commonplace reflection of the antiquated notions of the class to which he belonged in other nations and in which he had been educated and under the influence of which he had arrived here   in order to appreciate the influence of such a class of men it is necessary to recollect their numbers wealth and union it has often been a source of mortification to me to see the columns of the leading journals of the largest town of the republic teeming with reports of the celebrations of english irish german french and scotch societies and in which the sentiments promulgated half of the time are foreign rather than american charitable associations as charities may be well enough but the institutions of the country so generous and liberal in themselves are outraged by every factitious attempt to overshadow them by these appeals to the prejudices and recollections of another state of society at least we might be spared the parade in the journals and the offensive appearance of monopolizing the land which these accounts assume intelligent travellers observe and comment on these things and one of them quaintly asked me not long since if really there were no americans in america can it be matter of surprise that when the stranger sees these men so prominent in print and in society in many instances quite deservedly he should mistake their influence and attach an importance to their opinions which they do not deserve that europe has been receiving false notions of america from some source during the present century is proved by the results so completely discrediting her open predictions and while i know that many americans have innocently aided in the deception i have little doubt that the foreign merchants established in the country have been one of the principal causes of the errors  it is only necessary to look back within our own time to note the progress of opinion and to appreciate the value of those notions that some still cherish as containing all that is sound and true in human policy thirty years ago the opinion that it was unsafe to teach the inferior classes to read as it only enabled then to read bad books was a common and favourite sentiment of the upper classes in england today it is a part of the established system of austria to instruct her people i confess that i now feel mortified and grieved when i meet with an american gentleman who professes anything but liberal opinions as respects the rights of his fellowcreatures although never illiberal i trust i do not pretend that my own notions have not undergone changes since by being removed from the pressure of the society in which i was born my position perhaps enables me to look around less influenced by personal considerations than is usual but one of the strongest feelings created by an absence of so many years from he me is the conviction that no american can justly lay claim to be what might be and ought to be the most exalted of human beings the milder graces of the christian character excepted an american gentleman without this liberality entering thoroughly into the whole composition of his mind by liberal sentiments however i do not mean any of the fraudulent cant that is used in order to delude the credulous but the generous manly determination to let all enjoy equal political rights and to bring those to whom authority is necessarily confided as far as practicable under the control of the community they serve opinions like these have little in common with the miserable devices of demagogues who teach the doctrine that the people are infallible or that the aggregation of fallible parts acting too with diminished responsibilities form an infallible whole which is a doctrine almost as absurd as that which teaches us to believe the people are their own worst enemies a doctrine which if true ought to induce those who profess it to forbid any man from managing his own affairs but compel him to confide them to the management of others since the elementary principle is the same in communities and individuals and as regards interests neither would go wrong unless deceived  i shall not conceal from you the mortification and regret i have felt at discovering from this distance and it is more easily discovered from a distance than when near by how far how very far the educated classes of america are in opinion in my poor judgment at least behind the fortunes of the country notions are certainly still entertained at home among this class that are frankly abandoned here by men of any capacity let their political sect be what it may and i have frequently seen assertions and arguments used in congress that i think the dullest tory would now hesitate about using in parliament i do not say that certain great prejudices are not yet prevalent in england that are exploded with us but my remark applies to some of the old and cherished theories of government which have been kept alive as theories in england long after they have ceased to be recognised in practice and some of which indeed like that of the doctrine of a balance between different powers in the state never had any other than a theoretical existence at all the absurd doctrine just mentioned has many devout believers at this moment in america when a moments examination must show its fallacy the democracy of a country in the nature of things will possess its physical force now give to the physical force of a community an equal political power and the moment it finds itself gravely interested in supporting or defeating any measure it will fall back on its strength set the other estates at defiance and blow your boasted balance of power to the winds there never has been an active democratical feature in the government of england nor have the commons since they have enjoyed anything like independence been aught but an auxiliary to the aristocracy in a modified form while the king was strong the two bodies united to put him down and as he got to be weak they gradually became identified to reap the advantages what is to come remains to be seen     letter xx  the equinoxstorm on the lakechase of a little boatchateau of blonaydrive to lausannemont

has been in a foam but its miniature anger though terrible enough at times to those who are embarked on its waters can never rise to the dignity of a surf and a rolling sea the rain kept me housed and old john and i seized the occasion to convert a block of pine into a leman bark for p the next day proving fair our vessel fitted with two latine sails and carrying a weather helm was committed to the waves and away she went on a wind toward the opposite shore p of course was delighted and clapped his hands until perceiving that it was getting off the land he compelled us to enter the boat and give chase a chase it was truly for the little thing went skipping from wave to wave in such a businesslike manner that i once thought it would go all the way to savoy luckily a flaw caused it to tack when it soon became our prize we were a long distance off when the boat was overtaken and i thought the views behind the town finer at that position than when nearer in i was particularly struck with the appearance of the little chateau of blonay which is still the residence of a family of the same name that has been seated for more than seven centuries on the same rocky terrace i was delighted to hear that its present owner is a liberal as every ancient gentleman should be such a man ought to be cautious how he tarnishes his lineage with unjust or ungenerous sentiments  the equinoctial blow returned the next day and the lake became really fine in a new point of view for aided by the mountains it succeeded in getting up a very respectable appearance of fury the sailboats vanished and even the steamers went through it with a good deal of struggling and reluctance  as soon as the weather became better we went to lausanne preferring the road with a view to see the country it is not easy to fancy anything prettier than this drive which ran nearly the whole distance along the foot of hills that would be mountains anywhere else and quite near the water the day was beautiful and we had the lake with its varying scenery and movement the whole time in sight while the road an excellent solid wheeltrack wound between the walls of vineyards and was so narrow as scarcely to admit the passage of two carriages at a time at a short distance from lausanne we left the margin of the lake and ascended to the level of the town through a wooded and beautifully ornamented country  we found our friends established in one of the numberless villas that dot the broken land around the place with their windows commanding most of that glorious view that i have already described to you mont benon a beautiful promenade was close at hand and in the near view the eye ranged over fields verdant and smooth lawns irregular in their surfaces and broken by woods and countryhouses a long attenuated reach of the lake stretched away towards geneva while the upper end terminated in its noble mountains and the mysterious glenlike gorge of valais we returned from this excursion in the evening delighted with the exterior of lausanne and more and more convinced that all things considered the shores of this lake unite greater beauties with better advantages as a residence than any other part of switzerland  after remaining at vévey a day or two longer i went to geneva in the winkelried which had got a new commander one as unaffected as his predecessor had been fantastical our progress was slow and although we reached the port early enough to prevent being locked out with the exception of a passage across lake george in which the motion seemed expressly intended for the lovers of the picturesque i think this the most deliberate run or rather walk i ever made by steam  i found geneva much changed for the better in the last four years most of the hideous sheds had been pulled down from the fronts of the houses and a stone pier is building that puts the mighty port of new york with her commercial energies to shame in other respects i saw no material alterations in the place the town was crowded more of the travellers being french and fewer english than common as for the russians they appear to have vanished from the earth to my regret for in addition to being among the most polished people one meets i speak of those who travel your russian uniformly treats the american kindly i have met with more personal civilities conveyed in a delicate manner from these people and especially from the diplomatic agents of russia than from any others in europe and on the whole i have cause personally to complain of none or in other words i do not think that personal feeling warps my judgment in this matter m pozzo di borgo when he gave large entertainments sent a number of tickets to mr brown to be distributed among his countrymen and i have heard this gentleman say no other foreign minister paid him this attention all this may be the result of policy but it is something to obtain civil treatment in this world on any terms you must be here to understand how completely we are overlooked  late as we were we were in time for dinner which i took at a table dhôte that was well crowded with french i passed as an englishman as a matter of course and had reason to be much amused with some of the conversation one young frenchman very coolly affirmed that two members had lately fought with pistols in the hall of congress during the session and his intelligence was received with many very proper exclamations of horror the young man referred to the rencontre which took place on the terrace of the capitol in which the party assailed was a member of congress but i have no doubt he believed all he said for such is the desire to blacken the american name just now that every unfavourable incident is seized upon and exaggerated without shame or remorse i had a strong desire to tell this young man that the affair to which he alluded did not differ essentially from that of m calémard de lafayette37 with the exception that no one was slain at washington but i thought it wiser to preserve my incognito  footnote 37 this unfortunate gentleman was no relation of the family of lafayette his proper appellation being that of m calémard fayette so far as i can discover is an old french word or perhaps a provincial word that signifies a sort of hedge and has been frequently used as a territorial appellation like de la haie  the next day our french party was replaced by another and the master of the house promoted me to the upper end of his table as an old boarder here i found myself once more in company with an englishman an irishman and a scotchman the two former sat opposite to me and the last at my side the civilities of the table passed between us especially between the scotchman and myself with whom i fell into discourse after a little while my neighbour a sensible shrewd fellow enough by the way of illustrating his opinion and to get the better of me cited some english practice in connexion with you in england i told him i was no englishman no englishman you are not a scotchman certainly not still less an irishman no my companion now looked at me as hard as a wellbred man might and said earnestly where did you learn to speak english so well at home as you didi am an american umph and a silence of a minute followed by abruptly putting the question ofwhat is the reason that your duels in america are so bloodyi allude particularly to some fought in the mediterranean by your naval officers we get along with less vindicative fighting as this was rather a sharp and sudden shot i thought it best to fire back and i told him that as to the mediterranean our officers were of opinion they were illtreated till they began to shoot those who inflicted the injuries since which time all had gone on more smoothly according to their experience their own mode of fighting was much the most efficacious in that instance at least  as he bore this goodnaturedly thinking perhaps his abrupt question merited a saucy answer we soon became good friends he made a remark or two in better taste than the last on the facts of america and i assured him he was in error showing him wherein his error lay he then asked me why some of our own people did not correct the false impressions of europe on the subject of america for the european could only judge by the information laid before him he then mentioned two or three american writers who he thought would do the world a service by giving it a book or two on the subject i told him that if they wrote honestly and frankly europe would not read their books for prejudice was not easily overcome and no favourable account of us would be acceptable it would not be enough for us to confess our real faults but we should be required to confess the precise faults that according to the notions of this quarter of the world we are morally logically and politically bound to possess this he would not admit for what man is ever willing to confess that his own opinions are prejudiced  i mention this little incident because its spirit in my deliberate judgment forms the rule in the case of the feeling of all british subjects and i am sorry to say the subjects of most other european countries and the mawkish sentiment and honeyed words that sometimes appear in toasts tavern dinners and public speeches the exception i may be wrong as well as another but this i repeat for the twentieth time is the result of my own observations you know under what opportunities these observations have been made and how far they are likely to be influenced by personal considerations  in the evening i accompanied a gentleman whose acquaintance i had made at rome to the countryhouse of a family that i had also had the pleasure of meeting during their winters residence in that town we passed out by the gate of savoy and walked a mile or two among countryhouses and pleasant alleys of trees to a dwelling not unlike one of our own on the island of manhattan though furnished with more taste and comfort than it is usual to meet in america m and mad n were engaged to pass the evening at the house of a connexion near by and they frankly proposed that we should be of the party of course we assented leaving them to be the judges of what was proper  at this second dwelling a stones throw from the other we found a small party of sensible and wellbred people who received me as a stranger with marked politeness but with great simplicity i was struck with the repast which was exactly like what a country tea is or perhaps i ought to say used to be in respectable families at home who have not or had not much of the habits of the world we all sat round a large table and among other good things that were served was an excellent fruit tart i could almost fancy myself in new england where i remember a judge of a supreme court once gave me custards at a similar entertainment the family we had gone to see were perhaps a little too elegant for such a setout for i had seen them in rome with milordi and monsignori at their six oclock dinners but the quiet good sense with which everybody dropped into their own distinctive habits at home caused me to make a comparison between them and ourselves much to the disadvantage of the latter i do not mean that usages ought not to change but that usages should be consistent with themselves and based on their general fitness and convenience for the society for which they are intended this is good sense which is commonly not only goodbreeding but highbreeding  the genevois are french in their language in their literature and consequently in many of their notions still they have independence enough to have hours habits and rules of intercourse that they find suited to their own particular condition the fashions of paris beyond the point of reason would scarcely influence them and the answer would probably be were a discrepancy between the customs pointed out that the usage may suit paris but it does not suit geneva how is it with us our women read in novels and magazines that are usually written by those who have no access to the society they write about and which they oftener caricature than describe that people of quality in england go late to parties and they go late to parties too to be like english people of quality let me make a short comparison by way of illustration the english woman of quality in town rises at an hour between nine and twelve she is dressed by her maid and if there are children they are brought to her by a childs maid nourishing them herself is almost out of the question her breakfast is eaten between eleven and one at three or four she may lunch at four she drives out at halfpast seven she dines at ten she begins to think of the evenings amusement and is ready for it whatever it may be unless it should happen to be the opera or the theatre the latter being almost proscribed as vulgar when she necessarily forces herself to hours a little earlier she returns home between one and four is undressed by her maid and sleeps until ten or even one according to circumstances these are late hours certainly and in some respects unwise but they have their peculiar advantages and at all events they are consistent with themselves  in new york the house is open for morning visits at twelve and with a large straggling town bad attendance at the door and a total want of convenience in public vehicles unless one travels in a stagecoach yclept an omnibus it is closed at three for dinner sending a card would be little short of social treason we are too countrybred for such an impertinence after dinner there is an interval of three hours when tea is served and the mistress of the house is at a loss for employment until ten when she goes into the world in order to visit at the hour she has heard or read that fashion prescribes such visits ought to be made in other countries england in particular here she remains until one or two returns home undresses herself passes a sleepless morning perhaps on account of a cross child and rises at seven to make her husbands coffee at eight  there is no exaggeration in this for such is the dependence and imitation of a country that has not sufficient tone to think and act for itself in still graver matters that the case might even be made stronger with great truththe men are no wiser when invited they dine at six and at home as a rule they dine between three and four a man who is much in society dines out at least half his time and consequently he is eating one day at four and the next at six all winter  the object of this digression is to tell you that so far as my observation goes we are the only people who do not think and act for ourselves in these matters french millinery may pass current throughout christendom for mere modes of dress are habits scarce worth resisting but in germany belgium italy switzerland or wherever we have resided i have uniformly found that in all essentials the people have hours and usages of their own founded on their own governing peculiarities of condition in america there is a constant struggle between the force of things and imitation and the former often proving the strongest it frequently renders the latter lame and of course ungraceful in consequence of this fact social intercourse with us is attended with greater personal sacrifices and returns less satisfaction than in most other countries there are other causes beyond a doubt to assist in producing such a result more especially in a town like new york that doubles its population in less than twenty years but the want of independence and the weakness of not adapting our usages to our peculiar condition ought to be ranked among the first in some cases necessity compels us to be americans but whenever there is a tolerable chance we endeavour to become second chop english  in a fit of gallantry i entered a jewellers shop next day and bought a dozen or fifteen rings with a view to distribute them on my return among my young country women at vévey of whom there were now not less than eight or ten three families having met at that place it may serve to make the ladies of your family smile when i add that though i was aware of the difference between a european and an american foot and hand38 every one of my rings but three had to be cut in order to be worn it will show you how little one part of mankind know the other if i add that i have often met with allusions in this quarter of the world to the females of america in which the writers have evidently supposed them to be coarse and masculine the country is deemed vulgar and by a very obvious association it has been assumed that the women of such a country must have the same physical peculiarities as the coarse and vulgar here how false this notion is let the rings of geneva testify for when i presented my offerings i was almost laughed out of countenance  footnote 38 the southern parts of europe form an exception  a wind called the bise had been blowing for the last twentyfour hours and when we left vévey the gale was so strong that the steamboat had great difficulty in getting ahead this is a north wind and it forces the water at times into the narrow pass at the head of the lake in a way to cause a rise of some two or three feet we had taken a large empty bark in tow but by the time we reached nyon where the lake widens suddenly the boat pitched and struggled so hard as to render it advisable to cast off the tow after which we did much better the poor fellow as he fell off broadside to the sea which made a fair breach over him and set a shred of sail reminded me of a man who had been fancying himself in luck by tugging at the heels of a prosperous friend but who is unexpectedly cut adrift when he is found troublesome i did not understand his philosophy for instead of hauling in for the nearest anchorage he kept away before it and ran down for geneva as straight as a bee that is humming towards its hive  the lake gradually grew more tranquil as we proceeded north and from lausanne to vévey we actually had smooth water i saw vessels becalmed or with baffling winds under this shore while the bise was blowing stiff a few leagues farther down the lake when i got home i was surprised to hear that the family had been boating the previous evening and that there had scarcely been any wind during the day this difference was owing to the sheltered position of vévey of which the fact may serve to give you a better notion than a more laboured description  the following morning was marketday and i walked upon the promenade early to witness the arrival of the boats there was not a breath of wind even to leeward for the bise had blown itself out of breath the bay of naples in a calm scarcely presents a more picturesque view than the head of the lake did on this occasion i counted more than fifty boats in sight all steering towards vévey stealing along the water some crossing from savoy in converging lines some coming down and others up the sheet from different points on the swiss side the great square was soon crowded and i walked among the peasants to observe their costumes and listen to their language neither however was remarkable all speaking french and at need all i believe using a patois which does not vary essentially from that of vaud there was a good deal of fruit some of which was pretty good though it did not appear in the abundance we had been taught to expect the grapes were coming in and they promised to be fine though it is still early for them we have them served at breakfast regularly for they are said to be particularly healthful when eaten with the morning dew on them we try to believe ourselves the better for a regimen that is too agreeable to be lightly dropped among other things in the market i observed the inner husks of indian corn that had been dried in a kiln or oven rubbed and which were now offered for sale as the stuffing of beds it struck me that this was a great improvement on straw  i had received a visit the day before from a principal inhabitant of vévey with an invitation to breakfast at his countryhouse on the heights this gratuitous civility was not to be declined though it was our desire to be quiet as we considered the residence at vévey a sort of villagiatura after paris accordingly i got into a char and climbed the mountain for a mile and a half through beautiful pastures and orchards by narrow winding lanes that towards the end got to be of a very primitive character without this little excursion i should have formed no just idea of the variety in the environs of the place and should have lost a good deal of their beauty i have told you that this acclivity rises behind the town for a distance exceeding a mile but i am now persuaded it would have been nearer the truth had i said a league the majesty of swiss nature constantly deceives the eye and it requires great care and much experience to prevent falling into these mistakes the house i sought stood on a little natural terrace a speck on the broad breast of the mountain or what would be called a mountain were it not for the granite piles in its neighbourhood and was beautifully surrounded by woods pastures and orchards we were above the vine  a small party chiefly females of good manners and great good sense were assembled and our entertainment was very much what it ought to be simple good and without fuss after i had been formally presented to the rest of the company a young man approached and was introduced as a countryman it was a lieutenant of the navy who had found his way up from the mediterranean squadron to this spot it is so unusual to meet americans under such circumstances that his presence was an agreeable surprise our people abound in the taverns and public conveyances but it is quite rare that they are met in european society at all  one of the guests today recounted an anecdote of cambacérès which was in keeping with a good banquet he and the archchancelier were returning from a breakfast in the country together when he made a remark on the unusual silence of his companion the answer was je digère  we walked through the grounds which were prettily disposed and had several good lookouts from one of the latter we got a commanding view of all the adjacent district this acclivity is neither a côte as the french call them nor a hillside nor yet a mountain but a region its breadth is sufficiently great to contain hamlets as you already know and seen from this point the town of vévey came into the view as a mere particle the head of the lake lay deep in the distance and it was only when the eye rose to the pinnacles of rock hoary with glaciers above that one could at all conceive he was not already perched on a magnificent alp the different guests pointed out their several residences which were visible at the distance of miles perhaps all seated on the same verdant acclivity  i descended on foot the road being too precipitous in places to render even a char pleasant on rejoining the domestic circle we took boat and pulled towards the little chateaulooking dwelling on a narrow verdant peninsula which as you may remember had first caught my eye on approaching vévey as the very spot that a hunter of the picturesque would like for a temporary residence the distance was about a mile and the condition of the house excepted a nearer view confirmed all our first impressions it had been a small chateau and was called glayrole it stands near the hamlet of st saphorin which both françois and jean maintain produces the best wines of vaud and though now reduced to the condition of a dilapidated farmhouse has still some remains of its ancient state there is a ceiling in the ritter saal that can almost vie with that of the castle of habsburg though it is less smoked the road more resembling the wheeltrack of a lawn than a highway runs quite near the house on one side while the blue and limpid lake washes the foot of the little promontory     letter xxi  embark in the winkelrieddiscussion with an

listless enjoyments my friend c came over from lausanne and we embarked in the winkelried on the afternoon of the 25th september as she hoveto off our mole on her way up the lake we anchored off villeneuve in less than an hour there being neither port nor wharf nor mole at that place in a few minutes we were in a threehorse conveyance called a diligence and were trotting across the broad meadows of the rhone towards bex where we found one of our american families the ts on their way to italy  c and myself ate some excellent quails for supper in the public room an englishman was taking the same repast at another table near us and he inquired for news wishing particularly to know the state of things about antwerp this led to a little conversation when i observed that had the interests of france been consulted at the revolution of 1830 belgium would have been received into the kingdom our englishman grunted at this and asked me what europe would have said to it my answer was that when both parties were agreed i did not see what europe had to do with the matter and that at all events the right europe could have to interfere was founded in might and such was the state of southwestern germany italy savoy spain and even england that i was of opinion europe would have been glad enough to take things quietly at all events a war would only have made the matter worse for the allied monarchs the other stared at me in amazement muttered an audible dissent and i make no doubt set me down as a most disloyal subject for while extending her empire and spreading her commercial system her free trade à langlaise over every nook and corner of the earth where she can get footing nothing sounds more treasonable to the ears of a loyal englishman than to give the french possession of antwerp or the russians possession of constantinople so inveterate become his national feelings on such subjects that i am persuaded a portion of his antipathy to the americans arises from a disgust at hearing notions that have been as it were bred in and in through his own moral system contemned in a language that he deems his own peculiar property men in such circumstances are rarely very philosophical or very just  we were off in a char with the dawn of course you will understand that we entered the valais by its famous bridge and passed st maurice and the waterfall à la teniers for you have already travelled along this road with me i saw no reason to change my opinion of the valais which looked as chill and repulsive now as it did in 1828 though we were so early on the road as to escape the horrible sight of the basking crétins most of whom were still housed nor can i tell you how far these people have been elevated in the scale of men by an increasing desire for riches  at martigny we breakfasted while the innkeeper sent for a guide the canton has put these men under a rigid police the prices being regulated by law and the certificate of the traveller becoming important to them this your advocate of the absurdity called free trade will look upon as tyranny it being more for the interest of human intercourse than the traveller who arrives in a strange country should be cheated by a hackneycoachman or the driver of a cart or stand higgling an hour in the streets than to violate an abstraction that can do no one any good if travelling will not take the minor points of free tradeism out of a man i hold him to be incorrigible but such is humanity there cannot be even a general truth that our infirmities do not lead us to push it into falsehood in particular practice men are no more fitted to live under a system that should carry out the extreme doctrines of this theory than they are fitted to live without law and the legislator who should attempt the thing in practice would soon find himself in the condition of don quixote after he had liberated the galleyslaves from their fettersin other words he would be cheated the first moment circumstances compelled him to make a hard bargain with a stranger were the canton of valais to say you shall be a guide and such shall be your pay the imputation of tyranny might lie by saying you may be a guide and such must be your pay it merely legislates for an interest that calls for particular protection in a particular way to prevent abuses  our guide appeared with two mules harnessed to a char à banc and we proceeded the fragment of a village which the traveller passes for martigny on his way to italy is not the true hamlet of that name but a small collection of houses that has sprung up since the construction of the simplon road the real place is a mile distant and of a much more rural and swiss character driving through this hamlet we took our way along the winding bank of a torrent called the drance the direction at first being south the road was not bad but the valley had dwindled to a gorge and though broken and wild was not sufficiently so to be grand after travelling a few miles we reached a point where our own route diverged from the course of the drance which came in from the east while we journeyed south this drance is the stream that produced the terrible inundation a few years since the calamity was produced by an accumulation of ice higher in the gorges which formed a temporary lake the canton made noble efforts to avert the evil and men were employed as miners to cut a passage for the water through the ice but their labour proved useless although they had made a channel and the danger was greatly lessened before half the water had escaped however the ice gave way and let the remainder of the lake down in a flood the descent was terrific sweeping before it every thing that came in its way and although so distant and there was so much space the village of martigny was deluged and several of its people lost their lives the water rose to the height of several feet on the plain of the great valley before it could disgorge itself into the rhone  the ascents now became more severe though we occasionally made as sharp descents the road lay through a broken valley the mountains retiring from each other a little and the wheeltrack was very much like those we saw in our own hilly country some thirty years since though less obstructed by mud at one oclock we reached liddes a crowded rude and dirty hamlet where we made a frugal repast here we were compelled to quit the char and to saddle the mules the guide also engaged another man to accompany us with a horse that carried provender for himself and for the two animals we had brought with us we then mounted and proceeded  on quitting liddes the road or rather path for it had dwindled to that led through a valley that had some low meadows after which the ascents became more decided though the course had always been upward the vegetation gradually grew less and less the tree diminishing to the bush and finally disappearing altogether while the grasses became coarse and wiry or were entirely superseded by moss we went through a hamlet or two composed of stones stained apparently with iron ore and as the huts were covered with the same material instead of lending the landscape a more humanized air they rather added to its appearance of sterile dreariness there were a few tolerably good bits of savage mountain scenes especially in a wooded glen or two by the wayside but on the whole i thought this the least striking of the swiss mountains i had ascended  we entered a sort of mountain basin that was bounded on one side by the glacier of mont vélan that which so beautifully bounds the view up the valais as seen from vévey i was disappointed in finding an object which in the distance was so white and shining much disfigured and tarnished by fragments of broken rock still the summit shone in cold and spotless lustre there was herbage for a few goats here and some one had commenced the walls of a rude building that was intended for an inn no one was at work near it a hut of stone for the shelter of the goatherds being all that looked like a finished human habitation  winding our way across and out of this valley we came to a turn in the rocks and beheld two more stone cabins low and covered so as to resemble what in america are called roothouses they stood a little from the path on the naked rock crossing to them we dismounted and looked into the first it was empty had a little straw and was intended for a refuge in the event of storms thrusting my head into the other after the eye had got a little accustomed to the light i saw a grinning corpse seated against the remotest side the body looked like a mummy but the clothes were still on it and various shreds of garments lay about the place the remains of other bodies that had gradually shrunk into shapeless masses were also dimly visible human bones too were scattered around it is scarcely necessary to add that this was one of the deadhouses or places in which the bodies of those who perish on the mountain are deposited to waste away or to be claimed as others may or may not feel an interest in their remains interment could only be effected by penetrating the rock for there was no longer any soil and such is the purity of the atmosphere that putrescence never occurs  i asked the guide if he knew anything of the man whose body still retained some of the semblance of humanity he told me he remembered him well having been at the convent in his company it was a poor mason who had crossed the col from piémont in quest of work failing of which he had left liddes near nightfall in order to enjoy the unremitting hospitality of the monks on his return about a fortnight later his body was found on the bare rock quite near the refuge on the following day the poor fellow had probably perished in the dark within a few yards of shelter without knowing it hunger and cold aided perhaps by that refuge of the miserable brandy had destroyed him he had been dead now two years and yet his remains preserved a hideous resemblance to the living man  turning away from this melancholy spectacle i looked about me with renewed interest the sun had set and evening was casting its shadows over the valley below which might still be seen through the gorges of our path the air above and the brown peaks that rose around us like gloomy giants were still visible in a mellow saddened light and i thought i had never witnessed a more poetical or a more vivid picture of the approach of night following the direction of the upward path a track that was visible only by the broken fragments of rock and which now ascended suddenly an opening was seen between two dark granite piles through which the sky beyond still shone lustrous and pearly this opening appeared to be but a span it was the col or the summit of the path and gazing at it in that pure atmosphere i supposed it might be half a mile beyond and above us the guide shook his head at this conjecture and told me it was still a weary league  at this intelligence we hurried to bestride our mules which by this time were fagged and as melancholy as the mountains when we left the refuge there were no traces of the sun on any of the peaks or glaciers a more sombre ascent cannot be imagined vegetation had absolutely disappeared and in its place lay scattered the fragments of the ferruginous looking rocks the hue of every object was gloomy as desolation could make it and the increasing obscurity served to deepen the intense interest we felt although constantly and industriously ascending towards the light it receded faster than we could climb after half an hour of toil it finally deserted us to the night at this moment the guide pointed to a mass that i had thought a fragment of the living rock and said it was the roof a building it still appeared so near that i fancied we had arrived but minute after minute went by and this too was gradually swallowed up in the gloom at the end of another quarter of an hour we came to a place where the path always steep since quitting the refuge actually began to ascend by a flight of broad steps formed in the living rock like that already mentioned on the righi though less precipitous my weary mule seemed at times to be tottering beneath my weight or hanging in suspense undecided whether or not to yield to the downward pressure it was quite dark and i thought it best to trust to his instinct and his recollections this unpleasant struggle between animal force and the attraction of gravitation in which the part i played was merely to contribute to the latter lasted nearly a quarter of an hour longer when the mules appeared to be suddenly relieved they moved more briskly for a minute and then stopped before a pile of rock that a second look in the dark enabled us to see was made of stone thrown into the form of a large rude edifice this was the celebrated convent of the great st bernard  i bethought me of the romans of the marauders of the middle ages of the charity of a thousand years and of napoleon as throwing a leg over the crupper my foot first touched the rock our approach had been heard for noises ascend far through such a medium and we were met at the door by a monk in a black gown a queer asiaticlooking cap and a movement that was as laical as that of a garçon de café he hastily enquired if there were any ladies and i thought he appeared disappointed when we told him no he showed us very civilly however into a room that was warmed by a stove and which already contained two travellers who had the air of decent tradesmen who were crossing the mountain on business a table was set for supper and a lamp or two threw a dim light around  the little community soon assembled the prior excepted and the supper was served i had brought a letter for the clavier a sort of caterer who is accustomed to wander through the vallies in quest of contributions and this appeared to be a good time for presenting it as our reception had an awkward coldness that was unpleasant the letter was read but it made no apparent difference in the warmth of our treatment then or afterwards i presume the writer had unwittingly thrown the chill which the american name almost invariably carries with it over our reception  by this time seven of the augustines were in the room four of whom were canons and three novices the entire community is composed of about thirty who are professed with a suitable number who are in their noviciate but only eight in all are habitually kept on the mountain the rest residing in a convent in the bourg as the real village of martigny is called it is said that the keen air of the col affects the lungs after a time and that few can resist its influence for a long continued period you will remember that this building is the most elevated permanent abode in europe if not in the old world standing at a height of about 8000 english feet above the sea  as soon as the supper was served the superior or prior entered he had a better air than most of his brethren and was distinguished by a gold chain and cross the others saluted him by removing their caps and proceeding to the head of the table he immediately commenced the usual offices in latin the responses being audibly made by the monks and novices we were then invited to take our places at table the seats of honour being civilly left for the strangers the meal was frugal without tea or coffee and the wine none of the best but one ought to be too grateful for getting anything in such a place to be too fastidious  during supper there was a free general conversation and we were asked for news the movements in la vendée being evidently a subject of great interest with them our french fellowtraveller on the lake of brientz had been warm in his eulogiums on this community and coupling his conversation with the present question the suspicion that they were connected by a tie of common feeling flashed upon me a few remarks soon confirmed this conjecture and i found as indeed was natural for men in their situation that these religious republicans39 took a strong interest in the success of the carlists men may call themselves what they will live where they may and assume what disguises artifice or necessity may impose political instincts like love or any other strong passion are sure to betray themselves to an experienced observer how many of our own republicans of the purest water have i seen sighing for ribands and starsay and men too who appear before the nation as devoted to the institutions and the rights of the mass the romish church is certain to be found in secret on the side of despotic power let its pretensions to liberty be what it may its own form of government possessing sympathies with that of political power too strong to be effectually concealed i will not take on myself to say that the circumstance of our being americans caused the fraternity to manifest for us less warmth than common but i will say that our carlist of the lake of brientz eloquently described the warm welcome and earnest hospitality of les bons pères as he called them in a way that was entirely inapplicable to their manner towards us in short the only way we could excite any warmth in them was by blowing the anthracite coal of which we had heard they had discovered a mine on the mountain this was a subject of great interest for you should know that water excepted every necessary of life is to be transported for leagues to this place up the path we came on the backs of mules and that about 8000 persons cross the mountain annually all or nearly all of whom lodge of necessity at the convent the elevation renders fires constantly necessary for comfort to say nothing of cooking and a mine of gold could scarcely be as valuable to such a community as one of coal luckily c like a true pennsylvanian knew something about anthracite and by making a few suggestions and promising further intelligence he finally succeeded in throwing one or two of the community into a blaze  footnote 39 your commonplace logicians argue from these sentiments that distinctions are natural and ought to be maintained these philosophers forget that human laws are intended to restrain the natural propensities and that this argument would be just as applicable to the right of a strong man to knock down a weak one and to take the bread from his mouth as it is to the institution of exclusive political privileges  a little before nine we were shown into a plain but comfortable room with two beds loaded with blankets and were left to our slumbers before we fell asleep c and myself agreed that taking the convent altogether it was a rum place and that it required more imagination than either of us possessed to throw about it the poetry of monastic seclusion and the beautiful and simple hospitality of the patriarchs     letter xxii  sublime

timestransport of artillery up the precipicesnapoleons perilous accidentreturn to vévey   dear   the next morning we arose betimes and on thrusting my head out of a window i thought by the keen air that we had been suddenly transferred to siberia there is no month without frost at this great elevation and as we had now reached the 27th september the season was essentially beginning to change hurrying our clothes on and our beards off we went into the air to look about us  monks convent and historical recollections were at first all forgotten at the sight of the sublime desolation that reigned around the col is a narrow ravine between lofty peaks which happens to extend entirely across this point of the upper alps thus forming a passage several thousand feet lower than would otherwise be obtained the convent stands within a few yards of the northern verge of the precipice and precisely at the spot where the lowest cavity is formed the rocks beginning to rise in its front and in its rear at very short distances from the buildings a little south of it the mountains recede sufficiently to admit the bed of a small dark wintrylooking sheet of water which is oval in form and may cover fifty or sixty acres this lake nearly fills the whole of the level part of the col being bounded north by the site of the convent east by the mountain west by the path for which there is barely room between the water and the rising rocks and south by the same path which is sheltered on its other side by a sort of low wall of fragments piled some twenty or thirty feet high beyond these fragments or isolated rocks was evidently a valley of large dimensions  we walked in the direction of this valley descending gradually from the door of the convent some thirty feet to the level of the lake this we skirted by the regular path rock smoothed by the hoof of horse and foot of man until we came near the last curve of the oval formation here was the site of a temple erected by the romans in honour of jupiter of the snows this passage of the alps having been frequented from the most remote antiquity we looked at the spot with blind reverence for the remains might pass for these of a saladbed of the monks of which there was one enshrined among the rocks hard by and which was about as large and i fancy about as productive as those that are sometimes seen on the quartergalleries of ships at this point we entered italy  passing from the frontier we still followed the margin of the lake until we reached a spot where its waters trickled by a low passage southward the path took the same direction pierced the barrier of low rocks and came out on the verge of the southern declivity which was still more precipitous than that on the other side for a short distance the path ran en corniche along the margin of the descent until it reached the remotest point of what might be called the col whose southern edge is irregular and then it plunged by the most practicable descent which could be found towards its italian destination when at this precise point our distance from the convent may have been half a mile which of course is the breadth of the col we could see more than half a league down the brown gulf below but no sign of vegetation was visible above around beneath wherever the eye restedthe void of the heavens the distant peaks of snow the lake the convent and its accessories exceptedwas dark frowning rock of the colour of iron rust as all the buildings even to the roofs were composed of this material they produced little to relieve the dreary monotony  the view from the col is in admirable keeping with its desolation one is cut off completely from the lower world and beyond its own immediate scene nothing is visible but the impending arch of heaven and heaving mountain tops the water did little to change this character of general and savage desolation for it has the chill and wintry air of all the little mountain reservoirs that are so common in the alps if anything it rather added to the intensity of the feeling to which the other parts of the scenery gave rise  returning from our walk the convent and its long existence the nature of the institution its present situation and all that poetical feeling could do for both were permitted to resume their influence but alas the monks were commonplace their movements and utterance wanted the calm dignity of age and chastened habits the building had too much of the machinery smell and smoke of the kitchen and altogether we thought that the celebrated convent of st bernard was more picturesque on paper than in fact even the buildings were utterly tasteless resembling a barnishlooking manufactory and would be quite abominable but for the delightfully dreary appearance of their material  it is a misfortune that vice so often has the best of it in outward appearance although a little disposed to question the particular instance of taste in substance i am of the opinion of that religionist who was for setting his hymns to popular airs in order that the devil might not monopolize all the good music and under this impression i think it a thousand pities that a little better keeping between appearances and substance did not exist on the great st bernard  the convent is said to have been established by a certain bernard de menthon an augustine of aoste in 962 who was afterwards canonized for his holiness in that remote age the institution must have been eminently useful for posting and macadamized roads across the alps were not thought of it even does much good now as ninetenths who stop here are peasants that pay nothing for their entertainment at particular seasons and on certain occasions they cross in great numbers my guide assuring me he had slept at the convent when there were eight hundred guests a story by the way that one of the monks confirmed some fair or festival however led to this extraordinary migration formerly the convent was rich and able to bear the charges of entertaining so many guests but since the revolution it has lost most of its property and has but a small fixed income it is authorized however to make periodical quêtes in the surrounding country and obtains a good deal in that way all who can pay moreover leave behind them donations of greater or less amount and by that means the charity is still maintained  as many perish annually on the mountain and none are interred another deadhouse stands quite near the convent for the reception of the bodies it is open to the air and contained forty or fifty corpses in every stage of decay apart from putrescency and was a most revolting spectacle when the flesh disappears entirely the bones are cast into a small enclosure near by in which skulls thighbones and ribs were lying in a sort of waltzlike confusion  soon after our return from the walk into italy a novice opened a little door in the outer wall of the convent and the famous dogs of st bernard rushed forth like so many rampant tigers and most famous fellows they certainly were their play was like that of elephants and one of them rushing past me so near as to brush my clothes gave me to understand that a blow from him might be serious there were five of them in all longlegged powerful mastiffs with short hair long bushy tails and of a yellowish hue i have seen very similar animals in america they are trained to keep the paths can carry cordials and nourishment around their necks and frequently find bodies in the snow by the scent but their instinct and services have been greatly exaggerated the latter principally consisting in showing the traveller the way by following the paths themselves were one belated in winter on this pass i can readily conceive that a dog of this force that knew him and was attached to him would be invaluable some pretend that the ancient stock is lost and that their successors show the want of blood of all usurpers  we were now shown into a room where there was a small collection of minerals and of roman remains found about the ruins of the temple at seven we received a cup of coffee and some bread and butter after which the prior entered and invited us to look at the chapel which is of moderate dimensions and of plain ornaments there is a box attached to a column with tronc pour les pauvres and as all the poor in this mountain are those who enjoy the hospitality of the convent the hint was understood we dropped a few francs into the hole while the prior was looking earnestly the other way and it then struck us we were at liberty to depart the body of desaix lies in this chapel and there is a small tablet in it erected to his memory  it would be churlish and unreasonable to complain of the fare in a spot where food is to be had with so much difficulty and on that head i shall merely say in order that you may understand the fact that we found the table of st bernard very indifferent as to the deportment of the monks certainly so far as we were concerned it had none of that warmth and hospitality that travellers have celebrated but on the contrary it struck us both as cold and constrained strongly reminding me in particular of the frigidity of the ordinary american manner40 this might be discipline it might be the consequence of habitual and incessant demands on their attentions and services it might be accidental or it might be prejudice against the country from which we came that was all the stronger for the present excited state of europe  footnote 40 the peculiar coldness of our manners which are too apt to pass suddenly from the repulsive to the familiar has often been commented on but can only be appreciated by those who have been accustomed to a different two or three days after the return of the writer from his journey in europe which had lasted nearly eight years a public dinner was given in new york to a distinguished naval officer and he was invited to attend it as a guest here he met a crowd one half of whom he knew personally without a single exception those of his acquaintances who did speak to him twothirds did not addressed him as if they had seen him the week before and so cold and constrained did every mans manner seem that he had great difficulty in persuading himself there was not something wrong he could not believe however that he was especially invited to be neglected and he tried to revive his old impressions but the chill was so thorough that he found it impossible to sit out the dinner  our mules were ready and we left the col immediately after breakfast a ridge in the rock just before the convent is the dividing line for the flow of the waters here a little snow still lay and there were patches of snow also on the northern face of the declivity the remains of the past winter  we chose to walk the first league which brought us to the refuge the previous day the guide had given us a great deal of gossip and among other things be mentioned having been up to the convent lately with a family of americans whom he described as a people of peculiar appearance and peculiar odour by questioning him a little we discovered that he had been up with a party of coloured people from st domingo his head was a perfect babel as it respected america which was not a hemisphere but one country one government and one people to this we were accustomed however and finding that we passed for english we trotted the honest fellow a good deal on the subject of his nasal sufferings from travelling in such company on the descent we knew that we should encounter the party left at bex and our companion was properly prepared for the interview soon after quitting the refuge the meeting took place to the astonishment of the guide who gravely affirmed after we had parted that there must be two sorts of americans as these we had just left did not at all resemble those he had conducted to the convent may this little incident prove an entering wedge to some new ideas in the valais on the subject of the twelve millions  the population of this canton more particularly the women were much more goodlooking on the mountain than in the valley we saw no crétins after leaving martigny and soft lineaments and clear complexions were quite common in the other sex  you will probably wish to know something of the celebrated passage of napoleon and of its difficulties as far as the ascent was concerned the latter has been greatly exaggerated armies have frequently passed the great st bernard aulus coecinna led his barbarians across in 69 the lombards crossed in 547 several armies in the time of charlemagne or about the year 1000 and in the wars of charles le téméraire as well as at other periods armies made use of this pass near the year 900 a strong body of turkish corsairs crossed from italy and seized the pass of st maurice thus history is full of events to suggest the idea of crossing  nor is this all from the time the french entered switzerland in 1796 troops occupied manoeuvred and even fought on this mountain the austrians having succeeded in turning the summit contended an entire day with their enemies who remained masters of the field or rather rock ebel estimates the number of the hostile troops who were on this pass between the years 1798 and 1801 150000 including the army of napoleon which was 30000 strong  these facts of themselves and i presume they cannot be contested give a totally different colouring from that which is commonly entertained to the conception of the enterprise of the first consul so far as the difficulties of the ascent were concerned if the little community can transport stores for 8000 souls to the convent there could be no great difficulty in one who had all france at his disposal in throwing an army across the pass when we quitted martigny i began to study the difficulties of the route and though the road as far as liddes has probably been improved a little within thirty years taking its worst parts i have often travelled in my boyhood during the early settlement of our country in a heavy high oldfashioned coach over roads that were quite as bad and in some places over roads that were actually more dangerous than any part of this as far as liddes even a good deal of the road after quitting liddes is not worse than that we formerly travelled but wheels are nearly useless for the last league or two as we rode along this path c asked me in what manner i would transport artillery up such an ascent without the least reflection i answered by making sledges of the larches which is an expedient that i think would suggest instantly itself to nineteen men in twenty i have since understood from the duc de  who was an aide of napoleon on the occasion of the passage that it was precisely the expedient adopted several thousand swiss peasants were employed in drawing the logs thus loaded up the precipices i do not think it absolutely impracticable to take up guns limbered but the other plan would be much the easiest as well as the safest in short i make no doubt so far as mere toil and physical difficulties are concerned that a hundred marches have been made through the swamps and forests of america in every one of which mile for mile greater natural obstacles have been overcome than those on this celebrated passage the french it will be remembered were unresisted and had possession of the col a garrison having occupied the convent for more than a year  the great merit of the first consul was in the surprise the military manner in which the march was effected and the brilliant success of his subsequent movements had he been defeated i fancy few would have thought so much of the simple passage of the mountain unless to reproach him for placing the rocks between himself and a retreat as he was not defeated the audace of the experiment a great military quality sometimes enters also quite properly into the estimate of his glory  the guide pointed to a place where according to his account of the matter the horse of the first consul stumbled and pitched him over a precipice the attendants catching him by his greatcoat assisted by a few bushes this may be true for the man affirmed he had heard it from the guide who was near napoleon at the time and a misstep of a horse might very well produce such a fall the precipice was both steep and high and had the first consul gone down it it is not probable he would ever have gone up the st bernard  at liddes we reentered the char and trotted down to martigny in good time here we got another conveyance and pushed down the valley through st maurice across the bridge and out of the gate of the canton again reaching bex a little after dark  the next morning we were off early for villeneuve in order to reach the boat this was handsomely effected and heavingto abreast of vévey we succeeded in eating our breakfast at mon repos     letter xxiii  democracy in america and in switzerlandeuropean prejudicesinfluence of propertynationality of the swisswant of local attachments in americansswiss republicanismpolitical crusade against americaaffinities between america and russiafeeling of the european powers towards switzerland  dear   it is a besetting error with those who write of america whether as travellers political economists or commentators on the moral features of ordinary society to refer nearly all that is peculiar in the country to the nature of its institutions it is scarcely exaggerated to say that even its physical phenomena are ascribed to its democracy reflecting on this subject i have been struck by the fact that no such flights of the imagination are ever indulged in by those who speak of switzerland that which is termed the rudeness of liberty and equality with us becomes softened down here into the frankness of mountaineers or the sturdy independence of republicans what is vulgarity on the other side of the atlantic is unsophistication on this and truculence in the states dwindles to be earnest remonstrances in the cantons  there undeniably exist marked points of difference between the swiss and the americans the dominion of a really popular sway is admitted nowhere here except in a few unimportant mountain cantons that are but little known and which if known would not exercise a very serious influence on any but their own immediate inhabitants with us the case is different new york and pennsylvania and ohio for instance with a united population of near five millions of souls are as pure democracies as can exist under a representative form of government and their trade productions and example so far connect them with the rest of christendom as to render them objects of deep interest to all who look beyond the present moment in studying the history of man  we have states however in which the franchise does not materially differ from those of many of the cantons and yet we do not find that strangers make any material exceptions even in their favour few think of viewing the states in which there are property qualifications in a light different from those just named nor is a disturbance in virginia deemed to be less the consequence of democratic effervescence than it is in pennsylvania  there must be reasons for all this i make no doubt they are to be found in the greater weight of the example of a large and growing community of active commercial and political habits than in one like this which is satisfied with simply maintaining a quiet and secure existence in our total rejection of the usual aristocratical distinctions which still exist more or less all over switzerland in the jealousy of commercial and maritime power and in the recollections which are inseparable from the fact that the parties once stood to each other in the relation of principals and dependants this latter feeling an unavoidable consequence of metropolitan sway is more general than you may imagine for as nearly all europe once had colonies the feelings of superiority they uniformly excite have as naturally led to jealousy of the rising importance of our hemisphere you may smile at the suggestion but i do not remember a single european in whom under proper opportunities i have not been able to trace some lingering feeling of the old notion of the moral and physical superiority of the man of europe over the man of america i do not say that all i have met have betrayed this prejudice for in not one case in ten have i had the means to probe them but such i think has uniformly been the case though in very different degrees whenever the opportunity has existed  though the mountain or the purely rural population here possess more independence and frankness of manner than those who inhabit the towns and advanced valleys neither has them in so great a degree as to leave plausible grounds for believing that the institutions are very essentially connected with the traits institutions may depress men below what may be termed the natural level of feeling in this respect as in the case of slavery but in a civilized society where property has its influence i much question if any political regulations can raise them above it after allowing for the independence of manner and feeling that are coincident to easy circumstances and which is the result of obvious causes i know no part of america in which this is not also the fact the employed is and will be everywhere to a certain point dependent on his employer and the relations between the two cannot fail to bring forth a degree of authority and submission that will vary according to the character of individuals and the circumstances of the moment  i infer from this that the general aspects of society after men cease to be serfs and slaves can never be expected to vary essentially from each other merely on account of the political institutions except perhaps as those institutions themselves may happen to affect their temporal condition in other words i believe that we are to look more to property and to the absence or presence of facilities of living for effects of this nature than to the breadth or narrowness of constituencies  the swiss as is natural from their greater antiquity richer recollections and perhaps from their geographical position are more national than the americans with us national pride and national character exist chiefly in the classes that lie between the yeomen and the very bottom of the social scale whereas here i think the higher one ascends the stronger the feeling becomes the swiss moreover is pressed upon by his wants and is often obliged to tear himself from his native soil in order to find the means of subsistence and yet very few of them absolutely expatriate themselves  the emigrants that are called swiss in america either come from germany or are french germans from alsace and lorrain i have never met with a migration of a body of true swiss though some few cases probably have existed it would be curious to inquire how far the noble nature of the country has an influence in producing their strong national attachments the neapolitans love their climate and would rather be lazzaroni beneath their sun than gentlemen in holland or england this is simple enough as it depends on physical indulgence the charm that binds the swiss to his native mountains must be of a higher character and is moral in its essence  the american character suffers from the converse of the very feeling which has an effect so beneficial on that of the swiss the migratory habits of the country prevent the formation of the intensity of interest to which the long residence of a family in a particular spot gives birth and which comes at last to love a tree or a hill or a rock because they are the same tree and hill and rock that have been loved by our fathers before us these are attachments that depend on sentiment rather than on interest and which are as much purer and holier as virtuous sentiment is purer and holier than worldly interestedness in this moral feature therefore we are inferior to all old nations and to the swiss in particular i think as their local attachments are both quickened and heightened by the exciting and grand objects that surround them the italians have the same local affections in a still stronger degree for with a nature equally or even more winning they have still prouder and moreremote recollections  i do not believe the swiss at heart are a bit more attached to their institutions than we are ourselves for while i complain of the tone of so many of our people i consider it after all as the tone of people who the means of comparison having been denied them neither know that which they denounce nor that which they extol apart from the weakness of wishing for personal distinctions however i never met with a swiss gentleman who appeared to undervalue his institutions they frequently perhaps generally lament the want of greater power in the confederation but as between a monarchy and a republic so far as my observation goes they are uniformly swiss i do not believe there is such a thing in all the cantons as a man for instance who pines for the prussian despotism they will take service under kings be their soldiers bodyguardsreal dugald dalgettysbut when the question comes to switzerland one and all appear to think that the descendants of the companions of winkelried and stauffer must be republicans now all this may be because there are few in the condition of gentlemen in the democratic cantons and the gentlemen of the other parts of the confederation prefer that things should be as they are or rather so lately were for the recent changes have hardly had time to make an impression to putting a prince in the place of the aristocrats self is so prominent in everything of this nature that i feel no great faith in the generosity of men still i do believe that time and history and national pride and swiss morgue have brought about a state of feeling that would indispose them to bow down to a swiss sovereign  a policy is observed by the other states of europe towards this confederation very different from that which is or perhaps it would be better to say has been observed toward us as respects ourselves i have already observed it was my opinion there would have been a political crusade got up against us had not the recent changes taken place in europe and had the secret efforts to divide the union failed their chief dependence certainly is on our national dissensions but as this would probably fail them i think we should have seen some pretence for an invasion the motive would be the strong necessity which existed for destroying the example of a republic or rather of a democracy that was getting to be too powerful strange as you may think it i believe our chief protection in such a struggle would have been russia  we hear and read a great deal about the russian bear but it will be our own fault if this bear does us any harm let the edinburgh review the advocate of mystified liberalism prattle as much as it choose on this topic it becomes us to look at the subject like americans there are more practical and available affinities between america and russia at this very moment than there is between america and any other nation in europe they have high common political objects to obtain and russia has so little to apprehend from the example of america that no jealousy of the latter need interrupt their harmony you see the counterpart of this in the present condition of france and russia so far as their general policy is concerned they need not conflict but rather ought to unite and yet the mutual jealousy on the subject of the institutions keeps them alienated and almost enemies napoleon it is true said that these two nations sooner or later must fight for the possession of the east but it was the ambition of the man rather than the interests of his country that dictated the sentiment the france of napoleon and the france of louisphilippe are two very different things  now as i have told you switzerland is regarded by the powers who would crush america with other eyes i do not believe that a congress of europe would convert this republic into a monarchy if it could tomorrow nothing essential would be gained by such a measure while a great deal might be hazarded a king must have family alliances and these alliances would impair the neutrality it is so desirable to maintain the cantons are equally good as outworks for france austria bavaria wurtemburg lombardy sardinia and the tyrol all cannot have them and all are satisfied to keep them as a defence against their neighbours no one hears in the war of opinion that is going on here the example of the swiss quoted on the side of liberty for this purpose they appear to be as totally out of view as if they had no existence     letter xxiv  the

modern chateautravelling on horsebacknews from americadissolution of the union predictedthe prussian politydespotism in prussia   dear   you may have gathered from my last letters that i do not rank the path of the great st bernard among the finest of the swiss mountain passes you will remember however that we saw but little of the italian side where the noblest features and grandest scenes on these roads are usually found the simplon would not be so very extraordinary were it confined to its swiss horrors and swiss magnificence though by the little i have seen of them i suspect that both the st gothard and the splugen do a little better on their northern faces the pass by nice is peculiar being less wild and rocky than any other while it possesses beauties entirely its own and extraordinary beauties they are in the constant presence of the mediterranean with its vast blue expanse dotted with sails of every kind that the imagination can invent it has always appeared to me that poets have been the riggers of that sea  c and myself were too mountaineerish after this exploit to remain contented in a valley however lovely it might be and the next day we sallied forth on foot to explore the hillside behind vévey the road led at first through narrow lanes lined by vineyards but emerging from these we soon came out into a new world and one that i can compare to no other i have ever met with i should never tire of expatiating on the beauties of this district which really appear to be created expressly to render the foreground of one of the sublimest pictures on earth worthy of the rest of the piece  it was always mountain but a mountain so gradual of ascent so vast and yet so much like a broad reach of variegated low land in its ornaments cultivation houses villages copses meadows and vines that it seemed to be a huge plain canted into a particular inclination in order to give the spectator a better opportunity to examine it in detail and at his leisure as one would hold a picture to the proper light some of the ascents nevertheless were sufficiently sharp and more than once we were glad enough to stop to cool ourselves and to take breath at length after crossing some lovely meadows by the margin of beautiful woods we came out at the spot which was the goal we had aimed at from the commencement of the excursion this was the castle of blonay of whose picturesque site and pleasant appearance i have already spoken in my letters as a venerable hold that stands about a league from the town on one of the most striking positions of the mountain  the family of blonay has been in possession of this place for seven hundred years one branch of it is in sardinia but i suppose its head is the occupant of the house or castle as the building was historical and the de blonays of unquestionable standing i was curious to examine the edifice since it might give me some further insight into the condition of the old swiss nobility accordingly we applied for admission and obtained it without difficulty  the swiss castles with few exceptions are built on the breasts or spurs of mountains the immediate foundation is usually a rock and the sites were generally selected on account of the difficulties of the approach this latter peculiarity however does not apply so rigidly to blonay as to most of the other holds of the country for the rock which forms its base serves for little else than a solid foundation i presume one of the requisites of such a site was the difficulty or impossibility of undermining the walls a mode of attack that existed long before gunpowder was known  the buildings of blonay are neither extensive nor very elaborate we entered by a modest gateway in a retired corner and found ourselves at once in a long narrow irregular court on the left was a corps de bâtiment that contained most of the sleeping apartments and a few of the others with the offices in front was a still older wing in which was the knights hall and one or two other considerable rooms and on the right was the keep an old solid tower that was originally the nucleus and parent of all the others as well as a wing that is now degraded to the duties of a storehouse these buildings form the circuit of the court and complete the edifice for the side next the mountain or that by which we entered had little besides the ends of the two lateral buildings and the gate the latter was merely a sort of chivalrous backdoor for there was another between the old tower and the building of the knights hall of more pretension and which was much larger the great gate opens on a small elevated terrace that is beautifully shaded by fine trees and which commands a view second i feel persuaded to but few on earth i do not know that it is so perfectly exquisite as that we got from the house of cardinal rufo at naples and yet it has many admirable features that were totally wanting to the neapolitan villa i esteem these two views as much the best that it has ever been my good fortune to gaze at from any dwelling though the beauties of both are as a matter of course more or less shared by all the houses in their respective neighbourhoods the great carriageroad as great carriageroads go on such a mountainside comes up to this gate though it is possible to enter also by the other  blonay originally must have been a hold of no great importance as neither the magnitude strength nor position of the older parts is sufficient to render the place one to be seriously assailed or obstinately defended without knowing the fact i infer that its present interest arises from its great antiquity coupled with the circumstance of its having been possessed by the same family for so long a period admitting a new owner for each fiveandtwenty years the present must be somewhere about the twentyfifth de blonay who has lived on this spot  a common housemaid showed us through the building but unfortunately to her it was a house whose interest depended altogether on the number of floors there were to be scrubbed and windows to be cleaned this laboursaving sentiment destroys a great deal of excellent poetry and wholesome feeling reducing all that is venerable and romantic to the level of soap and housecloths i dare say one could find many more comfortable residences than this within a league of vévey perhaps mon repos has the advantage of it in this respect but there must be a constant quiet and enduring satisfaction with one whose mind is properly trained in reflecting that he is moving daily and hourly through halls that have been trodden by his fathers for near a thousand years hope is a livelier and on the whole a more useful because a more stimulating feeling than that connected with memory but there is a solemn and pleasing interest clinging about the latter that no buoyancy of the first can ever equal europe is fertile of recollections america is pregnant with hope i have tried hard aided by the love which is quickened by distance as well as by the observations that are naturally the offspring of comparison to draw such pictures of the latter for the future as may supplant the pictures of the past that so constantly rise before the mind in this quarter of the world but though reasonably ingenious in castlebuilding i have never been able to make it out i believe laziness lies at the bottom of the difficulty in our moments of enjoyment we prefer being led to racking the brain for invention the past is a fact while at the best the future is only conjecture in this case the positive prevails over the assumed and the imagination finds both and easier duty and all it wants in throwing around the stores of memory the tints and embellishments that are wanting to complete the charm i know little of the history of blonay beyond the fact of its great antiquity nor is it a chateau of remarkable interest as a specimen of the architecture and usages of its time and yet i never visited a modern palace with half the intense pleasure with which i went through this modest abode fancy had a text in a few unquestionable facts and it preached copiously on their authority at caserta or st cloud we admire the staircases friezes salons and marbles but i never could do anything with your kings who are so much mixed up with history as to leave little to the fancy while here one might imagine not only time but all the various domestic and retired usages that time brings forth  the ritter saal or knights hall of blonay has positive interest enough to excite the dullest mind neither the room nor its ornaments are very peculiar of themselves the former being square simple and a good deal modernized while the latter was such as properly belonged to a country gentleman of limited means but the situation and view form its great features for all that has just been said of the terrace can be better said of this room owing to the formation of the mountain the windows are very high above the ground and at one of them is a balcony which i am inclined to think is positively without a competitor in this beautiful world of ours cardinal rufo has certainly no such balcony it is le balcon des balcons  i should despair of giving you a just idea of the mingled magnificence and softness of the scene that lies stretched before and beneath the balcony of blonay you know the elements of the view alreadyfor they are the same mysterious glen or valley the same blue lake the same côtes the same solemn and frowning rocks the same groupings of towers churches hamlets and castles of which i have had such frequent occasion to speak in these letters but the position of blonay has about it that peculiar nicety which raises every pleasure to perfection it is neither too high nor too low too retired nor too much advanced too distant nor too near i know nothing of m de blonay beyond the favourable opinion of the observant jean the boatman but he must be made of flint if he can daily hourly gaze at the works of the deity as they are seen from this window without their producing a sensible and lasting effect on the character of his mind i can imagine a man so far blasé as to pass through the crowd of mites who are his fellows without receiving or imparting much but i cannot conceive of a heart whose owner can be the constant observer of such a scene without bending in reverence to the hand that made it it would be just as rational to suppose one might have the communion of st jerome hanging in his drawingroom without ever thinking of domenichino as to believe one can be the constant witness of these natural glories without thinking of god  i could have liked above all things to have been in this balcony during one of the fine sunsets of this season of the year i think the creeping of the shadows up the acclivities the growing darkness below and the lingering light above with the exquisite arabesques of the rocks of savoy must render the scene even more perfect than we found it  blonay is surrounded by meadows of velvet the verdure reaching its very walls and the rocks that occasionally do thrust their heads above the grass aid in relieving rather than in lessening their softness there are just enough of them to make a foreground that is not unworthy of the rocky belt which encircles most of the picture and to give a general idea of the grand geological formation of the whole region  we left blonay with regret and not without lingering some time on its terrace a spot in which retirement is better blended with a birds eye view of men and their haunts than any other i know one is neither in nor out of this world at such a spot near enough to enjoy its beauties and yet so remote as to escape its blemishes in quilting the castle we met a young female of simple ladylike carriage and attire whom i saluted as the lady of blonay and glad enough we were to learn from an old dependant whom we afterwards fell in with that the conjecture was true one bows with reverence to the possessor of such an abode  from blonay we crossed the meadows and orchards until we hit a road that led us towards the broad terrace that lies more immediately behind vévey we passed several hamlets which lie on narrow stripes of land more level than common a sort of shelves on the broad breast of the mountain and which were rural and pretty at length we came to the object of our search a tolerably spacious modern house that is called a château and whose roofs and chimneys had often attracted our eyes from the lake the place was french in exterior though the grounds were more like those of germany than those of france the terrace is irregular but broad and walks wind prettily among woods and copses altogether the place is quite modern and much more extensive than is usual in switzerland we did not presume to enter the house but avoiding a party that belonged to the place we inclined to the left and descended through the vines to the town  the true mode to move about this region is on horseback the female in particular who has a good seat possesses a great advantage over most of her sex if she will only improve it and all things considered i believe a family could travel through the cantons in no other manner so pleasantly always providing that the women can ride by riding however i do not mean sticking on a horse by dint of rein and clinging but a seat in which the fair one feels secure and entirely at her ease otherwise she may prove to be the gazee instead of the gazer  on my return home i went to a readingroom that i have frequented during our residence here where i found a good deal of feeling excited by the news from america the swiss i have told you with very few exceptions wish us well but i take it nothing would give greater satisfaction to a large majority of the upper classes in most of the other countries of europe than to hear that the american republic was broken up if buttons and broadcloths could be sent after us it is not too much to add or sent to the nether world this feeling does not proceed so much from inherent dislike to us as to our institutions as a people i rather think we are regarded with great indifference by the mass but they who so strongly detest our institutions and deprecate our example cannot prevent a little personal hatred from mingling with their political antipathies unlike the woman who was for beginning her love with a little aversion they begin with a little philanthropy and end with a strong dislike for all that comes from the land they hate i have known this feeling carried so far as to refuse credit even to the productions of the earth i saw strong evidences of this truth among several of the temporary habitués of the readingroom in question most of whom were french a speedy dissolution of the american union was proclaimed in all the journals on account of some fresh intelligence from the other side of the atlantic and i dare say that at this moment ninetenths of the europeans who think at all on the subject firmly and honestly believe that our institutions are not worth two years purchase this opinion is very natural because falsehood is so artfully blended with truth in what is published that it requires a more intimate knowledge of the country to separate them than a stranger can possess i spent an hour today in a fruitless attempt to demonstrate to a very sensible frenchman that nothing serious was to be apprehended from the present dispute but all my logic was thrown away and nothing but time will convince him of that which he is so strongly predisposed not to believe they rarely send proper diplomatic men among us in the first place for a novel situation like that in america requires a fertile and congenial mindand then your diplomatist is usually so much disposed to tell every one that which he wishes to hear we mislead too ourselves by the exaggerations of the opposition your partizan writes himself into a fever and talks like any other man whose pulse is unnatural this fact ought to be a matter of no surprise since it is one of the commonest foibles of man to dislike most the evils that press on him most although an escape from them to any other might even entail destruction it is the old story of king log and king stork as democracy is in the ascendant they revile democracy while we all feel persuaded we should be destroyed or muzzled under any other form of government a few toadeaters and court butterflies excepted i do not believe there is a man in all america who could dwell five years in any country in europe without being made sensible of the vast superiority of his own free institutions over those of every other christian nation  i have been amused of late by tracing in the publications at home a great and growing admiration for the prussian polity there is something so absurd in an americans extolling such a system that it is scarcely possible to say where human vagaries are to end the prussian government is a despotism a mode of ruling that one would think the world understood pretty well by this time it is true that the government is mildly administered and hence all the mystifying that we hear and read about it prussia is a kingdom compounded of heterogenous parts the north is protestant the south catholic the nation has been overrun in our own times and the empire dismembered ruled by a king of an amiable and paternal disposition and one who has been chastened by severe misfortunes circumstances have conspired to render his sway mild and useful no one disputes that the government which is controlled by a single will when that will is pure intelligent and just is the best possible it is the government of the universe which is perfect harmony but men with pure intentions and intelligent and just minds are rare and more rare among rulers perhaps than any other class of men even frederic ii though intelligent enough was a tyrant he led his subjects to slaughter for his own aggrandizement his father frederic william used to compel tall men to marry tall women the time for the latter description of tyranny may be past but oppression has many outlets and the next king may discover some of them in such a case his subjects would probably take refuge in a revolution and a constitution demanding guarantees against this admirable system and blow the new modelgovernment to the winds  many of our people are like children who having bawled till they get a toy begin to cry to have it taken away from them fortunately the heart and strength of the nation its rural population is sound and practical else we might prove ourselves to be insane as well as ridiculous      letter xxv  controversy respecting americaconduct of american diplomatistsattachés to american legationsunworthy state of public opinion in america   dear   the recent arrivals from america have brought a document that has filled me with surprise and chagrin you may remember what i have already written you on the subject of a controversy at paris concerning the cost of government and the manner in which the agents of the united states past and present wrongfully or not were made to figure in the affair there is a species of instinct in matters of this sort which soon enables a man of common sagacity who enjoys the means of observation to detect the secret bias of those with whom he is brought in contact now i shall say without reserve that so far as i had any connexion with that controversy or had the ability to detect the feelings and wishes of others the agents of the american government were just the last persons in france to whom i would have applied for aid or information the minister himself stood quoted by the prime minister of france in the tribune as having assured him m perier that we were the wrong of the disputed question and that the writers of the french government had truth on their side this allegation remains before the world uncontradicted to the present hour it was made six months since leaving ample time for a knowledge of the circumstance to reach america but no instructions have been sent to mr rives to clear the matter up or if sent they have not been obeyed with these unquestionable facts before my eyes you will figure to yourself my astonishment at finding in the papers a circular addressed by the department of state to the different governors of the union formally soliciting official reports that may enable us to prove to the world that the position taken by our opponents is not true this course is unusual and as the federal government has no control over or connexion with the expenditures of the states it may even be said to be extraconstitutional it is formally requesting that which the secretary of state had no official right to request there was no harm in the proceeding but it would be undignified puerile and unusual for so grave a functionary to take it without a commensurate object lest this construction should be put on his course the secretary has had the precaution to explain his own motives he tells the different governors in substance that the extravagant pretension is set up flat freedom is more costly than despotism and that what he requests may be done will be done in the defence of liberal institutions here then we have the construction that has been put on this controversy by our own government at home through one of its highest and ablest agents still the course of its agents abroad remains unchanged here the american functionaries are understood to maintain opinions which a distinguished functionary at home has openly declared to be injurious to free institutions  it may be it must be that the state of things here is unknown at washington of this fact i have no means of judging positively but when i reflect on the character and intelligence of the cabinet i can arrive at no other inference it has long been known to me that there exists not only at washington but all through the republic great errors on the subject of our foreign relations on the influence and estimation of the country abroad and on what we are to expect from others no less than what they expect from us but these are subjects which in general give me little concern while this matter of the finance controversy has become one of strong personal interest  the situation of the private individual who in a foreign nation stands or is supposed to stand contradicted in his facts by the authorized agents of their common country is anything but pleasant it is doubly so in europe where men fancy those in high trusts are better authority than those who are not it is true that this supposition under institutions like ours is absurd but it is not an easy thing to change the settled convictions of an entire people in point of truth other things being equal the american citizen who has been passing his time in foreign countries employed in diplomacy would know much less of the points mooted in his discussion than the private citizen who had been living at home in the discharge of his ordinary duties but this is a fact not easily impressed on those who are accustomed to see not only the power but all the machinery of government in the hands of a regular corps of employés the name of mr harris was introduced into the discussion as one thus employed and trusted by our government it is true he was falsely presented for the diplomatic functions of this gentleman were purely accidental and of very short continuance but there would have been a littleness in conducting an argument that was so strong in its facts by stooping to set this matter right and it was suffered to go uncontradicted by me he therefore possessed the advantage the whole time of appearing as one who enjoyed the confidence of his own government we had this difficulty to overcome as well as that of disproving his arguments if indeed the latter could be deemed a difficulty at all41  footnote 41 the american government soon after the date of this letter appointed mr harris to be chargé daffaires at paris  the private individual like myself who finds himself in collision with the agents of two governments powerful as those of france and america is pretty sure to get the worst of it it is quite probable that such has been my fortune in this affair i believe it to be so in public opinion both in france and at home but there is one power of which no political combination can deprive an honest man short of muzzling himthat of telling the truth of this power i have now availed myself and the time will come when they who have taken any note of the matter may see reason to change their minds louisphilippe sits on a throne and wields a fearful force but thanks to him of harlem or of cologne i care not which it is still within my reach to promulgate the facts his reign will at least cease with his life while that of truth will endure as long as means can be found to disseminate it it is probable the purposes of the french ministers are answered and that they care little now about the controversed points at all but their indifference to facts can have no influence with me  before dismissing this subject entirely i will add another word on that of the tone of some of our agents abroad it is not necessary for me to say for the tenth time that it is often what it ought not to be the fact has been openly asserted in the european journals and there can therefore be no mistake as to the manner in which their conduct and opinions are viewed by others certainly every american has a right to his opinions and unless under very peculiar circumstances a right to express them but as i have already said to you in these letters one who holds a diplomatic appointment is under these peculiar circumstances we are strangely not to say disgracefully situated truly if an american diplomate is to express his private opinions abroad on political matters only when they happen to be adverse to the system and action of his own government i would promptly join in condemning the american agent who should volunteer to unite against or freely to give his opinions even in society against the political system of the country to which he is accredited discretion and delicacy both tell him to use a proper reserve on a point that is of so much importance to others while it is no affair of his and by meddling with which he may possibly derange high interests that are entrusted to his especial keeping and care all this is very apparent and quite beyond discussion still circumstances may arise provocations may be given which will amply justify such a man in presenting the most unqualified statements in favour of the principles he is supposed to represent like every other accountable being when called to speak at all he is bound to speak the truth but admitting in the fullest extent the obligations and duties of the diplomatic man towards the country to which he is sent is there nothing due to that from which he comes is he to be justified in discrediting the principles denying the facts or mystifying the results of his own system in order to ingratiate himself with those with whom he treats are rights thus to be purchased by concessions so unworthy and base i will not believe that we have yet reached the degraded state that renders a policy so questionable or a course so mean at all necessary it really appears to me that the conduct of an american minister on all these points ought to be governed by a very simple rule he should in effect tell the other party gentlemen i wish to maintain a rigid neutrality as is due to you but i trust you will manifest towards me the same respect and delicacy if not on my own account at least on account of the country i represent if you drag me into the affair in any way i give you notice that you may expect great frankness on my part and nothing but the truth such a man would not only get a treaty of indemnity but he would be very apt to get the money into the bargain  the practice of naming attachés to our legations leads to great abuses of this nature in the first place the constitution is violated for without a law of congress to that effect and i believe none exists not even the president has a right to name one without the approval of the senate in no case can a minister appoint one legally for the constitution gives him under no circumstances any such authority and our system does not admit of the constructive authority that is used under other governments unless it can be directly referred to an expressly delegated power now the power of appointment to office is expressly delegated but it is to another or rather to another through congress should congress choose to interfere this difficulty is got over by saying an attaché is not an officer if not an officer of the government he is nothing he is at all events deemed to be an officer of the government in foreign countries and enjoys immunities as such besides it is a dangerous precedent to name to any situation under a pretence like this as the practice may become gradually enlarged but i care nothing as to the legality of the common appointments of this nature the question being as to the tone of the nominees you may be assured that i shall send you no idle gossip but there is more importance connected with these things than you may be disposed at first to imagine here these young men are believed to represent the state of feeling at home and are listened to with more respect than they would be as simple travellers it would be far better not to appoint them at all but if this is an indulgence that it would be ungracious to withhold they should at least be made to enter into engagements not to deride the institutions they are thought to represent for to say nothing of principle such a course can only react by discrediting the national character  in writing you these opinions i wish not to do injustice to my own sagacity i have not the smallest expectation were they laid tomorrow before that portion of the american public which comprises the reading classes that either these facts or these sentiments would produce the least effect on the indomitable selfishness in which nine men in ten or even a much larger proportion are intrenched i am fully aware that so much has the little national pride and national character created by the war of 1812 degenerated that more of this class will forgive the treason to the institutions on account of their hatred of the rights of the mass than will feel that the republic is degraded by the course and practices of which i complain i know no country that has retrograded in opinion so much as our own within the last five years it appears to me to go back as others advance let me not therefore be understood as expecting any immediate results were it in my power to bring these matters promptly and prominently before the nation i fully know i should not be heard were the attempt made for nothing is more dull than the ear of him who believes himself already in possession of all the knowledge and virtue of his age and peculiarly entitled in right of his possessions to the exclusive control of human affairs the most that i should expect from them were all the facts published tomorrow would be the secret assent of the wise and good the expressed censure of the vapid and ignorant a pretty numerous clan by the way the surprise of the mercenary and the demagogue and the secret satisfaction of the few who will come after me and who may feel an interest in my conduct or my name i have openly predicted bad consequences in a political light from the compliance of our agents here and we shall yet see how far this prediction may prove true42  footnote 42 has it not have we not been treated by france in the affair of the treaty in a manner she would not have treated any secondrate power of europe

peculiarities of the swisswomen of switzerlandmrs trollope and the american ladiesaffected manner of speaking in american womenpatois in americapeculiar manner of speaking at véveyswiss cupidity  dear   the season is giving warning for all intruders to begin to think of quitting the cantons we have not been driven to fires as in 1828 for vévey is not berne but the evenings are beginning to be cool and a dash of rain with a foaming lake are taken to be symptoms here as strong as a frost would be there speaking of berne a little occurrence has just recalled the burgerschaft which shorn of its glory as it is had some most praiseworthy regulations during our residence near that place i hired a bernois as a footman discharging the man as a matter of course on our departure for italy yesterday i got a doleful letter from this poor fellow informing me among a series of other calamities that he had had the misfortune to lose his livret and begging i would send him such testimonials of character as it might suit my sense of justice to bestow it will be necessary to explain a little in order that you may know what this livret is  the commune or district issues to the domestics a small certified blank book livret in which all the evidences of character are to be entered the guides have the same and in many instances i believe they are rendered necessary by law the freetrade system i very well know would play the deuce with these regulations but capital regulations they are and i make no doubt that the established fidelity of the swiss as domestics is in some measure owing to this excellent arrangement if men and women were born servants it might a little infringe on their natural rights to be sure but as even a von erlach or a de bonestetten would have to respect the regulation were they to don a livery i see no harm in a livret now by means of this little book every moment of a domestics time might be accounted for he being obliged to explain what he was about in the interregnums all this to be sure might be done by detached certificates but neither so neatly nor so accurately for a man would pretend a need that he had lost a single certificate oftener than he would pretend that he had lost those he really had or in other words his book besides the commune gives some relief i believe when such a calamity can be proved as proved it probably might be in addition the authorities will not issue a livret to any but those who are believed to be trustworthy of course i sent the man a character so far as i was concerned for he had conducted himself perfectly well during the short time he was in my service  a regulation like this could not exist in a very large town without a good deal of trouble certainly and yet what is there of more moment to the comfort of a population than severe police regulations on the subject of servants america is almostperhaps the only civilized country in which the freetrade system is fully carried out in this particular and carried out it is with a vengeance we have the letalone policy in puris naturalibus and everything is truly let alone but the property of the master i do not wish however to ascribe effects to wrong causes the dislike to being a servant in america has arisen from the prejudice created by our having slaves the negroes being of a degraded caste by insensible means their idea is associated with service and the whites shrink from the condition this fact is sufficiently proved by the circumstance that he who will respectfully and honestly do your bidding in the fieldbe a farmservant in factwill not be your domestic servant there is no particular dislike in our people to obey and to be respectful and attentive to their duties as journeymen farmlabourers daylabourers seamen soldiers or anything else domestic servants excepted which is just the duties they have been accustomed to see discharged by blacks and slaves this prejudice is fast weakening whites taking service more readily than formerly and it is found that with proper training they make capital domestics and are very faithful in time the prejudice will disappear and men will come to see it is more creditable to be trusted about the person and house than to be turned into the fields  it is just as difficult to give a minute account of the governments of the different cantons of switzerland as it is to give an account of the different state governments of america each differs in some respect from all the others and there are so many of them in both cases as to make it a subject proper only for regular treatises i shall therefore confine the remarks i have to make on this subject to a few general facts  previously to the recent changes there were twentytwo cantons a number that the recent secession of neufchâtel has reduced to twentyone43 until the french revolution the number was not so great many of the present cantons being then associated less intimately with the confederation as allies and some of them being held as political dependents by those that were cantons thus vaud and argovie were both provinces owned and ruled by berne  footnote 43 berne soleure zurich lucerne schweitz unterwalden uri glarus tessino valais vaud geneva basle schaffhausen argovie thourgovie zug fribourg st gall appenzell and the grisons they are named here without reference to their rank or antiquity  the system is that of a confederation which leaves each of its members to do pretty much as it pleases in regard to its internal affairs the central government is conducted by a diet very much as our affairs were formerly managed by the old congress in this diet each canton has one vote the executive power such as it is is wielded by a committee or council its duties do not extend much beyond being the organ of communication between the diet and the cantons the care of the treasury no great matter and the reception of and the treating with foreign ministers the latter duty however and indeed all other acts are subject to a revision by the diet  although the cantons themselves are only known to the confederation as they are enrolled on its list many of them are subdivided into local governments that are perfectly independent of each other thus there are two unterwaldens in fact though only one in the diet two appenzells also and i may add half a dozen grisons and valais in other words the two unterwaldens are absolutely independent of each other except as they are connected through the confederation though they unite to choose common delegates to the diet in which they are known as only one canton and possess but one vote the same is true of appenzell and will soon most probably be true of schweitz and basle in both of which there are at this moment serious dissensions that are likely to lead to internal separations44 the grisons is more of a consolidated canton than these examples but it is subdivided into leagues which have a good many strong features of independence the same is true of valais where the subdivisions are termed dizains the diet does little beyond controlling the foreign relations of the republic it makes peace and war receives ambassadors forms treaties and enters into alliances it can only raise armies however by calling on the cantons for their prescribed contingents the same is true as respects taxes this you will perceive is very much like our own rejected confederation and has most of its evils though external pressure and a trifling commerce render them less here than they were in america i believe the confederation has some control over the public mails though i think this is done also through the cantons the diet neither coins money nor establishes any courts beyond its own power to decide certain matters that may arise between the cantons themselves in short the government is a very loose one and it could not hold together in a crisis were it not for the jealousy of its neighbours  footnote 44 basle is now divided into what are called basle town and basle country or the city population and the rural before the late changes the former ruled the latter  i have already told you that there exists a strong desire among the intelligent to modify this system consolidation as you know from my letters is wished by no one for the great difference between the town and the rural populations causes both to wish to remain independent three languages are spoken in switzerland without including the rhetian or any of the numerous patois all the north is german geneva vaud and valais are french as are parts of berne while tessino lying altogether south of the alps is italian i have been told that the states which treat with switzerland for mercenaries condition that none of them shall be raised in tessino but the practice of treating for mercenaries is likely to be discontinued altogether though the republic has lately done something in this way for the pope the objection is to the italian character which is thought to be less constant than that of the real swiss  men and especially men of narrow habits and secluded lives part reluctantly with authority nothing can to be more evident than the fact that a common currency common postoffices common customhouses if there are to be any at all and various other similar changes would be a great improvement on the present system of switzerland but a few who control opinion in the small cantons and who would lose authority by the measure oppose the change the entire territory of the republic is not as great as that of pennsylvania nor is the entire population much greater than that of the same state it is materially less than the population of new york on the subject of their numbers there exists a singular and to me an inapplicable sensitiveness it is not possible to come at the precise population of switzerland that given in the tables of the contingents is thought to be exaggerated though one does not very well understand the motive i presume the entire population of the country is somewhere between 1500000 and 1900000 some pretend however there are 2000000 admitting the latter number you will perceive that the single state of new york considerably surpasses it45 more than onethird of the entire population of switzerland is probably in the single canton of berne as oneseventh of that of the united states is in new york the proportion between surface and inhabitants is not very different between new england and switzerland if maine be excluded parts of the cantons are crowded with people as zurich for instance while a large part is uninhabitable rocks and ice  footnote 45 the population of new york today is about 2200000 or not greatly inferior to that of scotland and superior to that of hanover or wurtemberg or denmark or saxony all of which are kingdoms the increase of population in the united states at present the immigration included is not far from 500000 souls annually which is equal to the addition of an average state each year the western speculations find their solution in this fact  the swiss have most of the physical peculiarities of the different nations that surround them the german part of the population however are on the whole both larger and betterlooking than the true germans all the mountaineers are fresher and have clearer complexions than those in the lower portions of the country but the difference in size is not very apparent nowhere is there such a population as in our southwestern states indeed i question if large men are as common in any other country scotland however may possibly form an exception  the women of switzerland are betterlooking than those of france or germany but beauty or even extreme prettiness is rare light flexible graceful forms are quite uncommon large hands and feet are met with everywhere those of our women being miraculous in comparison but the same thing is true nearly all over the north of europe even our menmeaning the gentlemeni think might be remarked for the same peculiarities in this part of the world the english have absurd notions on this subject and i have often enjoyed a malicious pleasure in bringing my own democratic paws and hoofs no prodigies at home in contrast with their aristocratic members of course the climate has great influence on all these things  i scarcely think the swiss women of the mountains entitled to their reputation for beauty if strength proportions on a scale that is scarcely feminine symmetry that is more anatomically than poetically perfect enter into the estimate one certainly sees in some of the cantons female peasants who may be called fine women i remember in 1828 to have met one of these in the grisons near the upper end of the valley of the rhine this woman had a form carriage and proportions that would have made a magnificent duchess in a coronation procession but the face though fresh and fair did not correspond with the figure the women of our own mountains excel them altogether being a more true medium between strength and coarseness even mrs trollope admits that the american women perhaps she ought to have said the girls are the most beautiful in the world while they are the least interesting mrs trollope has written a vast deal of nonsense putting cockneyisms into the mouths of americans and calling them americanisms but she has also written a good many truths i will not go as far as to say she was right in the latter part of this charge but if our girls would cultivate neater and more elegant forms of expression equally avoiding vulgar ohs and ahs and set phrases be more careful not to drawl and not to open the mouth so as to call hot haut giggle less speak lower have more calmness and more dignity of manner and think instead of pulsatingi would put them for all in all against any women in the world they lose half of these defects when they marry as it is but the wisdom of solomon would come to our ears with a diminished effect were it communicated through the medium of any other than a neat enunciation the great desideratum in female education at home is to impart a graceful quiet ladylike manner of speaking  were it not for precisely this place vévey i should add that the women of america speak their language worse than the women of any other country i ever was in we all know that a calm even unemphatic mode of speaking is almost a test of highbreeding that a clear enunciation is in short an indispensable requisite for either a gentleman or a lady one may be a fool and utter nonsense gracefully but aphorisms lose their force when conveyed in a vulgar intonation as a nation i repeat there is more of this fault in america perhaps than among an equal portion of educated people anywhere else contrary to the general rule too the men of america speak better than the women though the men as a class speak badly the peculiar dialect of new england which prevails so much all over the country is derived from a provincial mode of speaking in england which is just the meanest in the whole island and though it is far more intelligible and infinitely better grammar is used with us than in the place whence the patois came i think we have gained little on the score of elegance i once met in england a distinguished man who was one of the wealthiest commoners of his county and he had hardly opened his mouth before i was struck with this peculiarity on inquiry i learned that he came from the west of england it is by no means uncommon to meet with bad grammar and an improper use of words as relates to their significations among the highest classes in england though i think not as often as in america but it is rare indeed that a gentleman or a lady does not express himself or herself so far as utterance delivery and intonation go as a gentleman and lady should the fault in america arises from the habits of drawling and of opening the mouth too wide any one knows that if he open the stop of an organ and keep blowing the bellows he will make anything but music we have some extraordinary words too who but a philadelphian for instance would think of calling his mother a mare  but i am digressing the peculiar manner of speaking which prevails at vévey having led me from the main subject these people absolutely sing in their ordinary conversation more especially the women in the simple expression of bon jour madame each alternate syllable is uttered on an octave higher than the preceding this is not a patois at all but merely a vicious and ungraceful mode of utterance it prevails more among the women than among the men and as a matter of course more among the women of the inferior than among those of the superior classes still it is more or less general to ears that are accustomed to the even unemphatic graceful enunciation of paris it is impossible to describe to you in words the ludicrous effect it produces we have frequently been compelled to turn away in the shops to avoid downright laughter  there exists the same sensitiveness on the subject of the modes of speech between the french swiss and their french neighbours as is to be found between us and the english many intelligent men here have laboured to convince me that the genevese in particular speak purer french than even the parisians i dare say a part of this pretension may be true for a great people take great liberties with everything but if america with her fifteen millions finds it difficult to maintain herself in such matters even when in the right against the influence of england what can little geneva look for in such a dispute with france but to be put down by sheer volubility she will be outtalked as a matter of course clever as her citizens are  on the subject of the prevalent opinion of swiss cupidity i have very little to say the practice of taking service as mercenaries in other countries has probably given rise to the charge as is usually the case in countries where the means of obtaining a livelihood are not easy the swiss strike me as being more influenced by money than most of their neighbours though scarcely more so than the common classes of france to a man who gains but twenty in a day a sou is of more account than to him who gains forty i presume this is the whole amount of the matter i shall not deny however that the honorarium was usually more in view in a transaction with a swiss than in a transaction with a frenchman though i think the first the most to be depended on notwithstanding one or two instances of roguery that i have encountered i would as soon depend on a swiss a clear bargain having been made as on any other man i know     letter xxvii  departure from véveypassage down the lakearrival at genevapurchase of

scotch travellernationality of the scotchroad towards troyessource of the seine   dear   notwithstanding all the poetry of our situation we found some of the ills of life in it a few light cases of fever had occurred among us which gave reason to distrust the lakeshore at this late season and preparations were accordingly made to depart watching an opportunity the skiff of honest jean was loaded with us and our effects to the waters edge and we embarked in the leman as she layto in one of her daily trips bidding a final adieu to vévey after a residence of about five weeks  the passage down the lake was pleasant and our eyes rested on the different objects with melancholy interest for we knew not that they would ever be again looked upon by any among us it is an exquisite lake and it grows on us in beauty each time that we look at it the surest sign of perfection we reached geneva early and took lodgings at lecu in season for the ladies to make some purchases the jewellery of this town is usually too tempting to be resisted by female selfdenial and when we met at dinner we had a course of earrings chains and bracelets served up by a succession of shopmen who understand as it were by instinct the caprices of the daughters of eve one of the party had taken a fancy to a pair of unfinished bracelets and had expressed her regrets that she could not carry them with her madame goes to paris yes if she will leave her address they shall be sent to her in a month as we were strangers in france and the regulation which prevented travellers from buying articles of this sort for their personal use however necessary has always appeared to me inhospitable i told the man that if delivered in paris they should be received and paid for the bargain was made and the jewels have already reached us of course i have asked no questions and am ignorant whether they came by a balloon in the luggage of an ambassador or by the means of a dog  the next day it rained tremendously but having ordered horses we left geneva in the afternoon taking the road to ferney not an individual of the whole party had any desire to visit the chateau however and we drove through the place on a gallop we took french posthorses at the foot of the jura where we found the first posthouse and began to climb the mountains our party made a droll appearance just at that moment the rain was falling in torrents and the carriage was dragging slowly through the mud up the long winding ascent of course the windows were shut and we were a sort of fulldress party within looking ridiculously fine and from time to time laughing at our silly appearance everybody was in travelling dresses jewellery excepted the late purchases however were all on our persons for we had been told they would certainly be seized at the customhouses if left in their boxes in the trunks the douaniers could tell a recent purchase by instinct accordingly all our fingers were brilliant with rings brows glittered with ferronières earrings of the newest mode were shining beneath travelling caps and hats and chains abounded i could not persuade myself that this masquerade would succeed but predicted a failure it really appeared to me that so shallow a distinction could avail nothing against harpies who denied the right of strangers to pass through their country with a few purchases of this nature that had been clearly made for their own use but while the sumptuary laws of the customhouses are very rigid and set limits to the wants of travellers without remorse like quarantine regulations they have some rules that seem framed expressly to defeat their own ordinances  the road led up the mountain where a view that is much praised exists it is the counterpart of that which is seen everywhere when one touches on the eastern verge of the jura and first gets sight of switzerland proper these views are divided into that which embraces the valley of the aar and the oberland range and this which comprises the basin of the leman and the mountains that surround it mont blanc of course is included in the other on the whole i prefer the first although the last is singularly beautiful we got clear weather near the summit and stopped a few minutes to dissect the elements of this scene the view is very lovely beyond a question but i think it much inferior to that which has been so often spoken of between us above vévey notwithstanding mont blanc enters into this as one of its most conspicuous objects i have as yet nowhere seen this mountain to so much advantage in size as compared with the peaks around it it is a haystack among haycocks with the advantage of being a pile of shining ice or frozen snow while everything else near it is granite by insulating this mountain and studying it by itself one feels its mild sublimity but still as a whole i give the preference greatly to the other view from this point the lake is too distant the shores of savoy dwindle in the presence of their mightier neighbour and the mysteriouslooking valais which in its peculiar beauty has scarcely a rival on earth is entirely hid from sight then the lights and shades are nearly lost from the summit of the jura and after all it is these lights and shades the natural chiaroscuro that finishes the picture  we reached the first customhouse a little before sunset but as there was a reasonably good inn opposite i determined to pass the night there in order to be able to defend my rights against the myrmidons of the law at leisure should it be necessary the carriage was driven to the door of the customhouse and we were taken into separate rooms to be examined as for myself i have no reason to complain but the ladies were indignant at being subjected to a personal examination by a female harpy who was equally without politeness and propriety surely francepolished refined intellectual francecannot actually need this violation of decorum not to say of decency this is the second time that similar rudeness has been encountered by us on entering the country and to make the matter worse females have been the sufferers i made a pretty vigorous remonstrance in very animated french and it had the effect of preventing a repetition of the rudeness the men pleaded their orders and i pleaded the rights of hospitality and propriety as well as a determination not to submit to the insults i would have made a détour of a hundred leagues to enter at another point in preference  in the course of the conversation that succeeded the officers explained to me the difficulties they had to contend with which certainly are not trifling as to station they said that made no great difference your duchess being usually an inveterate smuggler travellers are not content to supply their own wants but they purchase for all their friends this i knew to be true though not by experience you will permit me to say the ambassadors bags half the time containing more prohibited articles than despatches but notwithstanding this explanation i did not deem the case of one who bought only for himself the less hard it is so easy to conceal light articles that except in instances where is reason for distrust it were better to confide in character if anything could induce me to enter seriously into the contraband it would be such treatment  the officers explained to me the manner in which smuggling is conducted the usual mode is to cross the fields in the night for when two customhouses are passed the jewellery may be put in a common trunk and sent forward by the diligence unless there is some particular grounds of suspicion they know perfectly well that bargains are constantly made in geneva to deliver purchases in paris but with all their care and vigilance the smugglers commonly succeed  on a recent occasion however the officers had been more successful a cart loaded with split wood larch had boldly passed the door of the douane the man who drove it was a peasant and altogether he appeared to be one driving a very common burthen to his own home the cart however was stopped and the wood unloaded while reloading for nothing but wood was found one stick attracted attention it was muddy as if it had fallen into the road the mud however had a suspicious malice prepense air about it it seemed as if it were smeared on and by examining it closely two seams were discovered which it had been hoped the mud would conceal the billet had been split in two hollowed and reunited by means of pegs the mud was to hide these pegs and the seams as i have told you and in the cavity were found seventy gold watches i saw the billet of wood and really felt less resentment at the old virago who had offended us the officers caught relenting in my eyes and inquired what i thought of it and i told them that we were not muddy logs of larch  the next morning we were off betimes intending to push through the mountains and the customhouses that day the country was wild and far from fruitful though there were bits of naked mountain through which the road wound in a way to recall on a greatly diminished scale however that peculiar charm of the apennines the villages were clean but dreary and nowhere for leagues did we see a country that was genial or likely to reward agriculture this passage of the jura is immeasurably inferior to that by salins and neufchâtel at first i was afraid it was my wornout feelings that produced the impression but by close comparisons and by questioning my companions some of whom scarcely recollected the other road i feel certain that such is the fact indeed it would be like comparing a finished painting to an esquisse  we had not much trouble at the second customhouse though the officers eyed our ornaments with a confiscating rapacity for my part i took my revenge by showing off the only ornament i had to the utmost a had made me a present of a sapphirering and this i flourished in all sorts of ways as it might be in open defiance one fellow had an extreme longing for a pretty ferronière and there was a private consultation about it among them i believe but after some detention and a pretty close examination of the passports we were permitted to proceed if françois smuggled nothing it must have been for want of funds for speculation is his hobby as well as his misfortune entering into every bone of his body  we were all day busy in those barren sterile and unattractive mountainsthrice unattractive after the godlike alpsand were compelled to dip into the night in order to get rid of them once or twice on looking back we saw the cold chiseled peak of mont blanc peering over our own nearer ridges and as the weather was not very clear it looked dim and spectral as if sorry to lose us it was rather late when we reached a small town at the foot of the jura and stopped for the night  this was france againfrance in cookery beds tone and thought we lost the swiss simplicity for there is still relatively a good deal of it and swiss directness in politeness finesse and manner we got monsieur saitmonsieur pensemonsieur ferafor que voulezvous monsieur  we had no more to do with mountains our road next morning was across a wide plain and we plunged at once into the undeviating monotony of french agriculture a village had been burned it was thought to excite political commotion and the postilions began to manoeuvre with us to curtail us of horseflesh as the road was full of carriages it now became a matter of some moment to push on for first come first served is the law of the road by dint of bribes and threats we reached the point where the two great routes unite a little east of dôle before a train of several carriages which we could see pushing for the point of junction with the same object as ourselves came up no one could pass us on the same road unless we stopped and abandoning all idea of eating we drove up to the posthouse in dôle and preferred our claim at the next moment four other carriages stopped also but five horses were in the stable and seventeen were needed even these five had just arrived and were baiting four of them fell to my share and we drove off with many handsome expressions of regret at being obliged to leave but one for the four other carriages your travelling is an epitome of life in which the lucky look upon the unlucky with a supercilious compassion  a league or two beyond dôle we met two carriages coming the other way and exchanged horses and really i had some such generous feelings on the occasion as those of a rich man who hears that a poor friend has found a bank note the carriage with which we exchanged was english and it had an earls coronet the pair within were man and wife and some fine children with an attendant or two were in the one that followed they were scotch at a glance the master himself wearing besides the stamp of his nation on his face a bonnet with the colours of his clan there is something highly respectable in this scotch nationality and i have no doubt it has greatly contributed towards making the people what they are if the irish were as true to themselves english injustice would cease in a twelvemonth but as a whole the irish nobles are a band of mercenaries of english origin and they prefer looking to the fleshpots of egypt to falling back sternly on their rights and sustaining themselves by the proud recollections of their forefathers indeed half of them would find their forefathers among the english speculators when they found them at all i envied the scotchman his cap and tartan though i dare say both he and his pretty wife had all the fine feelings that such an emblem is apt to inspire your earldoms are getting to be paltry things but it is really something to be the chief of a clan  you have travelled the road between dôle and dijon with me once already and i shall say no more than that we slept at the latter town the next morning with a view to vary the route and to get off the train of carriages we took the road towards troyes our two objects were effected for we saw no more of our competitors for posthorses and we found ourselves in an entirely new country but parts of champagne and the ardennes excepted a country that proved to be the most dreary portion of france we had yet been in while trotting along a good road through this naked stony region we came to a little valley in which there was a village that was almost as wild in appearance as one of those on the great st bernard a rivulet flowed through the village and meandered by our side among the half sterile meadows it was positively the only agreeable object that we had seen for some hours recollecting the stream at tuttlingen a desired me to ask the postilion if it had a name monsieur cette petite rivière sappelle la seine we were then at the sources of the seine looking back i perceived by the formation of the land that it must take its rise a short distance beyond the village among some naked and drearylooking hills a little beyond these again the streams flow towards the tributaries of the rhone and we were consequently in the high region where the waters of the atlantic and the mediterranean divide still there were no other signs of our being at such an elevation except in the air of sterility that reigned around it really seemed as if the river so notoriously affluent in mud had taken down with it all the soil     letter xxviii  miserable inna french bedfreetradefrench relicscross roadsarrival at la grangereception by general lafayettethe

french cuisinedeparture from la grangereturn to paris   dear   i have little to say of the next two days drive except that ignorance and the poetical conceptions of a postilion led us into the scrape of passing a night in just the lowest inn we had entered in europe we pushed on after dark to reach this spot and it was too late to proceed as all of the party were excessively fatigued to be frank with you it was an auberge aux charretiers eating was nearly out of the question and yet i had faith to the last in a french bed the experience of this night however enables me to say all france does not repose on excellent wool mattresses for we were obliged to put up with a good deal of straw and yet the people were assiduous anxious to please and civil the beds moreover were tidy our straw being clean straw  the next night we reached a small town where we did much better still one can see the great improvements that travellers are introducing into france by comparing the taverns on the better roads with those on the more retired routes at this place we slept well and à la française if sancho blessed the man who invented sleep after a nap on spanish earth what would he have thought of it after one enjoyed on a french bed  the drums beat through the streets after breakfast and the population crowded their doors listening with manifest interest to the proclamation of the crier the price of bread was reduced an annunciation of great interest at all times in a country where bread is literally the staff of life the advocates of freetrade prices ought to be told that france would often be convulsed literally from want if this important interest were left to the sole management of dealers a theory will not feed a starving multitude and hunger plays the deuce with argument in short freetrade as its warmest votaries now carry out their doctrines approaches suspiciously near a state of nature a condition which might do well enough if trade were a principal instead of a mere incident of life with some men however it is a principalan all in alland this is the reason we frequently find those who are notoriously the advocates of exclusion and privileges in government maintaining the doctrine as warmly as those who carry their liberalism in other matters to extremes  there was a small picture in the manner of watteau in this inn which the landlady told me had been bought at a sale of the effects of a neighbouring chateau it is curious to discover these relics in the shape of furniture pictures porcelain c scattered all over france though most of it has found its way to paris i offered to purchase the picture but the good woman held it to be above price  we left this place immediately after breakfast and soon quitted the great route to strike across the country the chemins vicinaux or crossroads of france are pretty much in a state of nature the public i believe as little liking to work them as it does at home previously to the revolution all this was done by means of the corvée a right which empowered the seigneur to oblige his tenants to perform a certain amount of labour without distinction on the highways of his estate thus whenever m le marquis felt disposed to visit the chateau there was a general muster to enable him and his friends to reach the house in safety and to amuse themselves during their residence after which the whole again reverted to the control of nature and accident to be frank one sometimes meets with byroads in this old country which are positively as bad as the very worst of our own in the newest settlements last year i actually travelled post for twenty miles on one of these trackless ways  we were more fortunate however on the present occasion the road we took being what is called a route départementale and little if any inferior to the one we had left our drive was through a slightly undulating country that was prettily wooded and in very good agriculture in all but the wheeltrack the traveller gains by quitting the great routes in france for nothing can be more fatiguing to the eye than their straight undeviating monotony they are worse than any of our own airline turnpikes for in america the constant recurrence of small isolated bits of wood greatly relieves the scenery  we drove through this country some three or four leagues until we at length came to an estate of better arrangements than common on our left was a wood and on our right a broad reach of meadow passing the wood we saw a wide parklike lawn that was beautifully shaded by copses and in which there were touches of landscapegardening in a taste altogether better than was usual in france passing this another wood met us and turning it we entered a private roadyou will remember the country has neither fence nor hedge nor yet scarcely a wallwhich wound round its margin describing an irregular semicircle then it ran in a straight line for a short distance among a grove of young evergreens towards two dark picturesque towers covered with ivy crossed a permanent bridge that spanned a ditch and dashing through a gateway in which the grooves of the portcullis are yet visible we alighted in the court of la grange  it was just nine and the family was about assembling in the drawingroom the le général sera charmé de vous voir monsieur of the faithful bastien told us we should find his master at home and on the great stairs most of the ladies met us in short the patriarch was under his own roof surrounded by that family which has so long been the admiration of thousandsor precisely as one would most wish to find him  it is not necessary to speak of our reception where all our country are welcome we were soon in the drawingroom which i found covered with american newspapers and in a few minutes i was made acquainted with all that was passing on the other side of the atlantic mr rives had sailed for home and as m perier was dead general lafayette had not explained in the chamber the error into which that minister had permitted himself to fall agreeably to a tardy authority to that effect received from mr rives the ministry was on the point of dissolution in france and it was said the doctrinaires were to come inand the nullification strife ran high at home on the latter subject lafayette spoke with a reserve that was unusual on subjects connected with america though he strongly deprecated the existence of the controversy  there is great weakness in an americans betraying undue susceptibility on the score of every little unpleasant occurrence that arises at home no one of the smallest intelligence can believe that we are to be exempt from human faults and we all ought to know that they will frequently lead to violence and wrongs still there is so much jealousy here on this subject the votaries of monarchies regard all our acts with so much malevolence and have so strong a desire to exaggerate our faults that it is not an easy matter at all times to suppress these feelings i have often told our opponents that they pay us the highest possible compliment in their constant effort to compare the results of the system with what is purely right in the abstract instead of comparing its results with those of their own but the predominance of the hostile interests are so great here that reason and justice go for nothing in the conflict of opinions if a member of congress is flogged it is no answer to say that a deputy or a member of parliament has been murdered they do not affirm but they always argue as if they thought we ought to be better than they if we have an angry discussion and are told of it one would think it would be a very good answer so far as comparative results are concerned to tell them that halfadozen of their provinces are in open revolt but to this they will not listen they expect us never to quarrel we must be without spot in all things or we are worse than they all this lafayette sees and feels and although it is impossible not to detect the unfairness and absurdity of such a mode of forming estimates of men it is almost equally impossible in the present situation of europe for one who understands the influence of american example not to suffer these unpleasant occurrences to derange his philosophy  before breakfast the general took me into his library and we had a long and a much franker conversation on the state of south carolina he said that a separation of the union would break his heart i hope they will at least let me die he added before they commit this suicide on our institutions he particularly deprecated the practice of talking about such an event which he thought would accustom mens minds to it i had not the same apprehensions to me it appeared that the habit of menacing dissolution was the result of every ones knowing and intimately feeling the importance of hanging together which induced the dissatisfied to resort to the threat as the shortest means of attaining their object it would be found in the end that the very consciousness which pointed out this mode as the gravest attack that could be made on those whom the discontented wish to influence would awaken enough to consequences to prevent any consummation in acts this menace was a natural argument of the politically weak in america just as the physically weak lay hold of knives and clubs where the strong rely on their hands it must be remembered that the latter at need can resort to weapons too i do not believe there could be found in all america any great number of respectable men who wish the union dissolved and until that shall be the case i see no great grounds of apprehension moreover i told him that so long as the northern states were tranquil i had no fears for i felt persuaded that no great political change would occur in america that did not come from that section of the union as this is a novel opinion he inquired for its reasons and in brief this was the answer  there is but one interest that would be likely to unite all the south against the north and this was the interest connected with slavery now it was notorious that neither the federal government nor the individual states have anything to do with this as a national question and it was not easy to see in what manner anything could be done that would be likely to push matters as far as disunion on such a point there might be and there probably would be discussion and denunciationsnay there often had been but a compromise having been virtually made by which all new states at the north are to be free states and all at the south slaveholding i saw nothing else that was likely to be serious46 as respects all other interests it would be difficult to unite the whole south taking the present discussion as an example those that were disaffected to use the strongest term the case admits of were so environed by those that were not that a serious separation became impossible the tier of states that lies behind the carolinas virginia and georgia for instance are in no degree dependent on them for an outlet to the sea while they are so near neighbours as to overshadow them in a measure then the south must always have a northern boundary of free states if they separate en massea circumstance not very desirable as they would infallibly lose most of their slaves  footnote 46 recent facts have confirmed this opinion  on the other hand the north is very differently situated new england new york pennsylvania ohio and the tier of states west are closely connected geographically must and would go together and they have one frontier that is nearly all water they contain already a free population of eight millions which is rapidly increasing and are strong enough and united enough to act as they please it is their interest to remain united with the south and it is also a matter of feeling with them and i apprehend little to the union so long as these states continue of this mind47  footnote 47 this was written before the recent events in texas which give a new aspect to the question  lafayette wished to know if i did not think the union was getting too large for its safety i thought not so long as the means of necessary intercommunication were preserved but just the reverse as the larger the union the less probability there would be of agitating its whole surface by any one interest and the parties that were tranquil as a matter of course would influence those that were disturbed were the union today for instance confined to the coast as it was forty years since there would be no southwestern states to hold the southern in check as we all know is the fact at present and the danger from nullification would be doubled these things act both ways for even the state governments while they offer positive organised and quasi legal means of resisting the federal government also afford the same organized local means of counteracting them in their own neighbourhood thus carolina and georgia do not pull together in this very affair and in a sense one neutralizes the other the long and short of the matter was that the union was a compromise that grew out of practical wants and facts and this was the strongest possible foundation for any polity men would assail it in words precisely as they believed it important and valued by the public to attain their endswe were here summoned to the breakfast  i was well laughed at the table for my ignorance the family of la grange live in the real old french style with an occasional introduction of an american dish in compliment to a guest we had obtained hints concerning one or two capital things there especially one for a very simple and excellent dish called soupe au lait and i fancied i had now made discovery the second a dish was handed to me that i found so excellent so very appropriate to breakfast that i sent it to a with a request that she would get its history from madame george lafayette who sat next her the ladies put their heads together and i soon saw that they were amused at the suggestion a then informed me that it was an american as well as a french dish and that she knew great quantities of it had been consumed in the hall at c in particular of course i protested that i had no recollection of it all this is very likely for it is a good while since you have eaten any the dish is neither more nor less than pap  two capital mistakes exist in america on the subject of france one regards its manners and the other its kitchen we believe that french deportment is superficial full of action and exaggerated this would truly be a wonder in a people who possess a better tone of manners perhaps than any other for quiet and simplicity are indispensable to high breeding the french of rank are perfect models of these excellences as to the cuisine we believe it is highseasoned nothing can be farther from the truth spices of all sorts being nearly proscribed when i went to london with the vicomte de v the first dinner was at a tavern the moment he touched the soup he sat with tears in his eyes and with his mouth open like a chicken with the pip le diable he exclaimed celleci est infernale and infernal i found it too for after seven years residence on the continent it was no easy matter for even me to eat the food or to drink the wines of england the one on account of the high seasoning and the other on account of the brandy  we left la grange about noon and struck into the great postroad as soon as possible a succession of accidents owing to the random driving of the postilions detained us several hours and it was dark before we reached the first barrière of paris we entered the town on our side of the river and drove into our own gate about eight the table was set for dinner the beds were made the gloves and toys lay scattered about à la princesse dorange and we resumed our customary mode of life precisely as if we had returned from an airing in the country instead of a journey of three months  the end
