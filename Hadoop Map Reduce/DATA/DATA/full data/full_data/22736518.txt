22736518	the rustlers of pecos county                                by zane grey                                    1914     chapter 1  vaughn steele and russ sittell   in the morning after breakfasting early i took a turn up and down the main street of sanderson made observations and got information likely to serve me at some future day and then i returned to the hotel ready for what might happen  the stagecoach was there and already full of passengers this stage did not go to linrock but i had found that another one left for that point three days a week  several cowboy broncos stood hitched to a railing and a little farther down were two buckboards with horses that took my eye these probably were the teams colonel sampson had spoken of to george wright  as i strolled up both men came out of the hotel wright saw me and making an almost imperceptible sign to sampson he walked toward me  youre the cowboy russ he asked  i nodded and looked him over by day he made as striking a figure as i had noted by night but the light was not generous to his dark face  heres your pay he said handing me some bills miss sampson wont need you out at the ranch any more  what do you mean this is the first ive heard about that  sorry kid thats it he said abruptly she just gave me the moneytold me to pay you off you neednt bother to speak with her about it  he might as well have said just as politely that my seeing her even to say goodby was undesirable  as my luck would have it the girls appeared at the moment and i went directly up to them to be greeted in a manner i was glad george wright could not help but see  in miss sampsons smile and good morning russ there was not the slightest discoverable sign that i was not to serve her indefinitely  it was as i had expectedshe knew nothing of wrights discharging me in her name  miss sampson i said in dismay what have i done why did you let me go  she looked astonished  russ i dont understand you  why did you discharge me i went on trying to look heartbroken i havent had a chance yet i wanted so much to work for youmiss sally what have i done why did she discharge me  i did not declared miss sampson her dark eyes lighting  but look hereheres my pay i went on exhibiting the money mr wright just came to mesaid you sent this moneythat you wouldnt need me out at the ranch  it was miss sally then who uttered a little exclamation miss sampson seemed scarcely to have believed what she had heard  my cousin mr wright said that  i nodded vehemently  at this juncture wright strode before me practically thrusting me aside  come girls lets walk a little before we start he said gaily ill show you sanderson  wait please miss sampson replied looking directly at him cousin george i think theres a mistakeperhaps a misunderstanding heres the cowboy ive engagedmr russ he declares you gave him moneytold him i discharged him  yes cousin i did he replied his voice rising a little there was a tinge of red in his cheek weyou dont need him out at the ranch weve any numbers of boys i just told him thatlet him down easydidnt want to bother you  certain it was that george wright had made a poor reckoning first she showed utter amaze then distinct disappointment and then she lifted her head with a kind of haughty grace she would have addressed him then had not colonel sampson come up  papa did you instruct cousin george to discharge russ she asked  i sure didnt declared the colonel with a laugh george took that upon his own hands  indeed id like my cousin to understand that im my own mistress ive been accustomed to attending to my own affairs and shall continue doing so russ im sorry youve been treated this way please in future take your orders from me  then im to go to linrock with you i asked  assuredly ride with sally and me today please  she turned away with sally and they walked toward the first buckboard  colonel sampson found a grim enjoyment in wrights discomfiture  dianes like her mother was george he said youve made a bad start with her  here wright showed manifestation of the sampson temper and i took him to be a dangerous man with unbridled passions  russ heres my own talk to you he said hard and dark leaning toward me dont go to linrock  say mr wright i blustered for all the world like a young and frightened cowboy if you threaten me ill have you put in jail  both men seemed to have received a slight shock wright hardly knew what to make of my boyish speech are you going to linrock he asked thickly  i eyed him with an entirely different glance from my other fearful one  i should smile was my reply as caustic as the most reckless cowboys and i saw him shake  colonel sampson laid a restraining hand upon wright then they both regarded me with undisguised interest i sauntered away  george your temperll do for you some day i heard the colonel say youll get in bad with the wrong man some time hello here are joe and brick  mention of these fellows engaged my attention once more  i saw two cowboys one evidently getting his name from his brickred hair they were the roistering type hard drinkers devilmaycare fellows packing guns and wearing bold frontsa kind that the rangers always called fourflushes  however as the rangers standard of nerve was high there was room left for cowboys like these to be dangerous to ordinary men  the little one was joe and directly wright spoke to him he turned to look at me and his thin mouth slanted down as he looked brick eyed me too and i saw that he was heavy not a hardriding cowboy  here right at the start were three enemies for mewright and his cowboys but it did not matter under any circumstances there would have been friction between such men and me  i believed there might have been friction right then had not miss sampson called for me  get our baggage russ she said  i hurried to comply and when i had fetched it out wright and the cowboys had mounted their horses colonel sampson was in the one buckboard with two men i had not before observed and the girls were in the other  the driver of this one was a tall lanky towheaded youth growing like a texas weed we had not any too much room in the buckboard but that fact was not going to spoil the ride for me  we followed the leaders through the main street out into the open on to a wide hardpacked road showing years of travel it headed northwest  to our left rose the range of low bleak mountains i had noted yesterday and to our right sloped the mesquitepatched sweep of ridge and flat  the driver pushed his team to a fast trot which gait surely covered ground rapidly we were close behind colonel sampson who from his vehement gestures must have been engaged in very earnest colloquy with his companions  the girls behind me now that they were nearing the end of the journey manifested less interest in the ride and were speculating upon linrock and what it would be like occasionally i asked the driver a question and sometimes the girls did likewise but to my disappointment the ride seemed not to be the same as that of yesterday  every half mile or so we passed a ranch house and as we traveled on these ranches grew further apart until twelve or fifteen miles out of sanderson they were so widely separated that each appeared alone on the wild range  we came to a stream that ran north and i was surprised to see a goodly volume of water it evidently flowed down from the mountain far to the west  tufts of grass were well scattered over the sandy ground but it was high and thick and considering the immense area in sight there was grazing for a million head of stock  we made three stops in the forenoon one at a likely place to water the horses the second at a chuckwagon belonging to cowboys who were riding after stock and the third at a small cluster of adobe and stone houses constituting a hamlet the driver called sampson named after the colonel from that point on to linrock there were only a few ranches each one controlling great acreage  early in the afternoon from a ridgetop we sighted linrock a green path in the mass of gray for the barrens of texas it was indeed a fair sight  but i was more concerned with its remoteness from civilization than its beauty at that time in the early seventies when the vast western third of texas was a wilderness the pioneer had done wonders to settle there and establish places like linrock  as we rolled swiftly along the whole sweeping range was dotted with cattle and farther on within a few miles of town there were droves of horses that brought enthusiastic praise from miss sampson and her cousin  plenty of room here for the long rides i said waving a hand at the graygreen expanse your horses wont suffer on this range  she was delighted and her cousin for once seemed speechless  thats the ranch said the driver pointing with his whip  it needed only a glance for me to see that colonel sampsons ranch was on a scale fitting the country  the house was situated on the only elevation around linrock and it was not high nor more than a few minutes walk from the edge of town  it was a low flatroofed structure made of red adobe bricks and covered what appeared to be fully an acre of ground all was green about it except where the fenced corrals and numerous barns or sheds showed gray and red  wright and the cowboys disappeared ahead of us in the cottonwood trees colonel sampson got out of the buckboard and waited for us his face wore the best expression i had seen upon it yet there was warmth and love and something that approached sorrow or regret  his daughter was agitated too i got out and offered my seat which colonel sampson took  it was scarcely a time for me to be required or even noticed at all and i took advantage of it and turned toward the town  ten minutes of leisurely walking brought me to the shady outskirts of linrock and i entered the town with mingled feelings of curiosity eagerness and expectation  the street i walked down was not a main one there were small red houses among oaks and cottonwoods  i went clear through to the other side probably more than half a mile i crossed a number of intersecting streets met children nicelooking women and more than one dustybooted man  halfway back this street i turned at right angles and walked up several blocks till i came to a treebordered plaza on the far side opened a broad street which for all its horses and people had a sleepy look  i walked on alert trying to take in everything wondering if i would meet steele wondering how i would know him if we did meet but i believed i could have picked that ranger out of a thousand strangers though i had never seen him  presently the residences gave place to buildings fronting right upon the stone sidewalk i passed a grain store a hardware store a grocery store then several unoccupied buildings and a vacant corner  the next block aside from the rough fronts of the crude structures would have done credit to a small town even in eastern texas here was evidence of business consistent with any prosperous community of two thousand inhabitants  the next block on both sides of the street was a solid row of saloons resorts hotels saddled horses stood hitched all along the sidewalk in two long lines with a buckboard and team here and there breaking the continuity this block was busy and noisy  from all outside appearances linrock was no different from other frontier towns and my expectations were scarcely realized  as the afternoon was waning i retraced my steps and returned to the ranch the driver boy whom i had heard called dick was looking for me evidently at miss sampsons order and he led me up to the house  it was even bigger than i had conceived from a distance and so old that the adobe bricks were worn smooth by rain and wind i had a glimpse in at several doors as we passed by  there was comfort here that spoke eloquently of many a freighters trip from del rio for the sake of the young ladies i was glad to see things little short of luxurious for that part of the country  at the far end of the house dick conducted me to a little room very satisfactory indeed to me i asked about bunkhouses for the cowboys and he said they were full to overflowing  colonel sampson has a big outfit eh  reckon he has replied dick don know how many cowboys theyre always comin an goin i aint acquainted with half of them  much movement of stock these days  stocks always movin he replied with a queer look  rustlers  but he did not follow up that look with the affirmative i expected  lively place i hearlinrock is  aint so lively as sanderson but its bigger  yes i heard it was fellow down there was talking about two cowboys who were arrested  sure i heerd all about thet joe bean an brick higginsthey belong heah but they aint heah much  i did not want dick to think me overinquisitive so i turned the talk into other channels it appeared that miss sampson had not left any instructions for me so i was glad to go with dick to supper which we had in the kitchen  dick informed me that the cowboys prepared their own meals down at the bunks and as i had been given a room at the ranchhouse he supposed i would get my meals there too  after supper i walked all over the grounds had a look at the horses in the corrals and came to the conclusion that it would be strange if miss sampson did not love her new home and if her cousin did not enjoy her sojourn there from a distance i saw the girls approaching with wright and not wishing to meet them i sheered off  when the sun had set i went down to the town with the intention of finding steele  this task considering i dared not make inquiries and must approach him secretly might turn out to be anything but easy  while it was still light i strolled up and down the main street when darkness set in i went into a hotel bought cigars sat around and watched without any clue  then i went into the next place this was of a rough crude exterior but the inside was comparatively pretentious and ablaze with lights  it was full of men coming and goinga dustybooted crowd that smelled of horses and smoke  i sat down for a while with wide eyes and open ears then i hunted up a saloon where most of the guests had been or were going i found a great square room lighted by six huge lamps a bar at one side and all the floor space taken up by tables and chairs  this must have been the gambling resort mentioned in the rangers letter to captain neal and the one rumored to be owned by the mayor of linrock this was the only gambling place of any size in southern texas in which i had noted the absence of mexicans there was some card playing going on at this moment  i stayed in there for a while and knew that strangers were too common in linrock to be conspicuous but i saw no man whom i could have taken for steele  then i went out  it had often been a boast of mine that i could not spend an hour in a strange town or walk a block along a dark street without having something happen out of the ordinary  mine was an experiencing nature some people called this luck but it was my private opinion that things gravitated my way because i looked and listened for them  however upon the occasion of my first day and evening in linrock it appeared despite my vigilance and inquisitiveness that here was to be an exception  this thought came to me just before i reached the last lighted place in the block a little dingy restaurant out of which at the moment a tall dark form passed it disappeared in the gloom i saw a man sitting on the low steps and another standing in the door  that was the fellow the whole towns talkin aboutthe ranger said one man  like a shot i halted in the shadow where i had not been seen  sho aint boardin heah is he said the other  yes  reckon hell hurt your business jim  the fellow called jim emitted a mirthless laugh wal hes been all my business these days an hes offered to rent that old dobe of mine just out of town you know where i lived before movin in heah hes goin to look at it tomorrow  lord does he expect to stay  say so an if he aint a stayer i never seen none nice quiet easy chap but he just looks deep  aw jim he cant hang out heah hes after some feller thats all  i dont know his game but he says he was heah for a while an he impressed me some just now he says where does sampson live i asked him if he was goin to make a call on our mayor an he says yes then i told him how to go out to the ranch he went out headed that way  the hell he did  i gathered from this fellows exclamation that he was divided between amaze and mirth then he got up from the steps and went into the restaurant and was followed by the man called jim before the door was closed he made another remark but it was unintelligible to me  as i passed on i decided i would scrape acquaintance with this restaurant keeper  the thing of most moment was that i had gotten track of steele i hurried ahead while i had been listening back there moments had elapsed and evidently he had walked swiftly  i came to the plaza crossed it and then did not know which direction to take concluding that it did not matter i hurried on in an endeavor to reach the ranch before steele although i was not sure i believed i had succeeded  the moon shone brightly i heard a banjo in the distance and a cowboy sing there was not a person in sight in the wide courts or on the porch i did not have a welldefined idea about the inside of the house  peeping in at the first lighted window i saw a large room miss sampson and sally were there alone evidently this was a parlor or a sitting room and it had clean white walls a blanketed floor an open fireplace with a cheery blazing log and a large table upon which were lamp books papers backing away i saw that this corner room had a door opening on the porch and two other windows  i listened hoping to hear steeles footsteps coming up the road but i heard only sallys laugh and her cousins mellow voice  then i saw lighted windows down at the other end of the front part of the house i walked down a door stood open and through it i saw a room identical with that at the other corner and here were colonel sampson wright and several other men all smoking and talking  it might have been interesting to tarry there within earshot but i wanted to get back to the road to intercept steele scarcely had i retraced my steps and seated myself on the porch steps when a very tall dark figure loomed up in the moonlit road  steele i wanted to yell like a boy he came on slowly looking all around halted some twenty paces distant surveyed the house then evidently espying me came on again  my first feeling was what a giant but his face was hidden in the shadow of a sombrero  i had intended of course upon first sight to blurt out my identity yet i did not he affected me strangely or perhaps it was my emotion at the thought that we rangers with so much in common and at stake had come together  is sampson at home he asked abruptly  i said yes  ask him if hell see vaughn steele ranger  wait here i replied i did not want to take up any time then explaining my presence there  deliberately and noisily i strode down the porch and entered the room with the smoking men  i went in farther than was necessary for me to state my errand but i wanted to see sampsons face to see into his eyes  as i entered the talking ceased i saw no face except his and that seemed blank  vaughn steele rangercome to see you sir i announced  did sampson startdid his eyes show a fleeting glintdid his face almost imperceptibly blanch i could not have sworn to either but there was a change maybe from surprise  the first sure effect of my announcement came in a quick exclamation from wright a sibilant intake of breath that did not seem to denote surprise so much as certainty wright might have emitted a curse with less force  sampson moved his hand significantly and the action was a voiceless command for silence as well as an assertion that he would attend to this matter i read him clearly so far he had authority and again i felt his power  steele to see me did he state his business  no sir i replied  russ say im not at home said sampson presently bending over to relight his pipe  i went out someone slammed the door behind me  as i strode back across the porch my mind worked swiftly the machinery had been idle for a while and was now started  mr steele i said colonel sampson says hes not at home tell your business to his daughter  without waiting to see the effect of my taking so much upon myself i knocked upon the parlor door miss sampson opened it she wore white looking at her i thought it would be strange if steeles wellknown indifference to women did not suffer an eclipse  miss sampson here is vaughn steele to see you i said  wont you come in she said graciously  steele had to bend his head to enter the door i went in with him an intrusion perhaps that in the interest of the moment she appeared not to notice  steele seemed to fill the room with his giant form his face was fine stern clear cut with blue or gray eyes strangely penetrating he was coatless vestless he wore a gray flannel shirt corduroys a big gun swinging low and top boots reaching to his knees  he was the most stalwart son of texas i had seen in many a day but neither his great stature nor his striking face accounted for something i felta something spiritual vital compelling that drew me  mr steele im pleased to meet you said miss sampson this is my cousin sally langdon we just arrivedi to make this my home she to visit me  steele smiled as he bowed to sally he was easy with a kind of rude grace and showed no sign of embarrassment or that beautiful girls were unusual to him  mr steele weve heard of you in austin said sally with her eyes misbehaving  i hoped i would not have to be jealous of steele but this girl was a little minx if not altogether a flirt  i did not expect to be received by ladies replied steele i called upon mr sampson he would not see me i was to tell my business to his daughter im glad to know you miss sampson and your cousin but sorry youve come to linrock now  why queried both girls in unison  because itsoh pretty roughno place for girls to walk and ride  ah i see and your business has to do with rough places said miss sampson strange that papa would not see you stranger that he should want me to hear your business either hes joking or wants to impress me  papa tried to persuade me not to come he tried to frighten me with tales of thisthis roughness out here he knows im in earnest how id like to help somehow do some little good pray tell me this business  i wished to get your fathers cooperation in my work  your work you mean your ranger dutythe arresting of rough characters  that yes but thats only a detail linrock is bad internally my job is to make it good  a splendid and worthy task replied miss sampson warmly i wish you success but mr steele arent you exaggerating linrocks wickedness  no he answered forcibly  indeed and papa refused to see youpresumably refused to cooperate with you she asked thoughtfully  i take it that way  mr steele pray tell me what is the matter with linrock and just what the work is youre called upon to do she asked seriously i heard papa say that he was the law in linrock perhaps he resents interference i know hell not tolerate any opposition to his will please tell me i may be able to influence him  i listened to steeles deep voice as he talked about linrock what he said was old to me and i gave heed only to its effect  miss sampsons expression which at first had been earnest and grave turned into one of incredulous amaze she and sally too watched steeles face in fascinated attention  when it came to telling what he wanted to do the ranger warmed to his subject he talked beautifully convincingly with a certain strange persuasive power that betrayed how he worked his way and his fine face losing its stern hard lines seemed to glow and give forth a spirit austere yet noble almost gentle assuredly something vastly different from what might have been expected in the expression of a gunfighting ranger i sensed that miss sampson felt this just as i did  papa said you were a hounder of outlawsa man whod rather kill than save she exclaimed  the old stern cast returned to steeles face it was as if he had suddenly remembered himself  my name is infamous i am sorry to say he replied  you have killed men she asked her dark eyes dilating  had any one ever dared ask steele that before his face became a mask it told truth to me but she could not see and he did not answer  oh you are above that dontdont kill any one here  miss sampson i hope i wont his voice seemed to check her i had been right in my estimate of her characteryoung untried but all pride fire passion she was white then and certainly beautiful  steele watched her could scarcely have failed to see the white gleam of her beauty and all that evidence of a quick and noble heart  pardon me please mr steele she said recovering her composure i amjust a little overexcited i didnt mean to be inquisitive thank you for your confidence ive enjoyed your call though your news did distress me you may rely upon me to talk to papa  that appeared to be a dismissal and bowing to her and sally the ranger went out i followed not having spoken  at the end of the porch i caught up with steele and walked out into the moonlight beside him  just why i did not now reveal my identity i could not say for certainly i was bursting with the desire to surprise him to earn his approval he loomed dark above me appearing not to be aware of my presence what a cold strange proposition this ranger was  still remembering the earnestness of his talk to miss sampson i could not think him cold but i must have thought him so to any attraction of those charming girls  suddenly as we passed under the shade of cottonwoods he clamped a big hand down on my shoulder  my god russ isnt she lovely he ejaculated  in spite of my being dumbfounded i had to hug him he knew me  thought you didnt swear i gasped  ridiculously those were my first words to vaughn steele  my boy i saw you parading up and down the street looking for me he said i intended to help you find me tomorrow  we gripped hands and that strong feel and clasp meant much  yes shes lovely steele i said but did you look at the cousin the little girl with the eyes  then we laughed and loosed hands  come on lets get out somewhere ive a million things to tell you  we went away out into the open where some stones gleamed white in the moonlight and there sitting in the sand our backs against a rest and with all quiet about us we settled down for a long conference  i began with neals urgent message to me then told of my going to the capitolwhat i had overheard when governor smith was in the adjutants office of my interview with them of the spying on colonel sampson neals directions advice and command the ride toward san antonio my being engaged as cowboy by miss sampson of the further ride on to sanderson and the incident there and finally how i had approached sampson and then had thought it well to get his daughter into the scheme of things  it was a long talk even for me and my voice sounded husky  i told neal id be lucky to get you said steele after a silence  that was the only comment on my actions the only praise but the quiet way he spoke it made me feel like a boy undeserving of so much  here i forgot the money neal sent i went on glad to be rid of the huge roll of bills  the ranger showed surprise besides he was very glad  the captain loves the service said steele he alone knows the worth of the rangers and the work hes given his life tothe good that service really doesall depends on you and me russ  i assented gloomily enough then i waited while he pondered  the moon soared clear there was a cool wind rustling the greasewood a dog bayed a barking coyote lights twinkled down in the town  i looked back up at the dark hill and thought of sally langdon getting here to linrock meeting steele had not changed my feelings toward her only somehow they had removed me far off in thought out of possible touch it seemed  well son listen began steele his calling me that was a joke yet i did not feel it youve made a better start than i could have figured neal said you were lucky perhaps but youve got brains  now heres your cue for the present work for miss sampson do your best for her as long as you last i dont suppose youll last long you have got to get in with this gang in town be a flash cowboy you dont need to get drunk but youre to pretend it  gamble be a good fellow hang round the barrooms i dont care how you play the part so long as you make friends learn the ropes we can meet out here at nights to talk and plan  youre to take sides with those whore against me ill furnish you with the money youd better appear to be a winning gambler even if youre not hows this plan strike you  greatexcept for one thing i replied i hate to lie to miss sampson shes true blue steele  son you havent got soft on her  not a bit maybe im soft on the little cousin but i just like miss sampsonthink shes finecould look up to her and i hate to be different from what she thinks  i understand russ he replied in his deep voice that had such quality to influence a man its no decent job youll be ashamed before her so would i but heres our work the hardest ever cut out for rangers think what depends upon it and  theres something wrong with miss sampsons father i interrupted  something strange if not wrong no man in this community is beyond us russ or above suspicion youve a great opportunity i neednt say use your eyes and ears as never before  i hope sampson turns out to be on the square i replied he might be a lax mayor too goodnatured to uphold law in a wild country and his southern pride would fire at interference i dont like him but for his daughters sake i hope were wrong  steeles eyes deep and gleaming in the moonlight searched my face  son sure youre not in love with heryoull not fall in love with her  no i am positive why  because in either case id likely have need of a new man in your place he said  steele you know something about sampsonsomething more i exclaimed swiftly  no more than you when i meet him face to face i may know more russ when a fellow has been years at this game he has a sixth sense mine seldom fails me i never yet faced the criminal who didnt somehow betray fearnot so much fear of me but fear of himselfhis life his deeds thats conscience or if not just realization of fate  had that been the thing i imagined i had seen in sampsons face  im sorry diane sampson came out here i said impulsively  steele did not say he shared that feeling he was looking out upon the moonblanched level  some subtle thing in his face made me divine that he was thinking of the beautiful girl to whom he might bring disgrace and unhappiness     chapter 2  a kiss and an arrest   a month had passed a swiftflying time full of new life wonderful it was for me to think i was still in diane sampsons employ  it was the early morning hour of a day in may the sun had not yet grown hot dew like diamond drops sparkled on the leaves and grass the gentle breeze was clear sweet with the song of larks upon it  and the range a sea of graygreen growing greener swept away westward in rolling ridges and hollows like waves to meet the dark low hills that notched the horizon line of blue  i was sitting on the top bar of the corral fence and before me stood three saddled horses that would have gladdened any eye i was waiting to take the young ladies on their usual morning ride  once upon a time in what seemed the distant past to this eventful month i had flattered myself there had been occasions for thought but scornfully i soliloquized that in those days i had no cue for thought such as i had now  this was one of the moments when my real self seemed to stand off and skeptically regard the fictitious cowboy  this gentleman of the range wore a huge sombrero with an ornamented silver band a silken scarf of red a black velvet shirt much affected by the indians an embroidered buckskin vest corduroys and fringed chaps with silver buttons a big blue gun swinging low high heeled boots and long spurs with silver rowels  a flash cowboy steele vowed i was a born actor  but i never divulged the fact that had it not been for my infatuation for sally i never could have carried on that part not to save the ranger service or the whole state of texas  the hardest part had not been the establishing of a reputation the scorn of cowboys the ridicule of gamblers the badinage of the young bucks of the settlementthese i had soon made dangerous procedures for any one i was quick with tongue and fist and gun  there had been fights and respect was quickly earned though the constant advent of strangers in linrock always had me in hot water  moreover instead of being difficult it was fun to spend all the time i could in the hotels and resorts shamming a weakness for drink gambling lounging making friends among the rough set when all the time i was a cool keen registering machine  the hard thing was the lie i lived in the eyes of diane sampson and sally langdon  i had indeed won the sincere regard of my employer her father her cousin george and newmade friends in town had come to her with tales of my reckless doings and had urged my dismissal  but she kept me and all the time pleaded like a sister to have me mend my vicious ways she believed what she was told about me but had faith in me despite that  as for sally i had fallen hopelessly in love with her by turns sally was indifferent to me cold friendly like a comrade and dangerously sweet  somehow she saw through me knew i was not just what i pretended to be but she never breathed her conviction she championed me i wanted to tell her the truth about myself because i believed the doubt of me alone stood in the way of my winning her  still that might have been my vanity she had never said she cared for me although she had looked it  this tangle of my personal life however had not in the least affected my loyalty and duty to vaughn steele day by day i had grown more attached to him keener in the interest of our work  it had been a busy montha month of foundation building my vigilance and my stealthy efforts had not been rewarded by anything calculated to strengthen our suspicions of sampson but then he had been absent from the home very often and was difficult to watch when he was there  george wright came and went too presumably upon stock business i could not yet see that he was anything but an honest rancher deeply involved with sampson and other men in stock deals nevertheless as a man he had earned my contempt  he was a hard drinker cruel to horses a gambler not above stacking the cards a quicktempered passionate southerner  he had fallen in love with diane sampson was like her shadow when at home he hated me he treated me as if i were the scum of the earth if he had to address me for something which was seldom he did it harshly like ordering a dog whenever i saw his sinister handsome face with its dark eyes always half shut my hand itched for my gun and i would go my way with something thick and hot inside my breast  in my talks with steele we spent time studying george wrights character and actions he was sampsons partner and at the head of a small group of linrock ranchers who were rich in cattle and property if not in money  steele and i had seen fit to wait before we made any thorough investigation into their business methods ours was a waiting game anyway  right at the start linrock had apparently arisen in resentment at the presence of vaughn steele but it was my opinion that there were men in linrock secretly glad of the rangers presence  what he intended to do was food for great speculation his fame of course had preceded him a company of militia could not have had the effect upon the wild element of linrock that steeles presence had  a thousand stories went from lip to lip most of which were false he was lightning swift on the draw it was death to face him he had killed thirty menwildest rumor of all  he had the gun skill of buck duane the craft of cheseldine the deviltry of king fisher the most notorious of texas desperadoes his nerve his lack of fearthose made him stand out alone even among a horde of bold men  at first there had not only been great conjecture among the vicious element with which i had begun to affiliate myself but also a very decided checking of all kinds of action calculated to be conspicuous to a keen eyed ranger  steele did not hide but during these opening days of his stay in linrock he was not often seen in town at the tables at the bars and lounging places remarks went the rounds  whos thet ranger after whatll he do fust off is he waitin fer somebody whos goin to draw on him fustan go to hell jest about how soon will he be found somewhere full of lead  those whom it was my interest to cultivate grew more curious more speculative and impatient as time went by when it leaked out somewhere that steele was openly cultivating the honest stayathome citizens to array them in time against the other element then linrock showed its wolf teeth hinted of in the letters to captain neal  several times steele was shot at in the dark and once slightly injured rumor had it that jack blome the gunman of those parts was coming in to meet steele part of linrock awakened and another part much smaller became quieter more secluded  strangers upon whom we could get no line mysteriously came and went the drinking gambling fighting in the resorts seemed to gather renewed life abundance of money floated in circulation  and rumors vague and unfounded crept in from sanderson and other points rumors of a gang of rustlers off here a holdup of the stage off here robbery of a rancher at this distant point and murder done at another  this was texas and new mexico life in these frontier days but strangely neither steele nor i had yet been able to associate any rumor or act with a possible gang of rustlers in linrock  nevertheless we had not been discouraged after three weeks of waiting we had become alive to activity around us and though it was unseen we believed we would soon be on its track  my task was the busier and the easier steele had to have a care for his life i never failed to caution him of this  my long reflection on the months happenings and possibilities was brought to an end by the disappearance of miss sampson and sally  my employer looked worried sally was in a regular cowgirl riding costume in which her trim shapely figure showed at its best and her face was saucy sparkling daring  good morning russ said miss sampson and she gazed searchingly at me i had dropped off the fence sombrero in hand i knew i was in for a lecture and i put on a brazen innocent air  did you break your promise to me she asked reproachfully  which one i asked it was sallys bright eyes upon me rather than miss sampsons reproach that bothered me  about getting drunk again she said  i didnt break that one  my cousin george saw you in the hope so gambling place last night drunk staggering mixing with that riffraff on the verge of a brawl  miss sampson with all due respect to mr wright i want to say that he has a strange wish to lower me in the eyes of you ladies i protested with a fine show of spirit  russ were you drunk she demanded  no i should think you neednt ask me that didnt you ever see a man the morning after a carouse  evidently she had and there i knew i stood fresh cleanshaven cleareyed as the morning  sallys saucy face grew thoughtful too the only thing she had ever asked of me was not to drink the habit had gone hard with the sampson family  russ you look just asas nice as id want you to miss sampson replied i dont know what to think they tell me things you deny whom shall i believe george swore he saw you  miss sampson did i ever lie to you  not to my knowledge  then i looked at her and she understood what i meant  george has lied to me that day at sanderson and since too i fear do you say he lies  miss sampson i would not call your cousin a liar  here sally edged closer with the bridle rein of her horse over her arm  russ cousin george isnt the only one who saw you burt waters told me the same said sally nervously i believed she hoped i was telling the truth  waters so he runs me down behind my back all right i wont say a word about him but do you believe i was drunk when i say no  im afraid i do russ she replied in reluctance was she testing me  see here miss sampson i burst out why dont you discharge me please let me go im not claiming much for myself but you dont believe even that im pretty bad i never denied the scraps the gamblingall that but i did do as miss sally asked mei did keep my promise to you now discharge me then ill be free to call on mr burt waters  miss sampson looked alarmed and sally turned pale to my extreme joy  those girls believed i was a desperate devil of a cowboy who had been held back from spilling blood solely through their kind relation to me  oh no exclaimed sally diane dont let him go  russ pray dont get angry replied miss sampson and she put a soft hand on me that thrilled me while it made me feel like a villain i wont discharge you i need you sally needs you after all its none of my business what you do away from here but i hoped i would be so happy toto reclaim you fromdidnt you ever have a sister russ  i kept silent for fear that i would perjure myself anew yet the situation was delicious and suddenly i conceived a wild idea  miss sampson i began haltingly but with brave front ive been wild in the past but ive been tolerably straight here trying to please you lately i have been going to the bad again not drunk but leaning that way lord knows what ill do soon ifif my trouble isnt cured  russ what trouble  you know whats the matter with me i went on hurriedly anybody could see that  sally turned a flaming scarlet miss sampson made it easier for me by reason of her quick glance of divination  ive fallen in love with miss sally im crazy about her here ive got to see these fellows flirting with her and its killing me ive  if you are crazy about me you dont have to tell cried sally red and white by turns  i want to stop your flirting one way or another ive been in earnest i wasnt flirting i begged you toto  you never did interrupted sally furiously that hint had been a spark  i couldnt have dreamed it i protested in a passion to be earnest yet tingling with the fun of it that day when ididnt i ask  if my memory serves me correctly you didnt ask anything she replied with anger and scorn now struggling with mirth  but sally i meant to you understood me say you didnt believe i could take that liberty without honorable intentions  that was too much for sally she jumped at her horse made the quickest kind of a mount and was off like a flash  stop me if you can she called back over her shoulder her face alight and saucy  russ go after her said miss sampson in that mood shell ride to sanderson my dear fellow dont stare so i understand many things now sally is a flirt she would drive any man mad russ ive grown in a short time to like you if youll be a mangive up drinking and gamblingmaybe youll have a chance with her hurry nowgo after her  i mounted and spurred my horse after sallys she was down on the level now out in the open and giving her mount his head even had i wanted to overhaul her at once the matter would have been difficult well nigh impossible under five miles  sally had as fast a horse as there was on the range she made no weight in the saddle and she could ride from time to time she looked back over her shoulder  i gained enough to make her think i was trying to catch her sally loved a horse she loved a race she loved to win  my good fortune had given me more than one ride alone with sally miss sampson enjoyed riding too but she was not a madcap and when she accompanied us there was never any race  when sally got out alone with me she made me ride to keep her from disappearing somewhere on the horizon this morning i wanted her to enjoy to the fullest her utter freedom and to feel that for once i could not catch her  perhaps my declaration to miss sampson had liberated my strongest emotions  however that might be the fact was that no ride before had ever been like this oneno sky so blue no scene so open free and enchanting as that beautiful graygreen range no wind so sweet the breeze that rushed at me might have been laden with the perfume of sally langdons hair  i sailed along on what seemed a strange ride grazing horses pranced and whistled as i went by jackrabbits bounded away to hide in the longer clumps of grass a prowling wolf trotted from his covert near a herd of cattle  far to the west rose the low dark lines of bleak mountains they were always mysterious to me as if holding a secret i needed to know  it was a strange ride because in the back of my head worked a haunting consciousness of the deadly nature of my business there on the frontier a business in such contrast with this dreaming and dallying this longing for what surely was futile  any moment i might be stripped of my disguise any moment i might have to be the ranger  sally kept the lead across the wide plain and mounted to the top of a ridge where tired out and satisfied with her victory she awaited me i was in no hurry to reach the summit of the long slowsloping ridge and i let my horse walk  just how would sally langdon meet me now after my regretted exhibition before her cousin there was no use to conjecture but i was not hopeful  when i got there to find her in her sweetest mood with some little difference never before noteda touch of shynessi concealed my surprise  russ i gave you a run that time she said ten miles and you never caught me  but look at the start you had ive had my troubles beating you with an even break  sally was susceptible to flattery in regard to her riding a fact that i made subtle use of  but in a long race i was afraid youd beat me russ ive learned to ride out here back home i never had room to ride a horse just look miles and miles of level of green little hills with black bunches of trees not a soul in sight even the town hidden in the green all wild and lonely isnt it glorious russ  lately its been getting to me i replied soberly  we both gazed out over the sea of graygreen at the undulating waves of ground in the distance on these rides with her i had learned to appreciate the beauty of the lonely reaches of plain  but when i could look at her i seldom wasted time on scenery looking at her now i tried to get again that impression of a difference in her it eluded me  just now with the rose in her brown cheeks her hair flying her eyes with grave instead of mocking light she seemed only prettier than usual i got down ostensibly to tighten the saddle girths on her horse but i lingered over the task  presently when she looked down at me i received that subtle impression of change and read it as her soft mood of dangerous sweetness that came so seldom mingled with something deeper more of character and womanliness than i had ever sensed in her  russ it wasnt nice to tell diane that she said  nice it wasoh id like to swear i ejaculated but now i understand my miserable feeling i was jealous sally im sorry i apologize  she had drawn off her gloves and one little hand brown shapely rested upon her knee very near to me i took it in mine she let it stay though she looked away from me the color rich in her cheeks  i can forgive that she murmured but the lie jealousy doesnt excuse a lie  you meanwhat i intimated to your cousin i said trying to make her look at me that was the devil in me only its true  how can it be true when you never askedsaid a wordyou hinted of she queried diane believed what you said i know she thinks me horrid  no she doesnt as for what i said or meant to say which is the same thing howd you take my actions i hope not the same as you take wrights or the other fellows  sally was silent a little pale now and i saw that i did not need to say any more about the other fellows the change the difference was now marked it drove me to give in wholly to this earnest and passionate side of myself  sally i do love you i dont know how you took my actions anyway now ill make them plain i was beside myself with love and jealousy will you marry me  she did not answer but the old willful sally was not in evidence watching her face i gave her a slow and gentle pull one she could easily resist if she cared to and she slipped from her saddle into my arms  then there was one wildly sweet moment in which i had the blissful certainty that she kissed me of her own accord she was abashed yet yielding she let herself go yet seemed not utterly unstrung perhaps i was rough held her too hard for she cried out a little  russ let me go help meback  i righted her in the saddle although not entirely releasing her  but sally you havent told me anything i remonstrated tenderly do you love me  i think so she whispered  sally will you marry me  she disengaged herself then sat erect and faced away from me with her breast heaving  no russ she presently said once more calm  but sallyif you love me i burst out and then stopped stilled by something in her face  i cant helploving you russ she said but to promise to marry you thats different why russ i know nothing about you not even your last name youre not aa steady fellow you drink gamble fight youll kill somebody yet then ill not love you besides ive always felt youre not just what you seemed i cant trust you theres something wrong about you  i knew my face darkened and perhaps hope and happiness died in it swiftly she placed a kind hand on my shoulder  now ive hurt you oh im sorry your asking me makes such a difference they are not in earnest but russ i had to tell you why i couldnt be engaged to you  im not good enough for you id no right to ask you to marry me i replied abjectly  russ dont think me proud she faltered i wouldnt care who you were if i could onlyonly respect you some things about you are splendid youre such a man thats why i cared but you gamble you drinkand i hate that youre dangerous they say and id be i am in constant dread youll kill somebody remember russ im no texan  this regret of sallys this faltering distress at giving me pain was such sweet assurance that she did love me better than she knew that i was divided between extremes of emotion  will you wait will you trust me a little will you give me a chance after all maybe im not so bad as i seem  oh if you werent russ are you asking me to trust you  i beg you todearest trust me and wait  wait what for are you really on the square russ or are you what george calls youa drunken cowboy a gambler sharp with the cards a gunfighter  my face grew cold as i felt the blood leave it at that moment mention of george wright fixed once for all my hate of him  bitter indeed was it that i dared not give him the lie but what could i do the character wright gave me was scarcely worse than what i had chosen to represent i had to acknowledge the justice of his claim but nevertheless i hated him  sally i ask you to trust me in spite of my reputation  you ask me a great deal she replied  yes its too much let it be then only thisyoull wait and while you wait promise not to flirt with wright and waters  russ ill not let george or any of them so much as dare touch me she declared in girlish earnestness her voice rising ill promise if youll promise me not to go into those saloons any more  one word would have brought her into my arms for good and all the better side of sally langdon showed then in her appeal that appeal was as strong as the drawing power of her little face all eloquent with its light and eyes dark with tears and lips wanting to smile  my response should have been instant how i yearned to give it and win the reward i imagined i saw on her tremulous lips but i was bound the grim dark nature of my enterprise there in linrock returned to stultify my eagerness dispel my illusion shatter my dream  for one instant it flashed through my mind to tell sally who i was what my errand was after the truth but the secret was not mine to tell and i kept my pledges  the hopeful glow left sallys face her disappointment seemed keen then a little scorn of certainty was the bitterest of all for me to bear  thats too much to promise all at once i protested lamely and i knew i would have done better to keep silence  russ a promise like that is nothingif a man loves a girl she retorted dont make any more love to me please unless you want me to laugh at you and dont feel such terrible trouble if you happen to see me flirting occasionally  she ended with a little mocking laugh that was the perverse side of her the cat using her claws i tried not to be angry but failed  all right ill take my medicine i replied bitterly ill certainly never make love to you again and ill stand it if i happen to see waters kiss you or any other decent fellow but look out how you let that damned backbiter wright fool around you  i spoke to her as i had never spoken before in quick fierce meaning with eyes holding hers  she paled but even my scarceveiled hint did not chill her anger tossing her head she wheeled and rode away  i followed at a little distance and thus we traveled the ten miles back to the ranch when we reached the corrals she dismounted and turning her horse over to dick she went off toward the house without so much as a nod or goodby to me  i went down to town for once in a mood to live up to what had been heretofore only a sham character  but turning a corner into the main street i instantly forgot myself at the sight of a crowd congregated before the town hall there was a babel of voices and an air of excitement that i immediately associated with sampson who as mayor of linrock once in a month of moons held court in this hall  it took slipping and elbowing to get through the crowd once inside the door i saw that the crowd was mostly outside and evidently not so desirous as i was to enter  the first man i saw was steele looming up the next was sampson chewing his mustachethe third wright whose dark and sinister face told much something was up in linrock steele had opened the hall  there were other men in the hall a dozen or more and all seemed shouting excitedly in unison with the crowd outside i did not try to hear what was said i edged closer in among the men to the front  sampson sat at a table up on a platform near him sat a thickset grizzled man with deep eyes and this was hanford owens county judge  to the right stood a tall angular yellowfaced fellow with a drooping sandy mustache conspicuous on his vest was a huge silver shield this was gorsech one of sampsons sheriffs  there were four other men whom i knew several whose faces were familiar and half a dozen strangers all dusty horsemen  steele stood apart from them a little to one side so that he faced them all his hair was disheveled and his shirt open at the neck he looked cool and hard  when i caught his eye i realized in an instant that the long deferred action the beginning of our real fight was at hand  sampson pounded hard on the table to be heard mayor or not he was unable at once to quell the excitement  gradually however it subsided and from the last few utterances before quiet was restored i gathered that steele had intruded upon some kind of a meeting in the hall  steele whatd you break in here for demanded sampson  isnt this court arent you the mayor of linrock interrogated steele his voice was so clear and loud almost piercing that i saw at once that he wanted all those outside to hear  yes replied sampson like flint he seemed yet i felt his intense interest  i had no doubt then that steele intended to make him stand out before this crowd as the real mayor of linrock or as a man whose office was a sham  ive arrested a criminal said steele bud snell i charge him with assault on jim hoden and attempted robberyif not murder snell had a shady past here as the court will know if it keeps a record  then i saw snell hunching down on a bench a nerveless and shaken man if there ever was one he had been a hangeron round the gambling dens the kind of sneak i never turned my back to  jim hoden the restaurant keeper was present also and on second glance i saw that he was pale there was blood on his face i knew jim liked him had tried to make a friend of him  i was not dead to the stinging interrogation in the concluding sentence of steeles speech then i felt sure i had correctly judged steeles motive i began to warm to the situation  whats this i hear about you bud get up and speak for yourself said sampson gruffly  snell got up not without a furtive glance at steele and he had shuffled forward a few steps toward the mayor he had an evil front but not the boldness even of a rustler  it aint so sampson he began loudly i went in hodens place fer grub some feller i never seen before come in from the hall an hit him an wrastled him on the floor then this big ranger grabbed me an fetched me here i didnt do nothin this rangers hankerin to arrest somebody thets my hunch sampson  what have you to say about this hoden sharply queried sampson i call to your mind the fact that you once testified falsely in court and got punished for it  why did my sharpened and experienced wits interpret a hint of threat or menace in sampsons reminder hoden rose from the bench and with an unsteady hand reached down to support himself  he was no longer young and he seemed broken in health and spirit he had been hurt somewhat about the head  i havent much to say he replied the ranger dragged me here i told him i didnt take my troubles to court besides i cant swear it was snell who hit me  sampson said something in an undertone to judge owens and that worthy nodded his great bushy head  bud youre discharged said sampson bluntly now the rest of you clear out of here  he absolutely ignored the ranger that was his rebuff to steeles advances his slap in the face to an interfering ranger service  if sampson was crooked he certainly had magnificent nerve i almost decided he was above suspicion but his nonchalance his air of finality his authoritative assurancethese to my keen and practiced eyes were in significant contrast to a certain tenseness of line about his mouth and a slow paling of his olive skin  he had crossed the path of vaughn steele he had blocked the way of this texas ranger if he had intelligence and remembered steeles fame which surely he had then he had some appreciation of what he had undertaken  in that momentary lull my scrutiny of sampson gathered an impression of the mans intense curiosity  then bud snell with a cough that broke the silence shuffled a couple of steps toward the door  hold on called steele  it was a buglecall it halted snell as if it had been a bullet he seemed to shrink  sampson i saw snell attack hoden said steele his voice still ringing what has the court to say to that  the moment for open rupture between ranger service and sampsons idea of law was at hand sampson showed not the slightest hesitation  the court has to say this west of the pecos well not aid or abet or accept any ranger service steele we dont want you out here linrock doesnt need you  thats a lie sampson retorted steele ive a pocket full of letters from linrock citizens all begging for ranger service  sampson turned white the veins corded at his temples he appeared about to burst into rage he was at a loss for a quick reply  steele shook a long arm at the mayor  i need your help you refuse now ill work alone this man snell goes to del rio in irons  george wright rushed up to the table the blood showed black and thick in his face his utterance was incoherent his uncontrollable outbreak of temper seemed out of all proportion to any cause he should reasonably have had for anger  sampson shoved him back with a curse and warning glare  wheres your warrant to arrest snell shouted sampson i wont give you one you cant take him without a warrant  i dont need warrants to make arrests sampson youre ignorant of the power of texas rangers  youll take snell without papers bellowed sampson  he goes to del rio to jail answered steele  he wont youll pull none of your damned ranger stunts out here ill block you steele  that passionate reply of sampsons appeared to be the signal steele had been waiting for  he had helped on the crisis i believed i saw how he wanted to force sampsons hand and show the town his stand  steele backed clear of everybody and like two swift flashes of light his guns leaped forth he was transformed my wish was fulfilled  here was steele the ranger in one of his lone lion stands not exactly alone either for my hands itched for my guns  men i call on you all cried steele piercingly i call on you to witness the arrest of a criminal opposed by sampson mayor of linrock it will be recorded in the report sent to the adjutant general at austin sampson i warn youdont follow up your threat  sampson sat white with working jaw  snell come here ordered steele  the man went as if drawn and appeared to slink out of line with the guns steeles cold gray glance held every eye in the hall  take the handcuffs out of my pocket this side go over to gorsech with them gorsech snap those irons on snells wrists now snell back here to the right of me  it was no wonder to me to see how instantly steele was obeyed he might have seen more danger in that moment than was manifest to me on the other hand he might have wanted to drive home hard what he meant  it was a critical moment for those who opposed him there was death in the balance  this ranger whose last resort was gunplay had instantly taken the initiative and his nerve chilled even me perhaps though he read this crowd differently from me and saw that intimidation was his cue i forgot i was not a spectator but an ally  sampson youve shown your hand said steele in the deep voice that carried so far and held those who heard any honest citizen of linrock can now see whats plainyours is a damn poor hand  youre going to hear me call a spade a spade your office is a farce in the two years youve been mayor youve never arrested one rustler strange when linrocks a nest for rustlers youve never sent a prisoner to del rio let alone to austin you have no jail  there have been nine murders since you took office innumerable street fights and holdups not one arrest but you have ordered arrests for trivial offenses and have punished these out of all proportion  there have been lawsuits in your courtsuits over water rights cattle deals property lines strange how in these lawsuits you or wright or other men close to you were always involved stranger how it seems the law was stretched to favor your interests  steele paused in his cold ringing speech in the silence both outside and inside the hall could be heard the deep breathing of agitated men  i would have liked to search for possible satisfaction on the faces of any present but i was concerned only with sampson i did not need to fear that any man might draw on steele  never had i seen a crowd so sold so stiff so held sampson was indeed a study yet did he betray anything but rage at this interloper  sampson heres plain talk for you and linrock to digest went on steele i dont accuse you and your court of dishonesty i saystrange law here has been a farce the motive behind all this laxity isnt plain to meyet but i call your hand     chapter 3  sounding the timber   when steele left the hall pushing snell before him making a lane through the crowd it was not any longer possible to watch everybody  yet now he seemed to ignore the men behind him any friend of snells among the vicious element might have pulled a gun i wondered if steele knew how i watched those men at his backhow fatal it would have been for any of them to make a significant move  noi decided that steele trusted to the effect his boldness had created it was this power to cow ordinary men that explained so many of his feats just the same it was his keenness to read desperate men his nerve to confront them that made him great  the crowd followed steele and his captive down the middle of the main street and watched him secure a team and buckboard and drive off on the road to sanderson  only then did that crowd appear to realize what had happened then my longlookedfor opportunity arrived in the expression of silent men i found something which i had sought from the hurried departure of others homeward i gathered import on the husky whispering lips of yet others i read words i needed to hear  the other part of that crowdto my surprise the smaller partwas the roaring threatening complaining one  thus i segregated linrock that was lawless from linrock that wanted law but for some reason not yet clear the latter did not dare to voice their choice  how could steele and i win them openly to our cause if that could be done long before the year was up linrock would be free of violence and captain neals ranger service saved to the state  i went from place to place corner to corner bar to bar watching listening recording and not until long after sunset did i go out to the ranch  the excitement had preceded me and speculation was rife hurrying through my supper to get away from questions and to go on with my spying i went out to the front of the house  the evening was warm the doors were open and in the twilight the only lamps that had been lit were in sampsons big sitting room at the far end of the house neither sampson nor wright had come home to supper  i would have given much to hear their talk right then and certainly intended to try to hear it when they did come home  when the buckboard drove up and they alighted i was well hidden in the bushes so well screened that i could get but a fleeting glimpse of sampson as he went in  for all i could see he appeared to be a calm and quiet man intense beneath the surface with an air of dignity under insult my chance to observe wright was lost  they went into the house without speaking and closed the door  at the other end of the porch close under a window was an offset between step and wall and there in the shadow i hid if sampson or wright visited the girls that evening i wanted to hear what was said about steele  it seemed to me that it might be a good clue for methe circumstance whether or not diane sampson was told the truth so i waited there in the darkness with patience born of many hours of like duty  presently the small lamp was liti could tell the difference in light when the big one was burningand i heard the swish of skirts  somethings happened surely sally i heard miss sampson say anxiously papa just met me in the hall and didnt speak he seemed pale worried  cousin george looked like a thundercloud said sally for once he didnt try to kiss me somethings happened well diane this has been a bad day for me too  plainly i heard sallys sigh and the little pathetic sound brought me vividly out of my sordid business of suspicion and speculation so she was sorry  bad for you too replied diane in amused surprise oh i seei forgot you and russ had it out  out we fought like the very old deuce ill never speak to him again  so your littleaffair with russ is all over  yes here she sighed again  well sally it began swiftly and its just as well short said diane earnestly we know nothing at all of russ  diane after today i respect him inin spite of thingseven though he seems no good ii cared a lot too  my dear your loves are like the summer flowers i thought maybe your flirting with russ might amount to something yet he seems so different now from what he was at first its only occasionally i get the impression i had of him after that night he saved me from violence hes strange perhaps it all comes of his infatuation for you he is in love with you im afraid of what may come of it  diane hell do something dreadful to george mark my words whispered sally he swore he would if george fooled around me any more  oh dear sally what can we do these are wild men george makes life miserable for me and he teases you unmer  i dont call it teasing george wants to spoon declared sally emphatically hed run after any woman  a fine compliment to me cousin sally laughed diane  i dont agree replied sally stubbornly its so hes spoony and when hes been drinking and tries to kiss me i hate him  sally you look as if youd rather like russ to do something dreadful to george said diane with a laugh that this time was only half mirth  half of me would and half of me would not returned sally but all of me would if i werent afraid of russ ive got a feelingi dont know whatsomething will happen between george and russ some day  there were quick steps on the hall floor steps i thought i recognized  hello girls sounded out wrights voice minus its usual gaiety then ensued a pause that made me bring to mind a picture of wrights glum face  george whats the matter asked diane presently i never saw papa as he is tonight nor you soso worried tell me what has happened  well diane we had a jar today replied wright with a blunt expressive laugh  jar echoed both the girls curiously  jar we had to submit to a damnable outrage added wright passionately as if the sound of his voice augmented his feeling listen girls ill tell you all about it  he coughed clearing his throat in a way that betrayed he had been drinking  i sunk deeper in the shadow of my covert and stiffening my muscles for a protracted spell of rigidity prepared to listen with all acuteness and intensity  just one word from this wright inadvertently uttered in a moment of passion might be the word steele needed for his clue  it happened at the town hall began wright rapidly your father and judge owens and i were there in consultation with three ranchers from out of town first we were disturbed by gunshots from somewhere but not close at hand then we heard the loud voices outside  a crowd was coming down street it stopped before the hall men came running in yelling we thought there was a fire then that ranger steele stalked in dragging a fellow by the name of snell we couldnt tell what was wanted because of the uproar finally your father restored order  steele had arrested snell for alleged assault on a restaurant keeper named hoden it developed that hoden didnt accuse anybody didnt know who attacked him snell being obviously innocent was discharged then thisthis gun fighting ranger pulled his guns on the court and halted the proceedings  when wright paused i plainly heard his intake of breath far indeed was he from calm  steele held everybody in that hall in fear of death and he began shouting his insults law was a farce in linrock the court was a farce there was no law your fathers office as mayor should be impeached he made arrests only for petty offenses he was afraid of the rustlers highwaymen murderers he was afraid orhe just let them alone he used his office to cheat ranchers and cattlemen in lawsuits  all of this steele yelled for everyone to hear a damnable outrage your father diane insulted in his own court by a rowdy ranger not only insulted but threatened with deathtwo big guns thrust almost in his face  oh how horrible cried diane in mingled distress and anger  steeles a ranger the ranger service wants to rule western texas went on wright these rangers are all a low set many of them worse than the outlaws they hunt some of them were outlaws and gun fighters before they became rangers  this steele is one of the worst of the lot hes keen intelligent smooth and that makes him more to be feared for he is to be feared he wanted to kill he meant to kill if your father had made the least move steele would have shot him hes a coldnerved devilthe born gunman my god any instant i expected to see your father fall dead at my feet  oh george thethe unspeakable ruffian cried diane passionately  you see diane this fellow steele has failed here in linrock hes been here weeks and done nothing he must have got desperate hes infamous and he loves his name he seeks notoriety he made that play with snell just for a chance to rant against your father he tried to inflame all linrock against him that about lawsuits was the worst damn him hell make us enemies  what do you care for the insinuations of such a man said diane sampson her voice now deep and rich with feeling after a moments thought no one will be influenced by them do not worry george tell papa not to worry surely after all these years he cant be injured in reputation byby an adventurer  yes he can be injured replied george quickly the frontier is a queer place there are many bitter men here men who have failed at ranching and your father has been wonderfully successful steele has dropped some poison and itll spread  then followed a silence during which evidently the worried wright bestrode the floor  cousin george what became of steele and his prisoner suddenly asked sally  how like her it was with her inquisitive bent of mind and shifting points of view to ask a question the answering of which would be gall and wormwood to wright  it amused while it thrilled me sally might be a flirt but she was no fool  what became of them ha steele bluffed the whole townat least all of it who had heard the mayors order to discharge snell growled wright he took snellrode off for del rio to jail him  george exclaimed diane then after all this ranger was able to arrest snell the innocent man father discharged and take him to jail  exactly thats the toughest part wright ended abruptly and then broke out fiercely but by god hell never come back  wrights slow pacing quickened and he strode from the parlor leaving behind him a silence eloquent of the effect of his sinister prediction  sally what did he mean asked diane in a low voice  steele will be killed replied sally just as lowvoiced  killed that magnificent fellow ah i forgot sally my wits are sadly mixed i ought to be glad if somebody kills my fathers defamer but oh i cant be  this bloody frontier makes me sick papa doesnt want me to stay for good and no wonder shall i go back i hate to show a white feather  do you know sally i wasa little taken with this texas ranger miserably i confess he seemed so like in spirit to the grand stature of him how can so splendid a man be so bloody base at heart its hideous how little we know of men i had my dream about vaughn steele i confess because it shames mebecause i hate myself  next morning i awakened with a feeling that i was more like my old self in the experience of activity of body and mind with a prospect that this was merely the forerunner of great events i came round to my own again  sally was not forgotten she had just become a sorrow so perhaps my downfall as a lover was a precursor of better results as an officer  i held in abeyance my last conclusion regarding sampson and wright and only awaited steeles return to have fixed in mind what these men were  wrights remark about steele not returning did not worry me i had heard many such dark sayings in reference to rangers  rangers had a trick of coming back i did not see any man or men on the present horizon of linrock equal to the killing of steele  as miss sampson and sally had no inclination to ride i had even more freedom i went down to the town and burst cheerily whistling into jim hodens place  jim always made me welcome there as much for my society as for the money i spent and i never neglected being free with both i bought a handful of cigars and shoved some of them in his pocket  hows tricks jim i asked cheerily  reckon im feelin as well as could be expected replied jim his head was circled by a bandage that did not conceal the lump where he had been struck jim looked a little pale but he was bright enough  that was a hell of a biff snell gave you the skunk i remarked with the same cheery assurance  russ i aint accusin snell remonstrated jim with eyes that made me thoughtful  sure i know youre too good a sport to send a fellow up but snell deserved what he got i saw his face when he made his talk to sampsons court snell lied and ill tell you what jim if itd been me instead of that ranger bud snell would have got settled  jim appeared to be agitated by my forcible intimation of friendship  jim thats between ourselves i went on im no fool and much as i blab when im hunky its all air maybe youve noticed that about me in some parts of texas its policy to be closemouthed policy and healthy between ourselves as friends i want you to know i lean some on steeles side of the fence  as i lighted a cigar i saw out of the corner of my eye how hoden gave a quick start i expected some kind of a startling idea to flash into his mind  presently i turned and frankly met his gaze i had startled him out of his habitual set taciturnity but even as i looked the light that might have been amaze and joy faded out of his face leaving it the same old mask  still i had seen enough like a bloodhound i had a scent thets funny russ seein as you drift with the gang steeles bound to fight remarked hoden  sure im a sport if i cant gamble with gentlemen ill gamble with rustlers  again he gave a slight start and this time he hid his eyes  wal russ ive heard you was slick he said  you tumble jim im a little better on the draw  on the draw with cards an gun too eh  now jim that last follows natural i havent had much chance to show how good i am on the draw with a gun but thatll come soon  reckon thet talks a little air said hoden with his dry laugh same as you leanin a little on the rangers side of the fence  but jim wasnt he game whatd you think of that stand bluffed the whole gang the way he called sampsonwhy it was great the justice of that call doesnt bother me it was steeles nerve that got me thatd warm any mans blood  there was a little red in hodens pale cheeks and i saw him swallow hard i had struck deep again  say dont you work for sampson he queried  me i guess not im miss sampsons man he and wright have tried to fire me many a time  thet so he said curiously what for  too many silver trimmings on me jim and i pack my gun low down  wal them two dont go much together out here replied hoden but i aint seen thet anyone has shot off the trimmins  maybe itll commence jim as soon as i stop buying drinks talking about workwhod you say snell worked for  i didnt say  well say so now cant you jim youre powerful peevish today its the bump on your head who does snell work for  when he works at all which sure aint often he rides for sampson  humph seems to me jim that sampsons the whole circus round linrock i was some sore the other day to find i was losing good money at sampsons faro game sure if id won i wouldnt have been sorry eh but i was surprised to hear some scully say sampson owned the hope so dive  ive heard he owned considerable property hereabouts replied jim constrainedly  humph again why jim you know it only like every other scully you meet in this town youre afraid to open your mug about sampson get me straight jim hoden i dont care a damn for colonel mayor sampson and for cause id throw a gun on him just as quick as on any rustler in pecos  talks cheap my boy replied hoden making light of my bluster but the red was deep in his face  sure i know that i said calming down my temper gets up jim then its not well known that sampson owns the hope so  reckon its known in pecos all right but sampsons name isnt connected with the hope so blandy runs the place  that blandyive got no use for him his faro games crooked or im locoed bronc not that we dont have lots of crooked faro dealers a fellow can stand for them but blandys mean back handed never looks you in the eyes that hope so place ought to be run by a good fellow like you hoden  thanks russ replied he and i imagined his voice a little husky didnt you ever hear i used to run it  no did you i said quickly  i reckon i built the place made additions twice owned it for eleven years  well ill be doggoned  it was indeed my turn to be surprised and with the surprise came glimmering  im sorry youre not there now jim did you sell out  no just lost the place  hoden was bursting for relief nowto talkto tell sympathy had made him soft i did not need to ask another question  it was two years agotwo years last march he went on i was in a big cattle deal with sampson we got the stock an my share eighteen hundred head was rustled off i owed sampson he pressed me it come to a lawsuit an iwas ruined  it hurt me to look at hoden he was white and tears rolled down his cheeks  i saw the bitterness the defeat the agony of the man he had failed to meet his obligation nevertheless he had been swindled  all that he suppressed all that would have been passion had the mans spirit not been broken lay bare for me to see i had now the secret of his bitterness  but the reason he did not openly accuse sampson the secret of his reticence and fearthese i thought best to try to learn at some later time after i had consulted with steele  hard luck jim it certainly was tough i said but youre a good loser and the wheel turns  now jim heres what i come particular to see you for i need your advice ive got a little money between you and me as friends ive been adding some to that roll all the time but before i lose it i want to invest some buy some stock or buy an interest in some ranchers herd  what i want you to steer me on is a good square rancher or maybe a couple of ranchers if there happen to be two honest ones in pecos eh no deals with ranchers who ride in the dark with rustlers ive a hunch linrocks full of them  now jim youve been here for years so you must know a couple of men above suspicion  thank god i do russ he replied feelingly frank morton an si zimmer my friends an neighbors all my prosperous days an friends still you can gamble on frank and si but russ if you want advice from me dont invest money in stock now  why  because any new feller buyin stock in pecos these days will be rustled quickern he can say jack robinson the pioneers the new cattlementhese are easy pickin but the new fellers have to learn the ropes they dont know anythin or anybody an the old ranchers are wise an sore theyd fight if they  what i put in as he paused if they knew who was rustling the stock  nope  if they had the nerve  not thet so much  what then whatd make them fight  a leader  i went out of hodens with that word ringing in my ears a leader in my minds eye i saw a horde of dark faced dustybooted cattlemen riding grim and armed behind vaughn steele  more thoughtful than usual i walked on passing some of my old haunts and was about to turn in front of a feed and grain store when a hearty slap on my back disturbed my reflection  howdy thar cowboy boomed a big voice  it was morton the rancher whom jim had mentioned and whose acquaintance i had made he was a man of great bulk with a ruddy merry face  hello morton lets have a drink i replied  gotta rustle home he said young feller ive a ranch to work  sell it to me morton  he laughed and said he wished he could his buckboard stood at the rail the horses stamping impatiently  cards must be runnin lucky he went on with another hearty laugh  cant kick on the luck but im afraid it will change morton my friend hoden gave me a hunch youd be a good man to tie to now ive a little money and before i lose it id like to invest it in stock  he smiled broadly but for all his doubt of me he took definite interest  im not drunk and im on the square i said bluntly youve taken me for a nogood cow puncher without any brains wake up morton if you never size up your neighbors any better than you have mewell you wont get any richer  it was sheer enjoyment for me to make my remarks to these men pregnant with meaning morton showed his pleasure his interest but his faith held aloof  ive got some money i had some then the cards have run lucky will you let me in on some kind of deal will you start me up as a stockman with a little herd all my own  russ thiss durn strange comin from sampsons cowboy he said  im not in his outfit my jobs with miss sampson shes fine but the old man nit hes been after me for weeks i wont last long thats one reason why i want to start up for myself  hoden sent you to me did he poor ol jim wal russ to come out flatfooted youd be foolish to buy cattle now i dont want to take your money an see you lose out better go back across the pecos where the rustlers aint so strong i havent had moren twentyfivehundred head of stock for ten years the rustlers let me hang on to a breedin herd kind of them aint it  sort of kind all i hear is rustlers i replied with impatience you see i havent ever lived long in a rustlerrun county who heads the gang anyway  frank morton looked at me with a curiouslyamused smile  i hear lots about jack blome and snecker everybody calls them out and out bad do they head this mysterious gang  russ i opine blome an snecker parade themselves off boss rustlers same as gun throwers but thets the love such men have for bein thought hell thats brains headin the rustler gang hereabouts  maybe blome and snecker are blinds savvy what i mean morton maybe theres more in the parade than just the fame of it  morton snapped his big jaw as if to shut in impulsive words  look here morton im not so young in years even if i am young west of the pecos i can figure ahead it stands to reason no matter how damn strong these rustlers are how hidden their work however involved with supposedly honest menthey cant last  they come with the pioneers an theyll last as long as thars a single steer left he declared  well if you take that view of circumstances i just figure you as one of the rustlers  morton looked as if he were about to brain me with the butt of his whip his anger flashed by then as unworthy of him and something striking him as funny he boomed out a laugh  its not so funny i went on if youre going to pretend a yellow streak what else will i think  pretend he repeated  sure you cant fool me morton i know men of nerve and here in pecos theyre not any different from those in other places i say if you show anything like a lack of sand its all bluff  by nature youve got nerve there are a lot of men round linrock whore afraid of their shadows afraid to be out after dark afraid to open their mouths but youre not one  so i say if you claim these rustlers will last youre pretending lack of nerve just to help the popular idea along for they cant last  morton i dont want to be a hardriding cowboy all my days do you think id let fear of a gang of rustlers stop me from going in business with a rancher nit what you need out here in pecos is some new blooda few youngsters like me to get you old guys started savvy what i mean  wal i reckon i do he replied looking as if a storm had blown over him  i gauged the hold the rustler gang had on linrock by the difficult job it was to stir this really courageous old cattleman he had grown up with the evil to him it must have been a necessary one the same as dry seasons and cyclones  russ ill look you up the next time i come to town he said soberly  we parted and i more than content with the meeting retraced my steps down street to the hope so saloon  here i entered bent on tasks as sincere as the ones just finished but displeasing because i had to mix with a low profane set to cultivate them to drink occasionally despite my deftness at emptying glasses on the floor to gamble with them and strangers always playing the part of a flush and flashy cowboy half drunk ready to laugh or fight  on the night of the fifth day after steeles departure i went as was my habit to the rendezvous we maintained at the pile of rocks out in the open  the night was clear bright starlight without any moon and for this latter fact safer to be abroad often from my covert i had seen dark figures skulking in and out of linrock  it would have been interesting to hold up these mysterious travelers so far however this had not been our game i had enough to keep my own tracks hidden and my own comings and goings  i liked to be out in the night with the darkness close down to the earth and the feeling of a limitless open all around not only did i listen for steeles soft step but for any soundthe yelp of coyote or mourn of wolf the creak of wind in the dead brush the distant clatter of hoofs a womans singing voice faint from the town  this time just when i was about to give up for that evening steele came looming like a black giant long before i heard his soft step it was good to feel his grip even if it hurt because after five days i had begun to worry  well old boy hows tricks he asked easily  well old man did you land that son of a gun in jail  you bet i did and hell stay there for a while del rio rather liked the idea russ all right there i sidestepped sanderson on the way back but over here at the little villagesampson they call iti was held up couldnt help it because there wasnt any road around  held up i queried  thats it the buckboard was held up i got into the brush in time to save my bacon they began to shoot too soon  did you get any of them  didnt stay to see he chuckled had to hoof it to linrock and its a good long walk  been to your dobe yet tonight  i slipped in at the back russ it bothered me some to make sure no one was laying for me in the dark  youll have to get a safer place why not take to the open every night  russ thats well enough on a trail but i need grub and ive got to have a few comforts ill risk the dobe yet a little  then i narrated all that i had seen and done and heard during his absence holding back one thing what i did tell him sobered him at once brought the quiet somber mood the thoughtful air  so thats all well its enough  all pertaining to our job vaughn i replied the rest is sentiment perhaps i had a pretty bad case of moons over the little langdon girl but we quarreled and its ended now just as well too because if shed  russ did you honestly care for her the real thing i mean  iim afraid so im sort of hurt inside but hell theres one thing sure a love affair might have hindered me made me soft im glad its over  he said no more but his big hand pressing on my knee told me of his sympathy another indication that there was nothing wanting in this ranger  the other thing concerns you i went on somehow reluctant now to tell this you remember how i heard wright making you out vile to miss sampson swore youd never come back well after he had gone when sally said hed meant youd be killed miss sampson felt bad about it she said she ought to be glad if someone killed you but she couldnt be she called you a bloody ruffian yet she didnt want you shot  she said some things about the difference between your hideous character and your splendid stature called you a magnificent fellowthat was it well then she choked up and confessed something to sally in shame and disgrace  shamedisgrace echoed steele greatly interested what  she confessed she had been taken with youhad her little dream about you and she hated herself for it  never i thought would i forget vaughn steeles eyes it did not matter that it was dark i saw the fixed gleam then the leaping shadowy light  did she say that his voice was not quite steady wonderful even if it only lasted a minute she mightwe mightif it wasnt for this hellish job russ has it dawned on you yet what ive got to do to diane sampson  yes i replied vaughn you havent gone sweet on her  what else could i make of that terrible thing in his eyes he did not reply to that at all i thought my arm would break in his clutch  you said you knew what ive got to do to diane sampson he repeated hoarsely  yes youve got to ruin her happiness if not her life  why speak out russ all this comes like a blow there for a little i hoped you had worked out things differently from me no hope ruin her life why  i could explain this strange agitation in steele in no other way except that realization had brought keen suffering as incomprehensible as it was painful i could not tell if it came from suddenly divined love for diane sampson equally with a poignant conviction that his fate was to wreck her but i did see that he needed to speak out the brutal truth  steele old man youll ruin diane sampson because as arrest looks improbable to me youll have to kill her father  my god why why say it  because sampson is the leader of the linrock gang of rustlers  that night before we parted we had gone rather deeply into the plan of action for the immediate future  first i gave steele my earnest counsel and then as stiff an argument as i knew how to put up all anent the absolute necessity of his eternal vigilance if he got shot in a fair encounter with his enemieswell that was a rangers risk and no disgrace but to be massacred in bed knifed in the dark shot in the back ambushed in any mannernot one of these miserable ends must be the last record of vaughn steele  he promised me in a way that made me wonder if he would ever sleep again or turn his back on anyonemade me wonder too at the menace in his voice steele seemed likely to be torn two ways and already there was a hint of future desperation  it was agreed that i make cautious advances to hoden and morton and when i could satisfy myself of their trustworthiness reveal my identity to them through this i was to cultivate zimmer and then other ranchers whom we should decide could be let into the secret  it was not only imperative that we learn through them clues by which we might eventually fix guilt on the rustler gang but also just as imperative that we develop a band of deputies to help us when the fight began  steele now that he was back in linrock would have the center of the stage with all eyes upon him we agreed moreover that the bolder the front now the better the chance of ultimate success the more nerve he showed the less danger of being ambushed the less peril in facing vicious men  but we needed a jail prisoners had to be corraled after arrest or the work would be useless almost a farce and there was no possibility of repeating trips to del rio  we could not use an adobe house for a jail because that could be easily cut out of or torn down  finally i remembered an old stone house near the end of the main street it had one window and one door and had been long in disuse steele would rent it hire men to guard and feed his prisoners and if these prisoners bribed or fought their way to freedom that would not injure the great principle for which he stood  both steele and i simultaneously from different angles of reasoning had arrived at a conviction of sampsons guilt it was not so strong as realization rather a divination  long experience in detecting in feeling the hidden guilt of men had sharpened our senses for that particular thing steele acknowledged a few mistakes in his day but i allowing for the same strength of conviction had never made a single mistake  but conviction was one thing and proof vastly another furthermore when proof was secured then came the crowning taskthat of taking desperate men in a wild country they dominated  verily steele and i had our work cut out for us however we were prepared to go at it with infinite patience and implacable resolve steele and i differed only in the driving incentive of course outside of that one binding vow to save the ranger service  he had a strange passion almost an obsession to represent the law of texas and by so doing render something of safety and happiness to the honest pioneers  beside steele i knew i shrunk to a shadow i was not exactly a heathen and certainly i wanted to help harassed people especially women and children but mainly with me it was the zest the thrill the hazard the matching of witsin a word the adventure of the game  next morning i rode with the young ladies in the light of sallys persistently flagrant advances to which i was apparently blind i saw that my hardwon victory over self was likely to be shortlived  that possibility made me outwardly like ice i was an attentive careful reliable and respectful attendant seeing to the safety of my charges but the onetime gay and debonair cowboy was a thing of the past  sally womanlike had been a littlea very littlerepentant she had showed it my indifference had piqued her she had made advances and then my coldness had roused her spirit she was the kind of girl to value most what she had lost and to throw consequences to the winds in winning it back  when i divined this i saw my revenge to be sure when i thought of it i had no reason to want revenge she had been most gracious to me  but there was the catty thing she had said about being kissed again by her admirers then in all seriousness sentiment aside i dared not make up with her  so the cold and indifferent part i played was imperative  we halted out on the ridge and dismounted for the usual little rest mine i took in the shade of a scrubby mesquite the girls strolled away out of sight it was a drowsy day and i nearly fell asleep  something aroused mea patter of footsteps or a rustle of skirts then a soft thud behind me gave me at once a start and a thrill first i saw sallys little brown hands on my shoulders then her head with hair all shiny and flying and fragrant came round over my shoulder softly smoothing my cheek until her sweet saucy heated face was right under my eyes  russ dont you love me any more she whispered     chapter 4  steele breaks up the party   that night i saw steele at our meeting place and we compared notes and pondered details of our problem  steele had rented the stone house to be used as a jail while the blacksmith was putting up a door and window calculated to withstand many onslaughts all the idlers and strangers in town went to see the sight manifestly it was an occasion for linrock when steele let it be known that he wanted to hire a jailer and a guard this caustically humorous element offered itself en masse the men made a joke out of it  when steele and i were about to separate i remembered a party that was to be given by miss sampson and i told him about it he shook his head sadly almost doubtfully  was it possible that sampson could be a deep eyed cunning scoundrel the true leader of the cattle rustlers yet keep that beautiful and innocent girl out on the frontier and let her give parties to sons and daughters of a community he had robbed to any but remorseless rangers the idea was incredible  thursday evening came in spite of what the girls must have regarded as an interminably dragging day  it was easy to differentiate their attitudes toward this party sally wanted to look beautiful to excell all the young ladies who were to attend to attach to her train all the young men and have them fighting to dance with her miss sampson had an earnest desire to open her fathers house to the people of linrock to show that a daughter had come into his long cheerless home to make the evening one of pleasure and entertainment  i happened to be present in the parlor was carrying in some flowers for final decoration when miss sampson learned that her father had just ridden off with three horsemen whom dick who brought the news had not recognized  in her keen disappointment she scarcely heard dicks concluding remark about the hurry of the colonel my sharp ears however took this in and it was thoughtprovoking sampson was known to ride off at all hours yet this incident seemed unusual  at eight oclock the house and porch and patio were ablaze with lights every lantern and lamp on the place together with all that could be bought and borrowed had been brought into requisition  the cowboys arrived first all dressed in their best clean shaven red faced bright eyed eager for the fun to commence then the young people from town and a good sprinkling of older people came in a steady stream  miss sampson received them graciously excused her fathers absence and bade them be at home  the music or the discordance that went by that name was furnished by two cowboys with banjos and an antediluvian gentleman with a fiddle nevertheless it was music that could be danced to and there was no lack of enthusiasm  i went from porch to parlor and thence to patio watching and amused the lights and the decorations of flowers the bright dresses and the flashy scarfs of the cowboys furnished a gay enough scene to a man of lonesome and stern life like mine during the dance there was a steady continuous shuffling tramp of boots and during the interval following a steady low hum of merry talk and laughter  my wandering from place to place apart from my usual careful observation was an unobtrusive but to me a sneaking pursuit of sally langdon  she had on a white dress i had never seen with a low neck and short sleeves and she looked so sweet so dainty so altogether desirable that i groaned a hundred times in my jealousy because manifestly sally did not intend to run any risk of my not seeing her in her glory no matter where my eyes looked  a couple of times in promenading i passed her on the arm of some proud cowboy or gallant young buck from town and on these occasions she favored her escort with a languishing glance that probably did as much damage to him as to me  presently she caught me redhanded in my careless sauntering pursuit of her and then whether by intent or from indifference she apparently deigned me no more notice but quick to feel a difference in her i marked that from that moment her gaiety gradually merged into coquettishness and soon into flirtation  then just to see how far she would go perhaps desperately hoping she would make me hate her i followed her shamelessly from patio to parlor porch to court even to the waltz  to her credit she always weakened when some young fellow got her in a corner and tried to push the flirting to extremes young waters was the only one lucky enough to kiss her and there was more of strength in his conquest of her than any decent fellow could be proud of  when george wright sought sally out there was added to my jealousy a real anxiety i had brushed against wright more than once that evening he was not drunk yet under the influence of liquor  sally however evidently did not discover that because knowing her abhorrence of drink i believed she would not have walked out with him had she known anyway i followed them close in the shadow  wright was unusually gay i saw him put his arm around her without remonstrance when the music recommenced they went back to the house wright danced with sally not ungracefully for a man who rode a horse as much as he after the dance he waved aside sallys many partners not so gaily as would have been consistent with good feeling and led her away i followed they ended up that walk at the extreme corner of the patio where under gaily colored lights a little arbor had been made among the flowers and vines  sally seemed to have lost something of her vivacity they had not been out of my sight for a moment before sally cried out it was a cry of impatience or remonstrance rather than alarm but i decided that it would serve me an excuse  i dashed back leaped to the door of the arbor my hand on my gun  wright was holding sally when he heard me he let her go then she uttered a cry that was one of alarm her face blanched her eyes grew strained one hand went to her breast she thought i meant to kill wright  excuse me i burst out frankly turning to wright i never saw a hyena but he looked like one i heard a squeal thought a girl was hurt or something miss sampson gave me orders to watch out for accidents fire anything so excuse me wright  as i stepped back to my amazement sally excusing herself to the scowling wright hurriedly joined me  oh its our dance russ  she took my arm and we walked through the patio  im afraid of him russ she whispered you frightened me worse though you didnt mean toto  i made a bluff saw hed been drinking so i kept near you  you return good for evil she replied squeezing my arm russ let me tell youwhenever anything frightens me since we got here i think of you if youre only near i feel safe  we paused at the door leading into the big parlor couples were passing here i could scarcely distinguish the last words she said she stood before me eyes downcast face flushed as sweet and pretty a lass as man could want to see and with her hand she twisted round and round a silver button on my buckskin vest  dance with me the rest of this she said george shooed away my partner im glad for the chance dance with me russnot gallantly or dutifully because i ask you but because you want to else not at all  there was a limit to my endurance there would hardly be another evening like this at least for me in that country i capitulated with what grace i could express  we went into the parlor and as we joined the dancers despite all that confusion i heard her whisper ive been a little beast to you  that dance seemingly lasted only a momenta moment while she was all airy grace radiant and alluring floating close to me with our hands clasped then it appeared the music had ceased the couples were finding seats and sally and i were accosted by miss sampson  she said we made a graceful couple in the dance and sally said she did not have to reach up a mile to mei was not so awfully tall  and i tonguetied for once said nothing  wright had returned and was now standing cigarette between lips in the door leading out to the patio at the same moment that i heard a heavy tramp of boots from the porch side i saw wrights face change remarkably expressing amaze consternation then fear  i wheeled in time to see vaughn steele bend his head to enter the door on that side the dancers fell back  at sight of him i was again the ranger his ally steele was pale yet heated he panted he wore no hat he had his coat turned up and with left hand he held the lapels together  in a quick ensuing silence miss sampson rose white as her dress the young women present stared in astonishment and their partners showed excitement  miss sampson i came to search your house panted steele courteously yet with authority  i disengaged myself from sally who was clinging to my hands and i stepped forward out of the corner steele had been running why did he hold his coat like that i sensed action and the cold thrill animated me  miss sampsons astonishment was succeeded by anger difficult to control  in the absence of my father i am mistress here i will not permit you to search my house  then i regret to say i must do so without your permission he said sternly  do not dare she flashed she stood erect her bosom swelling her eyes magnificently black with passion how dare you intrude here have you not insulted us enough to search my house tonightto break up my partyoh its worse than outrage why on earth do you want to search here ah for the same reason you dragged a poor innocent man into my fathers court sir i forbid you to take another step into this house  steeles face was bloodless now and i wondered if it had to do with her scathing scorn or something that he hid with his hand closing his coat that way  miss sampson i dont need warrants to search houses he said but this time ill respect your command it would be too bad to spoil your party let me add perhaps you do me a little wrong god knows i hope so i was shot by a rustler he fled i chased him here he has taken refuge herein your fathers house hes hidden somewhere  steele spread wide his coat lapels he wore a light shirt the color of which in places was white the rest was all a bloody mass from which dark red drops fell to the floor  oh cried miss sampson  scorn and passion vanished in the horror the pity of a woman who imagined she saw a man mortally wounded it was a hard sight for a womans eyes that crimson heaving breast  surely i didnt see that went on steele closing his coat you used unforgettable words miss sampson from you they hurt for i stand alone my fight is to make linrock safer cleaner a better home for women and children some day you will remember what you said  how splendid he looked how strong against odds how simple a dignity fitted his words why a woman far blinder than diane sampson could have seen that here stood a man  steele bowed turned on his heel and strode out to vanish in the dark  then while she stood bewildered still shocked i elected to do some rapid thinking  how seriously was steele injured an instants thought was enough to tell me that if he had sustained any more than a flesh wound he would not have chased his assailant not with so much at stake in the future  then i concerned myself with a cold grip of desire to get near the rustler who had wounded steele as i started forward however miss sampson defeated me sally once more clung to my hands and directly we were surrounded by an excited circle  it took a moment or two to calm them  then theres a rustlerherehiding repeated miss sampson  miss sampson ill find him ill rout him out i said  yes yes find him russ but dont use violence she replied send him awayno give him over to  nothing of the kind interrupted george wright loudvoiced cousin go on with your dance ill take a couple of cowboys ill find thisthis rustler if theres one here but i think its only another bluff of steeles  this from wright angered me deeply and i strode right for the door  where are you going he demanded  ive miss sampsons orders she wants me to find this hidden man she trusts me not to allow any violence  didnt i say id see to that he snarled  wright i dont care what you say i retorted but im thinking you might not want me to find this rustler  wright turned black in the face verily if he had worn a gun he would have pulled it on me as it was miss sampsons interference probably prevented more words if no worse  dont quarrel she said george you go with russ please hurry ill be nervous till the rustlers found or youre sure theres not one  we started with several cowboys to ransack the house we went through the rooms searching calling out flashing our lanterns in dark places  it struck me forcibly that wright did all the calling he hurried too tried to keep in the lead i wondered if he knew his voice would be recognized by the hiding man  be that as it might it was i who peered into a dark corner and then with a cocked gun leveled i said come out  he came forth into the flare of lanterns a tall slim darkfaced youth wearing dark sombrero blouse and trousers i collared him before any of the others could move and i held the gun close enough to make him shrink  but he did not impress me as being frightened just then nevertheless he had a clammy face the pallid look of a man who had just gotten over a shock he peered into my face then into that of the cowboy next to me then into wrights and if ever in my life i beheld relief i saw it then  that was all i needed to know but i meant to find out more if i could  whore you i asked quietly  he gazed rather arrogantly down at me it always irritated me to be looked down at that way  say dont be gay with me or youll get it good i yelled prodding him in the side with the cocked gun who are you quick  bo snecker he said  any relation to bill snecker  his son  whatd you hide here for  he appeared to grow sullen  reckoned id be as safe in sampsons as anywheres  ahuh youre taking a long chance i replied and he never knew or any of the others just how long a chance that was  sight of steeles bloody breast remained with me and i had something sinister to combat this was no time for me to reveal myself or to show unusual feeling or interest for steele  as steele had abandoned his search i had nothing to do now but let the others decide what disposition was to be made of snecker  wright whatll you do with him i queried as if uncertain now the capture was made i let snecker go and sheathed my weapon  that seemed a signal for him to come to life i guessed he had not much fancied the wide and somewhat variable sweep of that cocked gun  ill see to that replied wright gruffly and he pushed snecker in front of him into the hall i followed them out into the court at the back of the house  as i had very little further curiosity i did not wait to see where they went but hurried back to relieve miss sampson and sally  i found them as i had left themsally quiet pale miss sampson nervous and distressed i soon calmed their fears of any further trouble or possible disturbance miss sampson then became curious and wanted to know who the rustler was  how strange he should come here she said several times  probably hed run this way or thought he had a better chance to hide where there was dancing and confusion i replied glibly  i wondered how much longer i would find myself keen to shunt her mind from any channel leading to suspicion  would papa have arrested him she asked  colonel sampson might have made it hot for him i replied frankly feeling that if what i said had a double meaning it still was no lie  oh i forgotthe ranger she exclaimed suddenly that awful sightthe whole front of him bloody russ how could he stand up under such a wound do you think itll kill him  thats hard to say a man like steele can stand a lot  russ please go find him see how it is with him she said almost pleadingly  i started glad of the chance and hurried down toward the town  there was a light in the little adobe house where he lived and proceeding cautiously so as to be sure no one saw me i went close and whistled low in a way he would recognize then he opened the door and i went in  hello son he said you neednt have worried sling a blanket over that window so no one can see in  he had his shirt off and had been in the act of bandaging a wound that the bullet had cut in his shoulder  let me tie that up i said taking the strips of linen ahuh shot you from behind didnt he  how else you locoed ladycharmer its a wonder i didnt have to tell you that  tell me about it  steele related a circumstance differing little from other attempts at his life and concluded by saying that snecker was a good runner if he was not a good shot  i finished the bandaging and stood off admiring steeles magnificent shoulders i noted too on the fine white skin more than one scar made by bullets i got an impression that his strength and vitality were like his spiritunconquerable  so you knew it was bill sneckers son i asked when i had told him about finding the rustler  sure jim hoden pointed him out to me yesterday both the sneckers are in town from now on were going to be busy russ  it cant come too soon for me i replied shall i chuck my job come out from behind these cowboy togs  not yet we need proof russ weve got to be able to prove things hang on at the ranch yet awhile  this bo snecker was scared stiff till he recognized wright isnt that proof  no thats nothing weve got to catch sampson and wright redhanded  i dont like the idea of you trailing along alone i protested remember what neal told me im to kick its time for me to hang round with a couple of guns youll never use one  the hell i wont he retorted with a dark glance of passion i was surprised that my remark had angered him you fellows are all wrong i know when to throw a gun you ought to remember that rangers have a bad name for wanting to shoot and im afraid its deserved  did you shoot at snecker i queried  i could have got him in the back but that wouldnt do i shot three times at his legstried to let him down id have made him tell everything he knew but he ran he was too fast for me  shooting at his legs no wonder he ran he savvied your game all right its funny vaughn how these rustlers and gunmen dont mind being killed but to cripple them rope them jail themthats hell to them well im to go on up at the ranch falling further in love with that sweet kid instead of coming out straight to face things with you  steele had to laugh yet he was more thoughtful of my insistence  russ you think you have patience but you dont know what patience is i wont be hurried on this job but ill tell you what ill hang under cover most of the time when youre not close to me see that can be managed ill watch for you when you come in town well go in the same places and in case i get busy you can stand by and trail along after me that satisfy you  fine i said both delighted and relieved well ill have to rustle back now to tell miss sampson youre all right  steele had about finished pulling on a clean shirt exercising care not to disarrange the bandages and he stopped short to turn squarely and look at me with hungry eyes  russ did sheshow sympathy  she was all broken up about it thought you were going to die  did she send you  sure and she said hurry i replied  i was not a little gleeful over the apparent possibility of steele being in the same boat with me  do you think she would have cared ifif i had been shot up bad  the great giant of a ranger asked this like a boy hesitatingly with color in his face  care vaughn youre as thickheaded as you say im locoed diane sampson has fallen in love with you thats all love at first sight she doesnt realize it but i know  there he stood as if another bullet had struck him this time straight through the heart perhaps one hadand i repented a little of my overconfident declaration  still i would not go back on it i believed it  russ for gods sake what a terrible thing to say he ejaculated hoarsely  no its not terrible to say itonly the fact is terrible i went on i may be wrong but i swear im right when you opened your coat showed that bloody breastwell ill never forget her eyes  she had been furious she showed passionhate then all in a second something wonderful beautiful broke through pity fear agonized thought of your death if thats not love ifif she did not betray love then i never saw it she thinks she hates you but she loves you  get out of here he ordered thickly  i went not forgetting to peep out at the door and to listen a moment then i hurried into the open up toward the ranch  the stars were very big and bright so calm so cold that it somehow hurt me to look at them not like mens lives surely  what had fate done to vaughn steele and to me i had a moment of bitterness an emotion rare with me  most rangers put love behind them when they entered the service and seldom found it after that but love had certainly met me on the way and i now had confirmation of my fear that vaughn was hard hit  then the wildness the adventurer in me stirred to the wonder of it all it was in me to exult even in the face of fate steele and i while balancing our lives on the hairtrigger of a gun had certainly fallen into a tangled web of circumstances not calculated in the role of rangers  i went back to the ranch with regret remorse sorrow knocking at my heart but notwithstanding that tingling alive to the devilish excitement of the game  i knew not what it was that prompted me to sow the same seed in diane sampsons breast that i had sown in steeles probably it was just a propensity for sheer mischief probably a certainty of the truth and a strange foreshadowing of a coming event  if diane sampson loved through her this event might be less tragic somehow love might save us all  that was the shadowy portent flitting in the dark maze of my mind  at the ranch dancing had been resumed there might never have been any interruption of the gaiety i found miss sampson on the lookout for me and she searched my face with eyes that silenced my one last qualm of conscience  lets go out in the patio i suggested i dont want any one to hear what i say  outside in the starlight she looked white and very beautiful i felt her tremble perhaps my gravity presaged the worst so it did in one waypoor vaughn  i went down to steeles dobe the little place where he lives i began weighing my words he let me inwas surprised he had been shot high in the shoulder not a dangerous wound i bandaged it for him he was gratefulsaid he had no friends  poor fellow oh im glad itit isnt bad said miss sampson something glistened in her eyes  he looked strange sort of forlorn i think your wordswhat you said hurt him more than the bullet im sure of that miss sampson  oh i saw that myself i was furious but ii meant what i said  you wronged steele i happen to know i know his record along the rio grande its scarcely my place miss sampson to tell you what youll find out for yourself sooner or later  what shall i find out she demanded  ive said enough  no you mean my father and cousin george are misinformed or wrong about steele ive feared it this last hour it was his look that pierced me oh id hate to be unjust you say i wronged him russ then you take sides with him against my father  yes i replied very low  she was keenly hurt and seemed despite an effort to shrink from me  its only natural you should fight for your father i went on perhaps you dont understand he has ruled here for long hes beenwell lets say easy with the evildoers but times are changing he opposed the ranger idea which is also natural i suppose still hes wrong about steele terribly wrong and it means trouble  oh i dont know what to believe  it might be well for you to think things out for yourself  russ i feel as though i couldnt i cant make head or tail of life out here my father seems so strange though of course ive only seen him twice a year since i was a little girl he has two sides to him when i come upon that strange side the one i never knew hes like a man i never saw  i want to be a good and loving daughter i want to help him fight his battles but he doesnthe doesnt satisfy me hes grown impatient and wants me to go back to louisiana that gives me a feeling of mystery oh its all mystery  true youre right i replied my heart aching for her its all mysteryand trouble for you too perhaps youd do well to go home  russ you suggest i leave hereleave my father she asked  i advise it you struck aa rather troublesome time later you might return if  never i came to stay and ill stay she declared and there her temper spoke  miss sampson i began again after taking a long deep breath i ought to tell you one thing more about steele  well go on  doesnt he strike you now as being the farthest removed from a ranting brutal ranger  i confess he was at least a gentleman  rangers dont allow anything to interfere with the discharge of their duty he was courteous after you defamed him he respected your wish he did not break up the dance  this may not strike you particularly but let me explain that steele was chasing an outlaw who had shot him under ordinary circumstances he would have searched your house he would have been like a lion he would have torn the place down around our ears to get that rustler  but his action was so different from what i had expected it amazed me just now when i was with him i learned i guessed what stayed his hand i believe you ought to know  know what she asked how starry and magnetic her eyes a womans divining intuition made them wonderful with swiftvarying emotion  they drew me on to the fatal plunge what was i doing to herto vaughn something bound my throat making speech difficult  hes fallen in love with you i hurried on in a husky voice love at first sight terrible hopeless i saw itfelt it i cant explain how i know but i do know  thats what stayed his hand here and thats why im on his side hes alone he has a terrible task here without any handicaps every man is against him if he fails you might be the force that weakened him so you ought to be kinder in your thought of him wait before you judge him further  if he isnt killed time will prove him noble instead of vile if he is killed which is more than likely youll feel the happier for a generous doubt in favor of the man who loved you  like one stricken blind she stood an instant then with her hands at her breast she walked straight across the patio into the dark open door of her room     chapter 5  cleaning out linrock   not much sleep visited me that night in the morning the young ladies not stirring and no prospects of duty for me i rode down to town  sight of the wide street lined by its hitching posts and saddled horses the square buildings with their ugly signs unfinished yet old the lounging dustgray men at every cornerthese awoke in me a significance that had gone into oblivion overnight  that last talk with miss sampson had unnerved me wrought strangely upon me and afterward waking and dozing i had dreamed lived in a warm golden place where there were music and flowers and sallys spritelike form leading me on after two tall beautiful lovers diane and vaughn walking hand in hand  fine employment of mind for a ranger whose single glance down a quiet street pictured it with darkgarbed men in grim action guns spouting red horses plunging  in front of hodens restaurant i dismounted and threw my bridle jim was unmistakably glad to see me  whereve you been morton was in an powerful set on seein you i steered him from goin up to sampsons what kind of a game was you givin frank  jim i just wanted to see if he was a safe rancher to make a stock deal for me  he says you told him he didnt have no yellow streak an that he was a rustler frank cant git over them two hunches when he sees you hes goin to swear hes no rustler but he has got a yellow streak unless  this little brokendown texan had eyes like flint striking fire  unless i queried sharply  jim breathed a deep breath and looked around the room before his gaze fixed again on mine  wal he replied speaking low me and frank allows youve picked the right men it was me that sent them letters to the ranger captain at austin now who in hell are you  it was my turn to draw a deep breath  i had taken six weeks to strike fire from a texan whom i instinctively felt had been prey to the power that shadowed linrock there was no one in the room except us no one passing nor near  reaching into the inside pocket of my buckskin vest i turned the lining out a starshaped bright silver object flashed as i shoved it pocket and all under jims hard eyes  he could not help but read united states deputy marshall  by golly he whispered cracking the table with his fist russ you sure rung true to me but never as a cowboy  jim the woods is full of us  heavy footsteps sounded on the walk presently steeles bulk darkened the door  hello i greeted steele shake hands with jim hoden  hello replied steele slowly say i reckon i know hoden  nit not this one hes the old hoden he used to own the hope so saloon it was on the square when he ran it maybe hell get it back pretty soon hope so  i laughed at my execrable pun steele leaned against the counter his gray glance studying the man i had so oddly introduced  hoden in one flash associated the ranger with mea relation he had not dreamed of then whether from shock or hope or fear i know not he appeared about to faint  hoden do you know whos boss of this secret gang of rustlers hereabouts asked steele bluntly  it was characteristic of him to come sharp to the point his voice something deep easy cool about him seemed to steady hoden  no replied hoden  does anybody know went on steele  wal i reckon theres not one honest native of pecos who knows  but you have your suspicions  we have  you can keep your suspicions to yourself but you can give me your idea about this crowd that hangs round the saloons the regulars  jest a bad lot replied hoden with the quick assurance of knowledge most of them have been here years others have drifted in some of them work odd times they rustle a few steer steal rob anythin for a little money to drink an gamble jest a bad lot  but the strangers as are always comin an goinstrangers that never git acquaintedsome of them are likely to be the rustlers bill an bo snecker are in town now bills a known cattlethief bos no good the makin of a gunfighter he heads thet way  they might be rustlers but the boy hes hardly careful enough for this gang then theres jack blome he comes to town often he lives up in the hills he always has three or four strangers with him blomes the fancy gun fighter he shot a gambler here last fall then he was in a fight in sanderson lately got two cowboys then  blomes killed a dozen pecos men hes a rustler too but i reckon hes not the brains of thet secret outfit if hes in it at all  steele appeared pleased with hodens idea probably it coincided with the one he had arrived at himself  now im puzzled over this said steele why do men apparently honest men seem to be so closemouthed here is that a fact or only my impression  its sure a fact replied hoden darkly men have lost cattle an property in linrocklost them honestly or otherwise as hasnt been proved an in some cases when they talkedhinted a littlethey was found dead apparently held up an robbed but dead dead men dont talk thets why were closemouthed  steeles face wore a dark somber sternness  rustling cattle was not intolerable western texas had gone on prospering growing in spite of the horde of rustlers ranging its vast stretches but this cold secret murderous hold on a little struggling community was something too strange too terrible for men to stand long  it had waited for a leader like steele and now it could not last hodens revived spirit showed that  the ranger was about to speak again when the clatter of hoofs interrupted him horses halted out in front  a motion of steeles hand caused me to dive through a curtained door back of hodens counter i turned to peep out and was in time to see george wright enter with the redheaded cowboy called brick  that was the first time i had ever seen wright come into hodens he called for tobacco  if his visit surprised jim he did not show any evidence but wright showed astonishment as he saw the ranger and then a dark glint flitted from the eyes that shifted from steele to hoden and back again  steele leaned easily against the counter and he said good morning pleasantly wright deigned no reply although he bent a curious and hard scrutiny upon steele in fact wright evinced nothing that would lead one to think he had any respect for steele as a man or as a ranger  steele that was the second break of yours last night he said finally if you come fooling round the ranch again therell be hell  it seemed strange that a man who had lived west of the pecos for ten years could not see in steele something which forbade that kind of talk  it certainly was not nerve wright showed men of courage were seldom intolerant and with the matchless nerve that characterized steele or the great gunmen of the day there went a cool unobtrusive manner a speech brief almost gentle certainly courteous wright was a hotheaded louisianian of french extraction a man evidently who had never been crossed in anything and who was strong brutal passionate which qualities in the face of a situation like this made him simply a fool  the way steele looked at wright was joy to me i hated this smooth darkskinned southerner but of course an ordinary affront like wrights only earned silence from steele  im thinking you used your ranger bluff just to get near diane sampson wright sneered mind you if you come up there again therell be hell  youre damn right therell be hell retorted steele a kind of high ring in his voice i saw thick dark red creep into his face  had wrights incomprehensible mention of diane sampson been an instinct of loveof jealousy verily it had pierced into the depths of the ranger probably as no other thrust could have  diane sampson wouldnt stoop to know a dirty bloodtracker like you said wright hotly his was not a deliberate intention to rouse steele the man was simply rancorous ill call you right you cheap bluffer you fourflush you damned interfering conceited ranger  long before wright ended his tirade steeles face had lost the tinge of color so foreign to it in moments like this and the cool shade the steady eyes like ice on fire the ruthless lips had warned me if they had not wright  wright ill not take offense because you seem to be championing your beautiful cousin replied steele in slow speech biting but let me return your compliment youre a fine southerner why youre only a cheap fourflushdamned bullheadedrustler  steele hissed the last word then for himfor mefor hodenthere was the truth in wrights working passionblackened face  wright jerked moved meant to draw but how slow steele lunged forward his long arm swept up  and wright staggered backward knocking table and chairs to fall hard in a halfsitting posture against the wall  dont draw warned steele  wright get away from your gun yelled the cowboy brick  but wright was crazed by fury he tugged at his hip his face corded with purple welts malignant murderous while he got to his feet  i was about to leap through the door when steele shot wrights gun went ringing to the floor  like a beast in pain wright screamed frantically he waved a limp arm flinging blood over the white tablecloths steele had crippled him  here you cowboy ordered steele take him out quick  brick saw the need of expediency if wright did not realize it and he pulled the raving man out of the place he hurried wright down the street leaving the horses behind  steele calmly sheathed his gun  well i guess that opens the ball he said as i came out  hoden seemed fascinated by the spots of blood on the tablecloths it was horrible to see him rubbing his hands there like a ghoul  i tell you what fellows said steele weve just had a few pleasant moments with the man who has made it healthy to keep closemouthed in linrock  hoden lifted his shaking hands  whatd you wing him for he wailed he was drawin on you shootin arms off men like him wont do out here  i was inclined to agree with hoden  that bullheaded fool will roar and butt himself with all his gang right into our hands hes just the man ive needed to meet besides shooting him would have been murder for me  murder exclaimed hoden  he was a fool and slow at that under such circumstances could i kill him when i didnt have to  sure itd been the trick declared jim positively im not allowin for whether hes really a rustler or not it just wont do because these fellers out here aint goin to be afraid of you  see here hoden if a mans going to be afraid of me at all that trick will make him more afraid of me i know it it works out when wright cools down hell remember hell begin to think hell realize that i could more easily have killed him than risk a snapshot at his arm ill bet you he goes pale to the gills next time he even sees me  that may be true steele but if wrights the man you think he is hell begin that secret underground bizness its been tolerable healthy these last six months you can gamble on this if thet secret work does commence youll have more reason to suspect wright i wont feel very safe from now on  i heard you call him rustler he knows thet why wright wont sleep at night now he an sampson have always been after me  hoden what are your eyes for demanded steele watch out and now here see your friend morton tell him this game grows hot together you approach four or five men you know well and can absolutely trust  hello theres somebody coming you meet russ and me tonight out in the open a quarter of a mile straight from the end of this street youll find a pile of stones meet us there tonight at ten oclock  the next few days for the several hours each day that i was in town i had steele in sight all the time or knew that he was safe under cover  nothing happened his presence in the saloons or any place where men congregated was marked by a certain uneasy watchfulness on the part of almost everybody and some amusement on the part of a few  it was natural to suppose that the lawless element would rise up in a mass and slay steele on sight but this sort of thing never happened it was not so much that these enemies of the law awaited his next move but just a slowness peculiar to the frontier  the ranger was in their midst he was interesting if formidable he would have been welcomed at card tables at the bars to play and drink with the men who knew they were under suspicion  there was a rude kind of good humor even in their open hostility  besides one ranger or a company of rangers could not have held the undivided attention of these men from their games and drinks and quarrels except by some decided move excitement greed appetite were rife in them  i marked however a striking exception to the usual run of strangers i had been in the habit of seeing the sneckers had gone or were under cover again i caught a vague rumor of the coming of jack blome yet he never seemed to arrive  moreover the goingson among the habitues of the resorts and the cowboys who came in to drink and gamble were unusually mild in comparison with former conduct  this lull however did not deceive steele and me it could not last the wonder was that it had lasted so long  there was of course no post office in linrock a stage arrived twice a week from sanderson if it did not get held up on the way and the driver usually had letters which he turned over to the elderly keeper of a little store  this mans name was jones and everybody liked him on the evenings the stage arrived there was always a crowd at his store which fact was a source of no little revenue to him  one night so we ascertained after the crowd had dispersed two thugs entered his store beat the old man and robbed him he made no complaint however when steele called him he rather reluctantly gave not only descriptions of his assailants but their names  steele straightaway went in search of the men and came across them in leretts place i was around when it happened  steele strode up to a table which was surrounded by seven or eight men and he tapped sim bass on the shoulder  get up i want you he said  bass looked up only to see who had accosted him  the hell you say he replied impudently  steeles big hand shifted to the fellows collar one jerk seemingly no effort at all sent bass sliding chair and all to crash into the bar and fall in a heap he lay there wondering what had struck him  miller i want you get up said steele  miller complied with alacrity a sharp kick put more life and understanding into bass  then steele searched these men right before the eyes of their comrades took what money and weapons they had and marched them out followed by a crowd that gathered more and more to it as they went down the street steele took his prisoners into jones store had them identified returned the money they had stolen and then pushing the two through the gaping crowd he marched them down to his stone jail and locked them up  obviously the serious side of this incident was entirely lost upon the highly entertained audience many and loud were the coarse jokes cracked at the expense of bass and miller and after the rude door had closed upon them similar remarks were addressed to steeles jailer and guard who in truth were just as disreputable looking as their prisoners  then the crowd returned to their pastimes leaving their erstwhile comrades to taste the sweets of prison life  when i got a chance i asked steele if he could rely on his hired hands and with a twinkle in his eye which surprised me as much as his reply he said miller and bass would have flown the coop before morning  he was right when i reached the lower end of town next morning the same old crowd enlarged by other curious men and youths had come to pay their respects to the new institution  jailer and guard were on hand loud in their proclamations and explanations naturally they had fallen asleep as all other hard working citizens had and while they slept the prisoners made a hole somewhere and escaped  steele examined the hole and then engaged a stripling of a youth to see if he could crawl through the youngster essayed the job stuck in the middle and was with difficulty extricated  whereupon the crowd evinced its delight  steele without more ado shoved his jailer and guard inside his jail deliberately closed barred and chained the iron bolted door and put the key in his pocket then he remained there all day without giving heed to his prisoners threats  toward evening having gone without drink infinitely longer than was customary they made appeals to which steele was deaf  he left the jail however just before dark and when we met he told me to be on hand to help him watch that night we went around the outskirts of town carrying two heavy doublebarreled shotguns steele had gotten somewhere and taking up a position behind bushes in the lot adjoining the jail we awaited developments  steele was not above paying back these fellows  all the early part of the evening gangs of half a dozen men or more came down the street and had their last treat at the expense of the jail guard and jailer these prisoners yelled for drinknot water but drink and the more they yelled the more merriment was loosed upon the night air  about ten oclock the last gang left to the despair of the hungry and thirsty prisoners  steele and i had hugely enjoyed the fun and thought the best part of the joke for us was yet to come the moon had arisen and though somewhat hazed by clouds had lightened the night we were hidden about sixty paces from the jail a little above it and we had a fine command of the door  about eleven oclock when all was still we heard soft steps back of the jail and soon two dark forms stole round in front they laid down something that gave forth a metallic clink like a crowbar we heard whisperings and then low coarse laughs  then the rescuers who undoubtedly were miller and bass set to work to open the door softly they worked at first but as that door had been put there to stay and they were not fond of hard work they began to swear and make noises  steele whispered to me to wait until the door had been opened and then when all four presented a good target to fire both barrels we could easily have slipped down and captured the rescuers but that was not steeles game  a trick met by a trick cunning matching craft would be the surest of all ways to command respect  four times the workers had to rest and once they were so enraged at the insistence of the prisoners who wanted to delay proceedings to send one of them after a bottle that they swore they would go away and cut the job altogether  but they were prevailed upon to stay and attack the stout door once more finally it yielded with enough noise to have awakened sleepers a block distant and forth into the moonlight came rescuers and rescued with low satisfied grunts of laughter  just then steele and i each discharged both barrels and the reports blended as one in a tremendous boom  that little compact bunch disintegrated like quicksilver two stumbled over the others leaped out and all yelled in pain and terror then the fallen ones scrambled up and began to hobble and limp and jerk along after their comrades  before the four of them got out of sight they had ceased their yells but were moving slowly hanging on to one another in a way that satisfied us they would be lame for many a day  next morning at breakfast dick regaled me with an elaborate story about how the ranger had turned the tables on the jokers evidently in a night the whole town knew it  probably a desperate stand of steeles even to the extreme of killing men could not have educated these crude natives so quickly into the realization that the ranger was not to be fooled with  that morning i went for a ride with the girls and both had heard something and wanted to know everything i had become a newscarrier and miss sampson never thought of questioning me in regard to my fund of information  she showed more than curiosity the account i gave of the jail affair amused her and made sally laugh heartily  diane questioned me also about a rumor that had come to her concerning george wright  he had wounded himself with a gun it seemed and though not seriously injured was not able to go about he had not been up to the ranch for days  i asked papa about him said diane and papa laughed likewell like a regular hyena i was dumbfounded papas so queer he looked thunderclouds at me  when i insisted for i wanted to know he ripped out yes the damn fool got himself shot and im sorry its not worse  now russ what do you make of my dad cheerful and kind isnt he  i laughed with sally but i disclaimed any knowledge of georges accident i hated the thought of wright let alone anything concerning the fatal certainty that sooner or later these cousins of his were to suffer through him  sally did not make these rides easy for me for she was sweeter than anything that has a name since the evening of the dance i had tried to avoid her either she was sincerely sorry for her tantrum or she was bent upon utterly destroying my peace  i took good care we were never alone for in that case if she ever got into my arms again i would find the ground slipping from under me  despite however the wear and constant strain of resisting sally i enjoyed the ride there was a charm about being with these girls  then perhaps miss sampsons growing unconscious curiosity in regard to steele was no little satisfaction to me  i pretended a reluctance to speak of the ranger but when i did it was to drop a subtle word or briefly tell of an action that suggested such  i never again hinted the thing that had been such a shock to her what was in her mind i could not guess her curiosity perhaps the greater part was due to a generous nature not entirely satisfied with itself she probably had not abandoned her fathers estimate of the ranger but absolute assurance that this was just did not abide with her for the rest she was like any other girl a worshipper of the lion in a man a weaver of romance ignorant of her own heart  not the least talked of and speculated upon of all the details of the jail incident was the part played by storekeeper jones who had informed upon his assailants steele and i both awaited results of this significant fact  when would the town wake up not only to a little nerve but to the usefulness of a ranger  three days afterward steele told me a woman accosted him on the street she seemed a poor hardworking person plain spoken and honest  her husband did not drink enough to complain of but he liked to gamble and he had been fleeced by a crooked game in jack martins saloon other wives could make the same complaints it was gods blessing for such women that ranger steele had come to linrock  of course he could not get back the lost money but would it be possible to close martins place or at least break up the crooked game  steele had asked this woman whose name was price how much her husband had lost and being told he assured her that if he found evidence of cheating not only would he get back the money but also he would shut up martins place  steele instructed me to go that night to the saloon in question and get in the game i complied and in order not to be overcarefully sized up by the dealer i pretended to be well under the influence of liquor  by nine oclock when steele strolled in i had the game well studied and a more flagrantly crooked one i had never sat in it was barefaced robbery  steele and i had agreed upon a sign from me because he was not so adept in the intricacies of gambling as i was i was not in a hurry however for there was a little frecklefaced cattleman in the game and he had been losing too he had sold a bunch of stock that day and had considerable money which evidently he was to be deprived of before he got started for del rio  steele stood at our backs and i could feel his presence he thrilled me he had some kind of effect on the others especially the dealer who was honest enough while the ranger looked on  when however steele shifted his attention to other tables and players our dealer reverted to his crooked work i was about to make a disturbance when the little cattleman leaning over fire in his eye and gun in hand made it for me  evidently he was a keener and nervier gambler than he had been taken for there might have been gunplay right then if steele had not interfered  hold on he yelled leaping for our table put up your gun  who are you demanded the cattleman never moving better keep out of this  im steele put up your gun  youre thet ranger hey replied the other all right but just a minute i want this dealer to sit quiet ive been robbed and i want my money back  certainly the dealer and everyone else round the table sat quiet while the cattleman coolly held his gun leveled  crooked game asked steele bending over the table show me  it did not take the aggrieved gambler more than a moment to prove his assertion steele however desired corroboration from others beside the cattleman and one by one he questioned them  to my surprise one of the players admitted his conviction that the game was not straight  what do you say demanded steele of me  worsen a holdup mr ranger i burst out let me show you  deftly i made the dealers guilt plain to all and then i seconded the cattlemans angry claim for lost money the players from other tables gathered round curious muttering  and just then martin strolled in his appearance was not prepossessing  whats this holler he asked and halted as he saw the cattlemans gun still in line with the dealer  martin you know what its for replied steele take your dealer and digunless you want to see me clean out your place  sullen and fierce martin stood looking from steele to the cattleman and then the dealer some men in the crowd muttered and that was a signal for steele to shove the circle apart and get out back to the wall  the cattleman rose slowly in the center pulling another gun and he certainly looked business to me  wal ranger i reckon ill hang round an see you aint bothered none he said friend he went on indicating me with a slight wave of one extended gun jest rustle the money in sight well square up after the show  i reached out and swept the considerable sum toward me and pocketing it i too rose ready for what might come  youall give me elbow room yelled steele at martin and his cowed contingent  steele looked around evidently for some kind of implement and espying a heavy ax in a corner he grasped it and sweeping it to and fro as if it had been a buggywhip he advanced on the faro layout the crowd fell back edging toward the door  one crashing blow wrecked the dealers box and table sending them splintering among the tumbled chairs then the giant ranger began to spread further ruin about him  martins place was rough and bare of the most primitive order and like a thousand other dens of its kind consisted of a large room with adobe walls a rude bar of boards piles of kegs in a corner a stove and a few tables with chairs  steele required only one blow for each article he struck and he demolished it he stove in the head of each keg  when the dark liquor gurgled out martin cursed and the crowd followed suit that was a loss  the little cattleman holding the men covered backed them out of the room martin needing a plain stern word to put him out entirely i went out too for i did not want to miss any moves on the part of that gang  close behind me came the cattleman the kind of cool nervy texan i liked he had martin well judged too for there was no evidence of any bold resistance  but there were shouts and loud acclamations and these with the crashing blows of steeles ax brought a curious and growing addition to the crowd  soon sodden thuds from inside the saloon and red dust pouring out the door told that steele was attacking the walls of martins place those adobe bricks when old and crumbly were easily demolished  steele made short work of the back wall and then he smashed out half of the front of the building that seemed to satisfy him  when he stepped out of the dust he was wet with sweat dirty and disheveled hot with his exertiona man whose great stature and muscular development expressed a wonderful physical strength and energy and his somber face with the big gray eyes like open furnaces expressed a passion equal to his strength  perhaps only then did wild and lawless linrock grasp the real significance of this ranger  steele threw the ax at martins feet  martin dont reopen here he said curtly dont start another place in linrock if you dojail at austin for years  martin livid and scowling yet seemingly dazed with what had occurred slunk away accompanied by his cronies steele took the money i had appropriated returned to me what i had lost did likewise with the cattleman and then taking out the sum named by mrs price he divided the balance with the other players who had been in the game  then he stalked off through the crowd as if he knew that men who slunk from facing him would not have nerve enough to attack him even from behind  wal damn me ejaculated the little cattleman in mingled admiration and satisfaction so thets that texas ranger steele hey never seen him before all texas thet ranger  i lingered downtown as much to enjoy the sensation as to gain the different points of view  no doubt about the sensation in one hour every male resident of linrock and almost every female had viewed the wreck of martins place a fire could not have created half the excitement  and in that excitement both men and women gave vent to speech they might not have voiced at a calmer moment the women at least were not afraid to talk and i made mental note of the things they said  did he do it all alone  thank god a mans come to linrock  good for molly price  oh itll make bad times for linrock  it almost seemed that all the women were glad and this was in itself a vindication of the rangers idea of law  the men howeverblandy proprietor of the hope so and others of his ilk together with the whole brood of idle gaming loungers and in fact even storekeepers ranchers cowboysall shook their heads sullenly or doubtfully  striking indeed now was the absence of any joking steele had showed his hand and as one gambler said its a hard hand to call  the truth was this ranger service was hateful to the freeandeasy texan who lived by anything except hard and honest work and it was damnably hateful to the lawless class steeles authority now obvious to all was unlimited it could go as far as he had power to carry it  from present indications that power might be considerable the work of native sheriffs and constables in western texas had been a farce an utter failure if an honest native of a community undertook to be a sheriff he became immediately a target for rowdy cowboys and other vicious elements  many a town south and west of san antonio owed its peace and prosperity to rangers and only to them they had killed or driven out the criminals they interpreted the law for themselves and it was only such an attitude toward lawthe stern uncompromising implacable extermination of the lawlessthat was going to do for all texas what it had done for part  steele was the driving wedge that had begun to split linrocksplit the honest from dominance by the dishonest to be sure steele might be killed at any moment and that contingency was voiced in the growl of one sullen man who said wot the hell are we up against aint somebody goin to plug this ranger  it was then that the thing for which steele stood the ranger serviceto help to save to defend to punish with such somber menace of death as seemed embodied in his cold attitude toward resistancetook hold of linrock and sunk deep into both black and honest hearts  it was what was behind steele that seemed to make him more than an officera man  i could feel how he began to loom up the embodiment of a powerful forcethe ranger servicethe fame of which long known to this lawless pecos gang but scouted as a vague and distant thing now became an actuality a ranger in the flesh whose surprising attributes included both the law and the enforcement of it  when i reached the ranch the excitement had preceded me miss sampson and sally both talking at once acquainted me with the fact that they had been in a store on the main street a block or more from martins place  they had seen the crowd heard the uproar and as they had been hurriedly started toward home by their attendant dick they had encountered steele stalking by  he looked grand exclaimed sally  then i told the girls the whole story in detail  russ is it true just as you tell it inquired diane earnestly  absolutely i know mrs price went to steele with her trouble i was in martins place when he entered also i was playing in the crooked game and i saw him wreck martins place also i heard him forbid martin to start another place in linrock  then he does do splendid things she said softly as if affirming to herself  i walked on then having gotten a glimpse of colonel sampson in the background before i reached the corrals sally came running after me quite flushed and excited  russ my uncle wants to see you she said hes in a bad temper dont lose yours please  she actually took my hand what a child she was in all ways except that fatal propensity to flirt her statement startled me out of any further thought of her why did sampson want to see me he never noticed me i dreaded facing himnot from fear but because i must see more and more of the signs of guilt in dianes father  he awaited me on the porch as usual he wore riding garb but evidently he had not been out so far this day he looked worn there was a furtive shadow in his eyes the haughty imperious temper despite sallys conviction seemed to be in abeyance  russ whats this i hear about martins saloon being cleaned out he asked dick cant give particulars  briefly and concisely i told the colonel exactly what had happened he chewed his cigar then spat it out with an unintelligible exclamation  martins no worse than others he said blandy leans to crooked faro ive tried to stop that anyway if steele can more power to him  sampson turned on his heel then and left me with a queer feeling of surprise and pity  he had surprised me before but he had never roused the least sympathy it was probably that sampson was indeed powerless no matter what his position  i had known men before who had become involved in crime yet were too manly to sanction a crookedness they could not help  miss sampson had been standing in her door i could tell she had heard she looked agitated i knew she had been talking to her father  russ he hates the ranger she said thats what i fear itll bring trouble on us besides like everybody here hes biased he cant see anything good in steele yet he says more power to him im mystified and oh im between two fires                                       steeles next noteworthy achievement was as new to me as it was strange to linrock i heard a good deal about it from my acquaintances some little from steele and the concluding incident i saw and heard myself  andy vey was a brokendown rustler whose activity had ceased and who spent his time hanging on at the places frequented by younger and better men of his kind as he was a parasite he was often thrown out of the dens  moreover it was an open secret that he had been a rustler and the men with whom he associated had not yet to most of linrock become known as such  one night vey had been badly beaten in some back room of a saloon and carried out into a vacant lot and left there he lay there all that night and all the next day probably he would have died there had not steele happened along  the ranger gathered up the crippled rustler took him home attended to his wounds nursed him and in fact spent days in the little adobe house with him  during this time i saw steele twice at night out in our rendezvous he had little to communicate but was eager to hear when i had seen jim hoden morton wright sampson and all i could tell about them and the significance of things in town  andy vey recovered and it was my good fortune to be in the hope so when he came in and addressed a crowd of gamesters there  fellers he said im biddin goodby to them as was once my friends im leavin linrock an im askin some of you to take thet goodby an a partin word to them as did me dirt  i aint agoin to say if id crossed the trail of this ranger years ago thet id of turned round an gone straight but mebbe i wouldmebbe theres a hell of a lot a man doesnt know till too late im old now ready fer the bone pile an it doesnt matter but ive got a head on me yet an i want to give a hunch to thet gang who done me an that hunch wants to go around an up to the big guns of pecos  this texas star ranger was the feller who took me in id of died like a poisoned coyote but fer him an he talked to me he gave me money to git out of pecos mebbe everybodyll think he helped me because he wanted me to squeal to squeal whos who round these rustler diggins wal he never asked me mebbe he seen i wasnt a squealer but im thinkin he wouldnt ask a feller thet nohow  an heres my hunch steele has spotted the outfit thet aint so much mebbe but ive been with him an im old figgerin men jest as sure as god made little apples hes a goin to put thet outfit throughor hes agoin to kill them     chapter 6  enter jack blome   strange that the narrating of this incident made diane sampson unhappy  when i told her she exhibited one flash of gladness such as any woman might have shown for a noble deed and then she became thoughtful almost gloomy sad i could not understand her complex emotions perhaps she contrasted steele with her father perhaps she wanted to believe in steele and dared not perhaps she had all at once seen the ranger in his true light and to her undoing  she bade me take sally for a ride and sought her room i had my misgivings when i saw sally come out in that trim cowgirl suit and look at me as if to say this day would be my waterloo  but she rode hard and long ahead of me before she put any machinations into effect the first one found me with a respectful demeanor but an internal conflict  russ tighten my cinch she said when i caught up with her  dismounting i drew the cinch up another hole and fastened it  my boots unlaced too she added slipping a shapely foot out of the stirrup  to be sure it was very much unlaced i had to take off my gloves to lace it up and i did it heroically with bent head and outward calm when all the time i was mad to snatch the girl out of the saddle and hold her tight or run off with her or do some other fool thing  russ i believe dianes in love with steele she said soberly with the sweet confidence she sometimes manifested in me  small wonder its in the air i replied  she regarded me doubtfully  it was she retorted demurely  the fickleness of women is no new thing to me i didnt expect waters to last long  certainly not when there are nicer fellows around one anyway when he cares  a little brown hand slid out of its glove and dropped to my shoulder  make up youve been hateful lately make up with me  it was not so much what she said as the sweet tone of her voice and the nearness of her that made a tumult within me i felt the blood tingle to my face  why should i make up with you i queried in self defense you are only flirting you wontyou cant ever be anything to me really  sally bent over me and i had not the nerve to look up  never mind thingsreally she replied the futures far off let it alone were together ii like you russ and ive got to beto be loved there i never confessed that to any other man youve been hateful when we might have had such fun the rides in the sun in the open with the wind in our faces the walks at night in the moonlight russ havent you missed something  the sweetness and seductiveness of her the little luring devil of her irresistible as they were were no more irresistible than the naturalness the truth of her  i trembled even before i looked up into her flushed face and arch eyes and after that i knew if i could not frighten her out of this daring mood i would have to yield despite my conviction that she only trifled as my manhood as well as duty to steele forced me to be unyielding all that was left seemed to be to frighten her  the instant this was decided a wave of emotionlove regret bitterness angersurged over me making me shake i felt the skin on my face tighten and chill i grasped her with strength that might have need to hold a plunging unruly horse i hurt her i held her as in a vise  and the action the feel of her her suddenly uttered cry wrought against all pretense hurt me as my brutality hurt her and then i spoke what was hard passionate truth  girl youre playing with fire i cried out hoarsely i love youlove you as id want my sister loved i asked you to marry me that was proof if it was foolish even if you were on the square which youre not we couldnt ever be anything to each other understand theres a reason besides your being above me i cant stand it stop playing with me or illill  whatever i meant to say was not spoken for sally turned deathly white probably from my grasp and my looks as well as my threat  i let go of her and stepping back to my horse choked down my emotion  russ she faltered and there was womanliness and regret trembling with the fear in her voice ii am on the square  that had touched the real heart of the girl  if you are then play the game square i replied darkly  i will russ i promise ill never tease or coax you again if i do then ill deserve what youwhat i get but russ dont think me aa fourflush  all the long ride home we did not exchange another word the traveling gait of sallys horse was a lope that of mine a trot and therefore to my relief she was always out in front  as we neared the ranch however sally slowed down until i caught up with her and side by side we rode the remainder of the way at the corrals while i unsaddled she lingered  russ you didnt tell me if you agreed with me about diane she said finally  maybe youre right i hope shes fallen in love with steele lord knows i hope so i blurted out  i bit my tongue there was no use in trying to be as shrewd with women as i was with men i made no reply  misery loves company maybe thats why she added you told me steele lost his head over diane at first sight well we all have company good night russ  that night i told steele about the singular effect the story of his treatment of vey had upon miss sampson he could not conceal his feelings i read him like an open book  if she was unhappy because he did something really good then she was unhappy because she was realizing she had wronged him  steele never asked questions but the hungry look in his eyes was enough to make even a truthful fellow exaggerate things  i told him how diane was dressed how her face changed with each emotion how her eyes burned and softened and shadowed how her voice had been deep and full when she admitted her father hated him how much she must have meant when she said she was between two fires i divined how he felt and i tried to satisfy in some little measure his craving for news of her  when i had exhausted my fund and stretched my imagination i was rewarded by being told that i was a regular old woman for gossip  much taken back by this remarkable statement i could but gape at my comrade irritation had followed shortly upon his curiosity and pleasure and then the old sane mind reasserted itself the old stern look a little sad now replaced the glow the strange eagerness of youth on his face  son i beg your pardon he said with his hand on my shoulder were rangers but we cant help being human to speak right out it seems two sweet and lovable girls have come unfortunately for us all across the dark trail were on let us find what solace we can in the hope that somehow god only knows how in doing our duty as rangers we may yet be doing right by these two innocent girls i ask you as my friend please do not speak again to me ofmiss sampson  i left him and went up the quiet trail with the thick shadows all around me and the cold stars overhead and i was sober in thought sick at heart for him as much as for myself and i tortured my mind in fruitless conjecture as to what the end of this strange and fateful adventure would be  i discovered that less and less the old wild spirit abided with me and i become conscious of a dull deepseated ache in my breast a pang in the bone  from that day there was a change in diane sampson she became feverishly active she wanted to ride to see for herself what was going on in linrock to learn of that wild pecos county life at first hand  she made such demands on my time now that i scarcely ever found an hour to be with or near steele until after dark however as he was playing a waiting game on the rustlers keeping out of the resorts for the present i had not great cause for worry hoden was slowly gathering men together a band of trustworthy ones and until this organization was complete and ready steele thought better to go slow  it was of little use for me to remonstrate with miss sampson when she refused to obey a distracted and angry father i began to feel sorry for sampson he was an unscrupulous man but he loved this daughter who belonged to another and better and past side of his life  i heard him appeal to her to go back to louisiana to let him take her home giving as urgent reason the probability of trouble for him she could not help could only handicap him  she agreed to go provided he sold his property took the best of his horses and went with her back to the old home to live there the rest of their lives he replied with considerable feeling that he wished he could go but it was impossible then that settled the matter for her she averred  failing to persuade her to leave linrock he told her to keep to the ranch naturally in spite of his anger miss sampson refused to obey and she frankly told him that it was the free unfettered life of the country the riding here and there that appealed so much to her  sampson came to me a little later and his worn face showed traces of internal storm  russ for a while there i wanted to get rid of you he said ive changed diane always was a spoiled kid now shes a woman somethings fired her blood maybe its this damned wild country anyway shes got the bit between her teeth shell run till shes run herself out  now it seems the safety of diane and sally too has fallen into your hands the girls wont have one of my cowboys near them lately theyve got shy of george too between you and me i want to tell you that conditions here in pecos are worse than theyve seemed since youall reached the ranch but bad work will break out againits coming soon  i cant stop it the town will be full of the hardest gang in western texas my daughter and sally would not be safe if left alone to go anywhere with you perhaps theyll be safe can i rely on you  yes sampson you sure can i replied im on pretty good terms with most everybody in town i think i can say none of the tough set who hang out down there would ever made any move while im with the girls but ill be pretty careful to avoid them and particularly strange fellows who may come riding in  and if any of them do meet us and start trouble im going for my gun thats all there wont be any talk  good ill back you sampson replied understand russ i didnt want you here but i always had you sized up as a pretty hard nut a man not to be trifled with youve got a bad name diane insists the names not deserved shed trust you with herself under any circumstances and the kid sally shed be fond of you if it wasnt for the drink have you been drunk a good deal straight now between you and me  not once i replied  georges a liar then hes had it in for you since that day at sanderson look out you two dont clash hes got a temper and when hes drinking hes a devil keep out of his way  ive stood a good deal from wright and guess i can stand more  all right russ he continued as if relieved chuck the drink and cards for a while and keep an eye on the girls when my affairs straighten out maybe ill make you a proposition  sampson left me material for thought perhaps it was not only the presence of a ranger in town that gave him concern nor the wilfulness of his daughter there must be internal strife in the rustler gang with which we had associated him  perhaps a menace of publicity rather than risk was the cause of the wearing strain on him i began to get a closer insight into sampson and in the absence of any conclusive evidence of his personal baseness i felt pity for him  in the beginning he had opposed me just because i did not happen to be a cowboy he had selected this latest interview with me amounting in some instances to confidence proved absolutely that he had not the slightest suspicion that i was otherwise than the cowboy i pretended to be  another interesting deduction was that he appeared to be out of patience with wright in fact i imagined i sensed something of fear and distrust in this spoken attitude toward his relative not improbably here was the internal strife between sampson and wright and there flashed into my mind absolutely without reason an idea that the clash was over diane sampson  i scouted this intuitive idea as absurd but just the same it refused to be dismissed  as i turned my back on the coarse and exciting life in the saloons and gambling hells and spent all my time except when sleeping out in the windy open under blue sky and starry heaven my spirit had an uplift  i was glad to be free of that job it was bad enough to have to go into these dens to arrest men let alone living with them almost being one  diane sampson noted a change in me attributed it to the absence of the influence of drink and she was glad sally made no attempt to conceal her happiness and to my dismay she utterly failed to keep her promise not to tease or tempt me further  she was adorable distracting  we rode every day and almost all day we took our dinner and went clear to the foothills to return as the sun set we visited outlying ranches waterholes old adobe houses famous in one way or another as scenes of past fights of rustlers and ranchers  we rode to the little village of sampson and halfway to sanderson and all over the country  there was no satisfying miss sampson with rides new places new faces new adventures and every time we rode out she insisted on first riding through linrock and every time we rode home she insisted on going back that way  we visited all the stores the blacksmith the wagon shop the feed and grain houseseverywhere that she could find excuse for visiting i had to point out to her all the infamous dens in town and all the lawless and lounging men we met  she insisted upon being shown the inside of the hope so to the extreme confusion of that bewildered resort  i pretended to be blind to this restless curiosity sally understood the cause too and it divided her between a sweet gravity and a naughty humor  the last however she never evinced in sight or hearing of diane  it seemed that we were indeed fated to cross the path of vaughn steele we saw him working round his adobe house then we saw him on horseback once we met him face to face in a store  he gazed steadily into diane sampsons eyes and went his way without any sign of recognition there was red in her face when he passed and white when he had gone  that day she rode as i had never seen her risking her life unmindful of her horse  another day we met steele down in the valley where inquiry discovered to us he had gone to the home of an old cattleman who lived alone and was ill  last and perhaps most significant of all these meetings was the one when we were walking tired horses home through the main street of linrock and came upon steele just in time to see him in action  it happened at a corner where the usual slouchy shirtsleeved loungers were congregated they were in high glee over the predicament of one ruffian who had purchased or been given a poor emaciated little burro that was on his last legs the burro evidently did not want to go with its new owner who pulled on a halter and then viciously swung the end of the rope to make welts on the worn and scarred back  if there was one thing that diane sampson could not bear it was to see an animal in pain she passionately loved horses and hated the sight of a spur or whip  when we saw the man beating the little burro she cried out to me  make the brute stop  i might have made a move had i not on the instant seen steele heaving into sight round the corner  just then the fellow whom i now recognized to be a despicable character named andrews began to bestow heavy and brutal kicks upon the body of the little burro these kicks sounded deep hollow almost like the boom of a drum  the burro uttered the strangest sound i ever heard issue from any beast and it dropped in its tracks with jerking legs that told any horseman what had happened steele saw the last swings of andrews heavy boot he yelled it was a sharp yell that would have made anyone start but it came too late for the burro had dropped  steele knocked over several of the jeering men to get to andrews he kicked the fellows feet from under him sending him hard to the ground  then steele picked up the end of the halter and began to swing it powerfully resounding smacks mingled with hoarse bellows of fury and pain andrews flopped here and there trying to arise but every time the heavy knotted halter beat him down  presently steele stopped andrews rose right in front of the ranger and there like the madman he was he went for his gun  but it scarcely leaped from its holster when steeles swift hand intercepted it steele clutched andrews arm  then came a wrench a cracking of bones a scream of agony  the gun dropped into the dust and in a moment of wrestling fury andrews broken beaten down just able to moan lay beside it  steele so cool and dark for a man who had acted with such passionate swiftness faced the others as if to dare them to move they neither moved nor spoke and then he strode away  miss sampson did not speak a word while we were riding the rest of the way home but she was strangely white of face and dark of eye sally could not speak fast enough to say all she felt  and i of course had my measure of feelings one of them was that as sure as the sun rose and set it was written that diane sampson was to love vaughn steele  i could not read her mind but i had a mind of my own  how could any woman seeing this maligned and menaced ranger whose life was in danger every moment he spent on the streets in the light of his action on behalf of a poor little beast help but wonder and brood over the magnificent height he might reach if he had lovepassiona woman for his inspiration  it was the day after this incident that as sally diane and i were riding homeward on the road from sampson i caught sight of a group of dark horses and riders swiftly catching up with us  we were on the main road in plain sight of town and passing by ranches nevertheless i did not like the looks of the horsemen and grew uneasy still i scarcely thought it needful to race our horses just to reach town a little ahead of these strangers  accordingly they soon caught up with us  they were five in number all darkfaced except one darkclad and superbly mounted on dark bays and blacks they had no pack animals and for that matter carried no packs at all  four of them at a swinging canter passed us and the fifth pulled his horse to suit our pace and fell in between sally and me  good day he said pleasantly to me dont mind my ridin in with youall i hope  considering his pleasant approach i could not but be civil  he was a singularly handsome fellow at a quick glance under forty years with curly blond hair almost gold a skin very fair for that country and the keenest clearest boldest blue eyes i had ever seen in a man  youre russ i reckon he said some of my men have seen you ridin round with sampsons girls im jack blome  he did not speak that name with any flaunt or flourish he merely stated it  blome the rustler i grew tight all over  still manifestly there was nothing for me to do but return his pleasantry i really felt less uneasiness after he had made himself known to me and without any awkwardness i introduced him to the girls  he took off his sombrero and made gallant bows to both  miss sampson had heard of him and his record and she could not help a paleness a shrinking which however he did not appear to notice sally had been dying to meet a real rustler and here he was a very prince of rascals  but i gathered that she would require a little time before she could be natural blome seemed to have more of an eye for sally than for diane do you like pecos he asked sally  out here oh yes indeed she replied  like ridin  i love horses  like almost every man who made sallys acquaintance he hit upon the subject best calculated to make her interesting to freeriding outdoor western men  that he loved a thoroughbred horse himself was plain he spoke naturally to sally with interest just as i had upon first meeting her and he might not have been jack blome for all the indication he gave of the fact in his talk  but the look of the man was different he was a desperado one of the dashing reckless kindmore famous along the pecos and rio grande than more really desperate men his attire proclaimed a vanity seldom seen in any westerner except of that unusual brand yet it was neither gaudy or showy  one had to be close to blome to see the silk the velvet the gold the fine leather when i envied a mans spurs then they were indeed worth coveting  blome had a short rifle and a gun in saddlesheaths my sharp eye running over him caught a row of notches on the bone handle of the big colt he packed  it was then that the marshal the ranger in me went hot under the collar the custom that desperadoes and gunfighters had of cutting a notch on their guns for every man killed was one of which the mere mention made my gorge rise  at the edge of town blome doffed his sombrero again said adios and rode on ahead of us and it was then i was hard put to it to keep track of the queries exclamations and other wild talk of two very much excited young ladies i wanted to think i needed to think  wasnt he lovely oh i could adore him rapturously uttered miss sally langdon several times to my ultimate disgust  also after blome had ridden out of sight miss sampson lost the evident effect of his sinister presence and she joined miss langdon in paying the rustler compliments too perhaps my irritation was an indication of the quick and subtle shifting of my mind to harsher thought  jack blome i broke in upon their adulations rustler and gunman did you see the notches on his gun every notch for a man hes killed for weeks reports have come to linrock that soon as he could get round to it hed ride down and rid the community of that bothersome fellow that texas ranger hes come to kill vaughn steele     chapter 7  diane and vaughn   then as gloom descended on me with my uttered thought my heart smote me at sallys broken oh russ no no diane sampson bent dark shocked eyes upon the hill and ranch in front of her but they were sightless they looked into space and eternity and in them i read the truth suddenly and cruelly revealed to hershe loved steele  i found it impossible to leave miss sampson with the impression i had given my own mood fitted a kind of ruthless pleasure in seeing her suffer through love as i had intimation i was to suffer  but now when my strange desire that she should love steele had its fulfilment and my fiendish subtleties to that end had been crowned with success i was confounded in pity and the enormity of my crime for it had been a crime to make or help to make this noble and beautiful woman love a ranger the enemy of her father and surely the author of her coming misery i felt shocked at my work i tried to hang an excuse on my old motive that through her love we might all be saved when it was too late however i found that this motive was wrong and perhaps without warrant  we rode home in silence miss sampson contrary to her usual custom of riding to the corrals or the porch dismounted at a path leading in among the trees and flowers i want to rest to think before i go in she said  sally accompanied me to the corrals as our horses stopped at the gate i turned to find confirmation of my fears in sallys wet eyes  russ she said its worse than we thought  worse i should say so i replied  itll about kill her she never cared that way for any man when the sampson women love they love  well youre lucky to be a langdon i retorted bitterly  im sampson enough to be unhappy she flashed back at me and im langdon enough to have some sense you havent any sense or kindness either whyd you want to blurt out that jack blome was here to kill steele  im ashamed sally i returned with hanging head ive been a brute ive wanted her to love steele i thought i had a reason but now it seems silly just now i wanted to see how much she did care  sally the other day you said misery loved company thats the trouble im sorebitter im like a sick coyote that snaps at everything ive wanted you to go into the very depths of despair but i couldnt send you so i took out my spite on poor miss sampson it was a damn unmanly thing for me to do  oh its not so bad as all that but you might have been less abrupt russ you seem to take anan awful tragic view of youryour own case  tragic hah i cried like the villain in the play what other way could i look at it i tell you i love you so i cant sleep or do anything  thats not tragic when youve no chance then thats tragic  sally as swiftly as she had blushed could change into that deadly sweet mood she did both now she seemed warm softened agitated how could this be anything but sincere i felt myself slipping so i laughed harshly  chance ive no chance on earth  try she whispered  but i caught myself in time then the shock of bitter renunciation made it easy for me to simulate anger  you promised not tonot to i began choking my voice was hoarse and it broke matters surely far removed from pretense  i had seen sally langdon in varying degrees of emotion but never as she appeared now she was pale and she trembled a little if it was not fright then i could not tell what it was but there were contrition and earnestness about her too  russ i know i promised not toto teaseto tempt you anymore she faltered ive broken it im ashamed i havent played the game square but i couldnti cant help myself ive got sense enough not to engage myself to you but i cant keep from loving you i cant let you alone thereif you want it on the square whats more ill go on as i have done unless you keep away from me i dont care what i deservewhat you doi willi will  she had begun falteringly and she ended passionately  somehow i kept my head even though my heart pounded like a hammer and the blood drummed in my ears it was the thought of steele that saved me but i felt cold at the narrow margin i had reached a point i feared where a kiss one touch from this bewildering creature of fire and change and sweetness would make me put her before steele and my duty  sally if you dare break your promise again youll wish you never had been born i said with all the fierceness at my command  i wish that now and you cant bluff me mr gambler i may have no hand to play but you cant make me lay it down she replied  something told me sally langdon was finding herself that presently i could not frighten her and thenthen i would be doomed  why if i got drunk i might do anything i said cool and hard now cut off your beautiful chestnut hair for bracelets for my arms  sally laughed but she was still white she was indeed finding herself if you ever get drunk again you cant kiss me any more and if you dontyou can  i felt myself shake and with all of the iron will i could assert i hid from her the sweetness of this thing that was my weakness and her strength  i might lasso you from my horse drag you through the cactus i added with the implacability of an apache  russ she cried something in this last ridiculous threat had found a vital mark after all maybe those awful stories joe harper told about you were true  they sure were i declared with great relief and now to forget ourselves im more than sorry i distressed miss sampson more than sorry because what i said wasnt on the square blome no doubt has come to linrock after steele his intention is to kill him i said thatlet miss sampson think it all meant fatality to the ranger but sally i dont believe that blome can kill steele any more thanthan you can  why she asked and she seemed eager glad  because hes not man enough thats all without details you need not worry and i wish youd go tell miss sampson  go yourself interrupted sally i think shes afraid of my eyes but she wont fear youd guess her secret  go to her russ find some excuse to tell her say you thought it over believed shed be distressed about what might never happen goand afterward pray for your sins you queer goodnatured lovemeddling cowboydevil you  for once i had no retort ready for sally i hurried off as quickly as i could walk in chaps and spurs  i found miss sampson sitting on a bench in the shade of a tree her pallor and quiet composure told of the conquering and passing of the storm always she had a smile for me and now it smote me for i in a sense had betrayed her  miss sampson i began awkwardly yet swiftly ii got to thinking it over and the idea struck me maybe you felt bad about this gunfighter blome coming down here to kill steele at first i imagined you felt sick just because there might be blood spilled then i thought youve showed interest in steelenaturally his kind of ranger work is bound to appeal to womenyou might be sorry it couldnt go on you might care  russ dont beat about the bush she said interrupting my floundering you know i care  how wonderful her eyes were thengreat dark sad gulfs with the soul of a woman at the bottom almost i loved her myself i did love her truth the woman in her that scorned any subterfuge  instantly she inspired me to command over myself listen i said jack blome has come here to meet steele there will be a fight but blome cant kill steele  how is that why cant he you said this blome was a killer of men you spoke of notches on his gun ive heard my father and my cousin too speak of blomes record he must be a terrible ruffian if his intent is evil why will he fail in it  because miss sampson when it comes to the last word steele will be on the lookout and blome wont be quick enough on the draw to kill him thats all  quick enough on the draw i understand but i want to know more  i doubt if theres a man on the frontier today quick enough to kill steele in an even break that means a fair fight this blome is conceited hell make the meeting fair enough itll come off about like this miss sampson  blome will send out his bluffhell begin to blowto look for steele but steele will avoid him as long as possibleperhaps altogether though thats improbable if they do meet then blome must force the issue its interesting to figure on that steele affects men strangely its all very well for this blome to rant about himself and to hunt steele up but the testll come when he faces the ranger he never saw steele he doesnt know what hes up against he knows steeles reputation but i dont mean that i mean steele in the flesh his nerve the something thats in his eyes  now when it comes to handling a gun the man doesnt breathe who has anything on steele there was an outlaw duane who might have killed steele had they ever met ill tell you duanes story some day a girl saved him made a ranger of him then got him to go far away from texas  that was wise indeed id like to hear the story she replied then after all russ in this dreadful part of texas life when man faces man its all in the quickness of hand  absolutely its the draw and steeles a wonder see here look at this  i stepped back and drew my gun  i didnt see how you did that she said curiously try it again  i complied and still she was not quick enough of eye to see my draw then i did it slowly explaining to her the action of hand and then of finger she seemed fascinated as a woman might have been by the striking power of a rattlesnake  so mens lives depend on that how horrible for me to be interestedto ask about itto watch you but im out here on the frontier now caught somehow in its wildness and i feel a relief a gladness to know vaughn steele has the skill you claim thank you russ  she seemed about to dismiss me then for she rose and half turned away then she hesitated she had one hand at her breast the other on the bench have you been with himtalked to him lately she asked and a faint rose tint came into her cheeks but her eyes were steady dark and deep and peered through and far beyond me  yes ive met him a few times around places  did he ever speak ofof me  once or twice and then as if he couldnt help it  what did he say  well the last time he seemed hungry to hear something about you he didnt exactly ask but all the same he was begging so i told him  what  oh how you were dressed how you looked what you said what you didall about you dont be offended with me miss sampson it was real charity i talk too much its my weakness please dont be offended  she never heard my apology or my entreaty there was a kind of glory in her eyes looking at her i found a dimness hazing my sight and when i rubbed it away it came back  thenwhat did he say this was whispered almost shyly and i could scarcely believe the proud miss sampson stood before me  why he flew into a fury called me an hastily i caught myself well he said if i wanted to talk to him any more not to speak of you he was sure unreasonable  russyou thinkyou told me onceheyou think he still she was not facing me at all now she had her head bent both hands were at her breast and i saw it heave her cheek was white as a flower her neck darkly richly red with mounting blood  i understood and i pitied her and hated myself and marveled at this thing love it made another woman out of diane sampson i could scarcely comprehend that she was asking me almost beseechingly for further assurance of steeles love i knew nothing of women but this seemed strange then a thought sent the blood chilling back to my heart had diane sampson guessed the guilt of her father was it more for his sake than for her own that she hopedfor surely she hopedthat steele loved her  here was more mystery more food for reflection only a powerful motive or a selfleveling love could have made a woman of diane sampsons pride ask such a question whatever her reason i determined to assure her once and forever what i knew to be true accordingly i told her in unforgettable words with my own regard for her and love for sally filling my voice with emotion how i could see that steele loved her how madly he was destined to love her how terribly hard that was going to make his work in linrock  there was a stillness about her then a light on her face which brought to my mind thought of sally when i had asked her to marry me  russ i beg youbring us together said miss sampson bring about a meeting you are my friend then she went swiftly away through the flowers leaving me there thrilled to my soul at her betrayal of herself ready to die in her service yet cursing the fatal day vaughn steele had chosen me for his comrade in this tragic game  that evening in the girls sittingroom where they invited me i was led into a discourse upon the gunfighters outlaws desperadoes and bad men of the frontier miss sampson and sally had been before their arrival in texas as ignorant of such characters as any girls in the north or east they were now peculiarly interested fascinated and at the same time repelled  miss sampson must have placed the rangers in one of those classes somewhat as governor smith had and her father too sally thought she was in love with a cowboy whom she had been led to believe had as bad a record as any they were certainly a most persuasive and appreciative audience so as it was in regard to horses if i knew any subject well it was this one of dangerous and bad men texas and the whole developing southwest was full of such characters it was a very difficult thing to distinguish between fighters who were bad men and fighters who were good men however it was no difficult thing for one of my calling to tell the difference between a real bad man and the imitation fourflush  then i told the girls the story of buck duane famous outlaw and ranger and i narrated the histories of murrell most terrible of bloodspillers ever known to texas of hardin whose long career of crime ended in the main street in huntsville when he faced buck duane of sandobal the mexican terror of cheseldine bland alloway and other outlaws of the rio grande of king fisher and thompson and sterrett all still living and still busy adding notches to their guns  i ended my little talk by telling the story of amos clark a criminal of a higher type than most bad men yet infinitely more dangerous because of that he was a southerner of good family after the war he went to dimmick county and there developed and prospered with the country he became the most influential citizen of his town and the richest in that section he held offices he was energetic in his opposition to rustlers and outlaws he was held in high esteem by his countrymen but this amos clark was the leader of a band of rustlers highwaymen and murderers  captain neal and some of his rangers ferreted out clarks relation to this lawless gang and in the end caught him redhanded he was arrested and eventually hanged his case was unusual and it furnished an example of what was possible in that wild country clark had a son who was honest and a wife whom he dearly loved both of whom had been utterly ignorant of the other and wicked side of life i told this last story deliberately yet with some misgivings i wanted to seei convinced myself it was needful for me to seeif miss sampson had any suspicion of her father to look into her face then was no easy task but when i did i experienced a shock though not exactly the kind i had prepared myself for  she knew something maybe she knew actually more than steele or i still if it were a crime she had a marvelous control over her true feelings                                       jack blome and his men had been in linrock for several days old snecker and his son bo had reappeared and other hardlooking customers new to me if not to linrock these helped to create a charged and waiting atmosphere the saloons did unusual business and were never closed respectable citizens of the town were awakened in the early dawn by rowdies carousing in the streets  steele kept pretty closely under cover he did not entertain the opinion nor did i that the first time he walked down the street he would be a target for blome and his gang things seldom happened that way and when they did happen so it was more accident than design blome was setting the stage for his little drama  meanwhile steele was not idle he told me he had met jim hoden morton and zimmer and that these men had approached others of like character a secret club had been formed and all the members were ready for action steele also told me that he had spent hours at night watching the house where george wright stayed when he was not up at sampsons wright had almost recovered from the injury to his arm but he still remained most of the time indoors at night he was visited or at least his house was by strange men who were swift stealthy mysteriousall men who formerly would not have been friends or neighbors  steele had not been able to recognize any of these night visitors and he did not think the time was ripe for a bold holding up of one of them  jim hoden had forcibly declared and stated that some deviltry was afoot something vastly different from blomes open intention of meeting the ranger  hoden was right not twentyfour hours after his last talk with steele in which he advised quick action he was found behind the little room of his restaurant with a bullet hole in his breast dead no one could be found who had heard a shot  it had been deliberate murder for behind the bar had been left a piece of paper rudely scrawled with a pencil  all friends of ranger steele look for the same  later that day i met steele at hodens and was with him when he looked at the body and the written message which spoke so tersely of the enmity toward him we left there together and i hoped steele would let me stay with him from that moment  russ its all in the dark he said i feel wrights hand in this  i agreed i remember his face at hodens that day you winged him because jim swore you were wrong not to kill instead of wing him you were wrong  no russ i never let feeling run wild with my head we cant prove a thing on wright  come on lets hunt him up ill bet i can accuse him and make him show his hand come on  that steele found me hard to resist was all the satisfaction i got for the anger and desire to avenge jim hoden that consumed me  son youll have your belly full of trouble soon enough replied steele hold yourself in wait try to keep your eye on sampson at night see if anyone visits him spy on him ill watch wright  dont you think youd do well to keep out of town especially when you sleep  sure ive got blankets out in the brush and i go there every night late and leave before daylight but i keep a light burning in the dobe house and make it look as if i were there  good that worried me now whats this murder of jim hoden going to do to morton zimmer and their crowd  russ theyve all got blood in their eyes thisll make them see red ive only to say the word and well have all the backing we need  have you run into blome  once i was across the street he came out of the hope so with some of his gang they lined up and watched me but i went right on  hes here looking for trouble steele  yes and hed have found it before this if i just knew his relation to sampson and wright  do you think blome a dangerous man to meet  hardly hes a genuine bad man but for all that hes not much to be feared if he were quietly keeping away from trouble then thatd be different blome will probably die in his boots thinking hes the worst man and the quickest one on the draw in the west  that was conclusive enough for me the little shadow of worry that had haunted me in spite of my confidence vanished entirely  russ for the present help me do something for jim hodens family went on steele his wifes in bad shape shes not a strong woman there are a lot of kids and you know jim hoden was poor she told me her neighbors would keep shy of her now theyd be afraid oh its tough but we can put jim away decently and help his family  several days after this talk with steele i took miss sampson and sally out to see jim hodens wife and children i knew steele would be there that afternoon but i did not mention this fact to miss sampson we rode down to the little adobe house which belonged to mrs hodens people and where steele and i had moved her and the children after jim hodens funeral the house was small but comfortable and the yard green and shady  if this poor wife and mother had not been utterly forsaken by neighbors and friends it certainly appeared so for to my knowledge no one besides steele and me visited her miss sampson had packed a big basket full of good things to eat and i carried this in front of me on the pommel as we rode we hitched our horses to the fence and went round to the back of the house there was a little porch with a stone flooring and here several children were playing the door stood open at my knock mrs hoden bade me come in evidently steele was not there so i went in with the girls  mrs hoden ive brought miss sampson and her cousin to see you i said cheerfully  the little room was not very light there being only one window and the door but mrs hoden could be seen plainly enough as she lay hollowcheeked and haggard on a bed once she had evidently been a woman of some comeliness the ravages of trouble and grief were there to read in her worn face it had not however any of the hard and bitter lines that had characterized her husbands  i wondered considering that sampson had ruined hoden how mrs hoden was going to regard the daughter of an enemy  so youre roger sampsons girl queried the woman with her bright black eyes fixed on her visitor  yes replied miss sampson simply this is my cousin sally langdon weve come to nurse you take care of the children help you in any way youll let us  there was a long silence  well you look a little like sampson finally said mrs hoden but youre not at all like him you must take after your mother miss sampson i dont know if i canif i ought to accept anything from you your father ruined my husband  yes i know replied the girl sadly thats all the more reason you should let me help you pray dont refuse it willmean so much to me  if this poor stricken woman had any resentment it speedily melted in the warmth and sweetness of miss sampsons manner my idea was that the impression of diane sampsons beauty was always swiftly succeeded by that of her generosity and nobility at any rate she had started well with mrs hoden and no sooner had she begun to talk to the children than both they and the mother were won  the opening of that big basket was an event poor starved little beggars i went out on the porch to get away from them my feelings seemed too easily aroused hard indeed would it have gone with jim hodens slayer if i could have laid my eyes on him then however miss sampson and sally after the nature of tender and practical girls did not appear to take the sad situation to heart the havoc had already been wrought in that household the needs now were cheerfulness kindness help action and these the girls furnished with a spirit that did me good  mrs hoden who dressed this baby presently asked miss sampson i peeped in to see a dilapidated youngster on her knees that sight if any other was needed completed my full and splendid estimate of diane sampson  mr steele replied mrs hoden  mr steele exclaimed miss sampson  yes hes taken care of us all sincesince mrs hoden choked  oh so youve had no help but his replied miss sampson hastily no women too bad ill send someone mrs hoden and ill come myself  itll be good of you went on the older woman you see jim had few friendsthat is right in town and theyve been afraid to help usafraid theyd get what poor jim  thats awful burst out miss sampson passionately a brave lot of friends mrs hoden dont you worry any more well take care of you here sally help me whatever is the matter with babys dress manifestly miss sampson had some difficulty in subduing her emotion  why its on hind side before declared sally i guess mr steele hasnt dressed many babies  he did the best he could said mrs hoden lord only knows what would have become of us he brought your cowboy russ whos been very good too  mr steele then isis something more than a ranger queried miss sampson with a little break in her voice  hes more than i can tell replied mrs hoden he buried jim he paid our debts he fetched us here he bought food for us he cooked for us and fed us he washed and dressed the baby he sat with me the first two nights after jims death when i thought id die myself  hes so kind so gentle so patient he has kept me up just by being near sometimes id wake from a doze an seeing him there id know how false were all these tales jim heard about him and believed at first why he plays with the children justjust like any good man might when he has the baby up i just cant believe hes a bloody gunman as they say  hes good but he isnt happy he has such sad eyes he looks far off sometimes when the children climb round him they love him i think he must have loved some woman his life is sad nobody need tell mehe sees the good in things once he said somebody had to be a ranger well i say thank god for a ranger like him  after that there was a long silence in the little room broken only by the cooing of the baby i did not dare to peep in at miss sampson then  somehow i expected steele to arrive at that moment and his step did not surprise me he came round the corner as he always turned any corner quick alert with his hand down if i had been an enemy waiting there with a gun i would have needed to hurry steele was instinctively and habitually on the defense  hello son how are mrs hoden and the youngster today he asked  hello yourself why theyre doing fine i brought the girls down  then in the semishadow of the room across mrs hodens bed diane sampson and steele faced each other  that was a moment having seen her face then i would not have missed sight of it for anything i could name never so long as memory remained with me would i forget she did not speak sally however bowed and spoke to the ranger steele after the first start showed no unusual feeling he greeted both girls pleasantly  russ that was thoughtful of you he said it was womankind needed here i could do so littlemrs hoden you look better today im glad and heres baby all clean and white baby what a time i had trying to puzzle out the way your clothes went on well mrs hoden didnt i tell you friends would come so will the brighter side  yes ive more faith than i had replied mrs hoden roger sampsons daughter has come to me there for a while after jims death i thought id sink we have nothing how could i ever take care of my little ones but im gaining courage  mrs hoden do not distress yourself any more said miss sampson i shall see you are well cared for i promise you  miss sampson thats fine exclaimed steele with a ring in his voice its what id have hopedexpected of you  it must have been sweet praise to her for the whiteness of her face burned in a beautiful blush  and its good of you too miss langdon to come added steele let me thank you both im glad i have you girls as allies in part of my lonely task here more than glad for the sake of this good woman and the little ones but both of you be careful dont stir without russ theres risk and now ill be going goodby mrs hoden ill drop in again tonight goodby  steele backed to the door and i slipped out before him  mr steelewait called miss sampson as he stepped out he uttered a little sound like a hiss or a gasp or an intake of breath i did not know what and then the incomprehensible fellow bestowed a kick upon me that i thought about broke my leg but i understood and gamely endured the pain then we were looking at diane sampson she was white and wonderful she stepped out of the door close to steele she did not see me she cared nothing for my presence all the world would not have mattered to her then  i have wronged you she said impulsively  looking on i seemed to see or feel some slow mighty force gathering in steele to meet this ordeal then he appeared as alwaysyet to me how different  miss sampson how can you say that he returned  i believed what my father and george wright said about youthat bloody despicable record now i do not believe i seei wronged you  you make me very glad when you tell me this it was hard to have you think so ill of me but miss sampson please dont speak of wronging me i am a ranger and much said of me is true my duty is hard on otherssometimes on those who are innocent alas but god knows that duty is hard too on me  i did wrong you in thoughtin word i ordered you from my home as if you were indeed what they called you but i was deceived i see my error if you entered my home again i would think it an honor i  pleaseplease dont miss sampson interrupted poor steele i could see the gray beneath his bronze and something that was like gold deep in his eyes  but sir my conscience flays me she went on there was no other sound like her voice if i was all distraught with emotion what must steele have been i make amends will you take my hand will you forgive me she gave it royally while the other was there pressing at her breast  steele took the proffered hand and held it and did not release it what else could he have done but he could not speak then it seemed to dawn upon steele there was more behind this white sweet noble intensity of her than just making amends for a fancied or real wrong for myself i thought the man did not live on earth who could have resisted her then and there was resistance i felt it she must have felt it it was poor steeles hard fate to fight the charm and eloquence and sweetness of this woman when for some reason unknown to him and only guessed at by me she was burning with all the fire and passion of her soul  mr steele i honor you for your goodness to this unfortunate woman she said and now her speech came swiftly when she was all alone and helpless you were her friend it was the deed of a man but mrs hoden isnt the only unfortunate woman in the world i too am unfortunate ah how i may soon need a friend  vaughn steele the man whom i need most to be my friendwant most to lean uponis the one whose duty is to stab me to the heart to ruin me you will you be my friend if you knew diane sampson you would know she would never ask you to be false to your duty be true to us both im so aloneno one but sally loves me ill need a friend soonsoon  oh i knowi know what youll find out sooner or later i know now i want to help you let us save life if not honor must i stand aloneall alone will youwill you be  her voice failed she was swaying toward steele i expected to see his arms spread wide and enfold her in their embrace  diane sampson i love you whispered steele hoarsely white now to his lips i must be true to my duty but if i cant be true to you then by god i want no more of life he kissed her hand and rushed away  she stood a moment as if blindly watching the place where he had vanished and then as a sister might have turned to a brother she reached for me     chapter 8  the eavesdropper   we silently rode home in the gathering dusk miss sampson dismounted at the porch but sally went on with me to the corrals i felt heavy and somber as if a catastrophe was near at hand  help me down said sally her voice was low and tremulous  sally did you hear what miss sampson said to steele i asked  a little here and there i heard steele tell her he loved her isnt this a terrible mix  it sure is did you heardo you understand why she appealed to steele asked him to be her friend  did she no i didnt hear that i heard her say she had wronged him then i tried not to hear any more tell me  no sally its not my secret i wish i could do somethinghelp them somehow yes its sure a terrible mix i dont care so much about myself  nor me sally retorted  you oh youre only a shallow spoiled child youd cease to love anything the moment you won it and iwell im no good you say but their love my god what a tragedy youve no idea sally theyve hardly spoken to each other yet are ready to be overwhelmed  sally sat so still and silent that i thought i had angered or offended her but i did not care much one way or another her coquettish fancy for me and my own trouble had sunk into insignificance i did not look up at her though she was so close i could feel her little restless foot touching me the horses in the corrals were trooping up to the bars dusk had about given place to night although in the west a broad flare of golden sky showed bright behind dark mountains  so i say youre no good asked sally after a long silence then her voice and the way her hand stole to my shoulder should have been warning for me but it was not or i did not care  yes you said that didnt you i replied absently  i can change my mind cant i maybe youre only wild and reckless when you drink mrs hoden said such nice things about you they made me feel so good  i had no reply for that and still did not look up at her i heard her swing herself around in the saddle lift me down she said  perhaps at any other time i would have remarked that this request was rather unusual considering the fact that she was very light and sure of action extremely proud of it and likely to be insulted by an offer of assistance but my spirit was dead i reached for her hands but they eluded mine slipped up my arms as she came sliding out of the saddle and then her face was very close to mine russ she whispered it was torment wistfulness uncertainty and yet tenderness all in one little whisper it caught me off guard or indifferent to consequences so i kissed her without passion with all regret and sadness she uttered a little cry that might have been mingled exultation and remorse for her victory and her broken faith certainly the instant i kissed her she remembered the latter she trembled against me and leaving unsaid something she had meant to say she slipped out of my arms and ran she assuredly was frightened and i thought it just as well that she was  presently she disappeared in the darkness and then the swift little clinks of her spurs ceased i laughed somewhat ruefully and hoped she would be satisfied then i put away the horses and went in for my supper  after supper i noisily bustled around my room and soon stole out for my usual evenings spying the night was dark without starlight and the stiff wind rustled the leaves and tore through the vines on the old house the fact that i had seen and heard so little during my constant vigilance did not make me careless or the task monotonous i had so much to think about that sometimes i sat in one place for hours and never knew where the time went  this night the very first thing i heard wrights wellknown footsteps and i saw sampsons door open flashing a broad bar of light into the darkness wright crossed the threshold the door closed and all was dark again outside not a ray of light escaped from the window this was the first visit of wright for a considerable stretch of time little doubt there was that his talk with sampson would be interesting to me  i tiptoed to the door and listened but i could hear only a murmur of voices besides that position was too risky i went round the corner of the house some time before i had made a discovery that i imagined would be valuable to me this side of the big adobe house was of much older construction than the back and larger part there was a narrow passage about a foot wide between the old and new walls and this ran from the outside through to the patio i had discovered the entrance by accident as it was concealed by vines and shrubbery i crawled in there upon an opportune occasion with the intention of boring a small hole through the adobe bricks but it was not necessary to do that for the wall was cracked and in one place i could see into sampsons room this passage now afforded me my opportunity and i decided to avail myself of it in spite of the very great danger crawling on my hands and knees very stealthily i got under the shrubbery to the entrance of the passage in the blackness a faint streak of light showed the location of the crack in the wall  i had to slip in sidewise it was a tight squeeze but i entered without the slightest sound if my position were to be betrayed it would not be from noise as i progressed the passage grew a very little wider in that direction and this fact gave rise to the thought that in case of a necessary and hurried exit i would do best by working toward the patio it seemed a good deal of time was consumed in reaching my vantagepoint when i did get there the crack was a foot over my head if i had only been tall like steele there was nothing to do but find toeholes in the crumbling walls and by bracing knees on one side back against the other hold myself up to the crack  once with my eye there i did not care what risk i ran sampson appeared disturbed he sat stroking his mustache his brow was clouded wrights face seemed darker more sullen yet lighted by some indomitable resolve  well settle both deals tonight wright was saying thats what i came for thats why ive asked snecker and blome to be here  but suppose i dont choose to talk here protested sampson impatiently i never before made my house a place to  weve waited long enough this places as good as any youve lost your nerve since that ranger hit the town first now will you give diane to me  george you talk like a spoiled boy give diane to you why shes a woman and im finding out that shes got a mind of her own i told you i was willing for her to marry you i tried to persuade her but diane hasnt any use for you now she liked you at first but now she doesnt so what can i do  you can make her marry me replied wright  make that girl do what she doesnt want to it couldnt be done even if i tried and i dont believe ill try i havent the highest opinion of you as a prospective soninlaw george but if diane loved you i would consent wed all go away together before this damned miserable business is out then shed never know and maybe you might be more like you used to be before the west ruined you but as matters stand you fight your own game with her and ill tell you now youll lose  whatd you want to let her come out here for demanded wright hotly it was a dead mistake ive lost my head over her ill have her or die dont you think if she was my wife id soon pull myself together since she came weve none of us been right and the gang has put up a holler no sampson weve got to settle things tonight  well we can settle what dianes concerned in right now replied sampson rising come on well go ask her see where you stand  they went out leaving the door open i dropped down to rest myself and to wait i would have liked to hear miss sampsons answer to him but i could guess what it would be wright appeared to be all i had thought of him and i believed i was going to find out presently that he was worse just then i wanted steele as never before still he was too big to worm his way into this place  the men seemed to be absent a good while though that feeling might have been occasioned by my interest and anxiety finally i heard heavy steps wright came in alone he was leadenfaced humiliated then something abject in him gave place to rage he strode the room he cursed  sampson returned now appreciably calmer i could not but decide that he felt relief at the evident rejection of wrights proposal dont fume about it george he said you see i cant help it were pretty wild out here but i cant rope my daughter and give her to you as i would an unruly steer  sampson i can make her marry me declared wright thickly  how  you know the hold i got on youthe deal that made you boss of this rustler gang  it isnt likely id forget replied sampson grimly  i can go to dianetell her thatmake her believe id tell it broadcast tell this ranger steele unless shed marry me wright spoke breathlessly with haggard face and shadowed eyes he had no shame he was simply in the grip of passion sampson gazed with dark controlled fury at his relative in that look i saw a strong unscrupulous man fallen into evil ways but still a man it betrayed wright to be the wild and passionate weakling  i seemed to see also how during all the years of association this strong man had upheld the weak one but that time had gone forever both in intent on sampsons part and in possibility wright like the great majority of evil and unrestrained men on the border had reached a point where influence was futile reason had degenerated he saw only himself  but george dianes the one person on earth who must never know im a rustler a thief a redhanded ruler of the worst gang on the border replied sampson impressively  george bowed his head at that as if the significance had just occurred to him but he was not long at a loss shes going to find it out sooner or later i tell you she knows now theres something wrong out here shes got eyes and that meddling cowboy of hers is smarter than you give him credit for theyre always together youll regret the day russ ever straddled a horse on this ranch mark what i say  dianes changed i know but she hasnt any idea yet that her daddys a boss rustler dianes concerned about what she calls my duty as mayor also i think shes not satisfied with my explanations in regard to certain property  wright halted in his restless walk and leaned against the stone mantelpiece he squared himself as if this was his last stand he looked desperate but on the moment showed an absence of his usual nervous excitement sampson that may well be true he said no doubt all you say is true but it doesnt help me i want the girl if i dont get her i reckon well all go to hell he might have meant anything probably meant the worst he certainly had something more in mind  sampson gave a slight start barely perceptible like the twitch of an awakening tiger he sat there head down stroking his mustache almost i saw his thought i had long experience in reading men under stress of such emotion i had no means to vindicate my judgment but my conviction was that sampson right then and there decided that the thing to do was to kill wright for my part i wondered that he had not come to such a conclusion before not improbably the advent of his daughter had put sampson in conflict with himself  suddenly he threw off a somber cast of countenance and began to talk he talked swiftly persuasively yet i imagined he was talking to smooth wrights passion for the moment wright no more caught the fateful significance of a line crossed a limit reached a decree decided than if he had not been present he was obsessed with himself  how i wondered had a man of his mind ever lived so long and gone so far among the exacting conditions of pecos county the answer was perhaps that sampson had guided him upheld him protected him the coming of diane sampson had been the entering wedge of dissension  youre too impatient concluded sampson youll ruin any chance of happiness if you rush diane she might be won if you told her who i am shed hate you forever she might marry you to save me but shed hate you  that isnt the way wait play for time be different with her cut out your drinking she despises that lets plan to sell out here stock ranch property and leave the country then youd have a show with her  i told you weve got to stick growled wright the gang wont stand for our going it cant be done unless you want to sacrifice everything  you mean doublecross the men go without their knowing leave them here to face whatever comes  i mean just that  im bad enough but not that bad returned sampson if i cant get the gang to let me off ill stay and face the music all the same wright did it ever strike you that most of our deals the last few years have been yours  yes if i hadnt rung them in there wouldnt have been any youve had cold feet owens says especially since this ranger steele has been here  well call it cold feet if you like but i call it sense we reached our limit long ago we began by rustling a few cattle at a time when rustling was laughed at but as our greed grew so did our boldness then came the gang the regular trips and one thing and another till before we knew itbefore i knew it we had shady deals holdups and murders on our record then we had to go on too late to turn back  i reckon weve all said that none of the gang wants to quit they all think and i think we cant be touched we may be blamed but nothing can be proved were too strong  theres where youre dead wrong rejoined sampson emphatically i imagined that once not long ago i was bullheaded who would ever connect roger sampson with a rustler gang ive changed my mind ive begun to think ive reasoned out things were crooked and we cant last its the nature of life even in wild pecos for conditions to grow better the wise deal for us would be to divide equally and leave the country all of us  but you and i have all the stockall the gain protested wright  ill split mine  i wontthat settles that added wright instantly  sampson spread wide his hands as if it was useless to try to convince this man talking had not increased his calmness and he now showed more than impatience a dull glint gleamed deep in his eyes your stock and property will last a long timedo you lots of good when steele  bah hoarsely croaked wright the rangers name was a match applied to powder havent i told you hed be dead soon same as hoden is  yes you mentioned the supposition replied sampson sarcastically i inquired too just how that very desired event was to be brought about  blomes here to kill steele  bah retorted sampson in turn blome cant kill this ranger he cant face him with a ghost of a showhell never get a chance at steeles back the man dont live on this border whos quick and smart enough to kill steele  id like to know why demanded wright sullenly  you ought to know youve seen the ranger pull a gun  who told you queried wright his face working  oh i guessed it if thatll do you  if jack doesnt kill this damned ranger i will replied wright pounding the table  sampson laughed contemptuously george dont make so much noise and dont be a fool youve been on the border for ten years youve packed a gun and youve used it youve been with blome and snecker when they killed their men youve been present at many fights but you never saw a man like steele you havent got sense enough to see him right if you had a chance neither has blome the only way to get rid of steele is for the gang to draw on him all at once and even then hes going to drop some of them  sampson you say that like a man who wouldnt care much if steele did drop some of them declared wright and now he was sarcastic  to tell you the truth i wouldnt returned the other bluntly im pretty sick of this mess  wright cursed in amaze his emotions were out of all proportion to his intelligence he was not at all quickwitted i had never seen a vainer or more arrogant man sampson i dont like your talk he said  if you dont like the way i talk you know what you can do replied sampson quickly he stood up then cool and quiet with flash of eyes and set of lips that told me he was dangerous  well after all thats neither here nor there went on wright unconsciously cowed by the other the thing is do i get the girl  not by any means except her consent  youll not make her marry me  no no replied sampson his voice still cold lowpitched  all right then ill make her  evidently sampson understood the man before him so well that he wasted no more words i knew what wright never dreamed of and that was that sampson had a gun somewhere within reach and meant to use it  then heavy footsteps sounded outside tramping upon the porch i might have been mistaken but i believed those footsteps saved wrights life  there they are said wright and he opened the door five masked men entered about two of them i could not recognize anything familiar i thought one had old sneckers burly shoulders and another bo sneckers stripling shape i did recognize blome in spite of his mask because his fair skin and hair his garb and air of distinction made plain his identity they all wore coats hiding any weapons the big man with burly shoulders shook hands with sampson and the others stood back  the atmosphere of that room had changed wright might have been a nonentity for all he counted sampson was another mana stranger to me if he had entertained a hope of freeing himself from his band of getting away to a safer country he abandoned it at the very sight of these men there was power here and he was bound  the big man spoke in low hoarse whispers and at this all the others gathered round him close to the table there were evidently some signs of membership not plain to me then all the heads were bent over the table low voices spoke queried answered argued by straining my ears i caught a word here and there they were planning i did not attempt to get at the meaning of the few words and phrases i distinguished but held them in mind so to piece all together afterward before the plotters finished conferring i had an involuntary flashed knowledge of much and my whirling excited mind made reception difficult  when these rustlers finished whispering i was in a cold sweat steele was to be killed as soon as possible by blome or by the gang going to steeles house at night morton had been seen with the ranger he was to meet the same fate as hoden dealt by bo snecker who evidently worked in the dark like a ferret any other person known to be communing with steele or interested in him or suspected of either was to be silenced then the town was to suffer a short deadly spell of violence directed anywhere for the purpose of intimidating those people who had begun to be restless under the influence of the ranger after that big herds of stock were to be rustled off the ranches to the north and driven to el paso  then the big man who evidently was the leader of the present convention got up to depart he went as swiftly as he had come and was followed by the slender fellow as far as it was possible for me to be sure i identified these two as snecker and his son the others however remained blome removed his mask which action was duplicated by the two rustlers who had stayed with him they were both young bronzed hard of countenance not unlike cowboys evidently this was now a social call on sampson he set out cigars and liquors for his guests and a general conversation ensued differing little from what might have been indulged in by neighborly ranchers there was not a word spoken that would have caused suspicion  blome was genial gay and he talked the most wright alone seemed uncommunicative and unsociable he smoked fiercely and drank continually all at once he straightened up as if listening whats that he called suddenly  the talking and laughter ceased my own strained ears were pervaded by a slight rustling sound  must be a rat replied sampson in relief strange how any sudden or unknown thing weighed upon him  the rustling became a rattle  sounds like a rattlesnake to me said blome  sampson got up from the table and peered round the room just at that instant i felt an almost inappreciable movement of the adobe wall which supported me i could scarcely credit my senses but the rattle inside sampsons room was mingling with little dull thuds of falling dirt the adobe wall merely dried mud was crumbling i distinctly felt a tremor pass through it then the blood gushed with sickening coldness back to my heart and seemingly clogged it  what in the hell exclaimed sampson  i smell dust said blome sharply  that was the signal for me to drop down from my perch yet despite my care i made a noise  did you hear a step queried sampson  then a section of the wall fell inward with a crash i began to squeeze my body through the narrow passage toward the patio  hear him yelled wright this side  no hes going that way yelled someone else the tramp of heavy boots lent me the strength and speed of desperation i was not shirking a fight but to be cornered like a trapped coyote was another matter i almost tore my clothes off in that passage the dust nearly stifled me  when i burst into the patio it was not one single instant too soon but one deep gash of breath revived me and i was up gun in hand running for the outlet into the court thumping footsteps turned me back while there was a chance to get away i did not want to meet odds in a fight i thought i heard some one running into the patio from the other end i stole along and coming to a door without any idea of where it might lead i softly pushed it open a little way and slipped in     chapter 9  in flagrante delicto   a low cry greeted me the room was light i saw sally langdon sitting on her bed in her dressing gown shaking my gun at her with a fierce warning gesture to be silent i turned to close the door it was a heavy door without bolt or bar and when i had shut it i felt safe only for the moment then i gazed around the room there was one window with blind closely drawn i listened and seemed to hear footsteps retreating dying away then i turned to sally she had slipped off the bed to her knees and was holding out trembling hands as if both to supplicate mercy and to ward me off she was as white as the pillow on her bed she was terribly frightened again with warning hand commanding silence i stepped softly forward meaning to reassure her  russ russ she whispered wildly and i thought she was going to faint when i got close and looked into her eyes i understood the strange dark expression in them she was terrified because she believed i meant to kill her or do worse probably worse she had believed many a hard story about me and had cared for me in spite of them i remembered then that she had broken her promise she had tempted me led me to kiss her made a fool out of me i remembered also how i had threatened her this intrusion of mine was the wild cowboys vengeance  i verily believed she thought i was drunk i must have looked pretty hard and fierce bursting into her room with that big gun in hand my first action then was to lay the gun on her bureau  you poor kid i whispered taking her hands and trying to raise her but she stayed on her knees and clung to me  russ it was vile of me she whispered i know it i deserve anythinganything but i am only a kid russ i didnt break my wordi didnt make you kiss me just for vanitys sake i swear i didnt i wanted you to for i care russ i cant help it please forgive me please let me off this time dontdont  will you shut up i interrupted half beside myself and i used force in another way than speech i shook her and sat her on the bed you little fool i didnt come in here to kill you or do some other awful thing as you think for gods sake sally what do you take me for  russ you swore youd do something terrible if i tempted you anymore she faltered the way she searched my face with doubtful fearful eyes hurt me  listen and with the word i seemed to be pervaded by peace i didnt know this was your room i came in here to get awayto save my life i was pursued i was spying on sampson and his men they heard me but did not see me they dont know who was listening theyre after me now im special united states deputy marshal sittellrussell archibald sittell im a ranger im here as secret aid to steele  sallys eyes changed from blank gulfs to dilating shadowing quickening windows of thought russell archibald sittell she echoed ranger secret aid to steele  yes  then youre no cowboy  no  only a makebelieve one  yes  and the drinking the gambling the association with those low menthat was all put on  part of the game sally im not a drinking man and i sure hate those places i had to go in and all that pertains to them  oh so thats it i knew there was something how gladhow glad i am then sally threw her arms around my neck and without reserve or restraint began to kiss me and love me it must have been a moment of sheer gladness to feel that i was not disreputable a moment when something deep and womanly in her was vindicated assuredly she was entirely different from what she had ever been before  there was a little space of time a sweet confusion of senses when i could not but meet her halfway in tenderness quite as suddenly then she began to cry i whispered in her ear cautioning her to be careful that my life was at stake and after that she cried silently with one of her arms round my neck her head on my breast and her hand clasping mine so i held her for what seemed a long time indistinct voices came to me and footsteps seemingly a long way off i heard the wind in the rosebush outside some one walked down the stony court then a shrill neigh of a horse pierced the silence a rider was mounting out there for some reason with my life at stake i grasped all the sweetness of that situation sally stirred in my arms raised a red tearstained yet happy face and tried to smile it isnt any time to cry she whispered but i had to you cant understand what it made me feel to learn youre no drunkard no desperado but a mana man like that ranger very sweetly and seriously she kissed me again russ if i didnt honestly and truly love you before i do now  then she stood up and faced me with the fire and intelligence of a woman in her eyes tell me now you were spying on my uncle  briefly i told her what had happened before i entered her room not omitting a terse word as to the character of the men i had watched  my god so its uncle roger i knew something was very wrong herewith him with the place the people and right off i hated george wright russ does diane know  she knows something i havent any idea how much  this explains her appeal to steele oh itll kill her you dont know how proud how good diane is oh itll kill her  sally shes no baby shes got sand that girl  the sound of soft steps somewhere near distracted my attention reminded me of my peril and now what counted more with me made clear the probability of being discovered in sallys room ill have to get out of here i whispered  wait she replied detaining me didnt you say they were hunting for you  they sure are i returned grimly  oh then you mustnt go they might shoot you before you got away stay if we hear them you can hide under my bed ill turn out the light ill meet them at the door you can trust me stay russ wait till all quiets down if we have to wait till morning then you can slip out  sally i oughtnt to stay i dont want toi wont i replied perplexed and stubborn  but you must its the only safe way they wont come here  suppose they should its an even chance sampsonll search every room and corner in this old house if they found me here i couldnt start a fight you might be hurt thenthe fact of my being here i did not finish what i meant but instead made a step toward the door  sally was on me like a little whirlwind white of face and dark of eye with a resoluteness i could not have deemed her capable of she was as strong and supple as a panther too but she need not have been either resolute or strong for the clasp of her arms the feel of her warm breast as she pressed me back were enough to make me weak as water my knees buckled as i touched the chair and i was glad to sit down my face was wet with perspiration and a kind of cold ripple shot over me i imagined i was losing my nerve then proof beyond doubt that sally loved me was so sweet so overwhelming a thing that i could not resist even to save her disgrace  russ the fact of your being here is the very thing to save youif they come sally whispered softly what do i care what they think she put her arms round my neck i gave up then and held her as if she indeed were my only hope a noise a stealthy sound a step froze that embrace into stone  up yet sally came sampsons clear voice too strained too eager to be natural  no im in bed reading good night uncle instantly replied sally so calmly and naturally that i marveled at the difference between man and woman perhaps that was the difference between love and hate  are you alone went on sampsons penetrating voice colder now  yes replied sally  the door swung inward with a swift scrape and jar sampson half entered haggard flamingeyed his leveled gun did not have to move an inch to cover me behind him i saw wright and indistinctly another man  well gasped sampson he showed amazement hands up russ  i put up my hands quickly but all the time i was calculating what chance i had to leap for my gun or dash out the light i was trapped and fury like the hot teeth of a wolf bit into me that leveled gun the menace in sampsons puzzled eyes wrights dark and hateful face these loosened the spirit of fight in me if sally had not been there i would have made some desperate move  sampson barred wright from entering which action showed control as well as distrust  you lied said sampson to sally he was hard as flint yet doubtful and curious too  certainly i lied snapped sally in reply she was cool almost flippant i awakened to the knowledge that she was to be reckoned with in this situation suddenly she stepped squarely between sampson and me  move aside ordered sampson sternly  i wont what do i care for your old gun you shant shoot russ or do anything else to him its my fault hes here in my room i coaxed him to come  you little hussy exclaimed sampson and he lowered the gun  if i ever before had occasion to glory in sally i had it then she betrayed not the slightest fear she looked as if she could fight like a little tigress she was white composed defiant  how long has russ been in here demanded sampson  all evening i left diane at eight oclock russ came right after that  but youd undressed for bed ejaculated the angry and perplexed uncle  yes that simple answer was so noncommittal so above subterfuge so innocent and yet so confounding in its provocation of thought that sampson just stared his astonishment but i started as if i had been struck  see here sampson i began passionately  like a flash sally whirled into my arms and one hand crossed my lips its my fault i will take the blame she cried and now the agony of fear in her voice quieted me i realized i would be wise to be silent uncle began sally turning her head yet still clinging to me ive tormented russ into loving me ive flirted with himteased himtempted him we love each other now were engaged pleaseplease dont she began to falter and i felt her weight sag a little against me  well let go of him said sampson i wont hurt him sally how long has this affair been going on  for weeksi dont know how long  does diane know  she knows we love each other but not that we metdid this light swift steps the rustle of silk interrupted sampson and made my heart sink like lead  is that you george came miss sampsons deep voice nervous hurried whats all this commotion i hear  diane go on back ordered sampson  just then miss sampsons beautiful agitated face appeared beside wright he failed to prevent her from seeing all of us  papa sally she exclaimed in consternation then she swept into the room what has happened  sampson like the devil he was laughed when it was too late he had good impulses but they never interfered with his sardonic humor he paced the little room shrugging his shoulders offering no explanation sally appeared about ready to collapse and i could not have told sallys lie to miss sampson to save my life  diane your father and i broke in on a little romeo and juliet scene said george wright with a leer then miss sampsons dark gaze swept from george to her father then to sallys attire and her shamed face and finally to me what effect the magnificent wrath and outraged trust in her eyes had upon me  russ do they dare insinuate you came to sallys room for myself i could keep silent but for sally i began to feel a hot clamoring outburst swelling in my throat  sally confessed it diane replied wright  sally a shrinking shuddering disbelief filled miss sampsons voice  diane i told you i loved himdidnt i replied sally she managed to hold up her head with a ghost of her former defiant spirit  miss sampson its a i burst out  then sally fainted it was i who caught her miss sampson hurried to her side with a little cry of distress  russ your hands called said sampson of course youll swear the moons green cheese and i like you the better for it but we know now and you can save your breath if sally hadnt stuck up so gamely for you id have shot you but at that i wasnt looking for you now clear out of here i picked up my gun from the bureau and dropped it in its sheath for the life of me i could not leave without another look at miss sampson the scorn in her eyes did not wholly hide the sadness she who needed friends was experiencing the bitterness of misplaced trust that came out in the scorn but the sadnessi knew what hurt her most was her sorrow  i dropped my head and stalked out     chapter 10  a slap in the face   when i got out into the dark where my hot face cooled in the wind my relief equaled my other feelings sampson had told me to clear out and although i did not take that as a dismissal i considered i would be wise to leave the ranch at once daylight might disclose my footprints between the walls but even if it did not my work there was finished so i went to my room and packed my few belongings  the night was dark windy stormy yet there was no rain i hoped as soon as i got clear of the ranch to lose something of the pain i felt but long after i had tramped out into the open there was a lump in my throat and an ache in my breast and all my thought centered round sally  what a game and loyal little girl she had turned out to be i was absolutely at a loss concerning what the future held in store for us i seemed to have a vague but clinging hope that after the trouble was over there might bethere must besomething more between us  steele was not at our rendezvous among the rocks the hour was too late among the few dim lights flickering on the outskirts of town i picked out the one of his little adobe house but i knew almost to a certainty that he was not there so i turned my way into the darkness not with any great hope of finding steele out there but with the intention of seeking a covert for myself until morning  there was no trail and the night was so black that i could see only the lighter sandy patches of ground i stumbled over the little clumps of brush fell into washes and pricked myself on cactus by and by mesquites and rocks began to make progress still harder for me i wandered around at last getting on higher ground and here in spite of the darkness felt some sense of familiarity with things i was probably near steeles hiding place  i went on till rocks and brush barred further progress and then i ventured to whistle but no answer came whereupon i spread my blanket in as sheltered a place as i could find and lay down the coyotes were on noisy duty the wind moaned and rushed through the mesquites but despite these sounds and worry about steele and the neverabsent haunting thought of sally i went to sleep  a little rain had fallen during the night as i discovered upon waking still it was not enough to cause me any discomfort the morning was bright and beautiful yet somehow i hated it i had work to do that did not go well with that golden wave of grass and brush on the windy open  i climbed to the highest rock of that ridge and looked about it was a wild spot some three miles from town presently i recognized landmarks given to me by steele and knew i was near his place i whistled then halloed but got no reply then by working back and forth across the ridge i found what appeared to be a faint trail this i followed lost and found again and eventually still higher up on another ridge with a commanding outlook i found steeles hiding place he had not been there for perhaps fortyeight hours i wondered where he had slept  under a shelving rock i found a pack of food carefully protected by a heavy slab there was also a canteen full of water i lost no time getting myself some breakfast and then hiding my own pack i set off at a rapid walk for town  but i had scarcely gone a quarter of a mile had in fact just reached a level when sight of two horsemen halted me and made me take to cover they appeared to be cowboys hunting for a horse or a steer under the circumstances however i was suspicious and i watched them closely and followed them a mile or so round the base of the ridges until i had thoroughly satisfied myself they were not tracking steele they were a long time working out of sight which further retarded my venturing forth into the open  finally i did get started then about halfway to town more horsemen in the flat caused me to lie low for a while and make a wide detour to avoid being seen  somewhat to my anxiety it was afternoon before i arrived in town for my life i could not have told why i knew something had happened since my last visit but i certainly felt it and was proportionately curious and anxious  the first person i saw whom i recognized was dick and he handed me a note from sally she seemed to take it for granted that i had been wise to leave the ranch miss sampson had softened somewhat when she learned sally and i were engaged and she had forgiven my deceit sally asked me to come that night after eight down among the trees and shrubbery to a secluded spot we knew it was a brief note and all to the point but there was something in it that affected me strangely i had imagined the engagement an invention for the moment but after danger to me was past sally would not have carried on a pretense not even to win back miss sampsons respect the fact was sally meant that engagement if i did the right thing now i would not lose her  but what was the right thing  i was sorely perplexed and deeply touched never had i a harder task than that of the hourto put her out of my mind i went boldly to steeles house he was not there there was nothing by which i could tell when he had been there the lamp might have been turned out or might have burned out the oil was low i saw a good many tracks round in the sandy walks i did not recognize steeles  as i hurried away i detected more than one of steeles nearest neighbors peering at me from windows and doors then i went to mrs hodens she was up and about and cheerful the children were playing manifestly well cared for and content mrs hoden had not seen steele since i had miss samson had sent her servant there was a very decided change in the atmosphere of mrs hodens home and i saw that for her the worst was past and she was bravely hopefully facing the future  from there i hurried to the main street of linrock and to that section where violence brooded ready at any chance moment to lift its hydra head for that time of day the street seemed unusually quiet few pedestrians were abroad and few loungers there was a row of saddled horses on each side of the street the full extent of the block  i went into the big barroom of the hope so i had never seen the place so full nor had it ever seemed so quiet the whole long bar was lined by shirtsleeved men with hats slouched back and vests flapping wide those who were not drinking were talking low half a dozen tables held as many groups of dusty motley men some silent others speaking and gesticulating all earnest  at first glance i did not see any one in whom i had especial interest the principal actors of my drama did not appear to be present however there were rough characters more in evidence than at any other time i had visited the saloon voices were too low for me to catch but i followed the direction of some of the significant gestures then i saw that these half dozen tables were rather closely grouped and drawn back from the center of the big room next my quick sight took in a smashed table and chairs some broken bottles on the floor and then a dark sinister splotch of blood  i had no time to make inquiries for my roving eye caught frank morton in the doorway and evidently he wanted to attract my attention he turned away and i followed when i got outside he was leaning against the hitchingrail one look at this big rancher was enough for me to see that he had been told my part in steeles game and that he himself had roused to the texas fighting temper he had a clouded brow he looked somber and thick he seemed slow heavy guarded  howdy russ he said weve been wantin you  theres ten of us in town all scattered round ready its goin to start today  wheres steele was my first query  saw him lessn hour ago hes somewhere close he may show up any time  is he all right  wai he was pretty fit a little while back replied morton significantly  whats come off tell me all  wai the ball opened last night i reckon jack blome came swaggerin in here askin for steele we all knew what he was in town for but last night he came out with it every man in the saloons every man on the streets heard blomes loud an longin call for the ranger blomes pals took it up and they all enjoyed themselves some  drinking hard i queried  nopethey didnt hit it up very hard but they laid foundations of course steele was not to be seen last night this morning blome and his gang were out pretty early but they traveled alone blome just strolled up and down by himself i watched him walk up this street on one side and then down the other just a matter of thirtyone times i counted them for all i could see maybe blome did not take a drink but his gang especially bo snecker sure looked on the red liquor  by eleven oclock everybody in town knew what was coming off there was no work or business except in the saloons zimmer and i were together and the rest of our crowd in pairs at different places i reckon it was about noon when blome got tired parading up and down he went in the hope so and the crowd followed zimmer stayed outside so to give steele a hunch in case he came along i went in to see the show  wai it was some curious to me and ive lived all my life in texas but i never before saw a gunman on the job so to say blomes a handsome fellow an he seemed different from what i expected sure i thought hed yell an prance round like a drunken fool but he was cool an quiet enough the bio win an drinkin was done by his pals but after a little while it got to me that blome gloried in this situation ive seen a man deadset to kill another all dark sullen restless but blome wasnt that way he didnt seem at all like a bloody devil he was vain cocksure he was revelin in the effect he made i had him figured all right  blome sat on the edge of a table an he faced the door of course there was a pard outside ready to pop in an tell him if steele was comin but steele didnt come in that way he wasnt on the street just before that time because zimmer told me afterward steele must have been in the hope so somewhere any way just like he dropped from the clouds he came through the door near the bar blome didnt see him come but most of the gang did an i want to tell you that big room went pretty quiet  hello blome i hear youre lookin for me called out steele  i dont know if he spoke ordinary or not but his voice drew me up same as it did the rest an damn me blome seemed to turn to stone he didnt start or jump he turned gray an i could see that he was tryin to think in a moment when thinkin was hard then blome turned his head sure he expected to look into a sixshooter but steele was standin back there in his shirt sleeves his hands on his hips and he looked more man than any one i ever saw its easy to remember the look of him but how he made me feel that isnt easy  blome was at a disadvantage he was half sittin on a table an steele was behind an to the left of him for blome to make a move then would have been a fool trick he saw that so did everybody the crowd slid back without noise but bo snecker an a rustler named march stuck near blome i figured this bo snecker as dangerous as blome an results proved i was right  steele didnt choose to keep his advantage so far as position in regard to blome went he just walked round in front of the rustler but this put all the crowd in front of steele an perhaps he had an eye for that  i hear youve been looking for me repeated the ranger  blome never moved a muscle but he seemed to come to life it struck me that steeles presence had made an impression on blome which was new to the rustler  yes i have replied blome  well here i am what do you want  when everybody knew what blome wanted and had intended this question of steeles seemed strange on one hand an yet on the other now that the ranger stood there it struck me as natural enough  if you heard i was lookin for you you sure heard what for replied blome  blome my experience with such men as you is that you all brag one thing behind my back an you mean different when i show up ive called you now what do you mean  i reckon you know what jack blome means  jack blome that name means nothin to me blome youve been braggin around that youd meet mekill me you thought you meant it didnt you  yesi did mean it  all right go ahead  the barroom became perfectly still except for the slow breaths i heard there wasnt any movement anywhere that queer gray came to blomes face again he might again have been stone i thought an ill gamble every one else watchin thought blome would draw an get killed in the act but he never moved steele had cowed him if blome had been heated by drink or mad or anythin but what he was just then maybe he might have throwed a gun but he didnt ive heard of really brave men gettin panicked like that an after seein steele i didnt wonder at blome  you see blome you dont want to meet me for all your talk went on the ranger you thought you did but that was before you faced the man you intended to kill blome youre one of these dandy cockofthewalk fourflushers ill tell you how i know because ive met the real gunfighters an there never was one of them yet who bragged or talked now dont you go round blowin any more  then steele deliberately stepped forward an slapped blome on one side of his face an again on the other  keep out of my way after this or im liable to spoil some of your dandy looks  blome got up an walked straight out of the place i had my eyes on him kept me from seein steele but on hearin somethin i dont know what i turned back an there steele had got a long arm on bo snecker who was tryin to throw a gun  but he wasnt quick enough the gun banged in the air an then it went spinnin away while snecker dropped in a heap on the floor the table was overturned an march the other rustler who was on that side got up pullin his gun but somebody in the crowd killed him before he could get goin i didnt see who fired that shot an neither did anybody else but the crowd broke an run steele dragged bo snecker down to jail an locked him up  morton concluded his narrative and then evidently somewhat dry of tongue he produced knife and tobacco and cut himself a huge quid thats all so far today russ but i reckon youll agree with me on the main issuesteeles games opened  i had felt the rush of excitement the old exultation at the prospect of danger but this time there was something lacking in them the wildness of the boy that had persisted in me was gone  yes steele has opened it and im ready to boost the game along wait till i see him but morton you say someone you dont know played a hand in here and killed march  i sure do it wasnt any of our men zimmer was outside the others were at different places  the fact is then steele has more friends than we know perhaps more than he knows himself  right an its got the gang in the air therell be hell tonight  steele hardly expects to keep snecker in jail does he  i cant say probably not i wish steele had put both blome and snecker out of the way wed have less to fight  maybe im for the elimination method myself but steele doesnt follow out the gun method he will use one only when hes driven its hard to make him draw you know after all these desperate men arent afraid of guns or fights yet they are afraid of steele perhaps its his nerve the way he faces them the things he says the fact that he has mysterious allies  russ were all with him an ill gamble that the honest citizens of linrock will flock to him in another day i can see signs of that there were twenty or more men on hodens list but steele didnt want so many  we dont need any more morton can you give me any idea where steele is  not the slightest  all right ill hunt for him if you see him tell him to hole up and then you come after me tell him ive got our men spotted  russ if you ranger fellows aint wonders exclaimed morton with shining eyes  steele did not show himself in town again that day here his cunning was manifest by four oclock that afternoon blome was drunk and he and his rustlers went roaring up and down the street there was some shooting but i did not see or hear that any one got hurt the lawless element both native to linrock and the visitors followed in blomes tracks from saloon to saloon how often had i seen this sort of procession though not on so large a scale in many towns of wild texas  the two great and dangerous things in linrock at the hour were whisky and guns under such conditions the rustlers were capable of any mad act of folly  morton and his men sent word flying around town that a fight was imminent and all citizens should be prepared to defend their homes against possible violence but despite his warning i saw many respectable citizens abroad whose quiet unobtrusive manner and watchful eyes and hard faces told me that when trouble began they wanted to be there verily ranger steele had built his house of service upon a rock it did not seem too much to say that the next few days perhaps hours would see a great change in the character and a proportionate decrease in number of the inhabitants of this corner of pecos county  morton and i were in the crowd that watched blome snecker and a dozen other rustlers march down to steeles jail they had crowbars and they had cans of giant powder which they had appropriated from a hardware store if steele had a jailer he was not in evidence the door was wrenched off and bo snecker evidently not wholly recovered brought forth to his cheering comrades then some of the rustlers began to urge back the pressing circle and the word given out acted as a spur to haste the jail was to be blown up  the crowd split and some men ran one way some another morton and i were among those who hurried over the vacant ground to a little ridge that marked the edge of the open country from this vantage point we heard several rustlers yell in warning then they fled for their lives  it developed that they might have spared themselves such headlong flight the explosion appeared to be long in coming at length we saw the lifting of the roof in a cloud of red dust and then heard an exceedingly heavy but low detonation when the pall of dust drifted away all that was left of steeles jail was a part of the stone walls the building that stood nearest being constructed of adobe had been badly damaged  however this wreck of the jail did not seem to satisfy blome and his followers for amid wild yells and huzzahs they set to work with crowbars and soon laid low every stone then with young snecker in the fore they set off up town and if this was not a gang in fit mood for any evil or any ridiculous celebration i greatly missed my guess  it was a remarkable fact however and one that convinced me of deviltry afoot that the crowd broke up dispersed and actually disappeared off the streets of linrock the impression given was that they were satisfied but this impression did not remain with me morton was scarcely deceived either i told him that i would almost certainly see steele early in the evening and that we would be out of harms way he told me that we could trust him and his men to keep sharp watch on the night doings of blomes gang then we parted  it was almost dark by the time i had gotten something to eat and drink at the hope so the hour for my meeting with sally was about due on the way out i did not pass a lighted house until i got to the end of the street and then strange to say that one was steeles i walked down past the place and though i was positive he would not be there i whistled low i halted and waited he had two lights lit one in the kitchen and one in the big room the blinds were drawn i saw a long dark shadow cross one window and then a little later cross the other this would have deceived me had i not remembered steeles device for casting the shadow he had expected to have his house attacked at night presumably while he was at home but he had felt that it was not necessary for him to stay there to make sure lawless men of this class were sometimes exceedingly simple and gullible  then i bent my steps across the open avoiding road and path to the foot of the hill upon which sampsons house stood it was dark enough under the trees i could hardly find my way to the secluded nook and bench where i had been directed to come i wondered if sally would be able to find it trust that girl she might have a few qualms and come shaking a little but she would be there on the minute  i had hardly seated myself to wait when my keen ears detected something then slight rustlings then soft steps and a dark form emerged from the blackness into the little starlit glade sally came swiftly towards me and right into my arms that was sure a sweet moment through the excitement and dark boding thoughts of the day i had forgotten that she would do just this thing and now i anticipated tears clingings fears but i was agreeably surprised  russ are you all right she whispered  just at this moment i am i replied  sally gave me another little hug and then disengaging herself from my arms she sat down beside me  i can only stay a minute oh its safe enough but i told diane i was to meet you and shes waiting to hear if steele isis  steeles safe so far i interrupted  there were men coming and going all day uncle roger never appeared at meals he didnt eat diane said george tramped up and down smoking biting his nails listening for these messengers when theyd leave hed go in for another drink we heard him roar some one had been shot and we feared it might be steele  no i replied steadily  did steele shoot anybody  no a rustler named march tried to draw on steele and someone in the crowd killed march  someone russ was it you  it sure wasnt i didnt happen to be there  ah then steele has other men like you around him i might have guessed that  sally steele makes men his friends its because hes on the side of justice  diane will be glad to hear that she doesnt think only of steeles life i believe she has a secret pride in his work and ive an idea what she fears most is some kind of a clash between steele and her father  i shouldnt wonder sally what does diane know about her father  oh shes in the dark she got hold of papers that made her ask him questions and his answers made her suspicious she realizes hes not what he has pretended to be all these years but she never dreams her father is a rustler chief when she finds that out sally broke off and i finished the sentence in thought  listen sally i said suddenly ive an idea that steeles house will be attacked by the gang tonight and destroyed same as the jail was this afternoon these rustlers are crazy theyll expect to kill him while hes there but he wont be there if you and diane hear shooting and yelling tonight dont be frightened steele and i will be safe  oh i hope so russ i must hurry back but first cant you arrange a meeting between diane and steele its her wish she begged me to she must see him  ill try i promised knowing that promise would be hard to keep  we could ride out from the ranch somewhere you remember we used to rest on the high ridge where there was a shady placesuch a beautiful outlook it was there ii  my dear you neednt bring up painful memories i remember where  sally laughed softly she could laugh in the face of the gloomiest prospects well tomorrow morning or the next or any morning soon you tie your red scarf on the dead branch of that high mesquite ill look every morning with the glass if i see the scarf diane and i will ride out  thats fine sally you have ideas in your pretty little head and once i thought it held nothing but she put a hand on my mouth i must go now she said and rose she stood close to me and put her arms around my neck one thing more russ itit was difdifficult telling diane wewe were engaged i lied to uncle but what else could i have told diane iiohwas it she faltered  sally you lied to sampson to save me but you must have accepted me before you could have told diane the truth  oh russ i hadin my heart but it has been some time since you asked meandand  you imagined my offer might have been withdrawn well it stands  she slipped closer to me then with that soft sinuousness of a woman and i believed she might have kissed me had i not held back toying with my happiness  sally do you love me  ever so much since the very first  im a marshal a ranger like steele a hunter of criminals its a hard life theres spilling of blood and any time ii mightall the same sallywill you be my wife  oh russ yes but let me tell you when your dutys done here that i will have a word to say about your future itll be news to you to learn im an orphan and im not a poor one i own a plantation in louisiana ill make a planter out of you there  sally youre rich i exclaimed  im afraid i am but nobody can ever say you married me for my money  well no not if you tell of my abject courtship when i thought you a poor relation on a visit my god sally if i only could see this ranger job through safely and to success  you will she said softly  then i took a ring from my little finger and slipped it on hers that was my sisters shes dead now no other girl ever wore it let it be your engagement ring sally i pray i may somehow get through this awful ranger deal to make you happy to become worthy of you  russ i fear only one thing she whispered  and whats that  there will be fighting and youoh i saw into your eyes the other night when you stood with your hands up you would kill anybody russ its awful but dont think me a baby i can conceive what your work is what a man you must be i can love you and stick to you too but if you killed a blood relative of mine i would have to give you up im a southerner russ and blood is thick i scorn my uncle and i hate my cousin george and i love you but dont you kill one of my family ioh i beg of you go as far as you dare to avoid that  i could find no voice to answer her and for a long moment we were locked in an embrace breast to breast and lips to lips an embrace of sweet pain  then she broke away called a low hurried goodby and stole like a shadow into the darkness  an hour later i lay in the open starlight among the stones and brush out where steele and i always met he lay there with me but while i looked up at the stars he had his face covered with his hands for i had given him my proofs of the guilt of diane sampsons father  steele had made one comment i wish to god id sent for some fool whod have bungled the job  this was a compliment to me but it showed what a sad pass steele had come to my regret was that i had no sympathy to offer him i failed him there i had trouble of my own the feel of sallys clinging arms around my neck the warm sweet touch of her lips remained on mine what steele was enduring i did not know but i felt that it was agony  meanwhile time passed the blue velvety sky darkened as the stars grew brighter the wind grew stronger and colder i heard sand blowing against the stones like the rustle of silk otherwise it was a singularly quiet night i wondered where the coyotes were and longed for their chorus by and by a prairie wolf sent in his lonely lament from the distant ridges that mourn was worse than the silence it made the cold shudders creep up and down my back it was just the cry that seemed to be the one to express my own trouble no one hearing that longdrawn quivering wail could ever disassociate it from tragedy by and by it ceased and then i wished it would come again steele lay like the stone beside him was he ever going to speak among the vagaries of my mood was a petulant desire to have him sympathize with me  i had just looked at my watch making out in the starlight that the hour was eleven when the report of a gun broke the silence  i jumped up to peer over the stone steele lumbered up beside me and i heard him draw his breath hard     chapter 11  the fight in the hope so   i could plainly see the lights of his adobe house but of course nothing else was visible there were no other lighted houses near several flashes gleamed faded swiftly to be followed by reports and then the unmistakable jingle of glass  i guess the fools have opened up steele i said his response was an angry grunt it was just as well i concluded that things had begun to stir steele needed to be roused  suddenly a single sharp yell pealed out following it came a huge flare of light a sheet of flame in which a great cloud of smoke or dust shot up then with accompanying darkness burst a low deep thunderous boom the lights of the house went out then came a crash points of light flashed in a halfcircle and the reports of guns blended with the yells of furious men and all these were swallowed up in the roar of a mob  another and a heavier explosion momentarily lightened the darkness and then rent the air it was succeeded by a continuous volley and a steady sound that though composed of yells screams cheers was not anything but a hideous roar of hate it kept up long after there could have been any possibility of life under the ruins of that house it was more than hate of steele all that was wild and lawless and violent hurled this deed at the ranger service  such events had happened before in texas and other states but strangely they never happened more than once in one locality they were expressions perhaps that could never come but once  i watched steele through all that hideous din that manifestation of insane rage at his life and joy at his death and when silence once more reigned and he turned his white face to mine i had a sensation of dread and dread was something particularly foreign to my nature  so blome and the sneckers think theyve done for me he muttered  pleasant surprise for them tomorrow eh old man i queried  tomorrow look russ whats left of my old dobe house is on fire the ruins cant be searched soon and i was particular to fix things so itd look like i was home i just wanted to give them a chance its incomprehensible how easy men like them can be duped whiskysoaked yes theyll be surprised  he lingered a while watching the smoldering fire and the dim columns of smoke curling up against the dark blue russ do you suppose they heard up at the ranch and think im  they heard of course i replied but the girls know youre safe with me  safe ii almost wish to god i was there under that heap of ruins where the rustlers think theyve left me  well steele old fellow come on we need some sleep with steele in the lead we stalked away into the open  two days later about the middle of the forenoon i sat upon a great flat rock in the shade of a bushy mesquite and besides enjoying the vast clear sweep of gold and gray plain below i was otherwise pleasantly engaged sally sat as close to me as she could get holding to my arm as if she never intended to let go on the other side miss sampson leaned against me and she was white and breathless partly from the quick ride out from the ranch partly from agitation she had grown thinner and there were dark shadows under her eyes yet she seemed only more beautiful the red scarf with which i had signaled the girls waved from a branch of the mesquite at the foot of the ridge their horses were halted in a shady spot  take off your sombrero i said to sally you look hot besides youre prettier with your hair flying as she made no move i took it off for her then i made bold to perform the same office for miss sampson she faintly smiled her thanks assuredly she had forgotten all her resentment there were little beads of perspiration upon her white brow what a beautiful mass of blackbrown hair with strands of red or gold pretty soon she would be bending that exquisite head and face over poor steele and i who had schemed this meeting did not care what he might do to me  pretty soon also there was likely to be an interview that would shake us all to our depths and naturally i was somber at heart but though my outward mood of good humor may have been pretense it certainly was a pleasure to be with the girls again way out in the open both girls were quiet and this made my task harder and perhaps in my anxiety to ward off questions and appear happy for their own sakes i made an ass of myself with my silly talk and familiarity had ever a ranger such a job as mine  diane did sally show you her engagement ring i went on bound to talk  miss sampson either did not notice my use of her first name or she did not object she seemed so friendly so helplessly wistful yes its very pretty an antique ive seen a few of them she replied  i hope youll let sally marry me soon  let her sally langdon you havent become acquainted with your fiancee but when  oh next week just as soon  russ cried sally blushing furiously  whats the matter i queried innocently  youre a little previous  well sally i dont presume to split hairs over dates but you see youve become extremely more desirablein the light of certain revelations diane wasnt sally the deceitful thing an heiress all the time and im to be a planter and smoke fine cigars and drink mint juleps no there wont be any juleps  russ youre talking nonsense reproved sally surely its no time to be funny  all right i replied with resignation it was no task to discard that hollow mask of humor a silence ensued and i waited for it to be broken  is steele badly hurt asked miss sampson presently  no not what he or id call hurt at all hes got a scalp wound where a bullet bounced off his skull its only a scratch then hes got another in the shoulder but its not bad either  where is he now  look across on the other ridge see the big white stone there down under the trees is our camp hes there  when mayi see him there was a catch in her low voice  hes asleep now after what happened yesterday he was exhausted and the pain in his head kept him awake till late let him sleep a while yet then you can see him  did he know we were coming  he hadnt the slightest idea hell be overjoyed to see you he cant help that but hell about fall upon me with harmful intent  why  well i know hes afraid to see you  why  because it only makes his duty harder  ah she breathed  it seemed to me that my intelligence confirmed a hope of hers and gave her relief i felt something terrible in the balance for steele and i was glad to be able to throw them together the catastrophe must fall and now the sooner it fell the better but i experienced a tightening of my lips and a tugging at my heartstrings  sally what do you and diane know about the goingson in town yesterday i asked  not much george was like an insane man i was afraid to go near him uncle wore a sardonic smile i heard him curse georgeoh terribly i believe he hates george same as day before yesterday there were men riding in and out but diane and i heard only a little and conflicting statements at that we knew there was fighting dick and the servants the cowboys all brought rumors steele was killed at least ten times and came to life just as many  i cant recall dont want to recall all we heard but this morning when i saw the red scarf flying in the windwell russ i was so glad i could not see through the glass any more we knew then steele was all right or you wouldnt have put up the signal  reckon few people in linrock realize just what did come off i replied with a grim chuckle  russ i want you to tell me said miss sampson earnestly  what i queried sharply  about yesterdaywhat steele didwhat happened  miss sampson i could tell you in a few short statements of fact or i could take two hours in the telling which do you prefer  i prefer the long telling i want to know all about him  but why miss sampson consider this is hardly a story for a sensitive womans ears  i am no coward she replied turning eyes to me that flashed like dark fire  but why i persisted i wanted a good reason for calling up all the details of the most strenuous and terrible day in my border experience she was silent a moment i saw her gaze turn to the spot where steele lay asleep and it was a pity he could not see her eyes then frankly i dont want to tell you i added and i surely would have been glad to get out of the job  i want to hearbecause i glory in his work she replied deliberately  i gathered as much from the expression of her face as from the deep ring of her voice the clear content of her statement she loved the ranger but that was not all of her reason  his work i echoed do you want him to succeed in it  with all my heart she said with a white glow on her face  my god i ejaculated i just could not help it i felt sallys small fingers clutching my arm like sharp pincers i bit my lips to keep them shut what if steele had heard her say that poor noble justiceloving blind girl she knew even less than i hoped i forced my thought to the question immediately at hand she gloried in the rangers work she wanted with all her heart to see him succeed in it she had a womans pride in his manliness perhaps with a womans complex incomprehensible motive she wanted steele to be shown to her in all the power that made him hated and feared by lawless men she had finally accepted the wild life of this border as something terrible and inevitable but passing steele was one of the strange and great and misunderstood men who were making that wild life pass  for the first time i realized that miss sampson through sharpened eyes of love saw steele as he really wasa wonderful and necessary violence her intelligence and sympathy had enabled her to see through defamation and the false records following a ranger she had had no choice but to love him and then a womans glory in a work that freed men saved women and made children happy effaced forever the horror of a few dark deeds of blood  miss sampson i must tell you first i began and hesitatedthat im not a cowboy my wild stunts my drinking and gamingthese were all pretense  indeed i am very glad to hear it and was sally in your confidence  only lately i am a united states deputy marshal in the service of steele  she gave a slight start but did not raise her head  i have deceived you but all the same ive been your friend i ask you to respect my secret a little while im telling you because otherwise my relation to steele yesterday would not be plain now if you and sally will use this blanket make yourselves more comfortable seats ill begin my story  miss sampson allowed me to arrange a place for her where she could rest at ease but sally returned to my side and stayed there she was an enigma todaypale brooding silentand she never looked at me except when my face was half averted  well i began night before last steele and i lay hidden among the rocks near the edge of town and we listened to and watched the destruction of steeles house it had served his purpose to leave lights burning to have shadows blow across the windowblinds and to have a dummy in his bed also he arranged guns to go off inside the house at the least jar steele wanted evidence against his enemies it was not the pleasantest kind of thing to wait there listening to that drunken mob there must have been a hundred men the disturbance and the intent worked strangely upon steele it made him different in the dark i couldnt tell how he looked but i felt a mood coming in him that fairly made me dread the next day  about midnight we started for our camp here steele got in some sleep but i couldnt i was cold and hot by turns eager and backward furious and thoughtful you see the deal was such a complicated one and tomorrow certainly was nearing the climax by morning i was sick distraught gloomy and uncertain i had breakfast ready when steele awoke i hated to look at him but when i did it was like being revived  he said russ youll trail alongside me today and through the rest of this mess  that gave me another shock i want to explain to you girls that this was the first time in my life i was backward at the prospects of a fight the shock was the jump of my pulse my nerve came back to line up with steele against blome and his gangthat would be great  all right old man i replied were going after them then  he only nodded  after breakfast i watched him clean and oil and reload his guns i didnt need to ask him if he expected to use them i didnt need to urge upon him captain neals command  russ said steele well go in together but before we get to town ill leave you and circle and come in at the back of the hope so you hurry on ahead post morton and his men get the lay of the gang if possible and then be at the hope so when i come in  i didnt ask him if i had a free hand with my gun i intended to have that we left camp and hurried toward town it was near noon when we separated  i came down the road apparently from sampsons ranch there was a crowd around the ruins of steeles house it was one heap of crumbled dobe bricks and burned logs still hot and smoking no attempt had been made to dig into the ruins the curious crowd was certain that steele lay buried under all that stuff one feature of that night assault made me ponder daylight discovered the bodies of three dead men rustlers who had been killed the report went out by random shots other participants in the affair had been wounded i believed morton and his men under cover of the darkness and in the melee had sent in some shots not calculated upon the program  from there i hurried to town just as i had expected morton and zimmer were lounging in front of the hope so they had company disreputable and otherwise as yet mortons crowd had not come under suspicion he was wild for news of steele and when i gave it and outlined the plan he became as cool and dark and grim as any man of my kind could have wished he sent zimmer to get the others of their clique then he acquainted me with a few facts although he was noncommittal in regard to my suspicion as to the strange killing of the three rustlers  blome bo snecker hilliard and pickens the ringleaders had painted the town in celebration of steeles death they all got gloriously drunk except old man snecker he had cold feet they said they were too happy to do any more shooting or mind what the old rustler cautioned it was two oclock before they went to bed  this morning after eleven one by one they appeared with their followers the excitement had died down ranger steele was out of the way and linrock was once more wide open free and easy blome alone seemed sullen and spiritless unresponsive to his comrades and their admirers and now at the time of my arrival the whole gang with the exception of old snecker were assembled in the hope so  zimmer will be clever enough to drift his outfit along one or two at a time i asked morton and he reassured me then we went into the saloon  there were perhaps sixty or seventy men in the place more than half of whom were in open accord with blomes gang of the rest there were many of doubtful repute and a few that might have been neutral yet all the time were secretly burning to help any cause against these rustlers at all events i gathered that impression from the shadowed faces the tense bodies the tooevident indication of anything but careless presence there the windows were open the light was clear few men smoked but all had a drink before them there was the ordinary subdued hum of conversation i surveyed the scene picked out my position so as to be close to steele when he entered and sauntered round to it morton aimlessly leaned against a post  presently zimmer came in with a man and they advanced to the bar other men entered as others went out blome bo snecker hilliard and pickens had a table full in the light of the open windows i recognized the faces of the two lastnamed but i had not until morton informed me known who they were pickens was little scrubby dusty sandy mottled and he resembled a rattlesnake hilliard was big gaunt bronzed with huge mustache and hollow fierce eyes i never had seen a graverobber but i imagined one would be like hilliard bo snecker was a sleek slim slender hardlooking boy marked dangerous because he was too young and too wild to have caution or fear blome the last of the bunch showed the effects of a bad night  you girls remember how handsome he was but he didnt look it now his face was swollen dark red and as it had been bright now it was dull indeed he looked sullen shamed sore he was sober now thought was written on his clouded brow he was awakening now to the truth that the day before had branded him a coward and sent him out to bolster up courage with drink his vanity had begun to bleed he knew if his faithful comrades had not awakened to it yet that his prestige had been ruined for a gunman he had suffered the last degradation he had been bidden to draw and he had failed of the nerve  he breathed heavily his eyes were not clear his hands were shaky almost i pitied this rustler who very soon must face an incredibly swift and mercilessly fatal ranger face him too suddenly as if the grave had opened to give up its dead  friends and comrades of this center group passed to and fro and there was much lazy merry though not loud talk the whole crowd was still halfasleep it certainly was an auspicious hour for steele to confront them since that duty was imperative no man knew the stunning paralyzing effect of surprise better than steele i of course must take my cue from him or the sudden development of events  but jack blome did not enter into my calculations i gave him at most about a minute to live after steele entered the place i meant to keep sharp eyes all around i knew once with a gun out steele could kill blomes comrades at the table as quick as lightning if he chose i rather thought my game was to watch his outside partners this was right and as it turned out enabled me to save steeles life  moments passed and still the ranger did not come i began to get nervous had he been stopped i scouted the idea who could have stopped him then probably the time seemed longer than it really was morton showed the strain also other men looked drawn haggard waiting as if expecting a thunderbolt once in my roving gaze i caught blandys glinty eye on me i didnt like the gleam i said to myself id watch him if i had to do it out of the back of my head blandy by the way iswasi should say the hope so bartender i stopped to clear my throat and get my breath  was whispered sally she quivered with excitement miss sampson bent eyes upon me that would have stirred a stone man  yes he was once i replied ambiguously but mayhap my grimness betrayed the truth dont hurry me sally i guarantee youll be sick enough presently  well i kept my eyes shifty and i reckon ill never forget that room likely i saw what wasnt really there in the excitement the suspense i must have made shadows into real substance anyway there was the halfcircle of bearded swarthy men around blomes table there were the four rustlersblome brooding perhaps vaguely spiritually listening to a knock there was bo snecker reckless youth fondling a flower he had putting the stem in his glass then to his lips and lastly into the buttonhole of blomes vest there was hilliard big gloomy maybe with his cavernous eyes seeing the hell where i expected hed soon be and last the little dusty scaly pickens who looked about to leap and sting some one  in the lull of the general conversation i heard pickens say jack drink up an come out of it every man has an off day youve gambled long enough to know every feller gits called an as steele has cashed what the hell do you care  hilliard nodded his ghouls head and blinked his dead eyes bo snecker laughed it wasnt any different laugh from any other boys i remembered then that he killed hoden i began to sweat fire would steele ever come  jim the ole man hed cold feet an hes give em to jack said bo it aint nothin to lose your nerve once didnt i run like a scared jackrabbit from steele watch me if he comes to life as the ole man hinted  about mebbe steele wasnt in the dobe at all aw thets a joke i seen him in bed i seen his shadder i heard his shots comin from the room jack you seen an heerd same as me  sure i know the rangers cashed replied blome its not that im sore boys  deader n a doornail in hell replied pickens louder as he lifted his glass heres to lone star steeles ghost an if i seen it this minnit id ask it to waltz with me  the back door swung violently and steele huge as a giant plunged through and leaped square in front of that table  some one of them let out a strange harsh cry it wasnt blome or sneckerprobably pickens he dropped the glass he had lifted the cry had stilled the room so the breaking of the glass was plainly heard for a space that must have been short yet seemed long everybody stood tight steele with both hands out and down leaned a little in a way i had never seen him do it was the position of a greyhound but that was merely the body of him steeles nerve his spirit his meaning was there like lightning about to strike blome maintained a ghastly stricken silence  then the instant was plain when he realized this was no ghost of steele but the ranger in the flesh blomes whole frame rippled as thought jerked him out of his trance his comrades sat stonestill then hilliard and pickens dived without rising from the table their haste broke the spell  i wish i could tell it as quick as it happened but bo snecker turning white as a sheet stuck to blome all the others failed him as he had guessed they would fail low curses and exclamations were uttered by men sliding and pressing back but the principals were mute i was thinking hard yet i had no time to get to steeles side i like the rest was held fast but i kept my eyes sweeping around then back again to that center pair  blome slowly rose i think he did it instinctively because if he had expected his first movement to start the action he never would have moved snecker sat partly on the rail of his chair with both feet square on the floor and he never twitched a muscle there was a striking difference in the looks of these two rustlers snecker had burning holes for eyes in his white face at the last he was staunch defiant game to the core he didnt think but blome faced death and knew it it was infinitely more than the facing of foes the taking of stock preliminary to the even break blomes attitude was that of a trapped wolf about to start into savage action nevertheless equally it was the pitifully weak stand of a ruffian against ruthless and powerful law  the border of pecos county could have had no greater lesson than thisblome facetoface with the ranger that part of the border present saw its most noted exponent of lawlessness a coward almost powerless to go for his gun fatally sure of his own doom  but that moment seeming so long really so short had to end blome made a spasmodic upheaval of shoulder and arm snecker a second later flashed into movement  steele blurred in my sight his action couldnt be followed but i saw his gun waving up flame red oncetwiceand the reports almost boomed together  blome bent forward arm down doubled up and fell over the table and slid to the floor  but sneckers gun cracked with steeles last shot i heard the bullet strike steele it made me sick as if it had hit me but steele never budged snecker leaped up screaming his gun sputtering to the floor his left hand swept to his right arm which had been shattered by steeles bullet  blood streamed everywhere his screams were curses and then ended testifying to a rage hardly human then leaping he went down on his knees after the gun  dont pick it up called steele his command would have checked anyone save an insane man for an instant it even held snecker on his knees right arm hanging limp left extended and face ghastly with agony and fiendish fury he was certainly an appalling sight  bo youre courtin death called a hard voice from the crowd  snecker wait dont make me kill you cried steele swiftly youre still a boy surrender youll outlive your sentence many years i promise clemency hold you fool  but snecker was not to be denied the last game move he scrabbled for his gun just then something a breathtaking intuitionill never know whatmade me turn my head i saw the bartender deliberately aim a huge gun at steele if he had not been so slow i would have been too late i whirled and shot talk about nick of time blandy pulled trigger just as my bullet smashed into his head  he dropped dead behind the bar and his gun dropped in front but he had hit steele  the ranger staggered almost fell i thought he was done and yelling i sped to him  but he righted himself then i wheeled again someone in the crowd killed bo snecker as he wobbled up with his gun that was the signal for a wild run for outdoors for cover i heard the crack of guns and whistle of lead i shoved steele back of the bar falling over blandy as i did so  when i got up steele was leaning over the bar with a gun in each hand there was a hot fight then for a minute or so but i didnt fire a shot morton and his crowd were busy men ran everywhere shooting ducking cursing the room got blue with smoke till you couldnt see and then the fight changed to the street  steele and i ran out there was shooting everywhere mortons crowd appeared to be in pursuit of rustlers in all directions i ran with steele and did not observe his condition until suddenly he fell right down in the street then he looked so white and so bloody i thought hed stopped another bullet and  here miss sampsons agitation made it necessary for me to halt my story and i hoped she had heard enough but she was not sick as sally appeared to me she simply had been overcome by emotion and presently with a blaze in her eyes that showed how her soul was aflame with righteous wrath at these rustlers and ruffians and how whether she knew it or not the woman in her loved a fight she bade me go on so i persevered and with poor little sally sagging against me i went on with the details of that fight  i told how steele rebounded from his weakness and could no more have been stopped than an avalanche for all i saw he did not use his guns again here there everywhere as morton and his squad cornered a rustler steele would go in ordering surrender promising protection he seemed to have no thoughts of bullets i could not hold him back and it was hard to keep pace with him how many times he was shot at i had no idea but it was many he dragged forth this and that rustler and turned them all over to morton to be guarded more than once he protected a craven rustler from the summary dealing morton wanted to see in order  i told miss sampson particularly how steele appeared to me what his effect was on these men how toward the end of the fight rustlers were appealing to him to save them from these newborn vigilantes i believed i drew a picture of the ranger that would live forever in her heart of hearts if she were a heroworshiper she would have her fill  one thing that was strange to meleaving fight action blood peril out of the storythe singular exultation for want of some better term that i experienced in recalling steeles look his wonderful cold resistless inexplicable presence his unquenchable spirit which was at once deadly and merciful other men would have killed where he saved i recalled this magnificent spiritual something about him remembered it strongest in the ring of his voice as he appealed to bo snecker not to force him to kill then i told how we left a dozen prisoners under guard and went back to the hope so to find blome where he had fallen steeles bullet had cut one of the petals of the rose snecker had playfully put in the rustlers buttonhole bright and fatal target for an eye like steeles bo snecker lay clutching his gun his face set rigidly in that last fierce expression of his savage nature there were five other dead men on the floor and significant of the work of steeles unknown allies hilliard and pickens were among them  steele and i made for camp then i concluded we didnt speak a word on the way out when we reached camp all steele said was for me to go off and leave him alone he looked sick i went off only not very far i knew what was wrong with him and it wasnt bulletwounds i was near when he had his spell and fought it out  strange how spilling blood affects some men it never bothered me much i hope im human too i certainly felt an awful joy when i sent that bullet into blandys bloated head in time and ill always feel that way about it but steeles different     chapter 12  torn two ways   steele lay in a shady little glade partly walled by the masses of upreared rocks that we used as a lookout point he was asleep yet far from comfortable the bandage i had put around his head had been made from strips of soiled towel and having collected sundry bloody spots it was an unsightly affair there was a blotch of dried blood down one side of steeles face his shirt bore more dark stains and in one place was pasted fast to his shoulder where a bandage marked the location of his other wound a number of green flies were crawling over him and buzzing around his head he looked helpless despite his giant size and certainly a great deal worse off than i had intimated and in fact than he really was  miss sampson gasped when she saw him and both her hands flew to her breast  girls dont make any noise i whispered id rather he didnt wake suddenly to find you here go round behind the rocks there ill wake him and call you presently  they complied with my wish and i stepped down to steele and gave him a little shake he awoke instantly  hello i said want a drink  water or champagne he inquired  i stared at him ive some champagne behind the rocks i added  water you locoed son of a gun  he looked about as thirsty as a desert coyote also he looked flighty i was reaching for the canteen when i happened to think what pleasure it would be to miss sampson to minister to him and i drew back wait a little then with an effort i plunged vaughn listen miss sampson and sally are here  i thought he was going to jump up he started so violently and i pressed him back  shewhy shes been here all the timeruss you havent doublecrossed me  steele i exclaimed he was certainly out of his head  pure accident old man  he appeared to be half stunned yet an eager strange haunting look shone in his eyes fool he exclaimed  cant you make the ordeal easier for her i asked  thisll be hard on diane shes got to be told things  ah breathed steele sinking back make it easier for herruss youre a damned schemer you have given me the doublecross you have and shes going to  were in bad both of us i replied thickly ive ideas crazy enough maybe im between the devil and the deep sea i tell you im about ready to show yellow all the same i say see miss sampson and talk to her even if you cant talk straight  all right russ he replied hurriedly but god man dont i look a sight all this dirt and blood  well old man if she takes that bungled mug of yours in her lap you can be sure youre loved you neednt jump out of your boots brace up now for im going to bring the girls as i got up to go i heard him groan i went round behind the stones and found the girls come on i said hes awake now but a little queer feverish he gets that way sometimes it wont last long i led miss sampson and sally back into the shade of our little camp glade  steele had gotten worse all in a moment also the fool had pulled the bandage off his head his wound had begun to bleed anew and the flies were paying no attention to his weak efforts to brush them away his head rolled as we reached his side and his eyes were certainly wild and wonderful and devouring enough whos that he demanded  easy there old man i replied ive brought the girls miss sampson shook like a leaf in the wind  so youve come to see me die asked steele in a deep and hollow voice miss sampson gave me a lightning glance of terror  hes only off his head i said soon as we wash and bathe his head cool his temperature hell be all right  oh cried miss sampson and dropped to her knees flinging her gloves aside she lifted steeles head into her lap when i saw her tears falling upon his face i felt worse than a villain she bent over him for a moment and one of the tender hands at his cheeks met the flow of fresh blood and did not shrink sally she said bring the scarf out of my coat theres a veil too bring that russ you get me some waterpour some in the pan there  water whispered steele  she gave him a drink sally came with the scarf and veil and then she backed away to the stone and sat there the sight of blood had made her a little pale and weak miss sampsons hands trembled and her tears still fell but neither interfered with her tender and skillful dressing of that bullet wound  steele certainly said a lot of crazy things but whyd you comewhyre you so goodwhen you dont love me  oh buti dolove you whispered miss sampson brokenly  how do i know  i am here i tell you  there was a silence during which she kept on bathing his head and he kept on watching her diane he broke out suddenly  yesyes  that wont stop the pain in my head  oh i hope so  kiss methat will he whispered she obeyed as a child might have and kissed his damp forehead close to the red furrow where the bullet cut  not there steele whispered  then blindly as if drawn by a magnet she bent to his lips i could not turn away my head though my instincts were delicate enough i believe that kiss was the first kiss of love for both diane sampson and vaughn steele it was so strange and so long and somehow beautiful steele looked rapt i could only see the side of dianes face and that was white like snow after she raised her head she seemed unable for a moment to take up her task where it had been broken off and steele lay as if he really were dead here i got up and seating myself beside sally i put an arm around her sally dear there are others i said  oh russwhats to come of it all she faltered and then she broke down and began to cry softly i would have been only too glad to tell her what hung in the balance one way or another had i known but surely catastrophe then i heard steeles voice again and its huskiness its different tone made me fearful made me strain my ears when i tried or thought i tried not to listen  diane you know how hard my duty is dont you  yes i knowi think i know  youve guessedabout your father  ive seen all along you must clash but it neednt be so bad if i can only bring you two togetherah please dont speak any more youre excited now just not yourself  no listen we must clash your father and i diane hes not  not what he seems oh i know to my sorrow  what do you know she seemed drawn by a will stronger than her own to my shame i know he has been greedy crafty unscrupulousdishonest  diane if he were only that that wouldnt make my duty torture that wouldnt ruin your life dear sweet girl forgive meyour fathers  hush vaughn youre growing excited it will not do pleaseplease  diane your fatherschief of thisgang that i came to break up  my god hear him how dare youoh vaughn poor poor boy youre out of your mind sally russ what shall we do hes worse hes saying the most dreadful things ii cant bear to hear him  steele heaved a sigh and closed his eyes i walked away with sally led her to and fro in a shady aisle beyond the rocks and tried to comfort her as best i could after a while when we returned to the glade miss sampson had considerable color in her cheeks and steele was leaning against the rock grave and sad i saw that he had recovered and he had reached the critical point hello russ he said sprung a surprise on me didnt you miss sampson says ive been a little flighty while she bandaged me up i hope i wasnt bad i certainly feel better now i seem toto have dreamed  miss sampson flushed at his concluding words then silence ensued i could not think of anything to say and sally was dumb you all seem very strange said miss sampson  when steeles face turned gray to his lips i knew the moment had come no doubt we all feel so deeply for you he said  me why  because the truth must no longer be concealed  it was her turn to blanch and her eyes strained dark as night flashed from one of us to the other  the truth tell it then she had more courage than any of us  miss sampson your father is the leader of this gang of rustlers i have been tracing your cousin george wright is his righthand man  miss sampson heard but she did not believe  tell her russ steele added huskily turning away wildly she whirled to me i would have given anything to have been able to lie to her as it was i could not speak but she read the truth in my face and she collapsed as if she had been shot i caught her and laid her on the grass sally murmuring and crying worked over her i helped but steele stood aloof dark and silent as if he hoped she would never return to consciousness  when she did come to and began to cry to moan to talk frantically steele staggered away while sally and i made futile efforts to calm her all we could do was to prevent her doing herself violence presently when her fury of emotion subsided and she began to show a hopeless stricken shame i left sally with her and went off a little way myself how long i remained absent i had no idea but it was no inconsiderable length of time upon my return to my surprise and relief miss sampson had recovered her composure or at least selfcontrol she stood leaning against the rock where steele had been and at this moment beyond any doubt she was supremely more beautiful than i had ever seen her she was white tragic wonderful where is mr steele she asked her tone and her look did not seem at all suggestive of the mood i expected to find her inone of beseeching agony of passionate appeal to steele not to ruin her father  ill find him i replied turning away  steele was readily found and came back with me he was as unlike himself as she was strange but when they again faced each other then they were indeed new to me  i want to knowwhat you must do she said steele told her briefly and his voice was stern  thosethose criminals outside of my own family dont concern me now but can my father and cousin be taken without bloodshed i want to know the absolute truth steele knew that they could not be but he could not tell her so again she appealed to me thus my part in the situation grew harder it hurt me so that it made me angry and my anger made me cruelly frank  no it cant be done sampson and wright will be desperately hard to approach whichll make the chances even so if you must know the truth itll be your father and cousin to go under or itll be steele or me or any combination luck breaksor all of us  her selfcontrol seemed to fly to the four winds swift as light she flung herself down before steele against his knees clasped her arms round him good god miss sampson you mustnt do that implored steele he tried to break her hold with shaking hands but he could not  listen listen she cried and her voice made steele and sally and me also still as the rock behind us hear me do you think i beg you to let my father go for his sake no no i have gloried in your ranger duty i have loved you because of it but some awful tragedy threatens here listen vaughn steele do not you deny me as i kneel here i love you i never loved any other man but not for my love do i beseech you  there is no help here unless you forswear your duty forswear it do not kill my fatherthe father of the woman who loves you worse and more horrible it would be to let my father kill you its i who make this situation unnatural impossible you must forswear your duty i can live no longer if you dont i pray you her voice had sunk to a whisper and now it failed then she seemed to get into his arms to wind herself around him her hair loosened her face upturned white and spent her arms blindly circling his neck she was all love all surrender all supreme appeal and these without her beauty would have made her wonderful but her beauty would not steele have been less than a man or more than a man had he been impervious to it she was like some snowwhite exquisite flower broken and suddenly blighted she was a woman then in all that made a woman helplessin all that made her mysterious sacred absolutely and unutterably more than any other thing in life all this time my gaze had been riveted on her only but when she lifted her white face tried to lift it rather and he drew her up and then when both white faces met and seemed to blend in something rapt awesome tragic as lifethen i saw steele  i saw a god a man as beautiful as she was they might have stood indeed they did stand alone in the heart of a desertalone in the worldalone with their love and their agony it was a solemn and profound moment for me i faintly realized how great it must have been for them yet all the while there hammered at my mind the vital thing at stake had they forgotten while i remembered it might have been only a moment that he held her it might have been my own agitation that conjured up such swift and whirling thoughts but if my mind sometimes played me false my eyes never had i thought i saw diane sampson die in steeles arms i could have sworn his heart was breaking and mine was on the point of breaking too  how beautiful they were how strong how mercifully strong yet shaken he seemed how tenderly hopelessly fatally appealing she was in that hour of her broken life if i had been steele i would have forsworn my duty honor name service for her sake had i mind enough to divine his torture his temptation his narrow escape i seemed to feel them at any rate and while i saw him with a beautiful light on his face i saw him also ghastly ashen with hands that shook as they groped around her loosing her only to draw her convulsively back again it was the saddest sight i had ever seen death was nothing to it here was the death of happiness he must wreck the life of the woman who loved him and whom he loved i was becoming half frantic almost ready to cry out the uselessness of this scene almost on the point of pulling them apart when sally dragged me away her clinging hold then made me feel perhaps a little of what miss sampsons must have been to steele  how different the feeling when it was mine i could have thrust them apart after all my schemes and tricks to throw them together in vague undefined fear of their embrace still when love beat at my own pulses when sallys soft hand held me tight and she leaned to methat was different i was glad to be led awayglad to have a chance to pull myself together but was i to have that chance sally who in the stife of emotion had been forgotten might have to be reckoned with deep within me some motive some purpose was being born in travail i did not know what but instinctively i feared sally i feared her because i loved her my wits came back to combat my passion this hazeleyed girl soft fragile creature might be harder to move than the ranger but could she divine a motive scarcely yet formed in my brain suddenly i became cool with craft to conceal  oh russ whats the matter with you she queried quickly cant diane and steele you and i ride away from this bloody bad country our own lives our happiness come first do they not  they ought to i suppose i muttered fighting against the insidious sweetness of her i knew then i must keep my lips shut or betray myself  you look so strange russ i wouldnt want you to kiss me with that mouth thin shut lipssmile soften and kiss me oh youre so cold strange you chill me  dear child im badly shaken i said dont expect me to be natural yet there are things you cant guess so much depended uponoh never mind ill go now i want to be alone to think things out let me go sally  she held me only the tighter tried to pull my face around how intuitively keen women were she felt my distress and that growing stern and powerful thing i scarcely dared to acknowledge to myself strangely then i relaxed and faced her there was no use trying to foil these feminine creatures every second i seemed to grow farther from her the swiftness of this mood of mine was my only hope i realized i had to get away quickly and make up my mind after that what i intended to do it was an earnest soulful and loving pair of eyes that i met what did she read in mine her hands left mine to slide to my shoulders to slip behind my neck to lock there like steel bands here was my ordeal was it to be as terrible as steeles had been i thought it would be and i swore by all that was rising grim and cold in me that i would be strong sally gave a little cry that cut like a blade in my heart and then she was closepressed upon me her quivering breast beating against mine her eyes dark as night now searching my soul  she saw more than i knew and with her convulsive clasp of me confirmed my halfformed fears then she kissed me kisses that had no more of girlhood or coquetry or joy or anything but womans passion to blind and hold and tame by their very intensity i sensed the tiger in me and it was the tiger that made her new and alluring sweetness fail of its intent i did not return one of her kisses just one kiss given backand i would be lost  oh russ im your promised wife she whispered at my lips soon you said i want it to be soon tomorrow all the subtlety the intelligence the cunning the charm the love that made up the whole of womans power breathed in her pleading what speech known to the tongue could have given me more torture she chose the strongest weapon nature afforded her and had the calamity to consider been mine alone i would have laughed at it and taken sally at her word then i told her in short husky sentences what had depended on steele that i loved the ranger service but loved him more that his character his life embodied this service i loved that i had ruined him and now i would forestall him do his work force the issue myself or die in the attempt  dearest its great of you she cried but the cost if you kill one of my kin illill shrink from you if youre killedoh the thought is dreadful youve done your share let steelesome other ranger finish it i swear i dont plead for my uncle or my cousin for their sakes if they are vile let them suffer russ its you i think of oh my pitiful little dreams i wanted so to surprise you with my beautiful homethe oranges the mossy trees the mockingbirds now youll never never come  but sally theres a chancea mere chance i can do the job without  then she let go of me she had given up i thought she was going to drop and drew her toward the stone i cursed the day i ever saw neal and the service where now was the arch prettiness the gay sweet charm of sally langdon she looked as if she were suffering from a desperate physical injury and her final breakdown showed how one way or another i was lost to her  as she sank on the stone i had my supreme wrench and it left me numb hard in a cold sweat dont betray me ill forestall him hes planned nothing for today i whispered hoarsely sallyyou dearest gamest little girl in the world remember i loved you even if i couldnt prove it your way its for his sake im to blame for their love some day my act will look different to you goodby     chapter 13  russ sittell in action   i ran like one possessed of devils down that rough slope hurdling the stones and crashing through the brush with a sound in my ears that was not all the rush of the wind when i reached a level i kept running but something dragged at me i slowed down to a walk never in my life had i been victim of such sensation i must flee from something that was drawing me back apparently one side of my mind was unalterably fixed while the other was a hurrying conglomeration of flashes of thought reception of sensations i could not get calm  by and by almost involuntarily with a fleeting look backward as if in expectation of pursuit i hurried faster on action seemed to make my state less oppressive it eased the weight upon me but the farther i went on the harder it was to continue i was turning my back upon love happiness success in life perhaps on life itself i was doing that but my decision had not been absolute there seemed no use to go on farther until i was absolutely sure of myself i received a clear warning thought that such work as seemed haunting and driving me could never be carried out in the mood under which i labored i hung on to that thought several times i slowed up then stopped only to tramp on again  at length as i mounted a low ridge linrock lay bright and green before me not faraway and the sight was a conclusive check there were mesquites on the ridge and i sought the shade beneath them it was the noon hour with hot glary sun and no wind here i had to have out my fight if ever in my varied life of exciting adventure i strove to think to understand myself to see through difficulties i assuredly strove then i was utterly unlike myself i could not bring the old self back i was not the same man i once had been but i could understand why it was because of sally langdon the gay and roguish girl who had bewitched me the girl whom love had made a womanthe kind of woman meant to make life beautiful for me  i saw her changing through all those weeks holding many of the old traits and graces acquiring new character of mind and body to become what i had just fled froma woman sweet fair loyal loving passionate  temptation assailed me to have her tomorrowmy wife she had said it just twentyfour little hours and she would be minethe only woman i had ever really coveted the only one who had ever found the good in me the thought was alluring i followed it out a long happy stageride back to austin and then by train to her home where as she had said the oranges grew and the trees waved with streamers of gray moss and the mockingbirds made melody i pictured that home i wondered that long before i had not associated wealth and luxury with her family always i had owned a weakness for plantations for the agricultural life with its open air and freedom from towns  i saw myself riding through the cotton and rice and cane home to the stately old mansion where longeared hounds bayed me welcome and a woman looked for me and met me with happy and beautiful smiles there mightthere would be children and something new strange confounding with its emotion came to life deep in my heart there would be children sally their mother i their father the kind of life a lonely ranger always yearned for and never had i saw it all felt it keenly lived its sweetness in an hour of temptation that made me weak physically and my spirit faint and low  for what had i turned my back on this beautiful allsatisfying prospect was it to arrest and jail a few rustlers was it to meet that mocking sampson face to face and show him my shield and reach for my gun was it to kill that hated wright was it to save the people of linrock from further greed raids murder was it to please and aid my old captain neal of the rangers was it to save the service to the state  noa thousand times no it was for the sake of steele because he was a wonderful man because i had been his undoing because i had thrown diane sampson into his arms that had been my great error this ranger had always been the wonder and despair of his fellow officers so magnificent a machine so sober temperate chaste so unremittingly loyal to the service so strangely stern and faithful to his conception of the law so perfect in his fidelity to duty he was the model the inspiration the pride of all of us to me indeed he represented the ranger service he was the incarnation of that spirit which fighting texas had developed to oppose wildness and disorder and crime he would carry through this linrock case but even so if he were not killed his career would be ruined he might save the service yet at the cost of his happiness he was not a machine he was a man he might be a perfect ranger still he was a human being  the loveliness the passion the tragedy of a woman great as they were had not power to shake him from his duty futile hopeless vain her love had been to influence him but there had flashed over me with subtle overwhelming suggestion that not futile not vain was my love to save him therefore beyond and above all other claims and by reason of my wrong to him his claim came first  it was then there was something cold and deathlike in my soul it was then i bade farewell to sally langdon for i knew whatever happened of one thing i was surei would have to kill either sampson or wright snecker could be managed sampson might be trapped into arrest but wright had no sense no control no fear he would snarl like a panther and go for his gun and he would have to be killed this of all consummations was the one to be calculated upon and of course by sallys own words that contingency would put me forever outside the pale for her  i did not deceive myself i did not accept the slightest intimation of hope i gave her up and then for a time regret remorse pain darkness worked their will with me  i came out of it all bitter and callous and sore in the most fitting of moods to undertake a difficult and deadly enterprise miss sampson completely slipped my mind sally became a wraith as of some one dead steele began to fade in their places came the bushybearded snecker the oliveskinned sampson with his sharp eyes and dark evil faced wright their possibilities began to loom up and with my speculation returned tenfold more thrilling and sinister the old strange zest of the manhunt  it was about one oclock when i strode into linrock the streets for the most part were deserted i went directly to the hall where morton and zimmer with their men had been left by steele to guard the prisoners i found them camping out in the place restless somber anxious the fact that only about half the original number of prisoners were left struck me as further indication of mortons summary dealing but when i questioned him as to the decrease in number he said bluntly that they had escaped i did not know whether or not to believe him but that didnt matter i tried to get in some more questions only i found that morton and zimmer meant to be heard first wheres steele they demanded  hes out of town in a safe place i replied too bad hurt for action im to rush through with the rest of the deal  thats good weve waited long enough this gang has been split an if we hurry theyll never get together again old man snecker showed up today hes drawin the outfit in again reckon hes waitin for orders sure hes ragin since bo was killed this old fox will be dangerous if he gets goin  where is he now i queried  over at the hope so must be a dozen of the gang there but hes the only leader left we know of if we get him the rustler gang will be broken for good hes sent word down here for us to let our prisoners go or thered be a damn bloody fight we havent sent our answer yet was hopin steele would show up an now were sure glad youre back  morton ill take the answer i replied quickly now therere two things do you know if sampson and wright are at the ranch  they were an hour ago we had word zimmer saw dick  all right have you any horses handy  sure those hitched outside belong to us  i want you to take a man with you in a few moments and ride round the back roads and up to sampsons house get off and wait under the trees till you hear me shoot or yell then come fast  mortons breast heaved he whistled as he breathed his neck churned god almighty so there the scent leads we always wonderedhalf believed but no one spokeno one had any nerve morton moistened his lips his face was livid his big hands shook russ you can gamble on me  good well thats all come out and get me a horse  when i had mounted and was halfway to the hope so my plan as far as snecker was concerned had been formed it was to go boldy into the saloon ask for the rustler first pretend i had a reply from morton and then when i had sneckers ear whisper a message supposedly from sampson if snecker was too keen to be decoyed i could at least surprise him off his guard and kill him then run for my horse the plan seemed clever to me i had only one thing to fear and that was a possibility of the rustlers having seen my part in steeles defense the other day that had to be risked there were always some kind of risks to be faced  it was scarcely a block and a half to the hope so before i arrived i knew i had been seen when i dismounted before the door i felt cold yet there was an exhilaration in the moment i never stepped more naturally and carelessly into the saloon it was full of men there were men behind the bar helping themselves evidently blandys place had not been filled every face near the door was turned toward me dark intent scowling malignant they were and made me need my nerve  say boys ive a word for snecker i called quite loud nobody stirred i swept my glance over the crowd but did not see snecker im in some hurry i added  bill aint here said a man at the table nearest me air you comin from morton  nit but im not yellin this message  the rustler rose and in a few long strides confronted me  word from sampson i whispered and the rustler stared im in his confidence hes got to see bill at once sampson sends word hes quithes donehes through the jig is up and he means to hit the road out of linrock  billll kill him surer n hell muttered the rustler but we all said itd come to thet an whatd wright say  wright why hes cashed in didnt youall hear reckon sampson shot him  the rustler cursed his amaze and swung his rigid arm with fist clenched tight when did wright get it  a little while ago i dont know how long anyway i saw him lyin dead on the porch an say pard ive got to rustle send bill up quick as he comes tell him sampson wants to turn over all his stock an then light out  i backed to the door and the last i saw of the rustler he was standing there in a scowling amaze i had fooled him all right if only i had the luck to have snecker come along soon mounting i trotted the horse leisurely up the street business and everything else was at a standstill in linrock these days the doors of the stores were barricaded down side streets however i saw a few people a buckboard and stray cattle  when i reached the edge of town i turned aside a little and took a look at the ruins of steeles adobe house the walls and debris had all been flattened scattered about and if anything of value had escaped destruction it had disappeared steele however had left very little that would have been of further use to him turning again i continued on my way up to the ranch it seemed that though i was eager rather than backward my mind seized avidly upon suggestion or attraction as if to escape the burden of grim pondering when about halfway across the flat and perhaps just out of gunshot sound of sampsons house i heard the rapid clatter of hoofs on the hard road i wheeled expecting to see morton and his man and was ready to be chagrined at their coming openly instead of by the back way but this was only one man and it was not morton he seemed of big build and he bestrode a fine bay horse there evidently was reason for hurry too at about one hundred yards when i recognized snecker complete astonishment possessed me  well it was i had ample time to get on my guard in wheeling my horse i booted him so hard that he reared as i had been warm i had my sombrero over the pommel of the saddle and when the head of my horse blocked any possible sight of movement of my hand i pulled my gun and held it concealed under my sombrero this rustler had bothered me in my calculations and here he came galloping alone exultation would have been involuntary then but for the sudden shock and then the cold settling of temper the breathless suspense snecker pulled his huge bay and pounded to halt abreast of me luck favored me had i ever had anything but luck in these dangerous deals  snecker seemed to fume internally there was a volcano his wide sombrero and bushy beard hid all of his face except his eyes which were deepset furnaces he too like his lieutenant had been carried completely off balance by the strange message apparently from sampson it was sampsons name that had fooled and decoyed these men hey youre the feller who jest left word fer some one at the hope so he asked  yes i replied while with my left hand i patted the neck of my horse holding him still  sampson wants me bad eh  reckon theres only one man who wants you more  steadily i met his piercing gaze this was a rustler not to be long victim to any ruse i waited in cold surety  you thet cowboy russ he asked  i wasand im not i replied significantly  the violent start of this violent outlaw was a rippling jerk of passion whatn hell he ejaculated  bill youre easy  whore you he uttered hoarsely  i watched snecker with hawklike keenness united states deputy marshal bill youre under arrest  he roared a mad curse as his hand clapped down to his gun then i fired through my sombrero sneckers big horse plunged the rustler fell back and one of his legs pitched high as he slid off the lunging steed his other foot caught in the stirrup this fact terribly frightened the horse he bolted dragging the rustler for a dozen jumps then sneckers foot slipped loose he lay limp and still and shapeless in the road i did not need to go back to look him over  but to make assurance doubly sure i dismounted and went back to where he lay my bullet had gone where it had been aimed as i rode up into sampsons courtyard and turned in to the porch i heard loud and angry voices sampson and wright were quarrelling again how my lucky star guided me i had no plan of action but my brain was equal to a hundred lightningswift evolutions the voices ceased the men had heard the horse both of them came out on the porch in an instant i was again the lolling impudent cowboy half under the influence of liquor  its only russ and hes drunk said george wright contemptuously  i heard horses trotting off there replied sampson maybe the girls are coming i bet i teach them not to run off againhello russ  he looked haggard and thin but seemed amiable enough he was in his shirtsleeves and he had come out with a gun in his hand this he laid on a table near the wall he wore no belt i rode right up to the porch and greeting them laconically made a show of a somewhat tanglefooted cowboy dismounting the moment i got off and straightened up i asked no more the game was mine it was the great hour of my life and i met it as i had never met another i looked and acted what i pretended to be though a deep and intense passion an almost ungovernable suspense an icy sickening nausea abided with me all i needed all i wanted was to get sampson and wright together or failing that to maneuver into such position that i had any kind of a chance sampsons gun on the table made three distinct objects for me to watch and two of them could change position  what do you want here demanded wright he was red bloated thicklipped all fiery and sweaty from drink though sober on the moment and he had the expression of a desperate man in his last stand it was his last stand though he was ignorant of that  mesay wright i aint fired yet i replied in slowrising resentment  well youre fired now he replied insolently  who fires me id like to know i walked up on the porch and i had a cigarette in one hand a match in the other i struck the match  i do said wright  i studied him with apparent amusement it had taken only one glance around for me to divine that sampson would enjoy any kind of a clash between wright and me huh you fired me once before an it didnt go wright i reckon you dont stack up here as strong as you think  he was facing the porch moody preoccupied somber all the time only a little of his mind was concerned with me manifestly there were strong forces at work both men were strained to a last degree and wright could be made to break at almost a word sampson laughed mockingly at this sally of mine and that stung wright he stopped his pacing and turned his handsome fiery eyes on me sampson i wont stand this mans impudence  aw wright cut that talk im not impudent sampson knows im a good fellow on the square and i have you sized up about ok  all the same russ youd better dig out said sampson dont kick up any fuss were busy with deals today and i expect visitors  sure i wont stay around where i aint wanted i replied then i lit my cigarette and did not move an inch out of my tracks  sampson sat in a chair near the door the table upon which lay his gun stood between him and wright this position did not invite me to start anything but the tension had begun to be felt sampson had his sharp gaze on me whatd you come for anyway he asked suddenly  well i had some news i was asked to fetch in  get it out of you then  see here now mr sampson the fact is im a tenderhearted fellow i hate to hurt peoples feelins and if i was to spring this news in mr wrights hearin why such a sensitive hightempered gentleman as he would go plumb off his nut unconcealed sarcasm was the dominant note in that speech wright flared up yet he was eagerly curious sampson probably thought i was only a little worse for drink and but for the way i rubbed wright he would not have tolerated me at all  whats this news you neednt be afraid of my feelings said wright  aint so sure of that i drawled it concerns the lady youre sweet on an the ranger you aint sweet on  sampson jumped up russ had diane gone out to meet steele he asked angrily  sure she had i replied  i thought wright would choke he was thicknecked anyway and the gush of blood made him tear at the soft collar of his shirt both men were excited now moving about beginning to rouse i awaited my chance patient cold all my feelings shut in the vise of my will  how do you know she met steele demanded sampson  i was there i met sally at the same time  but why should my daughter meet this ranger  shes in love with him and hes in love with her  the simple statement might have had the force of a juggernaut i reveled in wrights state but i felt sorry for sampson he had not outlived his pride then i saw the leaping thoughtwould this daughter side against him would she help to betray him he seemed to shrivel up to grow old while i watched him  wright finding his voice cursed diane cursed the ranger then sampson then me  you damned selfish fool cried sampson in deep bitter scorn all you think of is yourself your loss of the girl think once of memy homemy life  then the connection subtly put out by sampson apparently dawned upon the other somehow through this girl her father and cousin were to be betrayed i got that impression though i could not tell how true it was certainly wrights jealousy was his paramount emotion  sampson thrust me sidewise off the porch go away he ordered he did not look around to see if i came back quickly i leaped to my former position he confronted wright he was beyond the table where the gun lay they were close together my moment had come the game was mineand a ball of fire burst in my brain to race all over me  to hell with you burst out wright incoherently he was frenzied ill have her or nobody else will  you never will returned sampson stridently so help me god id rather see her ranger steeles wife than yours  while wright absorbed that shock sampson leaned toward him all of hate and menace in his mien they had forgotten the halfdrunken cowboy wright you made me what i am continued sampson i backed you protected you finally i went in with you now its ended i quit you im done their gray passioncorded faces were still as stones  gentlemen i called in clear high farreaching voice the intonation of authority youre both done  they wheeled to confront me to see my leveled gun dont move not a muscle not a finger i warned sampson read what wright had not the mind to read his face turned paler gray to ashen  what dye mean yelled wright fiercely shrilly it was not in him to obey my command to see impending death all quivering and strung yet with perfect control i raised my left hand to turn back a lapel of my open vest the silver shield flashed brightly  united states deputy marshal in service of ranger steele  wright howled like a dog with barbarous and insane fury with sheer impotent folly he swept a clawing hand for his gun my shot broke his action as it cut short his life before wright even tottered before he loosed the gun sampson leaped behind him clasped him with his left arm quick as lightning jerked the gun from both clutching fingers and sheath i shot at sampson then again then a third time all my bullets sped into the upheld nodding wright sampson had protected himself with the body of the dead man i had seen red flashes puffs of smoke had heard quick reports something stung my left arm then a blow like wind light of sound yet shocking in impact struck me knocked me flat the hot rend of lead followed the blow my heart seemed to explode yet my mind kept extraordinarily clear and rapid  i raised myself felt a post at my shoulder leaned on it i heard sampson work the action of wrights gun i heard the hammer click fall upon empty shells he had used up all the loads in wrights gun i heard him curse as a man cursed at defeat i waited cool and sure now for him to show his head or other vital part from behind his bolster he tried to lift the dead man to edge him closer toward the table where the gun lay but considering the peril of exposing himself he found the task beyond him he bent peering at me under wrights arm sampsons eyes were the eyes of a man who meant to kill me there was never any mistaking the strange and terrible light of eyes like those  more than once i had a chance to aim at them at the top of sampsons head at a strip of his side but i had only two shells left i wanted to make sure suddenly i remembered morton and his man then i pealed out a cryhoarse strange yet farreaching it was answered by a shout sampson heard it it called forth all that was in the man he flung wrights body off but even as it dropped before sampson could recover to leap as he surely intended for the gun i covered him called piercingly to him i could kill him there or as he moved but one chance i gave him  dont jump for the gun dont ill kill you ive got two shells left sure as god ill kill you  he stood perhaps ten feet from the table where his gun lay i saw him calculating chances he was game he had the courage that forced me to respect him i just saw him measure the distance to that gun he was magnificent he meant to do it i would have to kill him  sampson listen i cried very swiftly the games up youre done but think of your daughter ill spare your life ill give you freedom on one condition for her sake ive got you nailedall the proofs it was i behind the wall the other night blome hilliard pickens bo snecker are dead i killed bo snecker on the way up here there lies wright youre alone and here comes morton and his men to my aid  give up surrender consent to demands and ill spare you you can go free back to your old country its for dianes sake her life perhaps her happiness can be saved hurry man your answer  suppose i refuse he queried with a dark and terrible earnestness  then ill kill you in your tracks you cant move a hand your word or death hurry sampson i cant last much longer but i can kill you before i drop be a man for her sake quick another second nowby god ill kill you  all right russ i give my word he said and deliberately walked to the chair and fell into it just as morton came running up with his man  put away your gun i ordered them the games up snecker and wright are dead sampson is my prisoner he has my word hell be protected its for you to draw up papers with him hell divide all his property every last acre every head of stock as you and zimmer dictate he gives up all then hes free to leave the country and hes never to return     chapter 14  through the valley   sampson looked strangely at the great bloody blot on my breast and his look made me conscious of a dark hurrying of my mind morton came stamping up the steps with blunt queries with anxious mien when he saw the front of me he halted threw wide his arms  there come the girls suddenly exclaimed sampson morton help me drag wright inside they mustnt see him  i was facing down the porch toward the court and corrals miss sampson and sally had come in sight were swiftly approaching evidently alarmed steele no doubt had remained out at the camp i was watching them wondering what they would do and say presently and then sampson and johnson came to carry me indoors they laid me on the couch in the parlor where the girls used to be so often  russ youre pretty hard hit said sampson bending over me with his hands at my breast the room was bright with sunshine yet the light seemed to be fading  reckon i am i replied  im sorry if only you could have told me sooner wright damn him always ive split over him  but the last time sampson  yes and i came near driving you to kill me too russ you talked me out of it for dianes sake shell be in here in a minute thisll be harder than facing a gun  hard now but itllturn outok  russ will you do me a favor he asked and he seemed shamefaced  sure  let diane and sally think wright shot you hes dead it cant matter and youre hard hit the girls are fond of you ifif you go underruss the old side of my life is coming back its been coming itll be here just about when she enters this room and by god id change places with you if i could  glad yousaid that sampson i replied and surewright plugged me its our secret ive a reason too notthatitmattersmuchnow  the light was fading i could not talk very well i felt dumb strange locked in ice with dull little prickings of my flesh with dim rushing sounds in my ears but my mind was clear evidently there was little to be done morton came in looked at me and went out i heard the quick light steps of the girls on the porch and murmuring voices  wherem i hit i whispered  three places arm shoulder and a bad one in the breast it got your lung im afraid but if you dont go quick youve a chance  sure ive a chance  russ ill tell the girls do what i can for you then settle with morton and clear out  just then diane and sally entered the room i heard two low cries so different in tone and i saw two dim white faces sally flew to my side and dropped to her knees both hands went to my face then to my breast she lifted them shaking they were red white and mute she gazed from them to me but some womans intuition kept her from fainting  papa cried diane wringing her hands  dont give way he replied both you girls will need your nerve russ is badly hurt theres little hope for him  sally moaned and dropped her face against me clasping me convulsively i tried to reach a hand out to touch her but i could not move i felt her hair against my face diane uttered a low heartrending cry which both sampson and i understood  listen let me tell it quick he said huskily theres been a fight russ killed snecker and wright they resisted arrest itit was wrightit was wrights gun that put russ down russ let me off in fact diane he saved me im to divide my propertyreturn so far as possible what ive stolenleave texas at once and forever youll find me back in old louisianaifif you ever want to come home  as she stood there realizing her deliverance with the dark and tragic glory of her eyes passing from her father to me my own sight shadowed and i thought if i were dying then it was not in vain  sendforsteele i whispered  silently swiftly breathlessly they worked over me i was exquisitely sensitive to touch to sound but i could not see anything by and by all was quiet and i slipped into a black void familiar heavy swift footsteps the thump of heels of a powerful and striding man jarred into the blackness that held me seemed to split it to let me out and i opened my eyes in a sunlit room to see sallys face all lined and haggard to see miss sampson fly to the door and the stalwart ranger bow his lofty head to enter however far life had ebbed from me then it came rushing back keensighted memorable with agonizing pain in every nerve i saw him start i heard him cry but i could not speak he bent over me and i tried to smile he stood silent his hand on me while diane sampson told swiftly brokenly what had happened  how she told it i tried to whisper a protest to any one on earth except steele i might have wished to appear a hero still at that moment i had more dread of him than any other feeling she finished the story with her head on his shoulder with tears that certainly were in part for me once in my life then i saw him stunned but when he recovered it was not diane that he thought of first nor of the end of sampsons power he turned to me  little hope he cried out with the deep ring in his voice no theres every hope no bullet hole like that could ever kill this ranger russ  i could not answer him but this time i did achieve a smile there was no shadow no pain in his face such as had haunted me in sallys and dianes he could fight death the same as he could fight evil he vitalized the girls diane began to hope sally lost her woe he changed the atmosphere of that room something filled it something like himself big virile strong the very look of him made me suddenly want to live and all at once it seemed i felt alive and that was like taking the deadened ends of nerves to cut them raw and quicken them with fiery current  from stupor i had leaped to pain and that tossed me into fever there were spaces darkened mercifully shutting me in there were others of light where i burned and burned in my heated blood sally like the wraith she had become in my mind passed in and out diane watched and helped in those hours when sight was clear but always the ranger was with me sometimes i seemed to feel his spirit grappling with mine drawing me back from the verge sometimes in strange dreams i saw him there between me and a dark cold sinister shape  the fever passed and with the first nourishing drink given me i seemed to find my tongue to gain something  hello old man i whispered to steele  oh lord russ to think you would doublecross me the way you did  that was his first speech to me after i had appeared to face round from the grave his goodhumored reproach told me more than any other thing how far from his mind was thought of death for me then he talked a little to me cheerfully with that directness and force characteristic of him always showing me that the danger was past and that i would now be rapidly on the mend i discovered that i cared little whether i was on the mend or not when i had passed the state of somber unrealities and then the hours of pain and then that first inspiring flush of renewed desire to live an entirely different mood came over me but i kept it to myself i never even asked why for three days sally never entered the room where i lay i associated this fact however with what i had imagined her shrinking from me her intent and pale face her singular manner when occasion made it necessary or unavoidable for her to be near me  no difficulty was there in associating my change of mood with her absence i brooded steeles keen insight betrayed me to him but all his power and his spirit availed nothing to cheer me i pretended to be cheerful i drank and ate anything given me i was patient and quiet but i ceased to mend  then one day she came back and steele who was watching me as she entered quietly got up and without a word took diane out of the room and left me alone with sally  russ ive been sick myselfin bed for three days she said im better now i hope you are you look so pale do you still think brood about that fight  yes i cant forget im afraid it cost me more than life  sally was somber bloomy thoughtful you werent driven to kill george she asked  how do you mean  by that awful instinct that hankering to kill you once told me these gunmen had  no i can swear it wasnt that i didnt want to kill him but he forced me as i had to go after these two men it was a foregone conclusion about wright it was premeditated i have no excuse  hushtell me if you confronted them drew on them then you had a chance to kill my uncle  yes i could have done it easily  why then didnt you  it was for dianes sake im afraid i didnt think of you i had put you out of my mind  well if a man can be noble at the same time hes terrible youve been russi dont know how i feel im sick and i cant think i see though what you saved diane and steele why shes touching happiness again fearfully yet really think of that god only knows what you did for steele if i judged it by his suffering as you lay there about to die it would be beyond words to tell but russ youre pale and shaky now hush no more talk  with all my eyes and mind and heart and soul i watched to see if she shrank from me she was passive yet tender as she smoothed my pillow and moved my head a dark abstraction hung over her and it was so strange so foreign to her nature no sensitiveness on earth could have equaled mine at that moment and i saw and felt and knew that she did not shrink from me thought and feeling escaped me for a while i dozed the old shadows floated to and fro  when i awoke steele and diane had just come in as he bent over me i looked up into his keen gray eyes and there was no mask on my own as i looked up to him  son the thing that was needed was a change of nurses he said gently i intend to make up some sleep now and leave you in better care  from that hour i improved i slept i lay quietly awake i partook of nourishing food i listened and watched and all the time i gained but i spoke very little and though i tried to brighten when steele was in the room i made only indifferent success of it days passed sally was almost always with me yet seldom alone she was grave where once she had been gay how i watched her face praying for that shade to lift how i listened for a note of the old music in her voice sally langdon had sustained a shock to her soul almost as dangerous as had been the blow at my life still i hoped i had seen other womens deadened and darkened spirits rebound and glow once more it began to dawn upon me however that more than time was imperative if she were ever to become her old self again  studying her closer with less thought of myself and her reaction to my presence i discovered that she trembled at shadows seemed like a frightened deer with a step always on its trail was afraid of the dark then i wondered why i had not long before divined one cause of her strangeness the house where i had killed one of her kin would ever be haunted for her she had said she was a southerner and that blood was thick when i had thought out the matter a little further i deliberately sat up in bed scaring the wits out of all my kind nurses  steele ill never get well in this house i want to go home when can you take me  they remonstrated with me and pleaded and scolded all to little avail then they were persuaded to take me seriously to plan providing i improved to start in a few days we were to ride out of pecos county together back along the stage trail to civilization the look in sallys eyes decided my measure of improvement i could have started that very day and have borne up under any pain or distress strange to see too how steele and diane responded to the stimulus of my idea to the promise of what lay beyond the wild and barren hills  he told me that day about the headlong flight of every lawless character out of linrock the very hour that snecker and wright and sampson were known to have fallen steele expressed deep feeling almost mortification that the credit of that final coup had gone to him instead of me his denial and explanation had been only a few soundless words in the face of a grateful and clamorous populace that tried to reward him to make him mayor of linrock sampson had made restitution in every case where he had personally gained at the loss of farmer or rancher and the accumulation of years went far toward returning to linrock what it had lost in a material way he had been a poor man when he boarded the stage for sanderson on his way out of texas forever  not long afterward i heard steele talking to miss sampson in a deep and agitated voice you must rise above this when i come upon you alone i see the shadow the pain in your face how wonderfully this thing has turned out when it might have ruined you i expected it to ruin you who but that wild boy in there could have saved us all diane you have had cause for sorrow but your father is alive and will live it down perhaps back there in louisiana the dishonor will never be known pecos county is far from your old home and even in san antonio and austin a mans evil repute means little  then the line between a rustler and a rancher is hard to draw in these wild border days rustling is stealing cattle and i once heard a wellknown rancher say that all rich cattlemen had done a little stealing your father drifted out here and like a good many others he succeeded its perhaps just as well not to split hairs to judge him by the law and morality of a civilized country some way or other he drifted in with bad men maybe a deal that was honest somehow tied his hands and started him in wrong  this matter of land water a few stray head of stock had to be decided out of court im sure in his case he never realized where he was drifting then one thing led to another until he was face to face with dealing that took on crooked form to protect himself he bound men to him and so the gang developed many powerful gangs have developed that way out here he could not control them he became involved with them  and eventually their dealings became deliberately and boldly dishonest that meant the inevitable spilling of blood sooner or later and so he grew into the leader because he was the strongest whatever he is to be judged for i think he could have been infinitely worse  when he ceased speaking i had the same impulse that must have governed steelesomehow to show sampson not so black as he was painted to give him the benefit of a doubt to arraign him justly in the eyes of rangers who knew what wild border life was  steele bring diane in i called ive something to tell her they came quickly concerned probably at my tone ive been hoping for a chance to tell you something miss sampson that day i came here your father was quarreling with wright i had heard them do that before he hated wright the reason came out just before we had the fight it was my plan to surprise them i did i told them you went out to meet steelethat you two were in love with each other wright grew wild he swore no one would ever have you then sampson said hed rather have you steeles wife than wrights  ill not forget that scene there was a great deal back of it long before you ever came out to linrock your father said that he had backed wright that the deal had ruined him made him a rustler he said he quit he was done now this is all clear to me and i want to explain miss sampson it was wright who ruined your father it was wright who was the rustler it was wright who made the gang necessary but wright had not the brains or the power to lead men because blood is thick your father became the leader of that gang at heart he was never a criminal  the reason i respected him was because he showed himself a man at the last he faced me to be shot and i couldnt do it as steele said youve reason for sorrow but you must get over it you mustnt brood i do not see that youll be disgraced or dishonored of course thats not the point the vital thing is whether or not a woman of your highmindedness had real and lasting cause for shame steele says no i say no  then as miss sampson dropped down beside me her eyes shining and wet sally entered the room in time to see her cousin bend to kiss me gratefully with sisterly fervor yet it was a womans kiss given for its own sake sally could not comprehend it was too sudden too unheardof that diane sampson should kiss me the man she did not love sallys white sad face changed and in the flaming wave of scarlet that dyed neck and cheek and brow i read with mighty pound of heart that despite the dark stain between us she loved me still     chapter 15  convalescence   four mornings later we were aboard the stage riding down the main street on the way out of linrock the whole town turned out to bid us farewell the cheering the clamor the almost passionate fervor of the populace irritated me and i could not see the incident from their point of view never in my life had i been so eager to get out of a place but then i was morbid and the whole world hinged on one thing morton insisted on giving us an escort as far as del rio it consisted of six cowboys mounted with light packs and they rode ahead of the stage  we had the huge vehicle to ourselves a comfortable bed had been rigged up for me by placing boards across from seat to seat and furnishing it with blankets and pillows by some squeezing there was still room enough inside for my three companions but steele expressed an intention of riding mostly outside and miss sampsons expression betrayed her i was to be alone with sally the prospect thrilled while it saddened me how different this ride from that first one with all its promise of adventure and charm  its over said steele thickly its done im glad for their sakesglad for ours were out of town  i had been quick to miss the shouts and cheers and i had been just as quick to see or to imagine a subtle change in sally langdons face we had not traveled a mile before the tension relaxed about her lips the downcast eyelids lifted and i saw beyond any peradventure of doubt a lighter spirit then i relaxed myself for i had keyed up every nerve to make myself strong for this undertaking i lay back with closed eyes weary aching in more pain than i wanted them to discover and i thought and thought  miss sampson had said to me russ itll all come right i can tell you now what you never guessed for years sally had been fond of our cousin george wright she hadnt seen him since she was a child but she remembered she had an only brother who was the image of george sally devotedly loved arthur he was killed in the rebellion she never got over it that left her without any family george and i were her nearest kin  how she looked forward to meeting george out here but he disappointed her right at the start she hates a drinking man i think she came to hate george too but he always reminded her of arthur and she could never get over that so naturally when you killed george she was terribly shocked there were nights when she was haunted when i had to stay with her vaughn and i have studied her talked about her and we think shes gradually recovering she loved you too and sally doesnt change once with her is for always so let me say to you what you said to medo not brood all will yet be well thank god  those had been words to remember to make me patient to lessen my insistent fear yet what did i know of women had not diane sampson and sally langdon amazed and nonplused me many a time at the very moment when i had calculated to a nicety my conviction of their action their feeling it was possible that i had killed sallys love for me though i could not believe so but it was very possible that still loving me she might never break down the barrier between us the beginning of that journey distressed me physically yet gradually as i grew accustomed to the roll of the stage and to occasional jars i found myself easier in body fortunately there had been rain which settled the dust and a favorable breeze made riding pleasant where ordinarily it would have been hot and disagreeable  we tarried long enough in the little hamlet of sampson for steele to get letters from reliable ranchers he wanted a number of references to verify the ranger report he had to turn in to captain neal this precaution he took so as to place in neals hands all the evidence needed to convince governor smith and now as steele returned to us and entered the stage he spoke of this report its the longest and the best i ever turned in he said with a gray flame in his eyes i shant let russ read it hes peevish because i want his part put on record and listen diane theres to be a blank line in this report your fathers name will never be recorded neither the governor nor the adjutantgeneral nor captain neal nor any one back austin way will ever know who this mysterious leader of the pecos gang might have been  even out here very few know many supposed but few knew ive shut the mouths of those few that blank line in the report is for a supposed and mysterious leader who vanished jack blome the reputed leader and all his lawless associates are dead linrock is free and safe now its future in the hands of roused determined and capable men  we were all silent after steele ceased talking i did not believe diane could have spoken just then if sorrow and joy could be perfectly blended in one beautiful expression they were in her face by and by i dared to say and vaughn steele lone star ranger has seen his last service  yes he replied with emotion  sally stirred and turned a strange look upon us all in that case then if i am not mistaken there were two lone star rangersand both have seen their last service sallys lips were trembling the way they trembled when it was impossible to tell whether she was about to laugh or cry the first hint of her old combative spirit or her old archness a wave of feeling rushed over me too much for me in my weakened condition dizzy racked with sudden shooting pains i closed my eyes and the happiness i embraced was all the sweeter for the suffering it entailed something beat into my ears into my brain with the regularity and rapid beat of pulsing bloodnot too late not too late  from that moment the ride grew different even as i improved with leaps and bounds sanderson behind us the long gray barren between sanderson and the rio grande behind us del rio for two days where i was able to sit up all behind usand the eastward trail to uvalde before us we were the only passengers on the stage from del rio to uvalde perhaps steele had so managed the journey assuredly he had become an individual with whom traveling under the curious gaze of strangers would have been embarrassing he was most desperately in love and diane all in a few days while riding these long tedious miles ordinarily so fatiguing had renewed her bloom had gained what she had lost she too was desperately in love though she remembered her identity occasionally and that she was in the company of a badly shotup young man and a brokenhearted cousin  most of the time diane and steele rode on top of the stage when they did ride inside their conduct was not unbecoming indeed it was sweet to watch yet it loosed the fires of jealous rage and longing in me and certainly had some remarkable effect upon sally gradually she had been losing that strange and somber mood she had acquired to brighten and change more and more perhaps she divined something about diane and steele that escaped me anyway all of a sudden she was transformed look here if you people want to spoon please get out on top she said  if that was not the old sally langdon i did not know who it was miss sampson tried to appear offended and steele tried to look insulted but they both failed they could not have looked anything but happy youth and love were too strong for this couple whom circumstances might well have made grave and thoughtful they were magnet and steel powder and spark any moment right before my eyes i expected them to rush right into each others arms and when they refrained merely substituting clasped hands for a dearer embrace i closed my eyes and remembered them as they would live in my memory forever standing crushed together on the ridge that day white lips to white lips embodying all that was beautiful passionate and tragic  and i who had been their undoing in the end was their salvation how i hugged that truth to my heart  it seemed following sallys pert remark that after an interval of decent dignity diane and steele did go out upon the top of the stage russ whispered sally theyre up to something i heard a few words i bet you theyre going to get married in san antonio  well its about time i replied  but oughtnt they take us into their confidence  sally they have forgotten we are upon the earth  oh im so glad theyre happy  then there was a long silence it was better for me to ride lying down in which position i was at this time after a mile sally took my hand and held it without speaking my heart leaped but i did not open my eyes or break that spell even with a whisper russ i must saytell you  she faltered and still i kept my eyes closed i did not want to wake up from that dream have i been veryvery sad she went on  sad and strange sally that was worse than my bulletholes she gripped my hand i felt her hair on my brow felt her breath on my cheek  russ i sworeid hate you if youif you  i know dont speak of it i interposed hurriedly  but i dont hate you ii love you and i cant give you up  darling but sally can you get over itcan you forget  yes that horrid black spell had gone with the miles little by little mile after mile and now its gone but i had to come to the point to go back on my word to tell you russ you never never had any sense  then i opened my eyes and my arms too and we were reunited it must have been a happy moment so happy that it numbed me beyond appreciation yes sally i agreed but no man ever had such a wonderful girl  russ i nevertook off your ring she whispered  but you hid your hand from my sight i replied quickly  oh dear russ were crazyas crazy as those lunatics outside lets think a little  i was very content to have no thought at all just to see and feel her close to me  russ will you give up the ranger service for me she asked  indeed i will  and leave this fighting texas never to return till the day of guns and rangers and bad men and evenbreaks is past  yes  will you go with me to my old home it was beautiful once russ before it was let run to rack and ruin a thousand acres an old stone house great mossy oaks a lake and river there are bear deer panther wild boars in the breaks you can hunt and ride ive horses russ such horses they could run these scrubby broncos off their legs will you come  come sally i rather think i will but dearest after im well again i must work i said earnestly ive got to have a job  youre indeed a poor cowboy out of a job remember your deceit oh russ well youll have work never fear  sally is this old home of yours near the one diane speaks of so much i asked  indeed it is but hers has been kept under cultivation and in repair while mine has run down that will be our work to build it up so its settled then  almost there are certainerformalitiesneedful in a compact of this kind she looked inquiringly at me with a soft flush well if you are so dense try to bring back that sally langdon who used to torment me how you broke your promises how you leaned from your saddle kiss me sally  later as we drew close to uvalde sally and i sat in one seat after the manner of diane and vaughn and we looked out over the west where the sun was setting behind dim and distant mountains we were fast leaving the wild and barren border already it seemed far beyond that broken rugged horizon with its dark line silhouetted against the rosy and golden sky already the spell of its wild life and the grim and haunting faces had begun to fade out of my memory let newer rangers with less to lose and with the call in their hearts go on with our work till soon that wild border would be safe  the great lone star state must work out its destiny some distant day in the fulness of time what place the rangers had in that destiny would be history
