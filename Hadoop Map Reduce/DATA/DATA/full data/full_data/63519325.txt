63519325	the adventure of the red circle   by  sir arthur conan doyle    well mrs warren i cannot see that you have any particular cause for uneasiness nor do i understand why i whose time is of some value should interfere in the matter  i really have other things to engage me  so spoke sherlock holmes and turned back to the great scrapbook in which he was arranging and indexing some of his recent material  but the landlady had the pertinacity and also the cunning of her sex she held her ground firmly  you arranged an affair for a lodger of mine last year she saidmr fairdale hobbs  ah yesa simple matter  but he would never cease talking of ityour kindness sir and the way in which you brought light into the darkness  i remembered his words when i was in doubt and darkness myself  i know you could if you only would  holmes was accessible upon the side of flattery and also to do him justice upon the side of kindliness  the two forces made him lay down his gumbrush with a sigh of resignation and push back his chair  well well mrs warren let us hear about it then  you dont object to tobacco i take it  thank you watsonthe matches you are uneasy as i understand because your new lodger remains in his rooms and you cannot see him  why bless you mrs warren if i were your lodger you often would not see me for weeks on end  no doubt sir but this is different  it frightens me mr holmes  i cant sleep for fright  to hear his quick step moving here and moving there from early morning to late at night and yet never to catch so much as a glimpse of himits more than i can stand  my husband is as nervous over it as i am but he is out at his work all day while i get no rest from it  what is he hiding for  what has he done  except for the girl i am all alone in the house with him and its more than my nerves can stand  holmes leaned forward and laid his long thin fingers upon the womans shoulder  he had an almost hypnotic power of soothing when he wished the scared look faded from her eyes and her agitated features smoothed into their usual commonplace  she sat down in the chair which he had indicated  if i take it up i must understand every detail said he  take time to consider  the smallest point may be the most essential you say that the man came ten days ago and paid you for a fortnights board and lodging  he asked my terms sir  i said fifty shillings a week  there is a small sittingroom and bedroom and all complete at the top of the house  well  he said ill pay you five pounds a week if i can have it on my own terms  im a poor woman sir and mr warren earns little and the money meant much to me  he took out a tenpound note and he held it out to me then and there  you can have the same every fortnight for a long time to come if you keep the terms he said  if not ill have no more to do with you  what were the terms  well sir they were that he was to have a key of the house that was all right  lodgers often have them  also that he was to be left entirely to himself and never upon any excuse to be disturbed  nothing wonderful in that surely  not in reason sir  but this is out of all reason  he has been there for ten days and neither mr warren nor i nor the girl has once set eyes upon him  we can hear that quick step of his pacing up and down up and down night morning and noon but except on that first night he had never once gone out of the house  oh he went out the first night did he  yes sir and returned very lateafter we were all in bed  he told me after he had taken the rooms that he would do so and asked me not to bar the door  i heard him come up the stair after midnight  but his meals  it was his particular direction that we should always when he rang leave his meal upon a chair outside his door  then he rings again when he has finished and we take it down from the same chair  if he wants anything else he prints it on a slip of paper and leaves it  prints it  yes sir prints it in pencil  just the word nothing more heres the one i brought to show yousoap  heres anothermatch this is one he left the first morningdaily gazette  i leave that paper with his breakfast every morning  dear me watson said homes staring with great curiosity at the slips of foolscap which the landlady had handed to him this is certainly a little unusual  seclusion i can understand but why print printing is a clumsy process  why not write  what would it suggest watson  that he desired to conceal his handwriting  but why  what can it matter to him that his landlady should have a word of his writing  still it may be as you say  then again why such laconic messages  i cannot imagine  it opens a pleasing field for intelligent speculation  the words are written with a broadpointed violettinted pencil of a not unusual pattern  you will observe that the paper is torn away at the side here after the printing was done so that the s of soap is partly gone suggestive watson is it not  of caution  exactly  there was evidently some mark some thumbprint something which might give a clue to the persons identity  now mrs warren you say that the man was of middle size dark and bearded  what age would he be  youngish sirnot over thirty  well can you give me no further indications  he spoke good english sir and yet i thought he was a foreigner by his accent  and he was well dressed  very smartly dressed sirquite the gentleman  dark clothesnothing you would note  he gave no name  no sir  and has had no letters or callers  none  but surely you or the girl enter his room of a morning  no sir he looks after himself entirely  dear me that is certainly remarkable  what about his luggage  he had one big brown bag with himnothing else  well we dont seem to have much material to help us  do you say nothing has come out of that roomabsolutely nothing  the landlady drew an envelope from her bag from it she shook out two burnt matches and a cigaretteend upon the table  they were on his tray this morning  i brought them because i had heard that you can read great things out of small ones  holmes shrugged his shoulders  there is nothing here said he  the matches have of course been used to light cigarettes  that is obvious from the shortness of the burnt end  half the match is consumed in lighting a pipe or cigar but dear me this cigarette stub is certainly remarkable  the gentleman was bearded and moustached you say  yes sir  i dont understand that  i should say that only a cleanshaven man could have smoked this  why watson even your modest moustache would have been singed  a holder i suggested  no no the end is matted  i suppose there could not be two people in your rooms mrs warren  no sir  he eats so little that i often wonder it can keep life in one  well i think we must wait for a little more material  after all you have nothing to complain of  you have received your rent and he is not a troublesome lodger though he is certainly an unusual one  he pays you well and if he chooses to lie concealed it is no direct business of yours  we have no excuse for an intrusion upon his privacy until we have some reason to think that there is a guilty reason for it  ive taken up the matter and i wont lose sight of it  report to me if anything fresh occurs and rely upon my assistance if it should be needed  there are certainly some points of interest in this case watson he remarked when the landlady had left us  it may of course be trivialindividual eccentricity or it may be very much deeper than appears on the surface  the first thing that strikes one is the obvious possibility that the person now in the rooms may be entirely different from the one who engaged them  why should you think so  well apart from this cigaretteend was it not suggestive that the only time the lodger went out was immediately after his taking the rooms  he came backor someone came backwhen all witnesses were out of the way  we have no proof that the person who came back was the person who went out  then again the man who took the rooms spoke english well  this other however prints match when it should have been matches  i can imagine that the word was taken out of a dictionary which would give the noun but not the plural  the laconic style may be to conceal the absence of knowledge of english  yes watson there are good reasons to suspect that there has been a substitution of lodgers  but for what possible end  ah there lies our problem  there is one rather obvious line of investigation  he took down the great book in which day by day he filed the agony columns of the various london journals dear me said he turning over the pages what a chorus of groans cries and bleatings  what a ragbag of singular happenings  but surely the most valuable huntingground that ever was given to a student of the unusual  this person is alone and cannot be approached by letter without a breach of that absolute secrecy which is desired  how is any news or any message to reach him from without  obviously by advertisement through a newspaper  there seems no other way and fortunately we need concern ourselves with the one paper only  here are the daily gazette extracts of the last fortnight  lady with a black boa at princes skating clubthat we may pass  surely jimmy will not break his mothers heartthat appears to be irrelevant  if the lady who fainted on brixton busshe does not interest me  every day my heart longs bleat watsonunmitigated bleat  ah this is a little more possible  listen to this  be patient  will find some sure means of communications  meanwhile this column  g  that is two days after mrs warrens lodger arrived  it sounds plausible does it not  the mysterious one could understand english even if he could not print it  let us see if we can pick up the trace again  yes here we arethree days later  am making successful arrangements patience and prudence  the clouds will pass  g  nothing for a week after that  then comes something much more definite  the path is clearing  if i find chance signal message remember code agreedone a two b and so on you will hear soon  g  that was in yesterdays paper and there is nothing in todays its all very appropriate to mrs warrens lodger  if we wait a little watson i dont doubt that the affair will grow more intelligible  so it proved for in the morning i found my friend standing on the hearthrug with his back to the fire and a smile of complete satisfaction upon his face  hows this watson he cried picking up the paper from the table high red house with white stone facings  third floor second window left  after dusk  g  that is definite enough i think after breakfast we must make a little reconnaissance of mrs warrens neighbourhood  ah mrs warren what news do you bring us this morning  our client had suddenly burst into the room with an explosive energy which told of some new and momentous development  its a police matter mr holmes she cried  ill have no more of it  he shall pack out of there with his baggage  i would have gone straight up and told him so only i thought it was but fair to you to take your opinion first  but im at the end of my patience and when it comes to knocking my old man about  knocking mr warren about  using him roughly anyway  but who used him roughly  ah thats what we want to know  it was this morning sir  mr warren is a timekeeper at morton and waylights in tottenham court road  he has to be out of the house before seven well this morning he had not gone ten paces down the road when two men came up behind him threw a coat over his head and bundled him into a cab that was beside the curb  they drove him an hour and then opened the door and shot him out  he lay in the roadway so shaken in his wits that he never saw what became of the cab when he picked himself up he found he was on hampstead heath so he took a bus home and there he lies now on his sofa while i came straight round to tell you what had happened  most interesting said holmes  did he observe the appearance of these mendid he hear them talk  no he is clean dazed  he just knows that he was lifted up as if by magic and dropped as if by magic two at least were in it and maybe three  and you connect this attack with your lodger  well weve lived there fifteen years and no such happenings ever came before  ive had enough of him  moneys not everything ill have him out of my house before the day is done  wait a bit mrs warren  do nothing rash i begin to think that this affair may be very much more important than appeared at first sight it is clear now that some danger is threatening your lodger  it is equally clear that his enemies lying in wait for him near your door mistook your husband for him in the foggy morning light  on discovering their mistake they released him what they would have done had it not been a mistake we can only conjecture  well what am i to do mr holmes  i have a great fancy to see this lodger of yours mrs warren  i dont see how that is to be managed unless you break in the door i always hear him unlock it as i go down the stair after i leave the tray  he has to take the tray in  surely we could conceal ourselves and see him do it  the landlady thought for a moment  well sir theres the boxroom opposite  i could arrange a lookingglass maybe and if you were behind the door  excellent said holmes  when does he lunch  about one sir  then dr watson and i will come round in time  for the present mrs warren goodbye  at halfpast twelve we found ourselves upon the steps of mrs warrens housea high thin yellowbrick edifice in great orme street a narrow thoroughfare at the northeast side of the british museum standing as it does near the corner of the street  it commands a view down howe street with its more pretentious houses  holmes pointed with a chuckle to one of these a row of residential flats which projected so that they could not fail to catch the eye  see watson said he  high red house with stone facings there is the signal station all right  we know the place and we know the code so surely our task should be simple  theres a to let card in that window  it is evidently an empty flat to which the confederate has access  well mrs warren what now  i have it all ready for you  if you will both come up and leave your boots below on the landing ill put you there now  it was an excellent hidingplace which she had arranged  the mirror was so placed that seated in the dark we could very plainly see the door opposite  we had hardly settled down in it and mrs warren left us when a distant tinkle announced that our mysterious neighbour had rung  presently the landlady appeared with the tray laid it down upon a chair beside the closed door and then treading heavily departed crouching together in the angle of the door we kept our eyes fixed upon the mirror suddenly as the landladys footsteps died away there was the creak of a turning key the handle revolved and two thin hands darted out and lifted the tray from the chair  an instant later it was hurriedly replaced and i caught a glimpse of a dark beautiful horrified face glaring at the narrow opening of the boxroom  then the door crashed to the key turned once more and all was silence holmes twitched my sleeve and together we stole down the stair  i will call again in the evening said he to the expectant landlady i think watson we can discuss this business better in our own quarters  my surmise as you saw proved to be correct said he speaking from the depths of his easychair  there has been a substitution of lodgers  what i did not foresee is that we should find a woman and no ordinary woman watson  she saw us  well she saw something to alarm her  that is certain  the general sequence of events is pretty clear is it not  a couple seek refuge in london from a very terrible and instant danger the measure of that danger is the rigour of their precautions the man who has some work which he must do desires to leave the woman in absolute safety while he does it  it is not an easy problem but he solved it in an original fashion and so effectively that her presence was not even known to the landlady who supplies her with food  the printed messages as is now evident were to prevent her sex being discovered by her writing the man cannot come near the woman or he will guide their enemies to her since he cannot communicate with her direct he has recourse to the agony column of a paper  so far all is clear  but what is at the root of it  ah yes watsonseverely practical as usual  what is at the root of it all  mrs warrens whimsical problem enlarges somewhat and assumes a more sinister aspect as we proceed  this much we can say  that it is no ordinary love escapade  you saw the womans face at the sign of danger  we have heard too of the attack upon the landlord which was undoubtedly meant for the lodger  these alarms and the desperate need for secrecy argue that the matter is one of life or death  the attack upon mr warren further shows that the enemy whoever they are are themselves not aware of the substitution of the female lodger for the male  it is very curious and complex watson  why should you go further in it  what have you to gain from it  what indeed  it is art for arts sake watson  i suppose when you doctored you found yourself studying cases without thought of a fee  for my education holmes  education never ends watson  it is a series of lessons with the greatest for the last  this is an instructive case  there is neither money nor credit in it and yet one would wish to tidy it up  when dusk comes we should find ourselves one stage advanced in our investigation  when we returned to mrs warrens rooms the gloom of a london winter evening had thickened into one gray curtain a dead monotone of colour broken only by the sharp yellow squares of the windows and the blurred haloes of the gaslamps  as we peered from the darkened sittingroom of the lodginghouse one more dim light glimmered high up through the obscurity  someone is moving in that room said holmes in a whisper his gaunt and eager face thrust forward to the windowpane  yes i can see his shadow  there he is again  he has a candle in his hand  now he is peering across  he wants to be sure that she is on the lookout  now he begins to flash  take the message also watson that we may check each other  a single flashthat is a surely  now then  how many did you make it  twenty  so did i  that should mean t  atthats intelligible enough another t  surely this is the beginning of a second word  now thententa dead stop  that cant be all watson attenta gives no sense  nor is it any better as three words at ten ta unless t a are a persons initials  there it goes again whats that  attewhy it is the same message over again curious watson very curious  now he is off once more  atwhy he is repeating it for the third time  attenta three times  how often will he repeat it no that seems to be the finish  he has withdrawn from the window what do you make of it watson  a cipher message holmes  my companion gave a sudden chuckle of comprehension  and not a very obscure cipher watson said he  why of course it is italian  the a means that it is addressed to a woman  beware beware  beware hows that watson  i believe you have hit it  not a doubt of it  it is a very urgent message thrice repeated to make it more so  but beware of what  wait a bit he is coming to the window once more  again we saw the dim silhouette of a crouching man and the whisk of the small flame across the window as the signals were renewed they came more rapidly than beforeso rapid that it was hard to follow them  pericolopericoloeh whats that watson  danger isnt it yes by jove its a danger signal  there he goes again peri halloa what on earth  the light had suddenly gone out the glimmering square of window had disappeared and the third floor formed a dark band round the lofty building with its tiers of shining casements  that last warning cry had been suddenly cut short  how and by whom  the same thought occurred on the instant to us both  holmes sprang up from where he crouched by the window  this is serious watson he cried  there is some devilry going forward  why should such a message stop in such a way  i should put scotland yard in touch with this businessand yet it is too pressing for us to leave  shall i go for the police  we must define the situation a little more clearly  it may bear some more innocent interpretation  come watson let us go across ourselves and see what we can make of it     two    as we walked rapidly down howe street i glanced back at the building which we had left  there dimly outlined at the top window i could see the shadow of a head a womans head gazing tensely rigidly out into the night waiting with breathless suspense for the renewal of that interrupted message  at the doorway of the howe street flats a man muffled in a cravat and greatcoat was leaning against the railing  he started as the halllight fell upon our faces  holmes he cried  why gregson said my companion as he shook hands with the scotland yard detective  journeys end with lovers meetings what brings you here  the same reasons that bring you i expect said gregson  how you got on to it i cant imagine  different threads but leading up to the same tangle  ive been taking the signals  signals  yes from that window  they broke off in the middle  we came over to see the reason  but since it is safe in your hands i see no object in continuing this business  wait a bit cried gregson eagerly  ill do you this justice mr holmes that i was never in a case yet that i didnt feel stronger for having you on my side  theres only the one exit to these flats so we have him safe  who is he  well well we score over you for once mr holmes  you must give us best this time  he struck his stick sharply upon the ground on which a cabman his whip in his hand sauntered over from a fourwheeler which stood on the far side of the street may i introduce you to mr sherlock holmes he said to the cabman  this is mr leverton of pinkertons american agency  the hero of the long island cave mystery said holmes  sir i am pleased to meet you  the american a quiet businesslike young man with a cleanshaven hatchet face flushed up at the words of commendation i am on the trail of my life now mr holmes said he  if i can get gorgiano  what  gorgiano of the red circle  oh he has a european fame has he  well weve learned all about him in america  we know he is at the bottom of fifty murders and yet we have nothing positive we can take him on  i tracked him over from new york and ive been close to him for a week in london waiting some excuse to get my hand on his collar mr gregson and i ran him to ground in that big tenement house and theres only one door so he cant slip us  theres three folk come out since he went in but ill swear he wasnt one of them  mr holmes talks of signals said gregson  i expect as usual he knows a good deal that we dont  in a few clear words holmes explained the situation as it had appeared to us  the american struck his hands together with vexation  hes on to us he cried  why do you think so  well it figures out that way does it not  here he is sending out messages to an accomplicethere are several of his gang in london then suddenly just as by your own account he was telling them that there was danger he broke short off  what could it mean except that from the window he had suddenly either caught sight of us in the street or in some way come to understand how close the danger was and that he must act right away if he was to avoid it  what do you suggest mr holmes  that we go up at once and see for ourselves  but we have no warrant for his arrest  he is in unoccupied premises under suspicious circumstances said gregson  that is good enough for the moment  when we have him by the heels we can see if new york cant help us to keep him  ill take the responsibility of arresting him now  our official detectives may blunder in the matter of intelligence but never in that of courage  gregson climbed the stair to arrest this desperate murderer with the same absolutely quiet and businesslike bearing with which he would have ascended the official staircase of scotland yard  the pinkerton man had tried to push past him but gregson had firmly elbowed him back london dangers were the privilege of the london force  the door of the lefthand flat upon the third landing was standing ajar  gregson pushed it open  within all was absolute silence and darkness  i struck a match and lit the detectives lantern  as i did so and as the flicker steadied into a flame we all gave a gasp of surprise  on the deal boards of the carpetless floor there was outlined a fresh track of blood  the red steps pointed towards us and led away from an inner room the door of which was closed  gregson flung it open and held his light full blaze in front of him while we all peered eagerly over his shoulders  in the middle of the floor of the empty room was huddled the figure of an enormous man his cleanshaven swarthy face grotesquely horrible in its contortion and his head encircled by a ghastly crimson halo of blood lying in a broad wet circle upon the white woodwork  his knees were drawn up his hands thrown out in agony and from the centre of his broad brown upturned throat there projected the white haft of a knife driven bladedeep into his body  giant as he was the man must have gone down like a poleaxed ox before that terrific blow  beside his right hand a most formidable hornhandled twoedged dagger lay upon the floor and near it a black kid glove  by george its black gorgiano himself cried the american detective someone has got ahead of us this time  here is the candle in the window mr holmes said gregson why whatever are you doing  holmes had stepped across had lit the candle and was passing it backward and forward across the windowpanes  then he peered into the darkness blew the candle out and threw it on the floor  i rather think that will be helpful said he  he came over and stood in deep thought while the two professionals were examining the body you say that three people came out from the flat while you were waiting downstairs said he at last  did you observe them closely  yes i did  was there a fellow about thirty blackbearded dark of middle size  yes he was the last to pass me  that is your man i fancy  i can give you his description and we have a very excellent outline of his footmark  that should be enough for you  not much mr holmes among the millions of london  perhaps not that is why i thought it best to summon this lady to your aid  we all turned round at the words  there framed in the doorway was a tall and beautiful womanthe mysterious lodger of bloomsbury  slowly she advanced her face pale and drawn with a frightful apprehension her eyes fixed and staring her terrified gaze riveted upon the dark figure on the floor  you have killed him she muttered  oh dio mio you have killed him  then i heard a sudden sharp intake of her breath and she sprang into the air with a cry of joy  round and round the room she danced her hands clapping her dark eyes gleaming with delighted wonder and a thousand pretty italian exclamations pouring from her lips  it was terrible and amazing to see such a woman so convulsed with joy at such a sight  suddenly she stopped and gazed at us all with a questioning stare  but you  you are police are you not  you have killed giuseppe gorgiano  is it not so  we are police madam  she looked round into the shadows of the room  but where then is gennaro she asked  he is my husband gennaro lucca  i am emilia lucca and we are both from new york where is gennaro  he called me this moment from this window and i ran with all my speed  it was i who called said holmes  you  how could you call  your cipher was not difficult madam  your presence here was desirable i knew that i had only to flash vieni and you would surely come  the beautiful italian looked with awe at my companion  i do not understand how you know these things she said giuseppe gorgianohow did he  she paused and then suddenly her face lit up with pride and delight  now i see it  my gennaro  my splendid beautiful gennaro who has guarded me safe from all harm he did it with his own strong hand he killed the monster  oh gennaro how wonderful you are  what woman could ever be worthy of such a man  well mrs lucca said the prosaic gregson laying his hand upon the ladys sleeve with as little sentiment as if she were a notting hill hooligan i am not very clear yet who you are or what you are but youve said enough to make it very clear that we shall want you at the yard  one moment gregson said holmes  i rather fancy that this lady may be as anxious to give us information as we can be to get it  you understand madam that your husband will be arrested and tried for the death of the man who lies before us  what you say may be used in evidence  but if you think that he has acted from motives which are not criminal and which he would wish to have known then you cannot serve him better than by telling us the whole story  now that gorgiano is dead we fear nothing said the lady  he was a devil and a monster and there can be no judge in the world who would punish my husband for having killed him  in that case said holmes my suggestion is that we lock this door leave things as we found them go with this lady to her room and form our opinion after we have heard what it is that she has to say to us  half an hour later we were seated all four in the small sittingroom of signora lucca listening to her remarkable narrative of those sinister events the ending of which we had chanced to witness  she spoke in rapid and fluent but very unconventional english which for the sake of clearness i will make grammatical  i was born in posilippo near naples said she and was the daughter of augusto barelli who was the chief lawyer and once the deputy of that part  gennaro was in my fathers employment and i came to love him as any woman must  he had neither money nor positionnothing but his beauty and strength and energyso my father forbade the match  we fled together were married at bari and sold my jewels to gain the money which would take us to america  this was four years ago and we have been in new york ever since  fortune was very good to us at first  gennaro was able to do a service to an italian gentlemanhe saved him from some ruffians in the place called the bowery and so made a powerful friend his name was tito castalotte and he was the senior partner of the great firm of castalotte and zamba who are the chief fruit importers of new york signor zamba is an invalid and our new friend castalotte has all power within the firm which employs more than three hundred men  he took my husband into his employment made him head of a department and showed his goodwill towards him in every way  signor castalotte was a bachelor and i believe that he felt as if gennaro was his son and both my husband and i loved him as if he were our father  we had taken and furnished a little house in brooklyn and our whole future seemed assured when that black cloud appeared which was soon to overspread our sky  one night when gennaro returned from his work he brought a fellowcountryman back with him  his name was gorgiano and he had come also from posilippo  he was a huge man as you can testify for you have looked upon his corpse  not only was his body that of a giant but everything about him was grotesque gigantic and terrifying  his voice was like thunder in our little house  there was scarce room for the whirl of his great arms as he talked  his thoughts his emotions his passions all were exaggerated and monstrous  he talked or rather roared with such energy that others could but sit and listen cowed with the mighty stream of words  his eyes blazed at you and held you at his mercy  he was a terrible and wonderful man  i thank god that he is dead  he came again and again  yet i was aware that gennaro was no more happy than i was in his presence  my poor husband would sit pale and listless listening to the endless raving upon politics and upon social questions which made up our visitors conversation  gennaro said nothing but i who knew him so well could read in his face some emotion which i had never seen there before  at first i thought that it was dislike  and then gradually i understood that it was more than dislike  it was feara deep secret shrinking fear  that nightthe night that i read his terrori put my arms round him and i implored him by his love for me and by all that he held dear to hold nothing from me and to tell me why this huge man overshadowed him so  he told me and my own heart grew cold as ice as i listened  my poor gennaro in his wild and fiery days when all the world seemed against him and his mind was driven half mad by the injustices of life had joined a neapolitan society the red circle which was allied to the old carbonari  the oaths and secrets of this brotherhood were frightful but once within its rule no escape was possible  when we had fled to america gennaro thought that he had cast it all off forever what was his horror one evening to meet in the streets the very man who had initiated him in naples the giant gorgiano a man who had earned the name of death in the south of italy for he was red to the elbow in murder  he had come to new york to avoid the italian police and he had already planted a branch of this dreadful society in his new home  all this gennaro told me and showed me a summons which he had received that very day a red circle drawn upon the head of it telling him that a lodge would be held upon a certain date and that his presence at it was required and ordered  that was bad enough but worse was to come  i had noticed for some time that when gorgiano came to us as he constantly did in the evening he spoke much to me and even when his words were to my husband those terrible glaring wildbeast eyes of his were always turned upon me  one night his secret came out  i had awakened what he called love within himthe love of a brutea savage  gennaro had not yet returned when he came  he pushed his way in seized me in his mighty arms hugged me in his bears embrace covered me with kisses and implored me to come away with him  i was struggling and screaming when gennaro entered and attacked him  he struck gennaro senseless and fled from the house which he was never more to enter  it was a deadly enemy that we made that night  a few days later came the meeting  gennaro returned from it with a face which told me that something dreadful had occurred it was worse than we could have imagined possible  the funds of the society were raised by blackmailing rich italians and threatening them with violence should they refuse the money it seems that castalotte our dear friend and benefactor had been approached  he had refused to yield to threats and he had handed the notices to the police  it was resolved now that such an example should be made of them as would prevent any other victim from rebelling at the meeting it was arranged that he and his house should be blown up with dynamite  there was a drawing of lots as to who should carry out the deed  gennaro saw our enemys cruel face smiling at him as he dipped his hand in the bag no doubt it had been prearranged in some fashion for it was the fatal disc with the red circle upon it the mandate for murder which lay upon his palm  he was to kill his best friend or he was to expose himself and me to the vengeance of his comrades  it was part of their fiendish system to punish those whom they feared or hated by injuring not only their own persons but those whom they loved and it was the knowledge of this which hung as a terror over my poor gennaros head and drove him nearly crazy with apprehension  all that night we sat together our arms round each other each strengthening each for the troubles that lay before us  the very next evening had been fixed for the attempt  by midday my husband and i were on our way to london but not before he had given our benefactor full warning of this danger and had also left such information for the police as would safeguard his life for the future  the rest gentlemen you know for yourselves  we were sure that our enemies would be behind us like our own shadows  gorgiano had his private reasons for vengeance but in any case we knew how ruthless cunning and untiring he could be  both italy and america are full of stories of his dreadful powers  if ever they were exerted it would be now  my darling made use of the few clear days which our start had given us in arranging for a refuge for me in such a fashion that no possible danger could reach me for his own part he wished to be free that he might communicate both with the american and with the italian police  i do not myself know where he lived or how  all that i learned was through the columns of a newspaper  but once as i looked through my window i saw two italians watching the house and i understood that in some way gorgiano had found our retreat finally gennaro told me through the paper that he would signal to me from a certain window but when the signals came they were nothing but warnings which were suddenly interrupted  it is very clear to me now that he knew gorgiano to be close upon him and that thank god he was ready for him when he came  and now gentleman i would ask you whether we have anything to fear from the law or whether any judge upon earth would condemn my gennaro for what he has done  well mr gregson said the american looking across at the official i dont know what your british point of view may be but i guess that in new york this ladys husband will receive a pretty general vote of thanks  she will have to come with me and see the chief gregson answered if what she says is corroborated i do not think she or her husband has much to fear  but what i cant make head or tail of mr holmes is how on earth you got yourself mixed up in the matter  education gregson education  still seeking knowledge at the old university  well watson you have one more specimen of the tragic and grotesque to add to your collection  by the way it is not eight oclock and a wagner night at covent garden  if we hurry we might be in time for the second act
