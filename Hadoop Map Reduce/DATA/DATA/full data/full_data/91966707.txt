allan quatermain or hunter quatermain as we used to call him in south africa he told it to me one evening when i was stopping with him at the place he bought in yorkshire shortly after that the death of his only son so unsettled him that he immediately left england accompanied by two companions his old fellowvoyagers sir henry curtis and captain good and has now utterly vanished into the dark heart of africa he is persuaded that a white people of which he has heard rumours all his life exists somewhere on the highlands in the vast still unexplored interior and his great ambition is to find them before he dies this is the wild quest upon which he and his companions have departed and from which i shrewdly suspect they never will return one letter only have i received from the old gentleman dated from a mission station high up the tana a river on the east coast about three hundred miles north of zanzibar in it he says they have gone through many hardships and adventures but are alive and well and have found traces which go far towards making him hope that the results of their wild quest may be a magnificent and unexampled discovery i greatly fear however that all he has discovered is death for this letter came a long while ago and nobody has heard a single word of the party since they have totally vanished  it was on the last evening of my stay at his house that he told the ensuing story to me and captain good who was dining with him he had eaten his dinner and drunk two or three glasses of old port just to help good and myself to the end of the second bottle it was an unusual thing for him to do for he was a most abstemious man having conceived as he used to say a great horror of drink from observing its effects upon the class of menhunters transport riders and othersamongst whom he had passed so many years of his life consequently the good wine took more effect on him that it would have done on most men sending a little flush into his wrinkled cheeks and making him talk more freely than usual  dear old man i can see him now as he went limping up and down the vestibule with his grey hair sticking up in scrubbingbrush fashion his shrivelled yellow face and his large dark eyes that were as keen as any hawks and yet soft as a bucks the whole room was hung with trophies of his numerous hunting expeditions and he had some story about every one of them if only he could be got to tell them generally he would not for he was not very fond of narrating his own adventures but tonight the port wine made him more communicative  ah you brute he said stopping beneath an unusually large skull of a lion which was fixed just over the mantelpiece beneath a long row of guns its jaws distended to their utmost width ah you brute you have given me a lot of trouble for the last dozen years and will i suppose to my dying day  tell us the yarn quatermain said good you have often promised to tell me and you never have  you had better not ask me to he answered for it is a longish one  all right i said the evening is young and there is some more port  thus adjured he filled his pipe from a jar of coarsecut boer tobacco that was always standing on the mantelpiece and still walking up and down the room began  it was i think in the march of 69 that i was up in sikukunis country it was just after old sequatis time and sikukuni had got into poweri forget how anyway i was there i had heard that the bapedi people had brought down an enormous quantity of ivory from the interior and so i started with a waggonload of goods and came straight away from middelburg to try and trade some of it it was a risky thing to go into the country so early on account of the fever but i knew that there were one or two others after that lot of ivory so i determined to have a try for it and take my chance of fever i had become so tough from continual knocking about that i did not set it down at much  well i got on all right for a while it is a wonderfully beautiful piece of bush veldt with great ranges of mountains running through it and round granite koppies starting up here and there looking out like sentinels over the rolling waste of bush but it is very hothot as a stewpanand when i was there that march which of course is autumn in this part of africa the whole place reeked of fever every morning as i trekked along down by the oliphant river i used to creep from the waggon at dawn and look out but there was no river to be seenonly a long line of billows of what looked like the finest cotton wool tossed up lightly with a pitchfork it was the fever mist out from among the scrub too came little spirals of vapour as though there were hundreds of tiny fires alight in itreek rising from thousands of tons of rotting vegetation it was a beautiful place but the beauty was the beauty of death and all those lines and blots of vapour wrote one great word across the surface of the country and that word was fever  it was a dreadful year of illness that i came i remember to one little kraal of knobnoses and went up to it to see if i could get some maas or curdled buttermilk and a few mealies as i drew near i was struck with the silence of the place no children began to chatter and no dogs barked nor could i see any native sheep or cattle the place though it had evidently been recently inhabited was as still as the bush round it and some guinea fowl got up out of the prickly pear bushes right at the kraal gate i remember that i hesitated a little before going in there was such an air of desolation about the spot nature never looks desolate when man has not yet laid his hand upon her breast she is only lonely but when man has been and has passed away then she looks desolate  well i passed into the kraal and went up to the principal hut in front of the hut was something with an old sheepskin kaross thrown over it i stooped down and drew off the rug and then shrank back amazed for under it was the body of a young woman recently dead for a moment i thought of turning back but my curiosity overcame me so going past the dead woman i went down on my hands and knees and crept into the hut it was so dark that i could not see anything though i could smell a great deal so i lit a match it was a tandstickor match and burnt slowly and dimly and as the light gradually increased i made out what i took to be a family of people men women and children fast asleep presently it burnt up brightly and i saw that they too five of them altogether were quite dead one was a baby i dropped the match in a hurry and was making my way from the hut as quick as i could go when i caught sight of two bright eyes staring out of a corner thinking it was a wild cat or some such animal i redoubled my haste when suddenly a voice near the eyes began first to mutter and then to send up a succession of awful yells  hastily i lit another match and perceived that the eyes belonged to an old woman wrapped up in a greasy leather garment taking her by the arm i dragged her out for she could not or would not come by herself and the stench was overpowering me such a sight as she wasa bag of bones covered over with black shrivelled parchment the only white thing about her was her wool and she seemed to be pretty well dead except for her eyes and her voice she thought that i was a devil come to take her and that is why she yelled so well i got her down to the waggon and gave her a tot of cape smoke and then as soon as it was ready poured about a pint of beeftea down her throat made from the flesh of a blue vilderbeeste i had killed the day before and after that she brightened up wonderfully she could talk zuluindeed it turned out that she had run away from zululand in tchakas timeand she told me that all the people whom i had seen had died of fever when they had died the other inhabitants of the kraal had taken the cattle and gone away leaving the poor old woman who was helpless from age and infirmity to perish of starvation or disease as the case might be she had been sitting there for three days among the bodies when i found her i took her on to the next kraal and gave the headman a blanket to look after her promising him another if i found her well when i came back i remember that he was much astonished at my parting with two blankets for the sake of such a worthless old creature why did i not leave her in the bush he asked those people carry the doctrine of the survival of the fittest to its extreme you see  it was the night after i had got rid of the old woman that i made my first acquaintance with my friend yonder and he nodded towards the skull that seemed to be grinning down at us in the shadow of the wide mantelshelf i had trekked from dawn till eleven oclocka long trekbut i wanted to get on and had turned the oxen out to graze sending the voorlooper to look after them my intention being to inspan again about six oclock and trek with the moon till ten then i got into the waggon and had a good sleep till halfpast two or so in the afternoon when i rose and cooked some meat and had my dinner washing it down with a pannikin of black coffeefor it was difficult to get preserved milk in those days just as i had finished and the driver a man called tom was washing up the things in comes the young scoundrel of a voorlooper driving one ox before him  where are the other oxen i asked  koos he said koos the other oxen have gone away i turned my back for a minute and when i looked round again they were all gone except kaptein here who was rubbing his back against a tree  you mean that you have been asleep and let them stray you villain i will rub your back against a stick i answered feeling very angry for it was not a pleasant prospect to be stuck up in that fever trap for a week or so while we were hunting for the oxen off you go and you too tom and mind you dont come back till you have found them they have trekked back along the middelburg road and are a dozen miles off by now ill be bound now no words go both of you  tom the driver swore and caught the lad a hearty kick which he richly deserved and then having tied old kaptein up to the disselboom with a reim they took their assegais and sticks and started i would have gone too only i knew that somebody must look after the waggon and i did not like to leave either of the boys with it at night i was in a very bad temper indeed although i was pretty well used to these sort of occurrences and soothed myself by taking a rifle and going to kill something for a couple of hours i poked about without seeing anything that i could get a shot at but at last just as i was again within seventy yards of the waggon i put up an old impala ram from behind a mimosa thorn he ran straight for the waggon and it was not till he was passing within a few feet of it that i could get a decent shot at him then i pulled and caught him halfway down the spine over he went dead as a doornail and a pretty shot it was though i ought not to say it this little incident put me into rather a better humour especially as the buck had rolled over right against the afterpart of the waggon so i had only to gut him fix a reim round his legs and haul him up by the time i had done this the sun was down and the full moon was up and a beautiful moon it was and then there came down that wonderful hush which sometimes falls over the african bush in the early hours of the night no beast was moving and no bird called not a breath of air stirred the quiet trees and the shadows did not even quiver they only grew it was very oppressive and very lonely for there was not a sign of the cattle or the boys i was quite thankful for the society of old kaptein who was lying down contentedly against the disselboom chewing the cud with a good conscience  presently however kaptein began to get restless first he snorted then he got up and snorted again i could not make it out so like a fool i got down off the waggonbox to have a look round thinking it might be the lost oxen coming  next instant i regretted it for all of a sudden i heard a roar and saw something yellow flash past me and light on poor kaptein then came a bellow of agony from the ox and a crunch as the lion put his teeth through the poor brutes neck and i began to realize what had happened my rifle was in the waggon and my first thought being to get hold of it i turned and made a bolt for it i got my foot on the wheel and flung my body forward on to the waggon and there i stopped as if i were frozen and no wonder for as i was about to spring up i heard the lion behind me and next second i felt the brute ay as plainly as i can feel this table i felt him i say sniffing at my left leg that was hanging down  my word i did feel queer i dont think that i ever felt so queer before i dared not move for the life of me and the odd thing was that i seemed to lose power over my leg which had an insane sort of inclination to kick out of its own mere motionjust as hysterical people want to laugh when they ought to be particularly solemn well the lion sniffed and sniffed beginning at my ankle and slowly nosing away up to my thigh i thought that he was going to get hold then but he did not he only growled softly and went back to the ox shifting my head a little i got a full view of him he was about the biggest lion i ever saw and i have seen a great many and he had a most tremendous black mane what his teeth were like you can seelook there pretty big ones aint they altogether he was a magnificent animal and as i lay there sprawling on the foretongue of the waggon it occurred to me that he would look uncommonly well in a cage he stood there by the carcass of poor kaptein and deliberately disembowelled him as neatly as a butcher could have done all this while i dared not move for he kept lifting his head and keeping an eye on me as he licked his bloody chops when he had cleared kaptein out he opened his mouth and roared and i am not exaggerating when i say that the sound shook the waggon instantly there came back an answering roar  heavens i thought there is his mate  hardly was the thought out of my head when i caught sight in the moonlight of the lioness bounding along through the long grass and after her a couple of cubs about the size of mastiffs she stopped within a few feet of my head and stood waved her tail and fixed me with her glowing yellow eyes but just as i thought that it was all over she turned and began to feed on kaptein and so did the cubs there were four of them within eight feet of me growling and quarrelling rending and tearing and crunching poor kapteins bones and there i lay shaking with terror and the cold perspiration pouring out of me feeling like another daniel come to judgment in a new sense of the phrase presently the cubs had eaten their fill and began to get restless one went round to the back of the waggon and pulled at the impala buck that hung there and the other came round my way and commenced the sniffing game at my leg indeed he did more than that for my trouser being hitched up a little he began to lick the bare skin with his rough tongue the more he licked the more he liked it to judge from his increased vigour and the loud purring noise he made then i knew that the end had come for in another second his filelike tongue would have rasped through the skin of my legwhich was luckily pretty toughand have tasted the blood and then there would be no chance for me so i just lay there and thought of my sins and prayed to the almighty and reflected that after all life was a very enjoyable thing  then all of a sudden i heard a crashing of bushes and the shouting and whistling of men and there were the two boys coming back with the cattle which they had found trekking along all together the lions lifted their heads and listened then bounded off without a soundand i fainted  the lions came back no more that night and by the next morning my nerves had got pretty straight again but i was full of wrath when i thought of all that i had gone through at the hands or rather noses of those four brutes and of the fate of my afterox kaptein he was a splendid ox and i was very fond of him so wroth was i that like a fool i determined to attack the whole family of them it was worthy of a greenhorn out on his first hunting trip but i did it nevertheless accordingly after breakfast having rubbed some oil upon my leg which was very sore from the cubs tongue i took the driver tom who did not half like the business and having armed myself with an ordinary double no 12 smoothbore the first breechloader i ever had i started i took the smoothbore because it shot a bullet very well and my experience has been that a round ball from a smoothbore is quite as effective against a lion as an express bullet the lion is soft and not a difficult animal to finish if you hit him anywhere in the body a buck takes far more killing  well i started and the first thing i set to work to do was to try to discover whereabouts the brutes lay up for the day about three hundred yards from the waggon was the crest of a rise covered with single mimosa trees dotted about in a parklike fashion and beyond this was a stretch of open plain running down to a dry pan or waterhole which covered about an acre of ground and was densely clothed with reeds now in the sere and yellow leaf from the further edge of this pan the ground sloped up again to a great cleft or nullah which had been cut out by the action of the water and was pretty thickly sprinkled with bush amongst which grew some large trees i forget of what sort  it at once struck me that the dry pan would be a likely place to find my friends in as there is nothing a lion is fonder of than lying up in reeds through which he can see things without being seen himself accordingly thither i went and prospected before i had got halfway round the pan i found the remains of a blue vilderbeeste that had evidently been killed within the last three or four days and partially devoured by lions and from other indications about i was soon assured that if the family were not in the pan that day they spent a good deal of their spare time there but if there the question was how to get them out for it was clearly impossible to think of going in after them unless one was quite determined to commit suicide now there was a strong wind blowing from the direction of the waggon across the reedy pan towards the bushclad kloof or donga and this first gave me the idea of firing the reeds which as i think i told you were pretty dry accordingly tom took some matches and began starting little fires to the left and i did the same to the right but the reeds were still green at the bottom and we should never have got them well alight had it not been for the wind which grew stronger and stronger as the sun climbed higher and forced the fire into them at last after halfanhours trouble the flames got a hold and began to spread out like a fan whereupon i went round to the further side of the pan to wait for the lions standing well out in the open as we stood at the copse today where you shot the woodcock it was a rather risky thing to do but i used to be so sure of my shooting in those days that i did not so much as mind the risk scarcely had i got round when i heard the reeds parting before the onward rush of some animal now for it said i on it came i could see that it was yellow and prepared for action when instead of a lion out bounded a beautiful reit bok which had been lying in the shelter of the pan it must by the way have been a reit bok of a peculiarly confiding nature to lay itself down with the lion like the lamb of prophecy but i suppose the reeds were thick and that it kept a long way off  well i let the reit bok go and it went like the wind and kept my eyes fixed upon the reeds the fire was burning like a furnace now the flames crackling and roaring as they bit into the reeds sending spouts of fire twenty feet and more into the air and making the hot air dance above it in a way that was perfectly dazzling but the reeds were still half green and created an enormous quantity of smoke which came rolling towards me like a curtain lying very low on account of the wind presently above the crackling of the fire i heard a startled roar then another and another so the lions were at home  i was beginning to get excited now for as you fellows know there is nothing in experience to warm up your nerves like a lion at close quarters unless it is a wounded buffalo and i became still more so when i made out through the smoke that the lions were all moving about on the extreme edge of the reeds occasionally they would pop their heads out like rabbits from a burrow and then catching sight of me standing about fifty yards away draw them back again i knew that it must be getting pretty warm behind them and that they could not keep the game up for long and i was not mistaken for suddenly all four of them broke cover together the old blackmaned lion leading by a few yards i never saw a more splendid sight in all my hunting experience than those four lions bounding across the veldt overshadowed by the dense pall of smoke and backed by the fiery furnace of the burning reeds  i reckoned that they would pass on their way to the bushy kloof within about five and twenty yards of me so taking a long breath i got my gun well on to the lions shoulderthe blackmaned oneso as to allow for an inch or two of motion and catch him through the heart i was on dead on and my finger was just beginning to tighten on the trigger when suddenly i went blinda bit of reedash had drifted into my right eye i danced and rubbed and succeeded in clearing it more or less just in time to see the tail of the last lion vanishing round the bushes up the kloof  if ever a man was mad i was that man it was too bad and such a shot in the open however i was not going to be beaten so i just turned and marched for the kloof tom the driver begged and implored me not to go but though as a personal rule i never pretend to be very brave which i am not i was determined that i would either kill those lions or they should kill me so i told tom that he need not come unless he liked but i was going and being a plucky fellow a swazi by birth he shrugged his shoulders muttered that i was mad or bewitched and followed doggedly in my tracks  we soon reached the kloof which was about three hundred yards in length and but sparsely wooded and then the real fun began there might be a lion behind every bushthere certainly were four lions somewhere the delicate question was where i peeped and poked and looked in every possible direction with my heart in my mouth and was at last rewarded by catching a glimpse of something yellow moving behind a bush at the same moment from another bush opposite me out burst one of the cubs and galloped back towards the burnt pan i whipped round and let drive a snap shot that tipped him head over heels breaking his back within two inches of the root of the tail and there he lay helpless but glaring tom afterwards killed him with his assegai i opened the breech of the gun and hurriedly pulled out the old case which to judge from what ensued must i suppose have burst and left a portion of its fabric sticking to the barrel at any rate when i tried to get in the new cartridge it would only enter halfway andwould you believe itthis was the moment that the lioness attracted no doubt by the outcry of her cub chose to put in an appearance there she stood twenty paces or so from me lashing her tail and looking just as wicked as it is possible to conceive slowly i stepped backwards trying to push in the new case and as i did so she moved on in little runs dropping down after each run the danger was imminent and the case would not go in at the moment i oddly enough thought of the cartridge maker whose name i will not mention and earnestly hoped that if the lion got me some condign punishment would overtake him it would not go in so i tried to pull it out it would not come out either and my gun was useless if i could not shut it to use the other barrel i might as well have had no gun  meanwhile i was walking backward keeping my eye on the lioness who was creeping forward on her belly without a sound but lashing her tail and keeping her eye on me and in it i saw that she was coming in a few seconds more i dashed my wrist and the palm of my hand against the brass rim of the cartridge till the blood poured from themlook there are the scars of it to this day  here quatermain held up his right hand to the light and showed us four or five white cicatrices just where the wrist is set into the hand  but it was not of the slightest use he went on the cartridge would not move i only hope that no other man will ever be put in such an awful position the lioness gathered herself together and i gave myself up for lost when suddenly tom shouted out from somewhere in my rear  you are walking on to the wounded cub turn to the right  i had the sense dazed as i was to take the hint and slewing round at rightangles but still keeping my eyes on the lioness i continued my backward walk  to my intense relief with a low growl she straightened herself turned and bounded further up the kloof  come on inkoos said tom lets get back to the waggon  all right tom i answered i will when i have killed those three other lions for by this time i was bent on shooting them as i never remember being bent on anything before or since you can go if you like or you can get up a tree  he considered the position a little and then he very wisely got up a tree i wish that i had done the same  meanwhile i had found my knife which had an extractor in it and succeeded after some difficulty in pulling out the cartridge which had so nearly been the cause of my death and removing the obstruction in the barrel it was very little thicker than a postagestamp certainly not thicker than a piece of writingpaper this done i loaded the gun bound a handkerchief round my wrist and hand to staunch the flowing of the blood and started on again  i had noticed that the lioness went into a thick green bush or rather a cluster of bushes growing near the water about fifty yards higher up for there was a little stream running down the kloof and i walked towards this bush when i got there however i could see nothing so i took up a big stone and threw it into the bushes i believe that it hit the other cub for out it came with a rush giving me a broadside shot of which i promptly availed myself knocking it over dead out too came the lioness like a flash of light but quick as she went i managed to put the other bullet into her ribs so that she rolled right over three times like a shot rabbit i instantly got two more cartridges into the gun and as i did so the lioness rose again and came crawling towards me on her forepaws roaring and groaning and with such an expression of diabolical fury on her countenance as i have not often seen i shot her again through the chest and she fell over on to her side quite dead  that was the first and last time that i ever killed a brace of lions right and left and what is more i never heard of anybody else doing it naturally i was considerably pleased with myself and having again loaded up i went on to look for the blackmaned beauty who had killed kaptein slowly and with the greatest care i proceeded up the kloof searching every bush and tuft of grass as i went it was wonderfully exciting work for i never was sure from one moment to another but that he would be on me i took comfort however from the reflection that a lion rarely attacks a manrarely i say sometimes he does as you will seeunless he is cornered or wounded i must have been nearly an hour hunting after that lion once i thought i saw something move in a clump of tambouki grass but i could not be sure and when i trod out the grass i could not find him  at last i worked up to the head of the kloof which made a culdesac it was formed of a wall of rock about fifty feet high down this rock trickled a little waterfall and in front of it some seventy feet from its face was a great piledup mass of boulders in the crevices and on the top of which grew ferns grasses and stunted bushes this mass was about twentyfive feet high the sides of the kloof here were also very steep well i came to the top of the nullah and looked all round no signs of the lion evidently i had either overlooked him further down or he had escaped right away it was very vexatious but still three lions were not a bad bag for one gun before dinner and i was fain to be content accordingly i departed back again making my way round the isolated pillar of boulders beginning to feel as i did so that i was pretty well done up with excitement and fatigue and should be more so before i had skinned those three lions when i had got as nearly as i could judge about eighteen yards past the pillar or mass of boulders i turned to have another look round i have a pretty sharp eye but i could see nothing at all  then on a sudden i saw something sufficiently alarming on the top of the mass of boulders opposite to me standing out clear against the rocks beyond was the huge blackmaned lion he had been crouching there and now arose as though by magic there he stood lashing his tail just like a living reproduction of the animal on the gateway of northumberland house that i have seen in a picture but he did not stand long before i could firebefore i could do more than get the gun to my shoulderhe sprang straight up and out from the rock and driven by the impetus of that one mighty bound came hurtling through the air towards me  heavens how grand he looked and how awful high into the air he flew describing a great arch just as he touched the highest point of his spring i fired i did not dare to wait for i saw that he would clear the whole space and land right upon me without a sight almost without aim i fired as one would fire a snap shot at a snipe the bullet told for i distinctly heard its thud above the rushing sound caused by the passage of the lion through the air next second i was swept to the ground luckily i fell into a low creeperclad bush which broke the shock and the lion was on the top of me and the next those great white teeth of his had met in my thighi heard them grate against the bone i yelled out in agony for i did not feel in the least benumbed and happy like dr livingstonewho by the way i knew very welland gave myself up for dead but suddenly as i did so the lions grip on my thigh loosened and he stood over me swaying to and fro his huge mouth from which the blood was gushing wide open then he roared and the sound shook the rocks  to and fro he swung and suddenly the great head dropped on me knocking all the breath from my body and he was dead my bullet had entered in the centre of his chest and passed out on the right side of the spine about halfway down the back  the pain of my wound kept me from fainting and as soon as i got my breath i managed to drag myself from under him thank heavens his great teeth had not crushed my thighbone but i was losing a great deal of blood and had it not been for the timely arrival of tom with whose aid i loosed the handkerchief from my wrist and tied it round my leg twisting it tight with a stick i think that i should have bled to death  well it was a just reward for my folly in trying to tackle a family of lions singlehanded the odds were too long i have been lame ever since and shall be to my dying day in the month of march the wound always troubles me a great deal and every three years it breaks out raw  i need scarcely add that i never traded the lot of ivory at sikukunis another man got ita germanand made five hundred pounds out of it after paying expenses i spent the month on the broad of my back and was a cripple for six months after that and now ive told you the yarn so i will have a drop of hollands and go to bed goodnight to you all goodnight
