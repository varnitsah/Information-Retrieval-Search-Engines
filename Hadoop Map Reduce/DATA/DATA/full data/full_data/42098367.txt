and wales where a strike has been in progress throughout the winter      act i        it is noon  in the underwoods diningroom a bright fire is      burning  on one side of the fireplace are doubledoors leading      to the drawingroom on the other side a door leading to the      hall  in the centre of the room a long diningtable without a      cloth is set out as a board table  at the head of it in the      chairmans seat sits john anthony an old man big      cleanshaven and highcoloured with thick white hair and thick      dark eyebrows  his movements are rather slow and feeble but his      eyes are very much alive  there is a glass of water by his side      on his right sits his son edgar an earnestlooking man of thirty      reading a newspaper  next him wanklin a man with jutting      eyebrows and silverstreaked light hair is bending over transfer      papers  tench the secretary a short and rather humble nervous      man with side whiskers stands helping him  on wanklins right      sits underwood the manager a quiet man with along stiff jaw      and steady eyes  back to the fire is scantlebury a very large      pale sleepy man with grey hair rather bald  between him and      the chairman are two empty chairs  wilder  who is lean cadaverous and complaining with drooping grey moustaches stands before the fire  i say this fires the devil  can i have a screen tench  scantlebury  a screen ah  tench  certainly mr wilder  he looks at underwood  that is perhaps the managerperhaps mr underwood  scantlebury  these fireplaces of yours underwood  underwood  roused from studying some papers  a screen  rather im sorry  he goes to the door with a little smile  were not accustomed to complaints of too much fire down here just now       he speaks as though he holds a pipe between his teeth slowly      ironically  wilder  in an injured voice  you mean the men  hm       underwood goes out  scantlebury  poor devils  wilder  its their own fault scantlebury  edgar  holding out his paper  theres great distress among them according to the trenartha news  wilder  oh that rag  give it to wanklin  suit his radical views they call us monsters i suppose  the editor of that rubbish ought to be shot  edgar  reading  if the board of worthy gentlemen who control the trenartha tin plate works from their armchairs in london would condescend to come and see for themselves the conditions prevailing amongst their workpeople during this strike  wilder  well we have come  edgar  continuing  we cannot believe that even their legofmutton hearts would remain untouched       wanklin takes the paper from him  wilder  ruffian  i remember that fellow when he had nt a penny to his name little snivel of a chap thats made his way by blackguarding everybody who takes a different view to himself       anthony says something that is not heard  wilder  what does your father say  edgar  he says the kettle and the pot  wilder  hm       he sits down next to scantlebury  scantlebury  blowing out his cheeks  i shall boil if i dont get that screen       underwood and enid enter with a screen which they place before      the fire  enid is tall she has a small decided face and is      twentyeight years old  enid  put it closer frank  will that do mr wilder  its the highest weve got  wilder  thanks capitally  scantlebury  turning with a sigh of pleasure  ah  merci madame  enid  is there anything else you want father  anthony shakes his head  edgaranything  edgar  you might give me a j nib old girl  enid  there are some down there by mr scantlebury  scantlebury  handing a little box of nibs  ah  your brother uses js  what does the manager use  with expansive politeness what does your husband use mrs underwood  underwood  a quill  scantlebury  the homely product of the goose  he holds out quills  underwood  drily  thanks if you can spare me one  he takes a quill  what about lunch enid  enid  stopping at the doubledoors and looking back  were going to have lunch here in the drawingroom so you need nt hurry with your meeting       wanklin and wilder bow and she goes out  scantlebury  rousing himself suddenly  ah  lunch  that hotel dreadful  did you try the whitebait last night  fried fat  wilder  past twelve  are nt you going to read the minutes tench  tench  looking for the chairmans assent reads in a rapid and monotonous voice  at a board meeting held the 31st of january at the companys offices 512 cannon street ec  presentmr anthony in the chair messrs  f h wilder william scantlebury oliver wanklin and edgar anthony  read letters from the manager dated january 20th 23d 25th 28th relative to the strike at the companys works  read letters to the manager of january 21st 24th 26th 29th  read letter from

conference with the board and it was resolved that a special board meeting be called for february 7th at the house of the manager for the purpose of discussing the situation with mr simon harness and the mens committee on the spot passed twelve transfers signed and sealed nine certificates and one balance certificate  he pushes the book over to the chairman  anthony  with a heavy sigh  if its your pleasure sign the same       he signs moving the pen with difficulty   wanklin  whats the unions game tench  they have nt made up their split with the men  what does harness want this interview for  tench  hoping we shall come to a compromise i think sir hes having a meeting with the men this afternoon  wilder  harness  ah  hes one of those coldblooded coolheaded chaps  i distrust them  i dont know that we didnt make a mistake to come down  what timell the men be here  underwood  any time now  wilder  well if were not ready theyll have to waitwont do them any harm to cool their heels a bit  scantlebury slowly  poor devils  its snowing  what weather  underwood  with meaning slowness  this housell be the warmest place theyve been in this winter  wilder  well i hope were going to settle this business in time for me to catch the 630  ive got to take my wife to spain tomorrow chattily  my old father had a strike at his works in 69 just such a february as this  they wanted to shoot him  wanklin  what  in the close season  wilder  by george there was no close season for employers then  he used to go down to his office with a pistol in his pocket  scantlebury  faintly alarmed  not seriously  wilder  with finality  ended in his shootin one of em in the legs  scantlebury  unavoidably feeling his thigh  no  which  anthony  lifting the agenda paper  to consider the policy of the board in relation to the strike  there is a silence  wilder  its this infernal threecornered duelthe union the men and ourselves  wanklin  we need nt consider the union  wilder  its my experience that youve always got to consider the union confound them  if the union were going to withdraw their support from the men as theyve done why did they ever allow them to strike at all  edgar  weve had that over a dozen times  wilder  well ive never understood it  its beyond me  they talk of the engineers and furnacemens demands being excessiveso they arebut thats not enough to make the union withdraw their support whats behind it  underwood  fear of strikes at harpers and tinewells  wilder  with triumph  afraid of other strikesnow thats a reason  why could nt we have been told that before  underwood  you were  tench  you were absent from the board that day sir  scantlebury  the men must have seen they had no chance when the union gave them up  its madness  underwood  its roberts  wilder  just our luck the men finding a fanatical firebrand like roberts for leader  a pause  wanklin  looking at anthony  well  wilder  breaking in fussily  its a regular mess  i dont like the position were in i dont like it ive said so for a long time looking at wanklin  when wanklin and i came down here before christmas it looked as if the men must collapse  you thought so too underwood  underwood  yes  wilder  well they havent  here we are going from bad to worse losing our customersshares going down  scantlebury  shaking his head  mm  mm  wanklin  what loss have we made by this strike tench  tench  over fifty thousand sir  scantlebury pained  you dont say  wilder  we shall never got it back  tench  no sir  wilder  whod have supposed the men were going to stick out like thisnobody suggested that looking angrily at tench  scantlebury  shaking his head  ive never liked a fightnever shall  anthony  no surrender  all look at him  wilder  who wants to surrender  anthony looks at him  ii want to act reasonably  when the men sent roberts up to the board in decemberthen was the time  we ought to have humoured him instead of that the chairmandropping his eyes before anthonyserwe snapped his head off  we could have got them in then by a little tact  anthony  no compromise  wilder  there we are  this strikes been going on now since october and as far as i can see it may last another six months pretty mess we shall be in by then  the only comfort is the menll be in a worse  edgar  to underwood  what sort of state are they really in frank  underwood  without expression  damnable  wilder  well who on earth would have thought theyd have held on like this without support  underwood  those who know them  wilder  i defy any one to know them  and what about tin  price going up daily  when we do get started we shall have to work off our contracts at the top of the market  wanklin  what do you say to that chairman  anthony  cant be helped  wilder  shant pay a dividend till goodness knows when  scantlebury  with emphasis  we ought to think of the shareholders  turning heavily  chairman i say we ought to think of the shareholders  anthony mutters  scantlebury  whats that  tench  the chairman says he is thinking of you sir  scantlebury  sinking back into torpor  cynic  wilder  its past a joke  i dont want to go without a dividend for years if the chairman does  we cant go on playing ducks and drakes with the companys prosperity  edgar  rather ashamedly  i think we ought to consider the men       all but anthony fidget in their seats  scantlebury  with a sigh  we must nt think of our private feelings young man  thatll never do  edgar  ironically  im not thinking of our feelings  im thinking of the mens  wilder  as to thatwere men of business  wanklin  that is the little trouble  edgar  theres no necessity for pushing things so far in the face of all this sufferingitsits cruel       no one speaks as though edgar had uncovered something whose      existence no man prizing his selfrespect could afford to      recognise  wanklin  with an ironical smile  im afraid we must nt base our policy on luxuries like sentiment  edgar  i detest this state of things  anthony  we did nt seek the quarrel  edgar  i know that sir but surely weve gone far enough  anthony  no all look at one another  wanklin  luxuries apart chairman we must look out what were doing  anthony  give way to the men once and therell be no end to it  wanklin  i quite agree but       anthony shakes his head  you make it a question of bedrock principle       anthony nods  luxuries again chairman  the shares are below par  wilder  yes and theyll drop to a half when we pass the next dividend  scantlebury  with alarm  come come  not so bad as that  wilder  grimly  youll see  craning forward to catch anthonys speech  i didnt catch  tench  hesitating  the chairman says sir fais quequedevra  edgar  sharply  my father says do what we oughtand let things rip  wilder  tcha  scantlebury  throwing up his hands  the chairmans a stoici always said the chairman was a stoic  wilder  much good thatll do us  wanklin  suavely  seriously chairman are you going to let the ship sink under you for the sake ofa principle  anthony  she wont sink  scantlebury  with alarm  not while im on the board i hope  anthony  with a twinkle  better rat scantlebury  scantlebury  what a man  anthony  ive always fought them ive never been beaten yet  wanklin  were with you in theory chairman  but were not all made of castiron  anthony  weve only to hold on  wilder  rising and going to the fire  and go to the devil as fast as we can  anthony  better go to the devil than give in  wilder  fretfully  that may suit you sir but it does nt suit me or any one else i should think       anthony looks him in the facea silence  edgar  i dont see how we can get over it that to go on like this means starvation to the mens wives and families       wilder turns abruptly to the fire and scantlebury puts out a      hand to push the idea away  wanklin  im afraid again that sounds a little sentimental  edgar  men of business are excused from decency you think  wilder  nobodys more sorry for the men than i am but if they lashing himself  choose to be such a pigheaded lot its nothing to do with us weve quite enough on our hands to think of ourselves and the shareholders  edgar  irritably  it wont kill the shareholders to miss a dividend or two i dont see that thats reason enough for knuckling under  scantlebury  with grave discomfort  you talk very lightly of your dividends young man i dont know where we are  wilder  theres only one sound way of looking at it  we cant go on ruining ourselves with this strike  anthony  no caving in  scantlebury  with a gesture of despair  look at him       anthonys leaning back in his chair  they do look at him  wilder  returning to his seat  well all i can say is if thats the chairmans view i dont know what weve come down here for  anthony  to tell the men that weve got nothing for them grimly  they wont believe it till they hear it spoken in plain english  wilder  hm  shouldnt be a bit surprised if that brute roberts had nt got us down here with the very same idea  i hate a man with a grievance  edgar  resentfully  we didnt pay him enough for his discovery i always said that at the time  wilder  we paid him five hundred and a bonus of two hundred three years later  if thats not enough  what does he want for goodness sake  tench complainingly  company made a hundred thousand out of his brains and paid him seven hundredthats the way he goes on sir  wilder  the mans a rank agitator  look here i hate the unions but now weve got harness here lets get him to settle the whole thing  anthony  no again they look at him  underwood  roberts wont let the men assent to that  scantlebury  fanatic  fanatic  wilder  looking at anthony  and not the only one  frost enters from the hall  frost  to anthony  mr harness from the union waiting sir  the men are here too sir       anthony nods  underwood goes to the door returning with      harness a pale cleanshaven man with hollow cheeks quick      eyes and lantern jawfrost has retired  underwood  pointing to tenchs chair  sit there next the chairman harness wont you       at harnesss appearance the board have drawn together as it      were and turned a little to him like cattle at a dog  harness  with a sharp look round and a bow  thanks  he sits his accent is slightly nasal  well gentlemen were going to do business at last i hope  wilder  depends on what you call business harness  why dont you make the men come in  harness  sardonically  the men are far more in the right than you are  the question with us is whether we shant begin to support them again       he ignores them all except anthony to whom he turns in      speaking  anthony  support them if you like well put in free labour and have done with it  harness  that wont do mr anthony  you cant get free labour and you know it  anthony  we shall see that  harness  im quite frank with you  we were forced to withhold our support from your men because some of their demands are in excess of current rates  i expect to make them withdraw those demands today if they do take it straight from me gentlemen we shall back them again at once  now i want to see something fixed upon before i go back tonight  cant we have done with this oldfashioned tugofwar business  what goods it doing you  why dont you recognise once for all that these people are men like yourselves and want whats good for them just as you want whats good for you bitterly  your motorcars and champagne and eightcourse dinners  anthony  if the men will come in well do something for them  harness  ironically  is that your opinion too sirand yours and yours  the directors do not answer  well all i can say is its a kind of high and mighty aristocratic tone i thought wed grown out ofseems i was mistaken  anthony  its the tone the men use  remains to be seen which can hold out longestthey without us or we without them  harness  as business men i wonder youre not ashamed of this waste of force gentlemen  you know what itll all end in  anthony  what  harness  compromiseit always does  scantlebury  cant you persuade the men that their interests are the same as ours  harness turning ironically  i could persuade them of that sir if they were  wilder  come harness youre a clever man you dont believe all the socialistic claptrap thats talked nowadays  there s no real difference between their interests and ours  harness  theres just one very simple question id like to put to you  will you pay your men one penny more than they force you to pay them       wilder is silent  wanklin  chiming in  i humbly thought that not to pay more than was necessary was the a b c of commerce  harness  with irony  yes that seems to be the a b c of commerce sir and the a b c of commerce is between your interests and the mens  scantlebury  whispering  we ought to arrange something  harness  drily  am i to understand then gentlemen that your board is going to make no concessions       wanklin and wilder bend forward as if to speak but stop  anthony  nodding  none       wanklin and wilder again bend forward and scantlebury gives an      unexpected grunt  harness  you were about to say something i believe       but scantlebury says nothing  edgar  looking up suddenly  were sorry for the state of the men  harness  icily  the men have no use for your pity sir  what they want is justice  anthony  then let them be just  harness  for that word just read humble mr anthony  why should they be humble  barring the accident of money are nt they as good men as you  anthony  cant  harness  well ive been five years in america  it colours a mans notions  scantlebury  suddenly as though avenging his uncompleted grunt lets have the men in and hear what theyve got to say       anthony nods and underwood goes out by the single door  harness  drily  as im to have an interview with them this afternoon gentlemen i ll ask you to postpone your final decision till thats over       again anthony nods and taking up his glass drinks       underwood comes in again followed by roberts green bulgin      thomas rous  they file in hat in hand and stand silent in a      row  roberts is lean of middle height with a slight stoop      he has a little ratgnawn browngrey beard moustaches high      cheekbones hollow cheeks small fiery eyes  he wears an old      and greasestained blue serge suit and carries an old bowler      hat  he stands nearest the chairman  green next to him has a      clean worn face with a small grey goatee beard and drooping      moustaches iron spectacles and mild straightforward eyes  he      wears an overcoat green with age and a linen collar  next to      him is bulgin a tall strong man with a dark moustache and      fighting jaw wearing a red muffler who keeps changing his cap      from one hand to the other  next to him is thomas an old man      with a grey moustache full beard and weatherbeaten bony face      whose overcoat discloses a lean pluckedlooking neck  on his      right rous the youngest of the five looks like a soldier he      has a glitter in his eyes  underwood  pointing  there are some chairs there against the wall roberts wont you draw them up and sit down  roberts  thank you mr underwoodwell stand in the presence of the board  he speaks in a biting and staccato voice rolling his rs pronouncing his as like an italian a and his consonants short and crisp  how are you mr harness  did nt expect t have the pleasure of seeing you till this afternoon  harness  steadily  we shall meet again then roberts  roberts  glad to hear that we shall have some news for you to take to your people  anthony  what do the men want  roberts  acidly  beg pardon i dont quite catch the chairmans remark  tench  from behind the chairmans chair  the chairman wishes to know what the men have to say  roberts  its what the board has to say weve come to hear  its for the board to speak first  anthony  the board has nothing to say  roberts  looking along the line of men  in that case were wasting the directors time  well be taking our feet off this pretty carpet       he turns the men move slowly as though hypnotically      influenced  wanklin suavely  come roberts you did nt give us this long cold journey for the pleasure of saying that  thomas  a pure welshman  no sir an what i say iss  robertsbitingly  go on henry thomas go on  you re better able to speak to thedirectors than me  thomas is silent  tench  the chairman means roberts that it was the men who asked for the conference the board wish to hear what they have to say  roberts  gad  if i was to begin to tell ye all they have to say i wouldnt be finished today  and thered be some thatd wish theyd never left their london palaces  harness  whats your proposition man  be reasonable  roberts  you want reason mr harness  take a look round this afternoon before the meeting  he looks at the men no sound escapes them  youll see some very pretty scenery  harness  all right my friend you wont put me off  roberts  to the men  we shant put mr harness off  have some champagne with your lunch mr harness youll want it sir  harness  come get to business man  thomas  what were asking look you is just simple justice  roberts  venomously  justice from london  what are you talking about henry thomas  have you gone silly  thomas is silent  we know very well what we arediscontented dogsnever satisfied  what did the chairman tell me up in london  that i did nt know what i was talking about  i was a foolish uneducated man that knew nothing of the wants of the men i spoke for  edgar  do please keep to the point  anthony  holding up his hand  there can only be one master roberts  roberts  then be gad itll be us       there is a silence anthony and roberts stare at one another  underwood  if youve nothing to say to the directors roberts perhaps you ll let green or thomas speak for the men       green and thomas look anxiously at roberts at each other and      the other men  green  an englishman  if id been listened to gentlemen  thomas  what ife got to say iss what wefe all got to say  roberts  speak for yourself henry thomas  scantlebury  with a gesture of deep spiritual discomfort  let the poor men call their souls their own  roberts  aye they shall keep their souls for its not much body that youve left them mr with biting emphasis as though the word were an offence  scantlebury  to the men  well will you speak or shall i speak for you  rous  suddenly  speak out roberts or leave it to others  roberts  ironically  thank you george rous  addressing himself to anthony  the chairman and board of directors have honoured us by leaving london and coming all this way to hear what weve got to say it would not be polite to keep them any longer waiting  wilder  well thank god for that  roberts  ye will not dare to thank him when i have done mr wilder for all your piety  may be your god up in london has no time to listen to the working man  im told he is a wealthy god but if he listens to what i tell him he will know more than ever he learned in kensington  harness  come roberts you have your own god  respect the god of other men  roberts  thats right sir  we have another god down here i doubt he is rather different to mr wilders  ask henry thomas he will tell you whether his god and mr wilders are the same       thomas lifts his hand and cranes his head as though to      prophesy  wanklin  for goodness sake let s keep to the point roberts  roberts  i rather think it is the point mr wanklin  if you can get the god of capital to walk through the streets of labour and pay attention to what he sees youre a brighter man than i take you for for all that youre a radical  anthony  attend to me roberts  roberts is silent  you are here to speak for the men as i am here to speak for the board       he looks slowly round       wilder wanklin and scantlebury make movements of uneasiness      and edgar gazes at the floor  a faint smile comes on harnesss      face  now then what is it  roberts  right sir       throughout all that follows he and anthony look fixedly upon      each other  men and directors show in their various ways      suppressed uneasiness as though listening to words that they      themselves would not have spoken  the men cant afford to travel up to london and they dont trust you to believe what they say in black and white  they know what the post is he darts a look at underwood and tench and what directors meetings are refer it to the managerlet the manager advise us on the mens condition  can we squeeze them a little more  underwood  in a low voice  dont hit below the belt roberts  roberts  is it below the belt mr underwood  the men know  when i came up to london i told you the position straight  an what came of it  i was told i did nt know what i was talkin about  i cant afford to travel up to london to be told that again  anthony  what have you to say for the men  roberts  i have this to sayand first as to their condition  ye shall ave no need to go and ask your manager  ye cant squeeze them any more  every man of us is wellnigh starving  a surprised murmur rises from the men  roberts looks round  ye wonder why i tell ye that  every man of us is going short  we cant be no worse off than weve been these weeks past  ye need nt think that by waiting yell drive us to come in  well die first the whole lot of us  the men have sent for ye to know once and for all whether ye are going to grant them their demands  i see the sheet of paper in the secretarys hand  tench moves nervously  thats it i think mr tench  its not very large  tench  nodding  yes  roberts  theres not one sentence of writing on that paper that we can do without       a movement amongst the men  roberts turns on them sharply  isnt that so       the men assent reluctantly  anthony takes from tench the paper      and peruses it  not one single sentence  all those demands are fair  we have not asked anything that we are not entitled to ask  what i said up in london i say again now there is not anything on that piece of paper that a just man should not ask and a just man give       a pause  anthony  there is not one single demand on this paper that we will grant       in the stir that follows on these words roberts watches the      directors and anthony the men  wilder gets up abruptly and goes      over to the fire  roberts  d ye mean that  anthony  i do       wilder at the fire makes an emphatic movement of disgust  roberts  noting it with dry intensity  ye best know whether the condition of the company is any better than the condition of the men scanning the directors faces  ye best know whether ye can afford your tyrannybut this i tell ye if ye think the men will give way the least part of an inch yere making the worst mistake ye ever made  he fixes his eyes on scantlebury  ye think because the union is not supporting usmore shame to itthat well be coming on our knees to you one fine morning  ye think because the men have got their wives an families to think ofthat its just a question of a week or two  anthony  it would be better if you did not speculate so much on what we think  roberts  aye  its not much profit to us  i will say this for you mr anthonyye know your own mind  staying at anthony  i can reckon on ye  anthony  ironically  i am obliged to you  roberts  and i know mine  i tell ye this the men will send their wives and families where the country will have to keep them an they will starve sooner than give way  i advise ye mr anthony to prepare yourself for the worst that can happen to your company  we are not so ignorant as you might suppose  we know the way the cat is jumping  your position is not all that it might benot exactly  anthony  be good enough to allow us to judge of our position for ourselves  go back and reconsider your own  roberts  stepping forward  mr anthony you are not a young man now from the time i remember anything ye have been an enemy to every man that has come into your works  i dont say that yere a mean man or a cruel man but yeve grudged them the say of any word in their own fate  yeve fought them down four times  ive heard ye say ye love a fightmark my wordsyere fighting the last fight yell ever fight       tench touches robertss sleeve  underwood  roberts  roberts  roberts  roberts  roberts  i must nt speak my mind to the chairman but the chairman may speak his mind to me  wilder  what are things coming to  anthony with a grim smile at wilder  go on roberts say what you like  roberts  after a pause  i have no more to say  anthony  the meeting stands adjourned to five oclock  wanklin  in a low voice to underwood  we shall never settle anything like this  roberts  bitingly  we thank the chairman and board of directors for their gracious hearing       he moves towards the door the men cluster together stupefied      then rous throwing up his head passes roberts and goes out      the others follow  roberts  with his hand on the doormaliciously  good day gentlemen  he goes out  harness  ironically  i congratulate you on the conciliatory spirit thats been displayed  with your permission gentlemen ill be with you again at halfpast five  good morning       he bows slightly rests his eyes on anthony who returns his      stare unmoved and followed by underwood goes out  there is a      moment of uneasy silence  underwood

enid  you dont father if you did you would nt  anthony  its you who dont know the simple facts of the position what sort of mercy do you suppose youd get if no one stood between you and the continual

 holding the papers and a pen to anthony very nervously would you sign these for me please sir       anthony takes the pen and signs  tench  standing with a sheet of blottingpaper behind edgars chair begins speaking nervously  i owe my position to you sir  anthony  well  tench  im obliged to see everything thats going on sir ii depend upon the company entirely  if anything were to happen to it itd

more terrible than they are up mine  tench  no sir  very nervously  i know the company means a great deal to you sir  anthony  it does i founded it  tench  yes sir  if the strike goes on itll be very serious  i think the directors are beginning to realise that sir  anthony  ironically  indeed  tench  i know you hold very strong views sir and its always your habit to look things in the face but i dont think the directors like it sir now theythey see it  anthony  grimly  nor you it seems  tench  with the ghost of a smile  no sir of course ive got my children and my wifes delicate in my position

on in life you do feel things dreadfully  anthony  almost paternally  come out with it trench  tench  i dont like to say it sir  anthony  stonily  you must  tench  after a pause desperately bolting it out  i think the directors are going to throw you over sir  anthony  sits in silence  ring the bell       tench nervously rings the bell and stands by the fire  tench  excuse me for saying such a thing  i was only thinking of you sir       frost enters from the hall he comes to the foot of the table      and looks at anthony tench coveys his nervousness by arranging      papers  anthony  bring me a whiskey and soda  frost  anything to eat sir       anthony shakes his head  frost goes to the sideboard and      prepares the drink  tench  in a low voice almost supplicating  if you could see your way sir it would be a great relief to my mind it would indeed he looks up at anthony who has not moved  it does make me so very anxious  i havent slept properly for weeks sir and thats a fact       anthony looks in his face then slowly shakes his head  disheartened  no sir  he goes on arranging papers       frost places the whiskey and salver and puts it down by      anthonys right hand  he stands away looking gravely at      anthony  frost  nothing i can get you sir       anthony shakes his head  youre aware sir of what the doctor said sir  anthony  i am       a pause  frost suddenly moves closer to him and speaks in a      low voice  frost  this strike sir puttin all this strain on you  excuse me sir is itis it worth it sir       anthony mutters some words that are inaudible  very good sir       he turns and goes out into the hall  tench makes two attempts      to speak but meeting his chairmans gaze he drops his eyes      and turning dismally he too goes out  anthony is left alone      he grips the glass tilts it and drinks deeply then sets it      down with a deep and rumbling sigh and leans back in his      chair                            the curtain falls      act ii  scene i       it is halfpast three  in the kitchen of robertss cottage a      meagre little fire is burning  the room is clean and tidy very      barely furnished with a brick floor and

i did nt know what suffering there is amongst the men  i do feel for them dreadfully but you know they have gone too far  mrs roberts  continually moving her fingers  they say theres no other way to get better wages mm  enid  earnestly  but annie thats why the union wont help them  my husbands very sympathetic with the men but he says they are not underpaid  mrs roberts  no mm  enid  they never think how the company could go on if we paid the wages they want  mrs roberts  with an effort  but the dividends having been so big mm  enid  takes aback  you all seem to think the shareholders are rich men but theyre notmost of them are really no better off than working men       mrs roberts smiles  they have to keep up appearances  mrs roberts  yes mm  enid  you dont have to pay rates and taxes and a hundred other things that they do  if the men did nt spend such a lot in drink and betting theyd be quite well off  mrs roberts  they say workin so hard they must have some pleasure  enid  but surely not low pleasure like that  mrs roberts  a little resentfully  roberts never touches a drop and hes never had a bet in his life  enid  oh  but hes not a comi mean hes an engineer a superior man  mrs roberts  yes mm  roberts says theyve no chance of other pleasures  enid  musing  of course i know its hard  mrs roberts  with a spice of malice  and they say gentlefolks just as bad  enid  with a smile  i go as far as most people annie but you know yourself thats nonsense  mrs roberts  with painful effort  a lot o the men never go near the public but even they dont save but very little and that goes if theres illness  enid  but theyve got their clubs have nt they  mrs roberts  the clubs only give up to eighteen shillins a week mm and its not much amongst a family  roberts says workin folk have always lived from hand to mouth  sixpence today is worth more than a shillin tomorrow thats what they say  enid  but thats the spirit of gambling  mrs roberts  with a sort of excitement  roberts says a working mans life is all a gamble from the time e s born to the time e dies       enid leans forward interested  mrs roberts goes on with a      growing excitement that culminates in the personal feeling of      the last words  he says mm that when a working mans baby is born its a tossup from breath to breath whether it ever draws another and so on all is life an when he comes to be old its the workhouse or the grave  he says that without a man is very near and pinches and stints imself and is children to save there cant be neither surplus nor security  thats why he wouldnt have no children she sinks back not though i wanted them  enid  yes yes i know  mrs roberts  no you dont mm  youve got your children and youll never need to trouble for them  enid  gently  you oughtnt to be talking so much annie  then in spite of herself  but roberts was paid a lot of money was nt he for discovering that process  mrs roberts  on the defensive  all robertss savins have gone he s always looked forward to this strike  he says hes no right to a farthing when the others are suffering  t is nt so with all o them  some dont seem to care no more than thatso long as they get their own  enid  i dont see how they can be expected to when they re suffering like this  in a changed voice  but roberts ought to think of you  its all terrible  the kettles boiling  shall i make the tea  she takes the teapot and seeing tea there pours water into it  wont you have a cup  mrs roberts  no thank you mm  she is listening as though for footsteps  idsooner you did nt see roberts mm he gets so wild  enid  oh  but i must annie ill be quite calm i promise  mrs roberts  its life an death to him mm  enid  very gently  ill get him to talk to me outside we wont excite you  mrs roberts  faintly  no mm       she gives a violent start  roberts has come in unseen  roberts  removing his hatwith subtle mockery  beg pardon for coming in youre engaged with a lady i see  enid  can i speak to you mr roberts  roberts  whom have i the pleasure of addressing maam  enid  but surely you know me  i m mrs underwood  roberts  with a bow of malice  the daughter of our chairman  enid  earnestly  ive come on purpose to speak to you will you come outside a minute       she looks at mrs roberts  roberts  hanging up his hat  i have nothing to say maam  enid  but i must speak to you please       she moves towards the door  roberts  with sudden venom  i have not the time to listen  mrs roberts  david  enid  mr roberts please  roberts  taking off his overcoat  i am sorry to disoblige a lady mr anthonys daughter  enid  wavering then with sudden decision  mr roberts i know youve another meeting of the men       roberts bows  i came to appeal to you  please please try to come to some compromise give way a little if its only for your own sakes  roberts  speaking to himself  the daughter of mr anthony begs me to give way a little if its only for our own sakes  enid  for everybodys sake for your wifes sake  roberts  for my wifes sake for everybodys sakefor the sake of mr anthony  enid  why are you so bitter against my father  he has never done anything to you  roberts  has he not  enid  he cant help his views any more than you can help yours  roberts  i really did nt know that i had a right to views  enid  hes an old man and you       seeing his eyes fixed on her she stops  roberts  without raising his voice  if i saw mr anthony going to die and i could save him by lifting my hand i would not lift the little finger of it  enid  youyoushe stops again biting her lips  roberts  i would not and thats flat  enid  coldly  you dont mean what you say and you know it  roberts  i mean every word of it  enid  but why  roberts  with a flash  mr anthony stands for tyranny  thats why  enid  nonsense       mrs roberts makes a movement as if to rise but sinks back in      her chair  enid  with an impetuous movement  annie  roberts  please not to touch my wife  enid  recoiling with a sort of horror  i believeyou are mad  roberts  the house of a madman then is not the fit place for a lady  enid  i m not afraid of you  roberts  bowing  i would not expect the daughter of mr anthony to be afraid  mr anthony is not a coward like the rest of them  enid  suddenly  i suppose you think it brave then to go on with the struggle  roberts  does mr anthony think it brave to fight against women and children  mr anthony is a rich man i believe does he think it brave to fight against those who have nt a penny  does he think it brave to set children crying with hunger an women shivering with cold  enid  putting up her hand as though warding off a blow  my father is acting on his principles and you know it  roberts  and so am i  enid  you hate us and you cant bear to be beaten  roberts  neither can mr anthony for all that he may say  enid  at any rate you might have pity on your wife       mrs roberts who has her hand pressed to her heart takes it      away and tries to calm her breathing  roberts  madam i have no more to say       he takes up the loaf  there is a knock at the door and      underwood comes in  he stands looking at them enid turns to      him then seems undecided  underwood  enid  roberts  ironically  ye were not needing to come for your wife mr underwood  we are not rowdies  underwood  i know that roberts  i hope mrs roberts is better       roberts turns away without answering  come enid  enid  i make one more appeal to you mr roberts for the sake of your wife  roberts  with polite malice  if i might advise ye maammake it for the sake of your husband and your father       enid suppressing a retort goes out  underwood opens the door      for her and follows  roberts going to the fire holds out his      hands to the dying glow  roberts  how goes it my girl  feeling better are you       mrs roberts smiles faintly  he brings his overcoat and wraps      it round her  looking at his watch  ten minutes to four  as though inspired ive seen their faces theres no fight in them except for that one old robber  mrs roberts  wont you stop and eat david  youve ad nothing all day  roberts  putting his hand to his throat  cant swallow till those old sharks are out o the town he walks up and down  i shall have a bother with the mentheres no heart in them the cowards  blind as bats they arecant see a day before their noses  mrs roberts  its the women david  roberts  ah  so they say  they can remember the women when their own bellies speak  the women never stop them from the drink but from a little suffering to themselves in a sacred cause the women stop them fast enough  mrs roberts  but think o the children david  roberts  ah  if they will go breeding themselves for slaves without a thought o the future o them they breed  mrs roberts  gasping  thats enough david dont begin to talk of thati wonti cant  roberts  staring at her  now now my girl  mrs roberts  breathlessly  no no davidi wont  roberts  there

his eyes  who talks of dying  no one will die till we have beaten these       he meets her eyes again and again turns his away  excitedly  this is what ive been waiting for all these months  to get the old robbers down and send them home again without a farthins worth o change  i ve seen their faces i tell you in the valley of the shadow of defeat       he goes to the peg and takes down his hat

girl  mrs roberts  with soft bitterness  youd better take it       she lifts the coat  but roberts puts it back and wraps it      round her  he tries to meet her eyes but cannot  mrs      roberts stays huddled in the coat her eyes that follow him      about are half malicious half yearning  he looks at his watch      again and turns to go  in the doorway he meets jan thomas a      boy of ten in clothes too big for him carrying a penny      whistle  roberts  hallo boy       he goes  jan stops within a yard of mrs roberts and stares      at her without a word  mrs roberts  well jan  jan

towingpath of a canal on which      is moored a barge  in the distance are marshes and snowcovered      hills  the works high wall runs from the canal across the open      space and ivy the angle of this wall is a rude platform of      barrels and boards  on it harness is standing  roberts a      little apart from the crowd leans his back against the wall on      the raised towingpath two

and old thomas      joining the crowd takes his stand in front  harness  holding up his hand  they cant get them  but that wont help you  now men be reasonable  your demands would have brought on us the burden of a dozen strikes at a time when we were not prepared for them  the unions live by justice not to one but all  any fair man will tell youyou were illadvised  i dont say you go too far for

when you want me you know where i shall be       he jumps down the crowd gives way he passes through them and      goes away  a bargeman looks after him jerking his pipe with a      derisive gesture  the men close up in groups and many looks      are cast at roberts who stands alone against the wall  evans  he wants ye to turn blacklegs thats what he wants  he wants ye to go back on us  sooner

air of      fierce distraction  sullen murmurs of disapproval from the      crowd  rous  speaking with great excitement  im no blanky orator mates but wot i say is drove from me  what i say is yuman

menacing yet halfashamed movement towards roberts  hell speak to you again mark my words but dont ye listen  the crowd groans  its hell fire thats on that mans tongue  roberts is seen laughing  sim

terms with london im no orator but i sayhave done wi this black misery       he gives his muter a twist jerks his head back and jumps off      the platform  the crowd applauds and surges forward  amid      cries of thats enough  up union  up harness roberts      quietly ascends the platform  there is a moment of silence  blacksmith  we dont want to hear you  shut it  henry rous  get down       amid such cries they surge towards the platform  evans  fiercely  let im speak  roberts  roberts  bulgin  muttering  hed better look out that i dont crack his skull       roberts faces the crowd probing them with his eyes till they      gradually become silent  he begins speaking  one of the      bargemen rises and stands  roberts  you dont want to hear me then  youll listen to rous and to that old man but not to me  youll listen to sim harness of the union thats treated you so fair maybe youll listen to those men from london  ah  you groan  what for  you love their feet on your necks dont you  then as bulgin elbows his way towards the platform with calm bathos  youd like to break my jaw john bulgin  let me speak then do your smashing if it gives you pleasure  bulgin stands motionless and sullen  am i a liar a coward a traitor  if only i were yed listen to me im sure the murmurings cease and there is now dead silence  is there a man of you here that has less to gain by striking  is there a man of you that had more to lose  is there a man of you that has given up eight hundred pounds since this trouble here began  come now is there  how much has thomas given upten pounds or five or what you listened to him and what had he to say  none can pretend he said that im not a believer in principlewith biting ironybut when nature says no further t es going agenst nature i tell you if a man cannot say to nature budge me from this if ye can with a sort of exaltation his principles are but his belly  oh but thomas says a man can be pure and honest just and merciful and take off his hat to nature  i tell you natures neither pure nor honest just nor merciful  you chaps that live over the hill an go home dead beat in the dark on a snowy nightdont ye fight your way every inch of it  do ye go lyin down an trustin to the tender mercies of this merciful nature  try it and youll soon know with what yeve got to deal  t es only by thathe strikes a blow with his clenched fistin natures face that a man can be a man give in says thomas go down on your knees throw up your foolish fight an perhaps he said perhaps your enemy will chuck you down a crust  jago  never  evans  curse them  thomas  i nefer said that  roberts  bitingly  if ye did not say it man ye meant it an what did ye say about chapel  chapels against it ye said she s against it  well if chapel and nature go hand in hand its the first ive ever heard of it  that young man there pointing to roussaid i ad ell fire on my tongue  if i had i would use it all to scorch and wither this talking of surrender surrendering s the work of cowards and traitors  henry rous  as george rous moves forward  go for him george dont stand his lip  roberts  flinging out his finger  stop there george rous its no time this to settle personal matters  rous stops  but there was one other spoke to youmr simon harness  we have not much to thank mr harness and the union for  they said to us desert your mates or well desert you  an they did desert us  evans  they did  roberts  mr simon harness is a clever man but he has come too late  with intense conviction  for all that mr simon harness says for all that thomas rous for all that any man present here can sayweve won the fight       the crowd sags nearer looking eagerly up  with withering scorn  youve felt the pinch ot in your bellies youve forgotten what that fight as been many times i have told you i will tell you now this once again  the fight o the countrys body and blood against a bloodsucker  the fight of those that spend themselves with every blow they strike and every breath they draw against a thing that fattens on them and grows and grows by the law of merciful nature  that thing is capital  a thing that buys the sweat o mens brows and the tortures o their brains at its own price  dont i know that  wasnt the work o my brains bought for seven hundred pounds and has nt one hundred thousand pounds been gained them by that seven hundred without the stirring of a finger it is a thing that will take as much and give you as little as it can  thats capital  a thing that will sayim very sorry for you poor fellowsyou have a cruel time of it i know but will not give one sixpence of its dividends to help you have a better time thats capital  tell me for all their talk is there one of them that will consent to another penny on the income tax to help the poor  thats capital  a whitefaced stonyhearted monster  ye have got it on its knees are ye to give up at the last minute to save your miserable bodies pain  when i went this morning to those old men from london i looked into their very earts  one of them was sitting theremr scantlebury a mass of flesh nourished on us sittin there for all the world like the shareholders in this company that sit not moving tongue nor finger takin dividends a great dumb ox that can only be roused when its food is threatened i looked into his eyes and i saw he was afraidafraid for himself and his dividends afraid for his fees afraid of the very shareholders he stands for and all but one of thems afraidlike children that get into a wood at night and start at every rustle of the leaves  i ask you menhe pauses holding out his hand till there is utter silencegive me a free hand to tell them go you back to london  the men have nothing for you a murmuring  give me that an i swear to you within a week you shall have from london all you want  evans jago and others  a free hand  give him a free hand  bravo bravo  roberts  t is not for this little moment of time were fighting the murmuring dies not for ourselves our own little bodies and their wants t is for all those that come after throughout all time with intense sadness  oh  menfor the love o them dont roll up another stone upon their heads dont help to blacken the sky an let the bitter sea in over them  theyre welcome to the worst that can happen to me to the worst that can happen to us all are nt theyare nt they  if we can shake passionately  that whitefaced monster with the bloody lips that has sucked the life out of ourselves our wives and children since the world began  dropping the note of passion but with the utmost weight and intensity  if we have not the hearts of men to stand against it breast to breast and eye to eye and force it backward till it cry for mercy it will go on sucking life and we shall stay forever what we are in almost a whisper less than the very dogs       an utter stillness and roberts stands rocking his body      slightly with his eyes burning the faces of the crowd  evans and jago  suddenly  roberts  the shout is taken up       there is a slight movement in the crowd and madge passing      below the towingpath stops by the platform looking up at      roberts  a sudden doubting silence  roberts  nature says that old man give in to nature  i tell you strike your blow in natures facean let it do its worst       he catches sight of madge his brows contract he looks away  madge  in a low voiceclose to the platform  your wifes dying       roberts glares at her as if torn from some pinnacle of      exaltation  roberts  trying to stammer on  i say to youanswer themanswer them       he is drowned by the murmur in the crowd  thomas  stepping forward  tont you hear her then  roberts  what is it  a dead silence  thomas  your wife man       roberts hesitates then with a gesture he leaps down and goes      away below the towingpath the men making way for him  the      standing bargeman opens and prepares to light a lantern      daylight is fast failing  madge  he need nt have hurried  annie roberts is dead then in the silence passionately  you pack of blinded hounds  how many more women are you going to let to die       the crowd shrinks back from her and breaks up in groups with      a confused uneasy movement  madge goes quickly away below the      towingpath  there is a hush as they look after her  lewis  theres a spitfire for ye  bulgin  growling  ill smash er

there i began to feel quite different at once  people talk about sympathy with the working classes they dont know what it means to try and put it into practice  it seems hopeless  edgar  ah  well

feeling against him       enid glances at him sharply but finding him in perfect      earnest stands biting her lips and looking at the      doubledoors  it s a regular right down struggle between the two  ive no patience with this roberts from what i ear hes just an ordinary workin man like the rest of em  if he did invent a thing hes no worse off than undreds of others  my brother invented a new kind o dumbwaiternobody gave him anything for it an there it is bein used all over the place       enid moves closer to the doubledoors  theres a kind o man that never forgives the world because e

slight impatience  yes i know frost of course will you please go in and ask if theyll have some tea say i sent you  frost  yes mm       he opens the doors gently and goes in  there is a momentary      sound of earnest gather angry talk  wilder  i dont agree with you  wanklin  weve had this over a dozen times  edgar  impatiently  well whats the proposition  scantlebury  yes what does your father say

strike  madge  with sombre triumph  then tell him mrs roberts is dead that ll make him better  enid  go away  madge  when a person hurts us we get it back on them       she makes a sudden and swift movement towards enid fixing her      eyes on the childs frock lying across the little table  enid      snatches the frock up as though it were the child itself  they      stand a yard apart crossing glances  madge  pointing to the frock with a little smile  ah  you felt that  lucky its her mothernot her childrenyouve to look after is nt it  she wont trouble you long  enid  go away  madge  ive given you the message       she turns and goes out into the hall  enid motionless till      she has gone sinks down at the table bending her head over the      frock which she is still clutching to her  the doubledoors      are opened and anthony comes slowly in he passes his daughter      and lowers himself into an armchair  he is very flushed  enid  hiding her emotionanxiously  what is it dad       anthony makes a gesture but does not speak  who was it       anthony does not answer  enid going to the doubledoors meets      edgar coming in  they speak together in low tones  what is it ted  edgar  that fellow wilder  taken to personalities  he was downright insulting  enid  what did he say  edgar  said father was too old and feeble to know what he was doing  the dads worth six of him  enid  of course he is       they look at anthony       the doors open wider wanklin appears with scantlebury  scantlebury  sotto voce  i dont like the look of this  wanklin  going forward  come chairman  wilder sends you his apologies  a man cant do more       wilder followed by tench comes in and goes to anthony  wilder  glumly  i withdraw my words sir  im sorry       anthony nods to him  enid  you have nt come to a decision mr wanklin       wanklin shakes his head  wanklin  were all here chairman what do you say  shall we get on with the business or shall we go back to the other room  scantlebury  yes yes lets get on  we must settle something       he turns from a small chair and settles himself suddenly in      the largest chair with a sigh of comfort       wilder and wanklin also sit and tench drawing up a      straightbacked chair close to his chairman sits on the edge      of it with the minutebook and a stylographic pen  enid  whispering i want to speak to you a minute ted       they go out through the doubledoors  wanklin  really chairman its no use soothing ourselves with a sense of false security  if this strikes not brought to an end before the general meeting the shareholders will certainly haul us over the coals  scantlebury  stirring  whatwhats that  wanklin  i know it for a fact  anthony  let them  wilder  and get turned out  wanklin  to anthony  i dont mind martyrdom for a policy in which i believe but i object to being burnt for some one elses principles  scantlebury  very reasonableyou must see that chairman  anthony  we owe it to other employers to stand firm  wanklin  theres a limit to that  anthony  you were all full of fight at the start  scantlebury  with a sort of groan  we thought the men would give in but theyhave nt  anthony  they will  wilder  rising and pacing up and down i cant have my reputation as a man of business destroyed for the satisfaction of starving the men out  almost in tears  i cant have it  how can we meet the shareholders with things in the state they are  scantlebury  hear hearhear hear  wilder  lashing himself  if any one expects me to say to them ive lost you fifty thousand pounds and sooner than put my pride in my pocket ill lose you another  glancing at anthony  itsits unnatural  i dont want to go against you sir  wanklin  persuasively  come chairman we re not free agents were part of a machine  our only business is to see the company earns as much profit as it safely can  if you blame me for want of principle i say that were trustees  reason tells us we shall never get back in the saving of wages what we shall lose if we continue this strugglereally chairman we must bring it to an end on the best terms we can make  anthony  no       there is a pause of general dismay  wilder  its a deadlock then  letting his hands drop with a sort of despair  now i shall never get off to spain  wanklin  retaining a trace of irony  you hear the consequences of your victory chairman  wilder  with a burst of feeling  my wifes ill  scantlebury  dear dear  you dont say so  wilder  if i dont get her out of this cold i wont answer for the consequences       through the doubledoors edgar comes in looking very grave  edgar  to his father  have you heard this sir  mrs roberts is dead       every one stages at him as if trying to gauge the importance      of this news  enid saw her this afternoon she had no coals or food or anything its enough       there is a silence every one avoiding the others eyes except      anthony who stares hard at his son  scantlebury  you dont suggest that we could have helped the poor thing  wilder  flustered  the woman was in bad health  nobody can say theres any responsibility on us  at leastnot on me  edgar  hotly  i say that we are responsible  anthony  war is war  edgar  not on women  wanklin  it not infrequently happens that women are the greatest sufferers  edgar  if we knew that all the more responsibility rests on us  anthony  this is no matter for amateurs  edgar  call me what you like sir  its sickened me  we had no right to carry things to such a length  wilder  i dont like this business a bitthat radical rag will twist it to their own ends see if they dont  theyll get up some cock and bull story about the poor womans dying from starvation  i wash my hands of it  edgar  you cant  none of us can  scantlebury  striking his fist on the arm of his chair  but i protest against this  edgar  protest as you like mr scantlebury it wont alter facts  anthony  thats enough  edgar  facing him angrily  no sir  i tell you exactly what i think  if we pretend the men are not suffering its humbug and if theyre suffering we know enough of human nature to know the women are suffering more and as to the childrenwellits damnable       scantlebury rises from his chair  i dont say that we meant to be cruel i dont say anything of the sort but i do say its criminal to shut our eyes to the facts  we employ these men and we cant get out of it  i dont care so much about the men but id sooner resign my position on the board than go on starving women in this way       all except anthony are now upon their feet anthony sits      grasping the arms of his chair and staring at his son  scantlebury  i donti dont like the way youre putting it young sir  wanklin  youre rather overshooting the mark  wilder  i should think so indeed  edgar  losing control  its no use blinking things  if you want to have the death of women on your handsi dont  scantlebury  now now young man  wilder  on our hands  not on mine i wont have it  edgar  we are five members of this board if we were four against it why did we let it drift till it came to this  you know perfectly well whybecause we hoped we should starve the men out  well all weve done is to starve one woman out  scantlebury  almost hysterically  i protest i protest  im a humane manwere all humane men  edgar  scornfully  theres nothing wrong with our humanity  its our imaginations mr scantlebury  wilder  nonsense  my imaginations as good as yours  edgar  if so it is nt good enough  wilder  i foresaw this  edgar  then why didnt you put your foot down  wilder  much good that would have done       he looks at anthony  edgar  if you and i and each one of us here who say that our imaginations are so good  scantlebury  flurried  i never said so  edgar  paying no attentionhad put our feet down the thing would have been ended long ago and this poor womans life wouldnt have been crushed out of her like this  for all we can tell there may be a dozen other starving women  scantlebury  for gods sake sir dont use that word at aat a board meeting itsits monstrous  edgar  i will use it mr scantlebury  scantlebury  then i shall not listen to you  i shall not listen its painful to me       he covers his ears  wanklin  none of us are opposed to a settlement except your father  edgar  im certain that if the shareholders knew  wanklin  i dont think youll find their imaginations are any better than ours  because a woman happens to have a weak heart  edgar  a struggle like this finds out the weak spots in everybody any child knows that  if it hadnt been for this cutthroat policy she need nt have died like this and there would nt be all this misery that any one who is nt a fool can see is going on       throughout the foregoing anthony has eyed his son he now moves      as though to rise but stops as edgar speaks again  i dont defend the men or myself or anybody  wanklin  you may have to  a coroners jury of disinterested sympathisers may say some very nasty things  we mustnt lose sight of our position  scantlebury  without uncovering his ears  coroners jury  no no its not a case for that  edgar  i ve had enough of cowardice  wanklin  cowardice is an unpleasant word mr edgar anthony  it will look very like cowardice if we suddenly concede the mens demands when a thing like this happens we must be careful  wilder  of course we must  weve no knowledge of this matter except a rumour  the proper course is to put the whole thing into the hands of harness to settle for us thats natural thats what we should have come to any way  scantlebury  with dignity  exactly  turning to edgar  and as to you young sir i cant sufficiently express mymy distaste for the way youve treated the whole matter  you ought to withdraw talking of starvation talking of cowardice  considering what our views are  except your own isis one of goodwillits most irregular its most improper and all i can say is itsits given me pain       he places his hand over his heart  edgar  stubbornly  i withdraw nothing       he is about to say mote when scantlebury once more coveys up      his ears  tench suddenly makes a demonstration with the      minutebook  a sense of having been engaged in the unusual comes      over all of them and one by one they resume their seats  edgar      alone remains on his feet  wilder  with an air of trying to wipe something out  i pay no attention to what young mr anthony has said  coroners jury  the ideas preposterous  ii move this amendment to the chairmans motion that the dispute be placed at once in the hands of mr simon harness for settlement on the lines indicated by him this morning any one second that       tench writes in his book  wanklin  i do  wilder  very well then i ask the chairman to put it to the board  anthony  with a great sighslowly  we have been made the subject of an attack  looking round at wilder and scantlebury with ironical contempt  i take it on my shoulders  i am seventysix years old i have been chairman of this company since its inception twoandthirty years ago  i have seen it pass through good and evil report my connection with it began in the year that this young man was born       edgar bows his head  anthony gripping his chair goes on  i have had do to with men for fifty years ive always stood up to them i have never been beaten yet  i have fought the men of this company four times and four times i have beaten them  it has been said that i am not the man i was  he looks at wilder  however that may be i am man enough to stand to my guns       his voice grows stronger  the doubledoors are opened  enid      slips in followed by underwood who restrains her  the men have been treated justly they have had fair wages we have always been ready to listen to complaints  it has been said that times have changed if they have i have not changed with them neither will i  it has been said that masters and men are equal cant  there can only be one master in a house  where two men meet the better man will rule  it has been said that capital and labour have the same interests  cant  their interests are as wide asunder as the poles  it has been said that the board is only part of a machine  cant  we are the machine its brains and sinews it is for us to lead and to determine what is to be done and to do it without fear or favour  fear of the men  fear of the shareholders  fear of our own shadows  before i am like that i hope to die       he pauses and meeting his sons eyes goes on  there is only one way of treating menwith the iron hand  this half and half business the half and half manners of this generation has brought all this upon us  sentiment and softness and what this young man no doubt would call his social policy  you cant eat cake and have it  this middleclass sentiment or socialism or whatever it may be is rotten  masters are masters men are men yield one demand and they will make it six  they are he smiles grimly  like oliver twist asking for more  if i were in their place i should be the same  but i am not in their place  mark my words one fine morning when you have given way here and given way thereyou will find you have parted with the ground beneath your feet and are deep in the bog of bankruptcy and with you floundering in that bog will be the very men you have given way to i have been accused of being a domineering tyrant thinking only of my pridei am thinking of the future of this country threatened with the black waters of confusion threatened with mob government threatened with what i cannot see  if by any conduct of mine i help to bring this on us i shall be ashamed to look my fellows in the face       anthony stares before him at what he cannot see and there is      perfect stillness  frost comes in from the hall and all but      anthony look round at him uneasily  frost  to his master  the men are here sir  anthony makes a gesture of dismissal  shall i bring them in sir  anthony  wait       frost goes out anthony turns to face his son  i come to the attack that has been made upon me       edgar with a gesture of deprecation remains motionless with      his head a little bowed  a woman has died  i am told that her blood is on my hands i am told that on my hands is the starvation and the suffering of other women and of children  edgar  i said on our hands sir  anthony  it is the same  his voice grows stronger and stronger his feeling is more and more made manifest  i am not aware that if my adversary suffer in a fair fight not sought by me it is my fault if i fall under his feetas fall i mayi shall not complain  that will be my lookoutand this ishis  i cannot separate as i would these men from their women and children  a fair fight is a fair fight  let them learn to think before they pick a quarrel  edgar  in a low voice  but is it a fair fight father  look at them and look at us  theyve only this one weapon  anthony  grimly  and youre weakkneed enough to teach them how to use it  it seems the fashion nowadays for men to take their enemys side  i have not learnt that art  is it my fault that they quarrelled with their union too  edgar  there is such a thing as mercy  anthony  and justice comes before it  edgar  what seems just to one man sir is injustice to another  anthony  with suppressed passion  you accuse me of injusticeof what amounts to inhumanityof cruelty       edgar makes a gesture of horrora general frightened      movement  wanklin  come come chairman  anthony  in a grim voice  these are the words of my own son they are the words of a generation that i dont understand the words of a soft breed       a general murmur  with a violent effort anthony recovers his      control  edgar  quietly  i said it of myself too father       a long look is exchanged between them and anthony puts out his      hand with a gesture as if to sweep the personalities away then      places it against his brow swaying as though from giddiness      there is a movement towards him  he moves them back  anthony  before i put this amendment to the board i have one more word to say  he looks from face to face  if it is carried it means that we shall fail in what we set ourselves to do  it means that we shall fail in the duty that we owe to all capital  it means that we shall fail in the duty that we owe ourselves  it means that we shall be open to constant attack to which we as constantly shall have to yield  be under no misapprehensionrun this time and you will never make a stand again  you will have to fly like curs before the whips of your own men  if that is the lot you wish for you will vote for this amendment       he looks again from face to face finally resting his gaze on      edgar all sit with their eyes on the ground  anthony makes a      gesture and tench hands him the book  he reads  moved by mr wilder and seconded by mr wanklin that the mens demands be placed at once in the hands of mr simon harness for settlement on the lines indicated by him this morning  with sudden vigour  those in favour signify the same in the usual way       for a minute no one moves then hastily just as anthony is      about to speak wilders hand and wanklins are held up then      scantleburys and last edgars who does not lift his head       anthony lifts his own hand  in a clear voice  the amendment is carried  i resign my position on this board       enid gasps and there is dead silence  anthony sits      motionless his head slowly drooping suddenly he heaves as      though the whole of his life had risen up within him  contrary  fifty years  you have disgraced me gentlemen  bring in the men       he sits motionless staring before him  the board draws      hurriedly together and forms a group  tench in a frightened      manner speaks into the hall  underwood almost forces enid from      the room  wilder  hurriedly  whats to be said to them  why isnt harness here  ought we to see the men before he comes  i dont  tench  will you come in please       enter thomas green bulgin and rous who file up in a row      past the little table  tench sits down and writes  all eyes      are foxed on anthony who makes no sign  wanklin  stepping up to the little table with nervous cordiality well thomas hows it to be  whats the result of your meeting  rous  sim harness has our answer  hell tell you what it is  were waiting for him  hell speak for us  wanklin  is that so thomas  thomas  sullenly  yes  roberts will not pe coming his wife is dead  scantlebury  yes yes  poor woman  yes  yes  frost  entering from the hall  mr harness sir       as harness enters he retires       harness has a piece of paper in his hand he bows to the      directors nods towards the men and takes his stand behind the      little table in the very centre of the room  harness  good evening gentlemen       tench with the paper he has been writing joins him they      speak together in low tones  wilder  weve been waiting for you harness  hope we shall come to some  frost  entering from the hall  roberts       he goes       roberts comes hastily in and stands staring at anthony  his      face is drawn and old  roberts  mr anthony i am afraid i am a little late i would have been here in time but for something thathas happened  to the men  has anything been said  thomas  no  but man what made ye come  roberts  ye told us this morning gentlemen to go away and reconsider our position  we have reconsidered it we are here to bring you the mens answer  to anthony  go ye back to london  we have nothing for you  by no jot or tittle do we abate our demands nor will we until the whole of those demands are yielded       anthony looks at him but does not speak  there is a movement      amongst the men as though they were bewildered  harness  roberts  roberts  glancing fiercely at him and back to anthony  is that clear enough for ye  is it short enough and to the point  ye made a mistake to think that we would come to heel  ye may break the body but ye cannot break the spirit  get back to london the men have nothing for ye       pausing uneasily he takes a step towards the unmoving anthony  edgar  were all sorry for you roberts but  roberts  keep your sorrow young man  let your father speak  harness  with the sheet of paper in his hand speaking from behind the little table  roberts  robert  to anthony with passionate intensity  why dont ye answer  harness  roberts  roberts  turning sharply  what is it  harness  gravely  youre talking without the book things have travelled past you       he makes a sign to tench who beckons the directors  they      quickly sign his copy of the terms  look at this man  holding up his sheet of paper  demands conceded with the exception of those relating to the engineers and furnacemen  double wages for saturdays overtime  nightshifts as they are  these terms have been agreed  the men go back to work again tomorrow  the strike is at an end  roberts  reading the paper and turning on the men  they shrink back from him all but rous who stands his ground  with deadly stillness  ye have gone back on me  i stood by ye to the death ye waited for that to throw me over       the men answer all speaking together  rous  its a lie  thomas  ye were past endurance man  green  if yed listen to me  bulgin  under his breath hold your jaw  roberts  ye waited for that  harness  taking the directors copy of the terms and handing his own to tench  thats enough men  you had better go       the men shuffle slowly awkwardly away  wilder  in a low nervous voice  theres nothing to stay for now i suppose  he follows to the door  i shall have a try for that train  coming scantlebury  scantlebury following with wanklin  yes yes wait for me  he stops as roberts speaks  roberts  to anthony  but ye have not signed them terms  they cant make terms without their chairman  ye would never sign them terms anthony looks at him without speaking  dont tell me ye have  for the love o god  with passionate appeal  i reckoned on ye  harness  holding out the directors copy of the teems  the board has signed       roberts looks dully at the signaturesdashes the paper from      him and covers up his eyes  scantlebury  behind his hand to tench  look after the chairman hes not well hes not wellhe had no lunch  if theres any fund started for the women and children put me down forfor twenty pounds       he goes out into the hall in cumbrous haste and wanklin who      has been staring at roberts and anthony with twitchings of his      face follows  edgar remains seated on the sofa looking at the      ground tench returning to the bureau writes in his minute      book  harness stands by the little table gravely watching      roberts  roberts  then youre no longer chairman of this company  breaking into halfmad laughter  ah  haah ha ha  theyve thrown ye over thrown over their chairman ahhaha  with a sudden dreadful calm sotheyve done us both down mr anthony       enid hurrying through the doubledoors comes

his arm away  home  shrinking togetherin a whisper  home  enid  quietly to her father  come away dear  come to your room       anthony rises with an effort  he turns to roberts who looks at      him  they stand several seconds gazing at each other fixedly      anthony lifts his hand as though to salute but lets it fall      the expression of robertss face changes from hostility to      wonder  they bend their heads in token of respect  anthony      turns and slowly walks towards the curtained door  suddenly      he sways as though about to fall recovers himself and is      assisted out by edgar and enid underwood follows but stops at      the door  roberts remains motionless for several seconds      staring intently after anthony then goes out into the hall  tench  approaching harness  its a great weight off my mind mr harness  but what a painful scene sir  he wipes his brow       harness pale and resolute regards with a grim halfsmile the      quavering  tench  its all been so violent  what did he mean by done us both down  if he has lost his wife poor fellow he oughtnt to have spoken to the chairman like that  harness  a woman dead and the two best men both broken  tench

slow grim voice  thats where the fun comes in       underwood without turning from the door makes a gesture of      assent                            the curtain falls  the end
