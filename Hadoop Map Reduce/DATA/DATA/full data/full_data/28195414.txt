she had twice been carried awayleonardo da vinci       my dear aei dedicate this book to you because whether you think it well or ill written you will sympathize with the sorrows and the ecstasies of its personages perhaps even more than i do myself although i wrote these stories at different times and in different manners and without any definite plan they have but one subject the war of spiritual with natural order and how can i dedicate such a book to anyone but to you the one poet of modern ireland who has moulded a spiritual ecstasy into verse my friends in ireland sometimes ask me when i am going to write a really national poem or romance and by a national poem or romance i understand them to mean a poem or romance founded upon some famous moment of irish history and built up out of the thoughts and feelings which move the greater number of patriotic irishmen i on the other hand believe that poetry and romance cannot be made by the most conscientious study of famous moments and of the thoughts and feelings of others but only by looking into that little infinite faltering eternal flame that we call ourselves if a writer wishes to interest a certain people among whom he has grown up or fancies he has a duty towards them he may choose for the symbols of his art their legends their history their beliefs their opinions because he has a right to choose among things less than himself but he cannot choose among the substances of art so far however as this book is visionary it is irish for ireland which is still predominantly celtic has preserved with some less excellent things a gift of vision which has died out among more hurried and more successful nations no shining candelabra have prevented us from looking into the darkness and when one looks into the darkness there is always something there  wb yeats     to the secret rose       far off most secret and inviolate rose      enfold me in my hour of hours where those      who sought thee at the holy sepulchre      or in the winevat dwell beyond the stir      and tumult of defeated dreams and deep      among pale eyelids heavy with the sleep      men have named beauty your great leaves enfold      the ancient beards the helms of ruby and gold      of the crowned magi and the king whose eyes      saw the pierced hands and rood of elder rise      in druid vapour and make the torches dim      till vain frenzy awoke and he died and him      who met fand walking among flaming dew      by a grey shore where the wind never blew      and lost the world and emir for a kiss      and him who drove the gods out of their liss      and till a hundred morns had flowered red      feasted and wept the barrows of his dead      and the proud dreaming king who flung the crown      and sorrow away and calling bard and clown      dwelt among winestained wanderers in deep woods      and him who sold tillage and house and goods      and sought through lands and islands numberless years      until he found with laughter and with tears      a woman of so shining loveliness      that men threshed corn at midnight by a tress      a little stolen tress i too await      the hour of thy great wind of love and hate      when shall the stars be blown about the sky      like the sparks blown out of a smithy and die      surely thine hour has come thy great wind blows      far off most secret and inviolate rose     the crucifixion of the outcast  a man with thin brown hair and a pale face half ran half walked along the road that wound from the south to the town of sligo many called him cumhal the son of cormac and many called him the swift wild horse and he was a gleeman and he wore a short particoloured doublet and had pointed shoes and a bulging wallet also he was of the blood of the ernaans and his birthplace was the field of gold but his eating and sleeping places where the four provinces of eri and his abiding place was not upon the ridge of the earth his eyes strayed from the abbey tower of the white friars and the town battlements to a row of crosses which stood out against the sky upon a hill a little to the eastward of the town and he clenched his fist and shook it at the crosses he knew they were not empty for the birds were fluttering about them and he thought how as like as not just such another vagabond as himself was hanged on one of them and he muttered if it were hanging or bowstringing or stoning or beheading it would be bad enough but to have the birds pecking your eyes and the wolves eating your feet i would that the red wind of the druids had withered in his cradle the soldier of dathi who brought the tree of death out of barbarous lands or that the lightning when it smote dathi at the foot of the mountain had smitten him also or that his grave had been dug by the greenhaired and greentoothed merrows deep at the roots of the deep sea  while he spoke he shivered from head to foot and the sweat came out upon his face and he knew not why for he had looked upon many crosses he passed over two hills and under the battlemented gate and then round by a lefthand way to the door of the abbey it was studded with great nails and when he knocked at it he roused the lay brother who was the porter and of him he asked a place in the guesthouse then the lay brother took a glowing turf on a shovel and led the way to a big and naked outhouse strewn with very dirty rushes and lighted a rushcandle fixed between two of the stones of the wall and set the glowing turf upon the hearth and gave him two unlighted sods and a wisp of straw and showed him a blanket hanging from a nail and a shelf with a loaf of bread and a jug of water and a tub in a far corner then the lay brother left him and went back to his place by the door and cumhal the son of cormac began to blow upon the glowing turf that he might light the two sods and the wisp of straw but the sods and the straw would not light for they were damp so he took off his pointed shoes and drew the tub out of the corner with the thought of washing the dust of the highway from his feet but the water was so dirty that he could not see the bottom he was very hungry for he had not eaten all that day so he did not waste much anger upon the tub but took up the black loaf and bit into it and then spat out the bite for the bread was hard and mouldy still he did not give way to his anger for he had not drunken these many hours having a hope of heath beer or wine at his days end he had left the brooks untasted to make his supper the more delightful now he put the jug to his lips but he flung it from him straightway for the water was bitter and illsmelling then he gave the jug a kick so that it broke against the opposite wall and he took down the blanket to wrap it about him for the night but no sooner did he touch it than it was alive with skipping fleas at this beside himself with anger he rushed to the door of the guest house but the lay brother being well accustomed to such outcries had locked it on the outside so he emptied the tub and began to beat the door with it till the lay brother came to the door and asked what ailed him and why he woke him out of sleep what ails me shouted cumhal are not the sods as wet as the sands of the three rosses and are not the fleas in the blanket as many as the waves of the sea and as lively and is not the bread as hard as the heart of a lay brother who has forgotten god and is not the water in the jug as bitter and as illsmelling as his soul and is not the footwater the colour that shall be upon him when he has been charred in the undying fires the lay brother saw that the lock was fast and went back to his niche for he was too sleepy to talk with comfort and cumhal went on beating at the door and presently he heard the lay brothers foot once more and cried out at him o cowardly and tyrannous race of friars persecutors of the bard and the gleeman haters of life and joy o race that does not draw the sword and tell the truth o race that melts the bones of the people with cowardice and with deceit  gleeman said the lay brother i also make rhymes i make many while i sit in my niche by the door and i sorrow to hear the bards railing upon the friars brother i would sleep and therefore i make known to you that it is the head of the monastery our gracious abbot who orders all things concerning the lodging of travellers  you may sleep said cumhal i will sing a bards curse on the abbot and he set the tub upside down under the window and stood upon it and began to sing in a very loud voice the singing awoke the abbot so that he sat up in bed and blew a silver whistle until the lay brother came to him i cannot get a wink of sleep with that noise said the abbot what is happening  it is a gleeman said the lay brother who complains of the sods of the bread of the water in the jug of the footwater and of the blanket and now he is singing a bards curse upon you o brother abbot and upon your father and your mother and your grandfather and your grandmother and upon all your relations  is he cursing in rhyme  he is cursing in rhyme and with two assonances in every line of his curse  the abbot pulled his nightcap off and crumpled it in his hands and the circular brown patch of hair in the middle of his bald head looked like an island in the midst of a pond for in connaught they had not yet abandoned the ancient tonsure for the style then coming into use if we do not somewhat he said he will teach his curses to the children in the street and the girls spinning at the doors and to the robbers upon ben bulben  shall i go then said the other and give him dry sods a fresh loaf clean water in a jug clean footwater and a new blanket and make him swear by the blessed saint benignus and by the sun and moon that no bond be lacking not to tell his rhymes to the children in the street and the girls spinning at the doors and the robbers upon ben bulben  neither our blessed patron nor the sun and moon would avail at all said the abbot for tomorrow or the next day the mood to curse would come upon him or a pride in those rhymes would move him and he would teach his lines to the children and the girls and the robbers or else he would tell another of his craft how he fared in the guesthouse and he in his turn would begin to curse and my name would wither for learn there is no steadfastness of purpose upon the roads but only under roofs and between four walls therefore i bid you go and awaken brother kevin brother dove brother little wolf brother bald patrick brother bald brandon brother james and brother peter and they shall take the man and bind him with ropes and dip him in the river that he shall cease to sing and in the morning lest this but make him curse the louder we will crucify him  the crosses are all full said the lay brother  then we must make another cross if we do not make an end of him another will for who can eat and sleep in peace while men like him are going about the world ill should we stand before blessed saint benignus and sour would be his face when he comes to judge us at the last day were we to spare an enemy of his when we had him under our thumb brother the bards and the gleemen are an evil race ever cursing and ever stirring up the people and immoral and immoderate in all things and heathen in their hearts always longing after the son of lir and aengus and bridget and the dagda and dana the mother and all the false gods of the old days always making poems in praise of those kings and queens of the demons finvaragh whose home is under cruachmaa and red aodh of cnocnasidhe and cleena of the wave and aoibhell of the grey rock and him they call donn of the vats of the sea and railing against god and christ and the blessed saints while he was speaking he crossed himself and when he had finished he drew the nightcap over his ears to shut out the noise and closed his eyes and composed himself to sleep  the lay brother found brother kevin brother dove brother little wolf brother bald patrick brother bald brandon brother james and brother peter sitting up in bed and he made them get up then they bound cumhal and they dragged him to the river and they dipped him in it at the place which was afterwards called buckleys ford  gleeman said the lay brother as they led him back to the guest house why do you ever use the wit which god has given you to make blasphemous and immoral tales and verses for such is the way of your craft i have indeed many such tales and verses well nigh by rote and so i know that i speak true and why do you praise with rhyme those demons finvaragh red aodh cleena aoibhell and donn i too am a man of great wit and learning but i ever glorify our gracious abbot and benignus our patron and the princes of the province my soul is decent and orderly but yours is like the wind among the salley gardens i said what i could for you being also a man of many thoughts but who could help such a one as you  friend answered the gleeman my soul is indeed like the wind and it blows me to and fro and up and down and puts many things into my mind and out of my mind and therefore am i called the swift wild horse and he spoke no more that night for his teeth were chattering with the cold  the abbot and the friars came to him in the morning and bade him get ready to be crucified and led him out of the guesthouse and while he still stood upon the step a flock of great grassbarnacles passed high above him with clanking cries he lifted his arms to them and said o great grassbarnacles tarry a little and mayhap my soul will travel with you to the waste places of the shore and to the ungovernable sea at the gate a crowd of beggars gathered about them being come there to beg from any traveller or pilgrim who might have spent the night in the guesthouse the abbot and the friars led the gleeman to a place in the woods at some distance where many straight young trees were growing and they made him cut one down and fashion it to the right length while the beggars stood round them in a ring talking and gesticulating the abbot then bade him cut off another and shorter piece of wood and nail it upon the first so there was his cross for him and they put it upon his shoulder for his crucifixion was to be on the top of the hill where the others were a halfmile on the way he asked them to stop and see him juggle for them for he knew he said all the tricks of aengus the subtle hearted the old friars were for pressing on but the young friars would see him so he did many wonders for them even to the drawing of live frogs out of his ears but after a while they turned on him and said his tricks were dull and a shade unholy and set the cross on his shoulders again another halfmile on the way and he asked them to stop and hear him jest for them for he knew he said all the jests of conan the bald upon whose back a sheeps wool grew and the young friars when they had heard his merry tales again bade him take up his cross for it ill became them to listen to such follies another halfmile on the way he asked them to stop and hear him sing the story of whitebreasted deirdre and how she endured many sorrows and how the sons of usna died to serve her and the young friars were mad to hear him but when he had ended they grew angry and beat him for waking forgotten longings in their hearts so they set the cross upon his back and hurried him to the hill  when he was come to the top they took the cross from him and began to dig a hole to stand it in while the beggars gathered round and talked among themselves i ask a favour before i die says cumhal  we will grant you no more delays says the abbot  i ask no more delays for i have drawn the sword and told the truth and lived my vision and am content  would you then confess   by sun and moon not i i ask but to be let eat the food i carry in my wallet i carry food in my wallet whenever i go upon a journey but i do not taste of it unless i am wellnigh starved i have not eaten now these two days  you may eat then says the abbot and he turned to help the friars dig the hole  the gleeman took a loaf and some strips of cold fried bacon out of his wallet and laid them upon the ground i will give a tithe to the poor says he and he cut a tenth part from the loaf and the bacon who among you is the poorest and thereupon was a great clamour for the beggars began the history of their sorrows and their poverty and their yellow faces swayed like gara lough when the floods have filled it with water from the bogs  he listened for a little and says he i am myself the poorest for i have travelled the bare road and by the edges of the sea and the tattered doublet of particoloured cloth upon my back and the torn pointed shoes upon my feet have ever irked me because of the towered city full of noble raiment which was in my heart and i have been the more alone upon the roads and by the sea because i heard in my heart the rustling of the rosebordered dress of her who is more subtle than aengus the subtlehearted and more full of the beauty of laughter than conan the bald and more full of the wisdom of tears than whitebreasted deirdre and more lovely than a bursting dawn to them that are lost in the darkness therefore i award the tithe to myself but yet because i am done with all things i give it unto you  so he flung the bread and the strips of bacon among the beggars and they fought with many cries until the last scrap was eaten but meanwhile the friars nailed the gleeman to his cross and set it upright in the hole and shovelled the earth in at the foot and trampled it level and hard so then they went away but the beggars stared on sitting round the cross but when the sun was sinking they also got up to go for the air was getting chilly and as soon as they had gone a little way the wolves who had been showing themselves on the edge of a neighbouring coppice came nearer and the birds wheeled closer and closer stay outcasts yet a little while the crucified one called in a weak voice to the beggars and keep the beasts and the birds from me but the beggars were angry because he had called them outcasts so they threw stones and mud at him and went their way then the wolves gathered at the foot of the cross and the birds flew lower and lower and presently the birds lighted all at once upon his head and arms and shoulders and began to peck at him and the wolves began to eat his feet outcasts he moaned have you also turned against the outcast     out of the rose   one winter evening an old knight in rusted chainarmour rode slowly along the woody southern slope of ben bulben watching the sun go down in crimson clouds over the sea his horse was tired as after a long journey and he had upon his helmet the crest of no neighbouring lord or king but a small rose made of rubies that glimmered every moment to a deeper crimson his white hair fell in thin curls upon his shoulders and its disorder added to the melancholy of his face which was the face of one of those who have come but seldom into the world and always for its trouble the dreamers who must do what they dream the doers who must dream what they do  after gazing a while towards the sun he let the reins fall upon the neck of his horse and stretching out both arms towards the west he said o divine rose of intellectual flame let the gates of thy peace be opened to me at last and suddenly a loud squealing began in the woods some hundreds of yards further up the mountain side he stopped his horse to listen and heard behind him a sound of feet and of voices they are beating them to make them go into the narrow path by the gorge said someone and in another moment a dozen peasants armed with short spears had come up with the knight and stood a little apart from him their blue caps in their hands where do you go with the spears he asked and one who seemed the leader answered a troop of woodthieves came down from the hills a while ago and carried off the pigs belonging to an old man who lives by glen car lough and we turned out to go after them now that we know they are four times more than we are we follow to find the way they have taken and will presently tell our story to de courcey and if he will not help us to fitzgerald for de courcey and fitzgerald have lately made a peace and we do not know to whom we belong  but by that time said the knight the pigs will have been eaten  a dozen men cannot do more and it was not reasonable that the whole valley should turn out and risk their lives for two or for two dozen pigs  can you tell me said the knight if the old man to whom the pigs belong is pious and true of heart  he is as true as another and more pious than any for he says a prayer to a saint every morning before his breakfast  then it were well to fight in his cause said the knight and if you will fight against the woodthieves i will take the main brunt of the battle and you know well that a man in armour is worth many like these woodthieves clad in wool and leather  and the leader turned to his fellows and asked if they would take the chance but they seemed anxious to get back to their cabins  are the woodthieves treacherous and impious  they are treacherous in all their dealings said a peasant and no man has known them to pray  then said the knight i will give five crowns for the head of every woodthief killed by us in the fighting and he bid the leader show the way and they all went on together after a time they came to where a beaten track wound into the woods and taking this they doubled back upon their previous course and began to ascend the wooded slope of the mountains in a little while the path grew very straight and steep and the knight was forced to dismount and leave his horse tied to a treestem they knew they were on the right track for they could see the marks of pointed shoes in the soft clay and mingled with them the cloven footprints of the pigs presently the path became still more abrupt and they knew by the ending of the cloven footprints that the thieves were carrying the pigs now and then a long mark in the clay showed that a pig had slipped down and been dragged along for a little way they had journeyed thus for about twenty minutes when a confused sound of voices told them that they were coming up with the thieves and then the voices ceased and they understood that they had been overheard in their turn they pressed on rapidly and cautiously and in about five minutes one of them caught sight of a leather jerkin half hidden by a hazelbush an arrow struck the knights chainarmour but glanced off harmlessly and then a flight of arrows swept by them with the buzzing sound of great bees they ran and climbed and climbed and ran towards the thieves who were now all visible standing up among the bushes with their still quivering bows in their hands for they had only their spears and they must at once come hand to hand the knight was in the front and smote down first one and then another of the woodthieves the peasants shouted and pressing on drove the woodthieves before them until they came out on the flat top of the mountain and there they saw the two pigs quietly grubbing in the short grass so they ran about them in a circle and began to move back again towards the narrow path the old knight coming now the last of all and striking down thief after thief the peasants had got no very serious hurts among them for he had drawn the brunt of the battle upon himself as could well be seen from the bloody rents in his armour and when they came to the entrance of the narrow path he bade them drive the pigs down into the valley while he stood there to guard the way behind them so in a moment he was alone and being weak with loss of blood might have been ended there and then by the woodthieves he had beaten off had fear not made them begone out of sight in a great hurry  an hour passed and they did not return and now the knight could stand on guard no longer but had to lie down upon the grass a half hour more went by and then a young lad with what appeared to be a number of cocks feathers stuck round his hat came out of the path behind him and began to move about among the dead thieves cutting their heads off then he laid the heads in a heap before the knight and said o great knight i have been bid come and ask you for the crowns you promised for the heads five crowns a head they bid me tell you that they have prayed to god and his mother to give you a long life but that they are poor peasants and that they would have the money before you die they told me this over and over for fear i might forget it and promised to beat me if i did  the knight raised himself upon his elbow and opening a bag that hung to his belt counted out the five crowns for each head there were thirty heads in all  o great knight said the lad they have also bid me take all care of you and light a fire and put this ointment upon your wounds and he gathered sticks and leaves together and flashing his flint and steel under a mass of dry leaves had made a very good blaze then drawing of the coat of mail he began to anoint the wounds but he did it clumsily like one who does by rote what he had been told the knight motioned him to stop and said you seem a good lad  i would ask something of you for myself  there are still a few crowns said the knight shall i give them to you  o no said the lad they would be no good to me there is only one thing that i care about doing and i have no need of money to do it i go from village to village and from hill to hill and whenever i come across a good cock i steal him and take him into the woods and i keep him there under a basket until i get another good cock and then i set them to fight the people say i am an innocent and do not do me any harm and never ask me to do any work but go a message now and then it is because i am an innocent that they send me to get the crowns anyone else would steal them and they dare not come back themselves for now that you are not with them they are afraid of the woodthieves did you ever hear how when the woodthieves are christened the wolves are made their godfathers and their right arms are not christened at all  if you will not take these crowns my good lad i have nothing for you i fear unless you would have that old coat of mail which i shall soon need no more  there was something i wanted yes i remember now said the lad i want you to tell me why you fought like the champions and giants in the stories and for so little a thing are you indeed a man like us are you not rather an old wizard who lives among these hills and will not a wind arise presently and crumble you into dust  i will tell you of myself replied the knight for now that i am the last of the fellowship i may tell all and witness for god look at the rose of rubies on my helmet and see the symbol of my life and of my hope and then he told the lad this story but with always more frequent pauses and while he told it the rose shone a deep bloodcolour in the firelight and the lad stuck the cocks feathers in the earth in front of him and moved them about as though he made them actors in the play  i live in a land far from this and was one of the knights of st john said the old man but i was one of those in the order who always longed for more arduous labours in the service of the most high at last there came to us a knight of palestine to whom the truth of truths had been revealed by god himself he had seen a great rose of fire and a voice out of the rose had told him how men would turn from the light of their own hearts and bow down before outer order and outer fixity and that then the light would cease and none escape the curse except the foolish good man who could not and the passionate wicked man who would not think already the voice told him the wayward light of the heart was shining out upon the world to keep it alive with a less clear lustre and that as it paled a strange infection was touching the stars and the hills and the grass and the trees with corruption and that none of those who had seen clearly the truth and the ancient way could enter into the kingdom of god which is in the heart of the rose if they stayed on willingly in the corrupted world and so they must prove their anger against the powers of corruption by dying in the service of the rose of god while the knight of palestine was telling us these things we seemed to see in a vision a crimson rose spreading itself about him so that he seemed to speak out of its heart and the air was filled with fragrance by this we knew that it was the very voice of god which spoke to us by the knight and we gathered about him and bade him direct us in all things and teach us how to obey the voice so he bound us with an oath and gave us signs and words whereby we might know each other even after many years and he appointed places of meeting and he sent us out in troops into the world to seek good causes and die in doing battle for them at first we thought to die more readily by fasting to death in honour of some saint but this he told us was evil for we did it for the sake of death and thus took out of the hands of god the choice of the time and manner of our death and by so doing made his power the less we must choose our service for its excellence and for this alone and leave it to god to reward us at his own time and in his own manner and after this he compelled us to eat always two at a table to watch each other lest we fasted unduly for some among us said that if one fasted for a love of the holiness of saints and then died the death would be acceptable and the years passed and one by one my fellows died in the holy land or in warring upon the evil princes of the earth or in clearing the roads of robbers and among them died the knight of palestine and at last i was alone i fought in every cause where the few contended against the many and my hair grew white and a terrible fear lest i had fallen under the displeasure of god came upon me but hearing at last how this western isle was fuller of wars and rapine than any other land i came hither and i have found the thing i sought and behold i am filled with a great joy  thereat he began to sing in latin and while he sang his voice grew fainter and fainter then his eyes closed and his lips fell apart and the lad knew he was dead he has told me a good tale he said for there was fighting in it but i did not understand much of it and it is hard to remember so long a story  and taking the knights sword he began to dig a grave in the soft clay he dug hard and a faint light of dawn had touched his hair and he had almost done his work when a cock crowed in the valley below ah he said i must have that bird and he ran down the narrow path to the valley     the wisdom of the king   the highqueen of the island of woods had died in childbirth and her child was put to nurse with a woman who lived in a hut of mud and wicker within the border of the wood one night the woman sat rocking the cradle and pondering over the beauty of the child and praying that the gods might grant him wisdom equal to his beauty there came a knock at the door and she got up not a little wondering for the nearest neighbours were in the dun of the high king a mile away and the night was now late who is knocking she cried and a thin voice answered open for i am a crone of the grey hawk and i come from the darkness of the great wood in terror she drew back the bolt and a greyclad woman of a great age and of a height more than human came in and stood by the head of the cradle the nurse shrank back against the wall unable to take her eyes from the woman for she saw by the gleaming of the firelight that the feathers of the grey hawk were upon her head instead of hair but the child slept and the fire danced for the one was too ignorant and the other too full of gaiety to know what a dreadful being stood there open cried another voice for i am a crone of the grey hawk and i watch over his nest in the darkness of the great wood the nurse opened the door again though her fingers could scarce hold the bolts for trembling and another grey woman not less old than the other and with like feathers instead of hair came in and stood by the first in a little came a third grey woman and after her a fourth and then another and another and another until the hut was full of their immense bodies they stood a long time in perfect silence and stillness for they were of those whom the dropping of the sand has never troubled but at last one muttered in a low thin voice sisters i knew him far away by the redness of his heart under his silver skin and then another spoke sisters i knew him because his heart fluttered like a bird under a net of silver cords  and then another took up the word sisters i knew him because his heart sang like a bird that is happy in a silver cage and after that they sang together those who were nearest rocking the cradle with long wrinkled fingers and their voices were now tender and caressing now like the wind blowing in the great wood and this was their song       out of sight is out of mind      long have man and womankind      heavy of will and light of mood      taken away our wheaten food      taken away our altar stone      hail and rain and thunder alone      and red hearts we turn to grey      are true till time gutter away  when the song had died out the crone who had first spoken said we have nothing more to do but to mix a drop of our blood into his blood and she scratched her arm with the sharp point of a spindle which she had made the nurse bring to her and let a drop of blood grey as the mist fall upon the lips of the child and passed out into the darkness then the others passed out in silence one by one and all the while the child had not opened his pink eyelids or the fire ceased to dance for the one was too ignorant and the other too full of gaiety to know what great beings had bent over the cradle  when the crones were gone the nurse came to her courage again and hurried to the dun of the highking and cried out in the midst of the assembly hall that the sidhe whether for good or evil she knew not had bent over the child that night and the king and his poets and men of law and his huntsmen and his cooks and his chief warriors went with her to the hut and gathered about the cradle and were as noisy as magpies and the child sat up and looked at them  two years passed over and the king died fighting against the fer bolg and the poets and the men of law ruled in the name of the child but looked to see him become the master himself before long for no one had seen so wise a child and tales of his endless questions about the household of the gods and the making of the world went hither and thither among the wicker houses of the poor everything had been well but for a miracle that began to trouble all men and all women who indeed talked of it without ceasing the feathers of the grey hawk had begun to grow in the childs hair and though his nurse cut them continually in but a little while they would be more numerous than ever this had not been a matter of great moment for miracles were a little thing in those days but for an ancient law of eri that none who had any blemish of body could sit upon the throne and as a grey hawk was a wild thing of the air which had never sat at the board or listened to the songs of the poets in the light of the fire it was not possible to think of one in whose hair its feathers grew as other than marred and blasted nor could the people separate from their admiration of the wisdom that grew in him a horror as at one of unhuman blood yet all were resolved that he should reign for they had suffered much from foolish kings and their own disorders and moreover they desired to watch out the spectacle of his days and no one had any other fear but that his great wisdom might bid him obey the law and call some other who had but a common mind to reign in his stead  when the child was seven years old the poets and the men of law were called together by the chief poet and all these matters weighed and considered the child had already seen that those about him had hair only and though they had told him that they too had had feathers but had lost them because of a sin committed by their forefathers they knew that he would learn the truth when he began to wander into the country round about after much consideration they decreed a new law commanding every one upon pain of death to mingle artificially the feathers of the grey hawk into his hair and they sent men with nets and slings and bows into the countries round about to gather a sufficiency of feathers they decreed also that any who told the truth to the child should be flung from a cliff into the sea  the years passed and the child grew from childhood into boyhood and from boyhood into manhood and from being curious about all things he became busy with strange and subtle thoughts which came to him in dreams and with distinctions between things long held the same and with the resemblance of things long held different multitudes came from other lands to see him and to ask his counsel but there were guards set at the frontiers who compelled all that came to wear the feathers of the grey hawk in their hair while they listened to him his words seemed to make all darkness light and filled their hearts like music but alas when they returned to their own lands his words seemed far off and what they could remember too strange and subtle to help them to live out their hasty days a number indeed did live differently afterwards but their new life was less excellent than the old some among them had long served a good cause but when they heard him praise it and their labour they returned to their own lands to find what they had loved less lovable and their arm lighter in the battle for he had taught them how little a hair divides the false and true others again who had served no cause but wrought in peace the welfare of their own households when he had expounded the meaning of their purpose found their bones softer and their will less ready for toil for he had shown them greater purposes and numbers of the young when they had heard him upon all these things remembered certain words that became like a fire in their hearts and made all kindly joys and traffic between man and man as nothing and went different ways but all into vague regret  when any asked him concerning the common things of life disputes about the mear of a territory or about the straying of cattle or about the penalty of blood he would turn to those nearest him for advice but this was held to be from courtesy for none knew that these matters were hidden from him by thoughts and dreams that filled his mind like the marching and countermarching of armies far less could any know that his heart wandered lost amid throngs of overcoming thoughts and dreams shuddering at its own consuming solitude  among those who came to look at him and to listen to him was the daughter of a little king who lived a great way off and when he saw her he loved for she was beautiful with a strange and pale beauty unlike the women of his land but dana the great mother had decreed her a heart that was but as the heart of others and when she considered the mystery of the hawk feathers she was troubled with a great horror he called her to him when the assembly was over and told her of her beauty and praised her simply and frankly as though she were a fable of the bards and he asked her humbly to give him her love for he was only subtle in his dreams overwhelmed with his greatness she half consented and yet half refused for she longed to marry some warrior who could carry her over a mountain in his arms day by day the king gave her gifts cups with ears of gold and findrinny wrought by the craftsmen of distant lands cloth from over sea which though woven with curious figures seemed to her less beautiful than the bright cloth of her own country and still she was ever between a smile and a frown between yielding and withholding he laid down his wisdom at her feet and told how the heroes when they die return to the world and begin their labour anew how the kind and mirthful men of dea drove out the huge and gloomy and misshapen people from under the sea and a multitude of things that even the sidhe have forgotten either because they happened so long ago or because they have not time to think of them and still she half refused and still he hoped because he could not believe that a beauty so much like wisdom could hide a common heart  there was a tall young man in the dun who had yellow hair and was skilled in wrestling and in the training of horses and one day when the king walked in the orchard which was between the foss and the forest he heard his voice among the salley bushes which hid the waters of the foss my blossom it said i hate them for making you weave these dingy feathers into your beautiful hair and all that the bird of prey upon the throne may sleep easy o nights and then the low musical voice he loved answered my hair is not beautiful like yours and now that i have plucked the feathers out of your hair i will put my hands through it thus and thus and thus for it casts no shadow of terror and darkness upon my heart then the king remembered many things that he had forgotten without understanding them doubtful words of his poets and his men of law doubts that he had reasoned away his own continual solitude and he called to the lovers in a trembling voice they came from among the salley bushes and threw themselves at his feet and prayed for pardon and he stooped down and plucked the feathers out of the hair of the woman and then turned away towards the dun without a word he strode into the hall of assembly and having gathered his poets and his men of law about him stood upon the dais and spoke in a loud clear voice men of law why did you make me sin against the laws of eri men of verse why did you make me sin against the secrecy of wisdom for law was made by man for the welfare of man but wisdom the gods have made and no man shall live by its light for it and the hail and the rain and the thunder follow a way that is deadly to mortal things men of law and men of verse live according to your kind and call eocha of the hasty mind to reign over you for i set out to find my kindred he then came down among them and drew out of the hair of first one and then another the feathers of the grey hawk and having scattered them over the rushes upon the floor passed out and none dared to follow him for his eyes gleamed like the eyes of the birds of prey and no man saw him again or heard his voice some believed that he found his eternal abode among the demons and some that he dwelt henceforth with the dark and dreadful goddesses who sit all night about the pools in the forest watching the constellations rising and setting in those desolate mirrors     the heart of the spring   a very old man whose face was almost as fleshless as the foot of a bird sat meditating upon the rocky shore of the flat and hazel covered isle which fills the widest part of the lough gill a russet faced boy of seventeen years sat by his side watching the swallows dipping for flies in the still water the old man was dressed in threadbare blue velvet and the boy wore a frieze coat and a blue cap and had about his neck a rosary of blue beads behind the two and half hidden by trees was a little monastery it had been burned down a long while before by sacrilegious men of the queens party but had been roofed anew with rushes by the boy that the old man might find shelter in his last days he had not set his spade however into the garden about it and the lilies and the roses of the monks had spread out until their confused luxuriancy met and mingled with the narrowing circle of the fern beyond the lilies and the roses the ferns were so deep that a child walking among them would be hidden from sight even though he stood upon his toes and beyond the fern rose many hazels and small oak trees  master said the boy this long fasting and the labour of beckoning after nightfall with your rod of quicken wood to the beings who dwell in the waters and among the hazels and oaktrees is too much for your strength rest from all this labour for a little for your hand seemed more heavy upon my shoulder and your feet less steady under you today than i have known them men say that you are older than the eagles and yet you will not seek the rest that belongs to age he spoke in an eager impulsive way as though his heart were in the words and thoughts of the moment and the old man answered slowly and deliberately as though his heart were in distant days and distant deeds  i will tell you why i have not been able to rest he said it is right that you should know for you have served me faithfully these five years and more and even with affection taking away thereby a little of the doom of loneliness which always falls upon the wise now too that the end of my labour and the triumph of my hopes is at hand it is the more needful for you to have this knowledge  master do not think that i would question you it is for me to keep the fire alight and the thatch close against the rain and strong lest the wind blow it among the trees and it is for me to take the heavy books from the shelves and to lift from its corner the great painted roll with the names of the sidhe and to possess the while an incurious and reverent heart for right well i know that god has made out of his abundance a separate wisdom for everything which lives and to do these things is my wisdom  you are afraid said the old man and his eyes shone with a momentary anger  sometimes at night said the boy when you are reading with the rod of quicken wood in your hand i look out of the door and see now a great grey man driving swine among the hazels and now many little people in red caps who come out of the lake driving little white cows before them i do not fear these little people so much as the grey man for when they come near the house they milk the cows and they drink the frothing milk and begin to dance and i know there is good in the heart that loves dancing but i fear them for all that and i fear the tall whitearmed ladies who come out of the air and move slowly hither and thither crowning themselves with the roses or with the lilies and shaking about their living hair which moves for so i have heard them tell each other with the motion of their thoughts now spreading out and now gathering close to their heads they have mild beautiful faces but aengus son of forbis i fear all these beings i fear the people of sidhe and i fear the art which draws them about us  why said the old man do you fear the ancient gods who made the spears of your fathers fathers to be stout in battle and the little people who came at night from the depth of the lakes and sang among the crickets upon their hearths and in our evil day they still watch over the loveliness of the earth but i must tell you why i have fasted and laboured when others would sink into the sleep of age for without your help once more i shall have fasted and laboured to no good end when you have done for me this last thing you may go and build your cottage and till your fields and take some girl to wife and forget the ancient gods i have saved all the gold and silver pieces that were given to me by earls and knights and squires for keeping them from the evil eye and from the loveweaving enchantments of witches and by earls and knights and squires ladies for keeping the people of the sidhe from making the udders of their cattle fall dry and taking the butter from their churns i have saved it all for the day when my work should be at an end and now that the end is at hand you shall not lack for gold and silver pieces enough to make strong the rooftree of your cottage and to keep cellar and larder full i have sought through all my life to find the secret of life i was not happy in my youth for i knew that it would pass and i was not happy in my manhood for i knew that age was coming and so i gave myself in youth and manhood and age to the search for the great secret i longed for a life whose abundance would fill centuries i scorned the life of fourscore winters i would benay i will belike the ancient gods of the land i read in my youth in a hebrew manuscript i found in a spanish monastery that there is a moment after the sun has entered the ram and before he has passed the lion which trembles with the song of the immortal powers and that whosoever finds this moment and listens to the song shall become like the immortal powers themselves i came back to ireland and asked the fairy men and the cowdoctors if they knew when this moment was but though all had heard of it there was none could find the moment upon the hourglass so i gave myself to magic and spent my life in fasting and in labour that i might bring the gods and the fairies to my side and now at last one of the fairies has told me that the moment is at hand one who wore a red cap and whose lips were white with the froth of the new milk whispered it into my ear tomorrow a little before the close of the first hour after dawn i shall find the moment and then i will go away to a southern land and build myself a palace of white marble amid orange trees and gather the brave and the beautiful about me and enter into the eternal kingdom of my youth but that i may hear the whole song i was told by the little fellow with the froth of the new milk on his lips that you must bring great masses of green boughs and pile them about the door and the window of my room and you must put fresh green rushes upon the floor and cover the table and the rushes with the roses and the lilies of the monks you must do this tonight and in the morning at the end of the first hour after dawn you must come and find me  will you be quite young then said the boy  i will be as young then as you are but now i am still old and tired and you must help me to my chair and to my books  when the boy had left aengus son of forbis in his room and had lighted the lamp which by some contrivance of the wizards gave forth a sweet odour as of strange flowers he went into the wood and began cutting green boughs from the hazels and great bundles of rushes from the western border of the isle where the small rocks gave place to gently sloping sand and clay it was nightfall before he had cut enough for his purpose and wellnigh midnight before he had carried the last bundle to its place and gone back for the roses and the lilies it was one of those warm beautiful nights when everything seems carved of precious stones sleuth wood away to the south looked as though cut out of green beryl and the waters that mirrored them shone like pale opal the roses he was gathering were like glowing rubies and the lilies had the dull lustre of pearl everything had taken upon itself the look of something imperishable except a glowworm whose faint flame burnt on steadily among the shadows moving slowly hither and thither the only thing that seemed alive the only thing that seemed perishable as mortal hope the boy gathered a great armful of roses and lilies and thrusting the glow worm among their pearl and ruby carried them into the room where the old man sat in a halfslumber he laid armful after armful upon the floor and above the table and then gently closing the door threw himself upon his bed of rushes to dream of a peaceful manhood with his chosen wife at his side and the laughter of children in his ears at dawn he rose and went down to the edge of the lake taking the hourglass with him he put some bread and a flask of wine in the boat that his master might not lack food at the outset of his journey and then sat down to wait until the hour from dawn had gone by gradually the birds began to sing and when the last grains of sand were falling everything suddenly seemed to overflow with their music it was the most beautiful and living moment of the year one could listen to the springs heart beating in it he got up and went to find his master the green boughs filled the door and he had to make a way through them when he entered the room the sunlight was falling in flickering circles on floor and walls and table and everything was full of soft green shadows but the old man sat clasping a mass of roses and lilies in his arms and with his head sunk upon his breast on the table at his left hand was a leathern wallet full of gold and silver pieces as for a journey and at his right hand was a long staff the boy touched him and he did not move he lifted the hands but they were quite cold and they fell heavily  it were better for him said the lad to have told his beads and said his prayers like another and not to have spent his days in seeking amongst the immortal powers what he could have found in his own deeds and days had he willed ah yes it were better to have said his prayers and kissed his beads he looked at the threadbare blue velvet and he saw it was covered with the pollen of the flowers and while he was looking at it a thrush who had alighted among the boughs that were piled against the window began to sing     the curse of the fires and of the shadows   one summer night when there was peace a score of puritan troopers under the pious sir frederick hamilton broke through the door of the abbey of the white friars which stood over the gara lough at sligo as the door fell with a crash they saw a little knot of friars gathered about the altar their white habits glimmering in the steady light of the holy candles all the monks were kneeling except the abbot who stood upon the altar steps with a great brazen crucifix in his hand shoot them cried sir frederick hamilton but none stirred for all were new converts and feared the crucifix and the holy candles the white lights from the altar threw the shadows of the troopers up on to roof and wall as the troopers moved about the shadows began a fantastic dance among the corbels and the memorial tablets for a little while all was silent and then five troopers who were the bodyguard of sir frederick hamilton lifted their muskets and shot down five of the friars the noise and the smoke drove away the mystery of the pale altar lights and the other troopers took courage and began to strike in a moment the friars lay about the altar steps their white habits stained with blood set fire to the house cried sir frederick hamilton and at his word one went out and came in again carrying a heap of dry straw and piled it against the western wall and having done this fell back for the fear of the crucifix and of the holy candles was still in his heart seeing this the five troopers who were sir frederick hamiltons bodyguard darted forward and taking each a holy candle set the straw in a blaze the red tongues of fire rushed up and flickered from corbel to corbel and from tablet to tablet and crept along the floor setting in a blaze the seats and benches the dance of the shadows passed away and the dance of the fires began the troopers fell back towards the door in the southern wall and watched those yellow dancers springing hither and thither  for a time the altar stood safe and apart in the midst of its white light the eyes of the troopers turned upon it the abbot whom they had thought dead had risen to his feet and now stood before it with the crucifix lifted in both hands high above his head suddenly he cried with a loud voice woe unto all who smite those who dwell within the light of the lord for they shall wander among the ungovernable shadows and follow the ungovernable fires and having so cried he fell on his face dead and the brazen crucifix rolled down the steps of the altar the smoke had now grown very thick so that it drove the troopers out into the open air before them were burning houses behind them shone the painted windows of the abbey filled with saints and martyrs awakened as from a sacred trance into an angry and animated life the eyes of the troopers were dazzled and for a while could see nothing but the flaming faces of saints and martyrs presently however they saw a man covered with dust who came running towards them two messengers he cried have been sent by the defeated irish to raise against you the whole country about manor hamilton and if you do not stop them you will be overpowered in the woods before you reach home again they ride northeast between ben bulben and cashelnagael  sir frederick hamilton called to him the five troopers who had first fired upon the monks and said mount quickly and ride through the woods towards the mountain and get before these men and kill them  in a moment the troopers were gone and before many moments they had splashed across the river at what is now called buckleys ford and plunged into the woods they followed a beaten track that wound along the northern bank of the river the boughs of the birch and quicken trees mingled above and hid the cloudy moonlight leaving the pathway in almost complete darkness they rode at a rapid trot now chatting together now watching some stray weasel or rabbit scuttling away in the darkness gradually as the gloom and silence of the woods oppressed them they drew closer together and began to talk rapidly they were old comrades and knew each others lives one was married and told how glad his wife would be to see him return safe from this harebrained expedition against the white friars and to hear how fortune had made amends for rashness the oldest of the five whose wife was dead spoke of a flagon of wine which awaited him upon an upper shelf while a third who was the youngest had a sweetheart watching for his return and he rode a little way before the others not talking at all suddenly the young man stopped and they saw that his horse was trembling i saw something he said and yet i do not know but it may have been one of the shadows it looked like a great worm with a silver crown upon his head one of the five put his hand up to his forehead as if about to cross himself but remembering that he had changed his religion he put it down and said i am certain it was but a shadow for there are a great many about us and of very strange kinds then they rode on in silence it had been raining in the earlier part of the day and the drops fell from the branches wetting their hair and their shoulders in a little they began to talk again they had been in many battles against many a rebel together and now told each other over again the story of their wounds and so awakened in their hearts the strongest of all fellowships the fellowship of the sword and half forgot the terrible solitude of the woods  suddenly the first two horses neighed and then stood still and would go no further before them was a glint of water and they knew by the rushing sound that it was a river they dismounted and after much tugging and coaxing brought the horses to the riverside in the midst of the water stood a tall old woman with grey hair flowing over a grey dress she stood up to her knees in the water and stooped from time to time as though washing presently they could see that she was washing something that half floated the moon cast a flickering light upon it and they saw that it was the dead body of a man and while they were looking at it an eddy of the river turned the face towards them and each of the five troopers recognised at the same moment his own face while they stood dumb and motionless with horror the woman began to speak saying slowly and loudly did you see my son he has a crown of silver on his head and there are rubies in the crown then the oldest of the troopers he who had been most often wounded drew his sword and cried i have fought for the truth of my god and need not fear the shadows of satan and with that rushed into the water in a moment he returned the woman had vanished and though he had thrust his sword into air and water he had found nothing  the five troopers remounted and set their horses at the ford but all to no purpose they tried again and again and went plunging hither and thither the horses foaming and rearing let us said the old trooper ride back a little into the wood and strike the river higher up they rode in under the boughs the groundivy crackling under the hoofs and the branches striking against their steel caps after about twenty minutes riding they came out again upon the river and after another ten minutes found a place where it was possible to cross without sinking below the stirrups the wood upon the other side was very thin and broke the moonlight into long streams the wind had arisen and had begun to drive the clouds rapidly across the face of the moon so that thin streams of light seemed to be dancing a grotesque dance among the scattered bushes and small firtrees the tops of the trees began also to moan and the sound of it was like the voice of the dead in the wind and the troopers remembered the belief that tells how the dead in purgatory are spitted upon the points of the trees and upon the points of the rocks they turned a little to the south in the hope that they might strike the beaten path again but they could find no trace of it  meanwhile the moaning grew louder and louder and the dance of the white moonfires more and more rapid gradually they began to be aware of a sound of distant music it was the sound of a bagpipe and they rode towards it with great joy it came from the bottom of a deep cuplike hollow in the midst of the hollow was an old man with a red cap and withered face he sat beside a fire of sticks and had a burning torch thrust into the earth at his feet and played an old bagpipe furiously his red hair dripped over his face like the iron rust upon a rock did you see my wife he cried looking up a moment she was washing she was washing i am afraid of him said the young trooper i fear he is one of the sidhe no said the old trooper he is a man for i can see the sunfreckles upon his face we will compel him to be our guide and at that he drew his sword and the others did the same they stood in a ring round the piper and pointed their swords at him and the old trooper then told him that they must kill two rebels who had taken the road between ben bulben and the great mountain spur that is called cashel nagael and that he must get up before one of them and be their guide for they had lost their way the piper turned and pointed to a neighbouring tree and they saw an old white horse ready bitted bridled and saddled he slung the pipe across his back and taking the torch in his hand got upon the horse and started off before them as hard as he could go  the wood grew thinner and thinner and the ground began to slope up toward the mountain the moon had already set and the little white flames of the stars had come out everywhere the ground sloped more and more until at last they rode far above the woods upon the wide top of the mountain the woods lay spread out mile after mile below and away to the south shot up the red glare of the burning town but before and above them were the little white flames the guide drew rein suddenly and pointing upwards with the hand that did not hold the torch shrieked out look look at the holy candles and then plunged forward at a gallop waving the torch hither and thither do you hear the hoofs of the messengers cried the guide quick quick or they will be gone out of your hands and he laughed as with delight of the chase the troopers thought they could hear far off and as if below them rattle of hoofs but now the ground began to slope more and more and the speed grew more headlong moment by moment they tried to pull up but in vain for the horses seemed to have gone mad the guide had thrown the reins on to the neck of the old white horse and was waving his arms and singing a wild gaelic song suddenly they saw the thin gleam of a river at an immense distance below and knew that they were upon the brink of the abyss that is now called lugnagael or in english the strangers leap the six horses sprang forward and five screams went up into the air a moment later five men and horses fell with a dull crash upon the green slopes at the foot of the rocks     the old men of the twilight   at the place close to the dead mans point at the rosses where the disused pilothouse looks out to sea through two round windows like eyes a mud cottage stood in the last century it also was a watchhouse for a certain old michael bruen who had been a smuggler in his day and was still the father and grandfather of smugglers lived there and when after nightfall a tall schooner crept over the bay from roughley it was his business to hang a horn lanthorn in the southern window that the news might travel to dorrens island and from thence by another horn lanthorn to the village of the rosses but for this glimmering of messages he had little communion with mankind for he was very old and had no thought for anything but for the making of his soul at the foot of the spanish crucifix of carved oak that hung by his chimney or bent double over the rosary of stone beads brought to him a cargo of silks and laces out of france one night he had watched hour after hour because a gentle and favourable wind was blowing and la mere de misericorde was much overdue and he was about to lie down upon his heap of straw seeing that the dawn was whitening the east and that the schooner would not dare to round roughley and come to an anchor after daybreak when he saw a long line of herons flying slowly from dorrens island and towards the pools which lie half choked with reeds behind what is called the second rosses he had never before seen herons flying over the sea for they are shorekeeping birds and partly because this had startled him out of his drowsiness and more because the long delay of the schooner kept his cupboard empty he took down his rusty shotgun of which the barrel was tied on with a piece of string and followed them towards the pools  when he came close enough to hear the sighing of the rushes in the outermost pool the morning was grey over the world so that the tall rushes the still waters the vague clouds the thin mists lying among the sandheaps seemed carved out of an enormous pearl in a little he came upon the herons of whom there were a great number standing with lifted legs in the shallow water and crouching down behind a bank of rushes looked to the priming of his gun and bent for a moment over his rosary to murmur patron patrick let me shoot a heron made into a pie it will support me for nearly four days for i no longer eat as in my youth if you keep me from missing i will say a rosary to you every night until the pie is eaten then he lay down and resting his gun upon a large stone turned towards a heron which stood upon a bank of smooth grass over a little stream that flowed into the pool for he feared to take the rheumatism by wading as he would have to do if he shot one of those which stood in the water but when he looked along the barrel the heron was gone and to his wonder and terror a man of infinitely great age and infirmity stood in its place he lowered the gun and the heron stood there with bent head and motionless feathers as though it had slept from the beginning of the world he raised the gun and no sooner did he look along the iron than that enemy of all enchantment brought the old man again before him only to vanish when he lowered the gun for the second time he laid the gun down and crossed himself three times and said a paternoster and an ave maria and muttered half aloud some enemy of god and of my patron is standing upon the smooth place and fishing in the blessed water and then aimed very carefully and slowly he fired and when the smoke had gone saw an old man huddled upon the grass and a long line of herons flying with clamour towards the sea he went round a bend of the pool and coming to the little stream looked down on a figure wrapped in faded clothes of black and green of an ancient pattern and spotted with blood he shook his head at the sight of so great a wickedness suddenly the clothes moved and an arm was stretched upwards towards the rosary which hung about his neck and long wasted fingers almost touched the cross he started back crying wizard i will let no wicked thing touch my blessed beads and the sense of a the old great danger just escaped made him tremble  if you listen to me replied a voice so faint that it was like a sigh you will know that i am not a wizard and you will let me kiss the cross before i die  i will listen to you he answered but i will not let you touch my blessed beads and sitting on the grass a little way from the dying man he reloaded his gun and laid it across his knees and composed himself to listen  i know not how many generations ago we who are now herons were the men of learning of the king leaghaire we neither hunted nor went to battle nor listened to the druids preaching and even love if it came to us at all was but a passing fire the druids and the poets told us many and many a time of a new druid patrick and most among them were fierce against him while a few thought his doctrine merely the doctrine of the gods set out in new symbols and were for giving him welcome but we yawned in the midst of their tale at last they came crying that he was coming to the kings house and fell to their dispute but we would listen to neither party for we were busy with a dispute about the merits of the great and of the little metre nor were we disturbed when they passed our door with sticks of enchantment under their arms travelling towards the forest to contend against his coming nor when they returned after nightfall with torn robes and despairing cries for the click of our knives writing our thoughts in ogham filled us with peace and our dispute filled us with joy nor even when in the morning crowds passed us to hear the strange druid preaching the commandments of his god the crowds passed and one who had laid down his knife to yawn and stretch himself heard a voice speaking far off and knew that the druid patrick was preaching within the kings house but our hearts were deaf and we carved and disputed and read and laughed a thin laughter together in a little we heard many feet coming towards the house and presently two tall figures stood in the door the one in white the other in a crimson robe like a great lily and a heavy poppy and we knew the druid patrick and our king leaghaire we laid down the slender knives and bowed before the king but when the black and green robes had ceased to rustle it was not the loud rough voice of king leaghaire that spoke to us but a strange voice in which there was a rapture as of one speaking from behind a battlement of druid flame i preached the commandments of the maker of the world it said within the kings house and from the centre of the earth to the windows of heaven there was a great silence so that the eagle floated with unmoving wings in the white air and the fish with unmoving fins in the dim water while the linnets and the wrens and the sparrows stilled there evertrembling tongues in the heavy boughs and the clouds were like white marble and the rivers became their motionless mirrors and the shrimps in the faroff seapools were still enduring eternity in patience although it was hard and as he named these things it was like a king numbering his people but your slender knives went click click upon the oaken staves and all else being silent the sound shook the angels with anger o little roots nipped by the winter who do not awake although the summer pass above you with innumerable feet o men who have no part in love who have no part in song who have no part in wisdom but dwell with the shadows of memory where the feet of angels cannot touch you as they pass over your heads where the hair of demons cannot sweep about you as they pass under your feet i lay upon you a curse and change you to an example for ever and ever you shall become grey herons and stand pondering in grey pools and flit over the world in that hour when it is most full of sighs having forgotten the flame of the stars and not yet found the flame of the sun and you shall preach to the other herons until they also are like you and are an example for ever and ever and your deaths shall come to you by chance and unforeseen that no fire of certainty may visit your hearts  the voice of the old man of learning became still but the voteen bent over his gun with his eyes upon the ground trying in vain to understand something of this tale and he had so bent it may be for a long time had not a tug at his rosary made him start out of his dream the old man of learning had crawled along the grass and was now trying to draw the cross down low enough for his lips to reach it  you must not touch my blessed beads cried the voteen and struck the long withered fingers with the barrel of his gun he need not have trembled for the old man fell back upon the grass with a sigh and was still he bent down and began to consider the black and green clothes for his fear had begun to pass away when he came to understand that he had something the man of learning wanted and pleaded for and now that the blessed beads were safe his fear had nearly all gone and surely he thought if that big cloak and that little tightfitting cloak under it were warm and without holes saint patrick would take the enchantment out of them and leave them fit for human use but the black and green clothes fell away wherever his fingers touched them and while this was a new wonder a slight wind blew over the pool and crumbled the old man of learning and all his ancient gear into a little heap of dust and then made the little heap less and less until there was nothing but the smooth green grass     where there is nothing there is god   the little wicker houses at tullagh where the brothers were accustomed to pray or bend over many handicrafts when twilight had driven them from the fields were empty for the hardness of the winter had brought the brotherhood together in the little wooden house under the shadow of the wooden chapel and abbot malathgeneus brother dove brother bald fox brother peter brother patrick brother bittern brother fairbrows and many too young to have won names in the great battle sat about the fire with ruddy faces one mending lines to lay in the river for eels one fashioning a snare for birds one mending the broken handle of a spade one writing in a large book and one shaping a jewelled box to hold the book and among the rushes at their feet lay the scholars who would one day be brothers and whose schoolhouse it was and for the succour of whose tender years the great fire was supposed to leap and flicker one of these a child of eight or nine years called olioll lay upon his back looking up through the hole in the roof through which the smoke went and watching the stars appearing and disappearing in the smoke with mild eyes like the eyes of a beast of the field he turned presently to the brother who wrote in the big book and whose duty was to teach the children and said brother dove to what are the stars fastened the brother rejoicing to see so much curiosity in the stupidest of his scholars laid down the pen and said there are nine crystalline spheres and on the first the moon is fastened on the second the planet mercury on the third the planet venus on the fourth the sun on the fifth the planet mars on the sixth the planet jupiter on the seventh the planet saturn these are the wandering stars and on the eighth are fastened the fixed stars but the ninth sphere is a sphere of the substance on which the breath of god moved in the beginning  what is beyond that said the child there is nothing beyond that there is god  and then the childs eyes strayed to the jewelled box where one great ruby was gleaming in the light of the fire and he said why has brother peter put a great ruby on the side of the box  the ruby is a symbol of the love of god  why is the ruby a symbol of the love of god  because it is red like fire and fire burns up everything and where there is nothing there is god  the child sank into silence but presently sat up and said there is somebody outside  no replied the brother it is only the wolves i have heard them moving about in the snow for some time they are growing very wild now that the winter drives them from the mountains they broke into a fold last night and carried off many sheep and if we are not careful they will devour everything  no it is the footstep of a man for it is heavy but i can hear the footsteps of the wolves also  he had no sooner done speaking than somebody rapped three times but with no great loudness  i will go and open for he must be very cold  do not open for it may be a manwolf and he may devour us all  but the boy had already drawn back the heavy wooden bolt and all the faces most of them a little pale turned towards the slowlyopening door  he has beads and a cross he cannot be a manwolf said the child as a man with the snow heavy on his long ragged beard and on the matted hair that fell over his shoulders and nearly to his waist and dropping from the tattered cloak that but halfcovered his withered brown body came in and looked from face to face with mild ecstatic eyes standing some way from the fire and with eyes that had rested at last upon the abbot malathgeneus he cried out o blessed abbot let me come to the fire and warm myself and dry the snow from my beard and my hair and my cloak that i may not die of the cold of the mountains and anger the lord with a wilful martyrdom  come to the fire said the abbot and warm yourself and eat the food the boy olioll will bring you it is sad indeed that any for whom christ has died should be as poor as you  the man sat over the fire and olioll took away his now dripping cloak and laid meat and bread and wine before him but he would eat only of the bread and he put away the wine asking for water when his beard and hair had begun to dry a little and his limbs had ceased to shiver with the cold he spoke again  o blessed abbot have pity on the poor have pity on a beggar who has trodden the bare world this many a year and give me some labour to do the hardest there is for i am the poorest of gods poor  then the brothers discussed together what work they could put him to and at first to little purpose for there was no labour that had not found its labourer in that busy community but at last one remembered that brother bald fox whose business it was to turn the great quern in the quernhouse for he was too stupid for anything else was getting old for so heavy a labour and so the beggar was put to the quern from the morrow  the cold passed away and the spring grew to summer and the quern was never idle nor was it turned with grudging labour for when any passed the beggar was heard singing as he drove the handle round the last gloom too had passed from that happy community for olioll who had always been stupid and unteachable grew clever and this was the more miraculous because it had come of a sudden one day he had been even duller than usual and was beaten and told to know his lesson better on the morrow or be sent into a lower class among little boys who would make a joke of him he had gone out in tears and when he came the next day although his stupidity born of a mind that would listen to every wandering sound and brood upon every wandering light had so long been the byword of the school he knew his lesson so well that he passed to the head of the class and from that day was the best of scholars at first brother dove thought this was an answer to his own prayers to the virgin and took it for a great proof of the love she bore him but when many far more fervid prayers had failed to add a single wheatsheaf to the harvest he began to think that the child was trafficking with bards or druids or witches and resolved to follow and watch he had told his thought to the abbot who bid him come to him the moment he hit the truth and the next day which was a sunday he stood in the path when the abbot and the brothers were coming from vespers with their white habits upon them and took the abbot by the habit and said the beggar is of the greatest of saints and of the workers of miracle i followed olioll but now and by his slow steps and his bent head i saw that the weariness of his stupidity was over him and when he came to the little wood by the quernhouse i knew by the path broken in the underwood and by the footmarks in the muddy places that he had gone that way many times i hid behind a bush where the path doubled upon itself at a sloping place and understood by the tears in his eyes that his stupidity was too old and his wisdom too new to save him from terror of the rod when he was in the quernhouse i went to the window and looked in and the birds came down and perched upon my head and my shoulders for they are not timid in that holy place and a wolf passed by his right side shaking my habit his left the leaves of a bush olioll opened his book and turned to the page i had told him to learn and began to cry and the beggar sat beside him and comforted him until he fell asleep when his sleep was of the deepest the beggar knelt down and prayed aloud and said o thou who dwellest beyond the stars show forth thy power as at the beginning and let knowledge sent from thee awaken in his mind wherein is nothing from the world that the nine orders of angels may glorify thy name and then a light broke out of the air and wrapped aodh and i smelt the breath of roses i stirred a little in my wonder and the beggar turned and saw me and bending low said o brother dove if i have done wrong forgive me and i will do penance it was my pity moved me but i was afraid and i ran away and did not stop running until i came here then all the brothers began talking together one saying it was such and such a saint and one that it was not he but another and one that it was none of these for they were still in their brotherhoods but that it was such and such a one and the talk was as near to quarreling as might be in that gentle community for each would claim so great a saint for his native province at last the abbot said he is none that you have named for at easter i had greeting from all and each was in his brotherhood but he is aengus the lover of god and the first of those who have gone to live in the wild places and among the wild beasts ten years ago he felt the burden of many labours in a brotherhood under the hill of patrick and went into the forest that he might labour only with song to the lord but the fame of his holiness brought many thousands to his cell so that a little pride clung to a soul from which all else had been driven nine years ago he dressed himself in rags and from that day none has seen him unless indeed it be true that he has been seen living among the wolves on the mountains and eating the grass of the fields let us go to him and bow down before him for at last after long seeking he has found the nothing that is god and bid him lead us in the pathway he has trodden  they passed in their white habits along the beaten path in the wood the acolytes swinging their censers before them and the abbot with his crozier studded with precious stones in the midst of the incense and came before the quernhouse and knelt down and began to pray awaiting the moment when the child would wake and the saint cease from his watch and come to look at the sun going down into the unknown darkness as his way was     of costello the proud of oona the daughter of dermott and of the bitter tongue   costello had come up from the fields and lay upon the ground before the door of his square tower resting his head upon his hands and looking at the sunset and considering the chances of the weather though the customs of elizabeth and james now going out of fashion in england had begun to prevail among the gentry he still wore the great cloak of the native irish and the sensitive outlines of his face and the greatness of his indolent body had a commingling of pride and strength which belonged to a simpler age his eyes wandered from the sunset to where the long white road lost itself over the southwestern horizon and to a horseman who toiled slowly up the hill a few more minutes and the horseman was near enough for his little and shapeless body his long irish cloak and the dilapidated bagpipes hanging from his shoulders and the roughhaired garron under him to be seen distinctly in the grey dusk so soon as he had come within earshot he began crying is it sleeping you are tumaus costello when better men break their hearts on the great white roads get up out of that proud tumaus for i have news get up out of that you great omadhaun shake yourself out of the earth you great weed of a man  costello had risen to his feet and as the piper came up to him seized him by the neck of his jacket and lifting him out of his saddle threw him on to the ground  let me alone let me alone said the other but costello still shook him  i have news from dermotts daughter winny the great fingers were loosened and the piper rose gasping  why did you not tell me said costello that you came from her you might have railed your fill  i have come from her but i will not speak unless i am paid for my shaking  costello fumbled at the bag in which he carried his money and it was some time before it would open for the hand that had overcome many men shook with fear and hope here is all the money in my bag he said dropping a stream of french and spanish money into the hand of the piper who bit the coins before he would answer  that is right that is a fair price but i will not speak till i have good protection for if the dermotts lay their hands upon me in any boreen after sundown or in coolavin by day i will be left to rot among the nettles of a ditch or hung on the great sycamore where they hung the horsethieves last beltaine four years and while he spoke he tied the reins of his garron to a bar of rusty iron that was mortared into the wall  i will make you my piper and my bodyservant said costello and no man dare lay hands upon the man or the goat or the horse or the dog that is tumaus costellos  and i will only tell my message said the other flinging the saddle on the ground in the corner of the chimney with a noggin in my hand and a jug of the brew of the little pot beside me for though i am ragged and empty my forbears were well clothed and full until their house was burnt and their cattle harried seven centuries ago by the dillons whom i shall yet see on the hob of hell and they screeching and while he spoke the little eyes gleamed and the thin hands clenched  costello led him into the great rushstrewn hall where were none of the comforts which had begun to grow common among the gentry but a feudal gauntness and bareness and pointed to the bench in the great chimney and when he had sat down filled up a horn noggin and set it on the bench beside him and set a great black jack of leather beside the noggin and lit a torch that slanted out from a ring in the wall his hands trembling the while and then turned towards him and said will dermotts daughter come to me duallach son of daly  dermotts daughter will not come to you for her father has set women to watch her but she bid me tell you that this day sennight will be the eve of st john and the night of her betrothal to namara of the lake and she would have you there that when they bid her drink to him she loves best as the way is she may drink to you tumaus costello and let all know where her heart is and how little of gladness is in her marriage and i myself bid you go with good men about you for i saw the horsethieves with my own eyes and they dancing the blue pigeon in the air and then he held the now empty noggin towards costello his hand closing round it like the claw of a bird and cried fill my noggin again for i would the day had come when all the water in the world is to shrink into a periwinkleshell that i might drink nothing but poteen  finding that costello made no reply but sat in a dream he burst out fill my noggin i tell you for no costello is so great in the world that he should not wait upon a daly even though the daly travel the road with his pipes and the costello have a bare hill an empty house a horse a herd of goats and a handful of cows praise the dalys if you will said costello as he filled the noggin for you have brought me a kind word from my love  for the next few days duallach went hither and thither trying to raise a bodyguard and every man he met had some story of costello how he killed the wrestler when but a boy by so straining at the belt that went about them both that he broke the big wrestlers back how when somewhat older he dragged fierce horses through a ford in the unchion for a wager how when he came to manhood he broke the steel horseshoe in mayo how he drove many men before him through rushy meadow at drumanair because of a malevolent song they had about his poverty and of many another deed of his strength and pride but he could find none who would trust themselves with any so passionate and poor in a quarrel with careful and wealthy persons like dermott of the sheep and namara of the lake  then costello went out himself and after listening to many excuses and in many places brought in a big halfwitted fellow who followed him like a dog a farmlabourer who worshipped him for his strength a fat farmer whose forefathers had served his family and a couple of lads who looked after his goats and cows and marshalled them before the fire in the empty hall they had brought with them their stout cudgels and costello gave them an old pistol apiece and kept them all night drinking spanish ale and shooting at a white turnip which he pinned against the wall with a skewer duallach of the pipes sat on the bench in the chimney playing the green bunch of rushes the unchion stream and the princes of breffeny on his old pipes and railing now at the appearance of the shooters now at their clumsy shooting and now at costello because he had no better servants the labourer the halfwitted fellow the farmer and the lads were all well accustomed to duallachs railing for it was as inseparable from wake or wedding as the squealing of his pipes but they wondered at the forbearance of costello who seldom came either to wake or wedding and if he had would scarce have been patient with a scolding piper  on the next evening they set out for coolavin costello riding a tolerable horse and carrying a sword the others upon roughhaired garrons and with their stout cudgels under their arms as they rode over the bogs and in the boreens among the hills they could see fire answering fire from hill to hill from horizon to horizon and everywhere groups who danced in the red light on the turf celebrating the bridal of life and fire when they came to dermotts house they saw before the door an unusually large group of the very poor dancing about a fire in the midst of which was a blazing cartwheel that circular dance which is so ancient that the gods long dwindled to be but fairies dance no other in their secret places from the door and through the long loopholes on either side came the pale light of candles and the sound of many feet dancing a dance of elizabeth and james  they tied their horses to bushes for the number so tied already showed that the stables were full and shoved their way through a crowd of peasants who stood about the door and went into the great hall where the dance was the labourer the halfwitted fellow the farmer and the two lads mixed with a group of servants who were looking on from an alcove and duallach sat with the pipers on their bench but costello made his way through the dancers to where dermott of the sheep stood with namara of the lake pouring poteen out of a porcelain jug into horn noggins with silver rims  tumaus costello said the old man you have done a good deed to forget what has been and to fling away enmity and come to the betrothal of my daughter to namara of the lake  i come answered costello because when in the time of costello de angalo my forbears overcame your forbears and afterwards made peace a compact was made that a costello might go with his bodyservants and his piper to every feast given by a dermott for ever and a dermott with his bodyservants and his piper to every feast given by a costello for ever  if you come with evil thoughts and armed men said the son of dermott flushing no matter how strong your hands to wrestle and to swing the sword it shall go badly with you for some of my wifes clan have come out of mayo and my three brothers and their servants have come down from the ox mountains and while he spoke he kept his hand inside his coat as though upon the handle of a weapon  no answered costello i but come to dance a farewell dance with your daughter  dermott drew his hand out of his coat and went over to a tall pale girl who was now standing but a little way off with her mild eyes fixed upon the ground  costello has come to dance a farewell dance for he knows that you will never see one another again  the girl lifted her eyes and gazed at costello and in her gaze was that trust of the humble in the proud the gentle in the violent which has been the tragedy of woman from the beginning costello led her among the dancers and they were soon drawn into the rhythm of the pavane that stately dance which with the saraband the gallead and the morrice dances had driven out among all but the most irish of the gentry the quicker rhythms of the verseinterwoven pantomimic dances of earlier days and while they danced there came over them the unutterable melancholy the weariness with the world the poignant and bitter pity for one another the vague anger against common hopes and fears which is the exultation of love and when a dance ended and the pipers laid down their pipes and lifted their horn noggins they stood a little from the others waiting pensively and silently for the dance to begin again and the fire in their hearts to leap up and to wrap them anew and so they danced and danced pavane and saraband and gallead and morrice through the night long and many stood still to watch them and the peasants came about the door and peered in as though they understood that they would gather their childrens children about them long hence and tell how they had seen costello dance with dermotts daughter oona and become by the telling themselves a portion of ancient romance but through all the dancing and piping namara of the lake went hither and thither talking loudly and making foolish jokes that all might seem well with him and old dermott of the sheep grew redder and redder and looked oftener and oftener at the doorway to see if the candles there grew yellow in the dawn  at last he saw that the moment to end had come and in a pause after a dance cried out from where the horn noggins stood that his daughter would now drink the cup of betrothal then oona came over to where he was and the guests stood round in a halfcircle costello close to the wall to the right and the piper the labourer the farmer the halfwitted man and the two farm lads close behind him the old man took out of a niche in the wall the silver cup from which her mother and her mothers mother had drunk the toasts of their betrothals and poured poteen out of a porcelain jug and handed the cup to his daughter with the customary words drink to him whom you love the best  she held the cup to her lips for a moment and then said in a clear soft voice i drink to my true love tumaus costello  and then the cup rolled over and over on the ground ringing like a bell for the old man had struck her in the face and the cup had fallen and there was a deep silence  there were many of namaras people among the servants now come out of the alcove and one of them a storyteller and poet a last remnant of the bardic order who had a chair and a platter in namaras kitchen drew a french knife out of his girdle and made as though he would strike at costello but in a moment a blow had hurled him to the ground his shoulder sending the cup rolling and ringing again the click of steel had followed quickly had not there come a muttering and shouting from the peasants about the door and from those crowding up behind them and all knew that these were no children of queens irish or friendly namaras and dermotts but of the wild irish about lough gara and lough cara who rowed their skin coracles and had masses of hair over their eyes and left the right arms of their children unchristened that they might give the stouter blows and swore only by st atty and sun and moon and worshipped beauty and strength more than st atty or sun and moon  costellos hand had rested upon the handle of his sword and his knuckles had grown white but now he drew it away and followed by those who were with him strode towards the door the dancers giving way before him the most angrily and slowly and with glances at the muttering and shouting peasants but some gladly and quickly because the glory of his fame was over him he passed through the fierce and friendly peasant faces and came where his good horse and the rough haired garrons were tied to bushes and mounted and bade his ungainly bodyguard mount also and ride into the narrow boreen when they had gone a little way duallach who rode last turned towards the house where a little group of dermotts and namaras stood next to a more numerous group of countrymen and cried dermott you deserve to be as you are this hour a lantern without a candle a purse without a penny a sheep without wool for your hand was ever niggardly to piper and fiddler and storyteller and to poor travelling people he had not done before the three old dermotts from the ox mountains had run towards their horses and old dermott himself had caught the bridle of a garron of the namaras and was calling to the others to follow him and many blows and many deaths had been had not the countrymen caught up still glowing sticks from the ashes of the fires and hurled them among the horses with loud cries making all plunge and rear and some break from those who held them the whites of their eyes gleaming in the dawn  for the next few weeks costello had no lack of news of oona for now a woman selling eggs or fowls and now a man or a woman on pilgrimage to the well of the rocks would tell him how his love had fallen ill the day after st johns eve and how she was a little better or a little worse as it might be and though he looked to his horses and his cows and goats as usual the common and uncomely the dust upon the roads the songs of men returning from fairs and wakes men playing cards in the corners of fields on sundays and saints days the rumours of battles and changes in the great world the deliberate purposes of those about him troubled him with an inexplicable trouble and the country people still remember how when night had fallen he would bid duallach of the pipes tell to the chirping of the crickets the son of apple the beauty of the world the king of irelands son or some other of those traditional tales which were as much a pipers business as the green bunch of rushes the unchion stream or the chiefs of breffeny and while the boundless and phantasmal world of the legends was abuilding would abandon himself to the dreams of his sorrow  duallach would often pause to tell how some clan of the wild irish had descended from an incomparable king of the blue belt or warrior of the ozier wattle or to tell with many curses how all the strangers and most of the queens irish were the seed of the misshapen and horned people from under the sea or of the servile and creeping ferbolg but costello cared only for the love sorrows and no matter whither the stories wandered whether to the isle of the red lough where the blessed are or to the malign country of the hag of the east oona alone endured their shadowy hardships for it was she and no kings daughter of old who was hidden in the steel tower under the water with the folds of the worm of nine eyes round and about her prison and it was she who won by seven years of service the right to deliver from hell all she could carry and carried away multitudes clinging with worn fingers to the hem of her dress and it was she who endured dumbness for a year because of the little thorn of enchantment the fairies had thrust into her tongue and it was a lock of her hair coiled in a little carved box which gave so great a light that men threshed by it from sundown to sunrise and awoke so great a wonder that kings spent years in wandering or fell before unknown armies in seeking to discover her hidingplace for there was no beauty in the world but hers no tragedy in the world but hers and when at last the voice of the piper grown gentle with the wisdom of old romance was silent and his rheumatic steps had toiled upstairs and to bed and costello had dipped his fingers into the little delf font of holy water and begun to pray to mary of the seven sorrows the blue eyes and starcovered dress of the painting in the chapel faded from his imagination and the brown eyes and homespun dress of dermotts daughter winny came in their stead for there was no tenderness in the passion who keep their hearts pure for love or for hatred as other men for god for mary and for the saints and who when the hour of their visitation arrives come to the divine essence by the bitter tumult the garden of gethsemane and the desolate rood ordained for immortal passions in mortal hearts  one day a servingman rode up to costello who was helping his two lads to reap a meadow and gave him a letter and rode away without a word and the letter contained these words in english tumaus costello my daughter is very ill the wise woman from knocknasidhe has seen her and says she will die unless you come to her i therefore bid you come to her whose peace you stole by treachery dermott the son of dermott  costello threw down his scythe and sent one of the lads for duallach who had become woven into his mind with oona and himself saddled his great horse and duallachs garron  when they came to dermotts house it was late afternoon and lough gara lay down below them blue mirrorlike and deserted and though they had seen when at a distance dark figures moving about the door the house appeared not less deserted than the lough the door stood half open and costello knocked upon it again and again so that a number of lake gulls flew up out of the grass and circled screaming over his head but there was no answer  there is no one here said duallach for dermott of the sheep is too proud to welcome costello the proud and he threw the door open and they saw a ragged dirty very old woman who sat upon the floor leaning against the wall costello knew that it was bridget delaney a deaf and dumb beggar and she when she saw him stood up and made a sign to him to follow and led him and his companion up a stair and down a long corridor to a closed door she pushed the door open and went a little way off and sat down as before duallach sat upon the ground also but close to the door and costello went and gazed upon winny sleeping upon a bed he sat upon a chair beside her and waited and a long time passed and still she slept on and then duallach motioned to him through the door to wake her but he hushed his very breath that she might sleep on for his heart was full of that ungovernable pity which makes the fading heart of the lover a shadow of the divine heart presently he turned to duallach and said it is not right that i stay here where there are none of her kindred for the common people are always ready to blame the beautiful and then they went down and stood at the door of the house and waited but the evening wore on and no one came  it was a foolish man that called you proud costello duallach cried at last had he seen you waiting and waiting where they left none but a beggar to welcome you it is humble costello he would have called you  then costello mounted and duallach mounted but when they had ridden a little way costello tightened the reins and made his horse stand still many minutes passed and then duallach cried it is no wonder that you fear to offend dermott of the sheep for he has many brothers and friends and though he is old he is a strong man and ready with his hands and he is of the queens irish and the enemies of the gael are upon his side  and costello answered flushing and looking towards the house i swear by the mother of god that i will never return there again if they do not send after me before i pass the ford in the brown river and he rode on but so very slowly that the sun went down and the bats began to fly over the bogs when he came to the river he lingered awhile upon the bank among the flowers of the flag but presently rode out into the middle and stopped his horse in a foaming shallow duallach however crossed over and waited on a further bank above a deeper place after a good while duallach cried out again and this time very bitterly it was a fool who begot you and a fool who bore you and they are fools of all fools who say you come of an old and noble stock for you come of wheyfaced beggars who travelled from door to door bowing to gentles and to servingmen  with bent head costello rode through the river and stood beside him and would have spoken had not hoofs clattered on the further bank and a horseman splashed towards them it was a servingman of dermotts and he said speaking breathlessly like one who had ridden hard tumaus costello i come to bid you again to dermotts house when you had gone his daughter winny awoke and called your name for you had been in her dreams bridget delaney the dummy saw her lips move and the trouble upon her and came where we were hiding in the wood above the house and took dermott of the sheep by the coat and brought him to his daughter he saw the trouble upon her and bid me ride his own horse to bring you the quicker  then costello turned towards the piper duallach daly and taking him about the waist lifted him out of the saddle and hurled him against a grey rock that rose up out of the river so that he fell lifeless into the deep place and the waters swept over the tongue which god had made bitter that there might be a story in mens ears in after time then plunging his spurs into the horse he rode away furiously toward the northwest along the edge of the river and did not pause until he came to another and smoother ford and saw the rising moon mirrored in the water he paused for a moment irresolute and then rode into the ford and on over the ox mountains and down towards the sea his eyes almost continually resting upon the moon which glimmered in the dimness like a great white rose hung on the lattice of some boundless and phantasmal world but now his horse long dark with sweat and breathing hard for he kept spurring it to an extreme speed fell heavily hurling him into the grass at the roadside he tried to make it stand up and failing in this went on alone towards the moonlight and came to the sea and saw a schooner lying there at anchor now that he could go no further because of the sea he found that he was very tired and the night very cold and went into a shebeen close to the shore and threw himself down upon a bench the room was full of spanish and irish sailors who had just smuggled a cargo of wine and ale and were waiting a favourable wind to set out again a spaniard offered him a drink in bad gaelic he drank it greedily and began talking wildly and rapidly  for some three weeks the wind blew inshore or with too great violence and the sailors stayed drinking and talking and playing cards and costello stayed with them sleeping upon a bench in the shebeen and drinking and talking and playing more than any he soon lost what little money he had and then his horse which some one had brought from the mountain boreen to a spaniard who sold it to a farmer from the mountains and then his long cloak and his spurs and his boots of soft leather at last a gentle wind blew towards spain and the crew rowed out to their schooner singing gaelic and spanish songs and lifted the anchor and in a little while the white sails had dropped under the horizon then costello turned homeward his life gaping before him and walked all day coming in the early evening to the road that went from near lough gara to the southern edge of lough cay here he overtook a great crowd of peasants and farmers who were walking very slowly after two priests and a group of welldressed persons certain of whom were carrying a coffin he stopped an old man and asked whose burying it was and whose people they were and the old man answered it is the burying of oona dermotts daughter and we are the namaras and the dermotts and their following and you are tumaus costello who murdered her  costello went on towards the head of the procession passing men who looked at him with fierce eyes and only vaguely understanding what he had heard for now that he had lost the understanding that belongs to good health it seemed impossible that a gentleness and a beauty which had been so long the worlds heart could pass away presently he stopped and asked again whose burying it was and a man answered we are carrying dermotts daughter winny whom you murdered to be buried in the island of the holy trinity and the man stooped and picked up a stone and cast it at costello striking him on the cheek and making the blood flow out over his face costello went on scarcely feeling the blow and coming to those about the coffin shouldered his way into the midst of them and laying his hand upon the coffin asked in a loud voice who is in this coffin  the three old dermotts from the ox mountains caught up stones and bid those about them do the same and he was driven from the road covered with wounds and but for the priests would surely have been killed  when the procession had passed on costello began to follow again and saw from a distance the coffin laid upon a large boat and those about it get into other boats and the boats move slowly over the water to insula trinitatis and after a time he saw the boats return and their passengers mingle with the crowd upon the bank and all disperse by many roads and boreens it seemed to him that winny was somewhere on the island smiling gently as of old and when all had gone he swam in the way the boats had been rowed and found the new made grave beside the ruined abbey of the holy trinity and threw himself upon it calling to oona to come to him above him the square ivy leaves trembled and all about him white moths moved over white flowers and sweet odours drifted through the dim air  he lay there all that night and through the day after from time to time calling her to come to him but when the third night came he had forgotten worn out with hunger and sorrow that her body lay in the earth beneath but only knew she was somewhere near and would not come to him  just before dawn the hour when the peasants hear his ghostly voice crying out his pride awoke and he called loudly winny daughter of dermott of the sheep if you do not come to me i will go and never return to the island of the holy trinity and before his voice had died away a cold and whirling wind had swept over the island and he saw many figures rushing past women of the sidhe with crowns of silver and dim floating drapery and then oona but no longer smiling gently for she passed him swiftly and angrily and as she passed struck him upon the face crying then go and never return  he would have followed and was calling out her name when the whole glimmering company rose up into the air and rushing together in the shape of a great silvery rose faded into the ashen dawn  costello got up from the grave understanding nothing but that he had made his beloved angry and that she wished him to go and wading out into the lake began to swim he swam on and on but his limbs were too weary to keep him afloat and her anger was heavy about him and when he had gone a little way he sank without a struggle like a man passing into sleep and dreams  the next day a poor fisherman found him among the reeds upon the lake shore lying upon the white lake sand with his arms flung out as though he lay upon a rood and carried him to his own house and the very poor lamented over him and sang the keen and when the time had come laid him in the abbey on insula trinitatis with only the ruined altar between him and dermotts daughter and planted above them two ashtrees that in after days wove their branches together and mingled their trembling leaves
