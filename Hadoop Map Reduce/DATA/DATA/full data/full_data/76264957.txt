bears and dacoits  a tale of the ghauts     chapter i   a merry party were sitting in the verandah of one of the largest and handsomest bungalows of poonah it belonged to colonel hastings colonel of a native regiment stationed there and at present in virtue of seniority commanding a brigade tiffin was on and three or four officers and four ladies had taken their seats in the comfortable cane lounging chairs which form the invariable furniture of the verandah of a wellordered bungalow permission had been duly asked and granted by mrs hastings and the cheroots had just begun to draw when miss hastings a niece of the colonel who had only arrived the previous week from england said  uncle i am quite disappointed mrs lyons showed me the bear she has got tied up in their compound and it is the most wretched little thing not bigger than rover papas retriever and its fullgrown i thought bears were great fierce creatures and this poor little thing seemed so restless and unhappy that i thought it quite a shame not to let it go  colonel hastings smiled rather grimly  and yet small and insignificant as that bear is my dear it is a question whether he is not as dangerous an animal to meddle with as a maneating tiger  what that wretched little bear uncle  yes that wretched little bear any experienced sportsman will tell you that hunting those little bears is as dangerous a sport as tigerhunting on foot to say nothing of tigerhunting from an elephants back in which there is scarcely any danger whatever i can speak feelingly about it for my career was pretty nearly brought to an end by a bear just after i entered the army some thirty years ago at a spot within a few miles from here i have got the scars on my shoulder and arm still  oh do tell me all about it miss hastings said and the request being seconded by the rest of the party none of whom with the exception of mrs hastings had ever heard the story beforefor the colonel was somewhat chary of relating this special experiencehe waited till they had all drawn up their chairs as close as possible and then giving two or three vigorous puffs at his cheroot began as follows  thirty years ago in 1855 things were not so settled in the deccan as they are now there was no idea of insurrection on a large scale but we were going through one of those outbreaks of dacoity which have several times proved so troublesome bands of marauders kept the country in confusion pouring down on a village now carrying off three or four of the bombay moneylenders who were then as now the curse of the country sometimes making an onslaught upon a body of traders and occasionally venturing to attack small detachments of troops or isolated parties of police they were not very formidable but they were very troublesome and most difficult to catch for the peasantry regarded them as patriots and aided and shielded them in every way the headquarters of these gangs of dacoits were the ghauts in the thick bush and deep valleys and gorges there they could always take refuge while sometimes the more daring chiefs converted these detached peaks and masses of rock numbers of which you can see as you come up the ghaut by railway into almost impregnable fortresses many of these masses of rock rise as sheer up from the hillside as walls of masonry and look at a short distance like ruined castles some are absolutely inaccessible others can only be scaled by experienced climbers and although possible for the natives with their bare feet are impracticable to european troops many of these rock fortresses were at various times the headquarters of famous dacoit leaders and unless the summits happened to be commanded from some higher ground within gunshot range they were all but impregnable except by starvation when driven to bay these fellows would fight well  well about the time i joined the dacoits were unusually troublesome the police had a hard time of it and almost lived in the saddle and the cavalry were constantly called up to help them while detachments of infantry from the station were under canvas at several places along the top of the ghauts to cut the bands off from their strongholds and to aid if necessary in turning them out of their rock fortresses the natives in the valleys at the foot of the ghauts who have always been a semiindependent race ready to rob whenever they saw a chance were great friends with the dacoits and supplied them with provisions whenever the hunt on the deccan was too hot for them to make raids in that direction  this is a long introduction you will say and does not seem to have much to do with bears but it is really necessary as you will see i had joined about six months when three companies of the regiment were ordered to relieve a wing of the 15th who had been under canvas at a village some four miles to the north of the point where the line crosses the top of the ghauts there were three white officers and little enough to do except when a party was sent off to assist the police we had one or two brushes with the dacoits but i was not out on either occasion however there was plenty of shooting and a good many pigs about so we had very good fun of course as a raw hand i was very hot for it and as the others had both passed the enthusiastic age except for pigsticking and big game i could always get away i was supposed not to go far from camp because in the first place i might be wanted and in the second because of the dacoits and norworthy who was in command used to impress upon me that i ought not to go beyond the sound of a bugle of course we both knew that if i intended to get any sport i must go further afoot than this but i merely used to say all right sir i will keep an ear to the camp and he on his part never considered it necessary to ask where the game which appeared on the table came from but in point of fact i never went very far and my servant always had instructions which way to send for me if i was wanted while as to the dacoits i did not believe in their having the impudence to come in broad daylight within a mile or two of our camp i did not often go down the face of the ghauts the shooting was good and there were plenty of bears in those days but it needed a long day for such an expedition and in view of the dacoits who might be scattered about was not the sort of thing to be undertaken except with a strong party norworthy had not given any precise orders about it but i must admit that he said one day  of course you wont be fool enough to think of going down the ghauts hastings but i did not look at that as equivalent to a direct orderwhatever i should do now the colonel put in on seeing a furtive smile on the faces of his male listeners  however i never meant to go down though i used to stand on the edge and look longingly down into the bush and fancy i saw bears moving about in scores but i dont think i should have gone into their country if they had not come into mine one day the fellow who always carried my spare gun or flask and who was a sort of shekarry in a small way told me he had heard that a farmer whose house stood near the edge of the ghauts some two miles away had been seriously annoyed by his fruit and corn being stolen by bears  ill go and have a look at the place tomorrow i said there is no parade and i can start early you may as well tell the mess cook to put up a basket with some tiffin and a bottle of claret and get a boy to carry it over  the bears not come in day rahman said  of course not i replied still i may like to find out which way they come just do as you are told  the next morning at seven oclock i was at the farmers spoken of and there was no mistake as to the bears a patch of indian corn had been ruined by them and two dogs had been killed the native was in a terrible state of rage and alarm he said that on moonlight nights he had seen eight of them and they came and sniffed around the door of the cottage  why dont you fire through the window at them i asked scornfully for i had seen a score of tame bears in captivity and like you mary was inclined to despise them though there was far less excuse for me for i had heard stories which should have convinced me that small as he is the indian bear is not a beast to be attacked with impunity upon walking to the edge of the ghauts there was no difficulty in discovering the route by which the bears came up to the farm for a mile to the right and left the ground fell away as if cut with a knife leaving a precipice of over a hundred feet sheer down but close by where i was standing was the head of a watercourse which in time had gradually worn a sort of cleft in the wall up or down which it was not difficult to make ones way further down this little gorge widened out and became a deep ravine and further still a wide valley where it opened upon the flats far below us about half a mile down where the ravine was deepest and darkest was a thick clump of trees and jungle  thats where the bears are i asked rahman he nodded it seemed no distance i could get down and back in time for tiffin and perhaps bag a couple of bears for a young sportsman the temptation was great how long would it take us to go down and have a shot or two at them  no good go down master come here at night shoot bears when they come up  i had thought of that but in the first place it did not seem much sport to shoot the beasts from cover when they were quietly eating and in the next place i knew that norworthy could not even if he were willing give me leave to go out of camp at night i waited hesitating for a few minutes and then i said to myself it is of no use waiting i could go down and get a bear and be back again while i am thinking of it then to rahman no come along we will have a look through that wood anyhow  rahman evidently did not like it  not easy find bear sahib he very cunning  well very likely we shant find them i said but we can try anyhow bring that bottle with you the tiffin basket can wait here till we come back in another five minutes i had begun to climb down the watercoursethe shekarry following me i took the doublebarrelled rifle and handed him the shotgun having first dropped a bullet down each barrel over the charge the ravine was steep but there were bushes to hold on by and although it was hot work and took a good deal longer than i expected we at last got down to the place which i had fixed upon as likely to be the bears home  sahib climb up top rahman said come down through wood no good fire at bear when he above  i had heard that before but i was hot the sun was pouring down there was not a breath of wind and it looked a long way up to the top of the wood  give me the claret it would take too long to search the wood regularly we will sit down here for a bit and if we can see anything moving up in the wood well and good if not we will come back again another day with some beaters and dogs so saying i sat down with my back against a rock at a spot where i could look up among the trees for a long way through a natural vista i had a drink of claret and then i sat and watched till gradually i dropped off to sleep i dont know how long i slept but it was some time and i woke up with a sudden start rahman who had i fancy been asleep too also started up  illustration my gun rahman i shouted  the noise which had aroused us was made by a rolling stone striking a rock and looking up i saw some fifty yards away not in the wood but on the rocky hillside on our side of the ravine a bear standing as though unconscious of our presence snuffing the air as was natural i seized my rifle cocked it and took aim unheeding a cry of no no sahib from rahman however i was not going to miss such a chance as this and i let fly the beast had been standing sideways to me and as i saw him fall i felt sure i had hit him in the heart i gave a shout of triumph and was about to climb up when from behind the rock on which the bear had stood appeared another growling fiercely on seeing me it at once prepared to come down stupidly being taken by surprise and being new at it i fired at once at its head the bear gave a spring and thenit seemed instantaneousdown it came at me whether it rolled down or slipped down or ran down i dont know but it came almost as if it had jumped straight at me  my gun rahman i shouted holding out my hand there was no answer i glanced round and found that the scoundrel had bolted i had time and only just time to take a step backwards and to club my rifle when the brute was upon me i got one fair blow at the side of its head a blow that would have smashed the skull of any civilized beast into pieces and which did fortunately break the brutes jaw then in an instant he was upon me and i was fighting for life my huntingknife was out and with my left hand i had the beast by the throat while with my right i tried to drive my knife into its ribs my bullet had gone through his chest the impetus of his charge had knocked me over and we rolled on the ground he tearing with his claws at my shoulder and arm i stabbing and struggling my great effort being to keep my knees up so as to protect my body with them from his hind claws after the first blow with his paw which laid my shoulder open i do not think i felt any special pain whatever there was a strange faint sensation and my whole energy seemed centered in the two ideasto strike and to keep my knees up i knew that i was getting faint but i was dimly conscious that his efforts too were relaxing his weight on me seemed to increase enormously and the last idea that flashed across me was that it was a drawn fight  the next idea of which i was conscious was that i was being carried i seemed to be swinging about and i thought i was at sea then there was a little jolt and a sense of pain a collision i muttered and opened my eyes beyond the fact that i seemed in a yellow worlda bright orangeyellowmy eyes did not help me and i lay vaguely wondering about it all till the rocking ceased there was another bump and then the yellow world seemed to come to an end and as the daylight streamed in upon me i fainted again this time when i awoke to consciousness things were clearer i was stretched by a little stream a native woman was sprinkling my face and washing the blood from my wounds while another who had with my own knife cut off my coat and shirt was tearing the latter into strips to bandage my wounds the yellow world was explained i was lying on the yellow robe of one of the women they had tied the ends together placed a long stick through them and carried me in the baglike hammock they nodded to me when they saw i was conscious and brought water in a large leaf and poured it into my mouth then one went away for some time and came back with some leaves and bark these they chewed and put on my wounds bound them up with strips of my shirt and then again knotted the ends of the cloth and lifting me up went on as before  i was sure that we were much lower down the ghaut than we had been when i was watching for the bears and we were now going still lower however i knew very little hindustani nothing of the language the women spoke i was too weak to stand too weak even to think much and i dozed and woke and dozed again until after what seemed to me many hours of travel we stopped again this time before a tent two or three old women and four or five men came out and there was great talking between them and the young womenfor they were youngwho had carried me down some of the party appeared angry but at last things quieted down and i was carried into the tent i had fever and was i suppose delirious for days i afterwards found that for fully a fortnight i had lost all consciousness but a good constitution and the nursing of the women pulled me round when once the fever had gone i began to mend rapidly i tried to explain to the women that if they would go up to the camp and tell them where i was they would be well rewarded but although i was sure they understood they shook their heads and by the fact that as i became stronger two or three armed men always hung about the tent i came to the conclusion that i was a sort of prisoner this was annoying but did not seem serious if these people were dacoits or as was more likely allies of the dacoits i could be kept only for ransom or exchange moreover i felt sure of my ability to escape when i got strong especially as i believed that in the young women who had saved my life both by bringing me down and by their careful nursing i should find friends  were they pretty uncle mary hastings broke in  never mind whether they were pretty mary they were better than pretty  no but we like to know uncle  well except for the soft dark eyes common to the race and the good temper and lightheartedness also so general among hindu girls and the tenderness which women feel towards a creature whose life they have saved whether it is a wounded bird or a drowning puppy i suppose they were nothing remarkable in the way of beauty but at the time i know that i thought them charming     chapter ii   just as i was getting strong enough to walk and was beginning to think of making my escape a band of five or six fellows armed to the teeth came in and made signs that i was to go with them it was evidently an arranged thing the girls only were surprised but they were at once turned out and as we started i could see two crouching figures in the shade with their cloths over their heads i had a native garment thrown over my shoulders and in five minutes after the arrival of the fellows found myself on my way it took us some six hours before we reached our destination which was one of those natural rock citadels had i been in my usual health i could have done the distance in an hour and a half but i had to rest constantly and was finally carried rather than helped up i had gone not unwillingly for the men were clearly by their dress dacoits of the deccan and i had no doubt that it was intended either to ransom or exchange me  at the foot of this natural castle were some twenty or thirty more robbers and i was led to a rough sort of arbour in which was lying on a pile of maize straw a man who was evidently their chief he rose and we exchanged salaams  what is your name sahib he asked in mahratta  hastingslieutenant hastings i said and yours  sivajee punt he said  this was bad i had fallen into the hands of the most troublesome most ruthless and most famous of the dacoit leaders over and over again he had been hotly chased but had always managed to get away and when i last heard anything of what was going on four or five troops of native police were scouring the country after him he gave an order which i did not understand and a wretched bombay writer i suppose a clerk of some moneylender was dragged forward sivajee punt spoke to him for some time and the fellow then told me in english that i was to write at once to the officer commanding the troops telling him that i was in his hands and should be put to death directly he was attacked  ask him i said if he will take any sum of money to let me go  sivajee shook his head very decidedly  a piece of paper was put before me and a pen and ink and i wrote as i had been ordered adding however in french that i had brought myself into my present position by my own folly and would take my chance for i well knew the importance which government attached to sivajees capture i read out loud all that i had written in english and the interpreter translated it then the paper was folded and i addressed it the officer commanding and i was given some chupattis and a drink of water and allowed to sleep the dacoits had apparently no fear of any immediate attack  it was still dark although morning was just breaking when i was awakened and was got up to the citadel i was hoisted rather than climbed two men standing above with a rope tied round my body so that i was halfhauled halfpushed up the difficult places which would have taxed all my climbing powers had i been in health  the height of this mass of rock was about a hundred feet the top was fairly flat with some depressions and risings and about eighty feet long by fifty wide it had evidently been used as a fortress in ages past along the side facing the hill were the remains of a rough wall in the centre of a depression was a cistern some four feet square lined with stonework and in another depression a gallery had been cut leading to a subterranean storeroom or chamber this natural fortress rose from the face of the hill at a distance of a thousand yards or so from the edge of the plateau which was fully two hundred feet higher than the top of the rock in the old days it would have been impregnable and even at that time it was an awkward place to take for the troops were armed only with brown bess and rifled cannon were not thought of looking round i could see that i was some four miles from the point where i had descended the camp was gone but running my eye along the edge of the plateau i could see the tops of tents a mile to my right and again two miles to my left turning round and looking down into the wide valley i saw a regimental camp  it was evident that a vigorous effort was being made to surround and capture the dacoits since troops had been brought up from bombay in addition to the troops above and below there would probably be a strong police force acting on the face of the hill i did not see all these things at the time for i was as soon as i got to the top ordered to sit down behind the parapet a fellow armed to the teeth squatting down by me and signifying that if i showed my head above the stones he would cut my throat without hesitation there were however sufficient gaps between the stones to allow me to have a view of the crest of the ghaut while below my view extended down to the hills behind bombay it was evident to me now why the dacoits did not climb up into the fortress there were dozens of similar crags on the face of the ghauts and the troops did not as yet know their whereabouts it was a sort of blockade of the whole face of the hills which was being kept up and there were probably enough several other bands of dacoits lurking in the jungle  there were only two guards and myself on the rock plateau i discussed with myself the chances of my overpowering them and holding the top of the rock till help came but i was greatly weakened and was not a match for a boy much less for the two stalwart mahrattas besides i was by no means sure that the way i had been brought up was the only possible path to the top the day passed off quietly the heat on the bare rock was frightful but one of the men seeing how weak and ill i really was fetched a thick rug from the storehouse and with the aid of a stick made a sort of leanto against the wall under which i lay sheltered from the sun  once or twice during the day i heard a few distant musketshots and once a sharp heavy outburst of firing it must have been three or four miles away but it was on the side of the ghaut and showed that the troops or police were at work my guards looked anxiously in that direction and uttered sundry curses when it was dusk sivajee and eight of the dacoits came up from what they said i gathered that the rest of the band had dispersed trusting either to get through the line of their pursuers or if caught to escape with slight punishment the men who remained being too deeply concerned in murderous outrages to hope for mercy sivajee himself handed me a letter which the man who had taken my note had brought back in reply major knapp the writer who was the second in command said that he could not engage the government but that if lieutenant hastings was given up the act would certainly dispose the government to take the most merciful view possible but that if on the contrary any harm was suffered by lieutenant hastings every man taken would be at once hung sivajee did not appear put out about it i do not think he expected any other answer and imagine that his real object in writing was simply to let them know that i was a prisoner and so enable him the better to paralyse the attack upon a position which he no doubt considered all but impregnable  i was given food and was then allowed to walk as i chose upon the little plateau two of the dacoits taking post as sentries at the steepest part of the path while the rest gathered chatting and smoking in the depression in front of the storehouse it was still light enough for me to see for some distance down the face of the rock and i strained my eyes to see if i could discern any other spot at which an ascent or descent was possible the prospect was not encouraging at some places the face fell sheer away from the edge and so evident was the impracticability of escape that the only place which i glanced at twice was the western side that is the one away from the hill here it sloped gradually for a few feet i took off my shoes and went down to the edge below some ten feet was a ledge on to which with care i could get down but below that was a sheer fall of some fifty feet as a means of escape it was hopeless but it struck me that if an attack was made i might slip away and get on to the ledge once there i could not be seen except by a person standing where i now was just on the edge of the slope a spot to which it was very unlikely that anyone would come  the thought gave me a shadow of hope and returning to the upper end of the platform i lay down and in spite of the hardness of the rock was soon asleep the pain of my aching bones woke me up several times and once just as the first tinge of dawn was coming i thought i could hear movements in the jungle i raised myself somewhat and i saw that the sounds had been heard by the dacoits for they were standing listening and some of them were bringing spare firearms from the storehouse in evident preparation for attack  as i afterwards learned the police had caught one of the dacoits trying to effect his escape and by means of a little of the ingenious torture to which the indian police then frequently resorted when their white officers were absent they obtained from him the exact position of sivajees band and learned the side from which the ascent must be made that the dacoit and his band were still upon the slopes of the ghauts they knew and were gradually narrowing their circle but there were so many rocks and hidingplaces that the process of searching was a slow one and the intelligence was so important that the news was off at once to the colonel who gave orders for the police to surround the rock at daylight and to storm it if possible the garrison was so small that the police were alone ample for the work supposing that the natural difficulties were not altogether insuperable  just at daybreak there was a distant noise of men moving in the jungle and the dacoit halfway down the path fired his gun he was answered by a shout and a volley the dacoits hurried out from the chamber and lay down on the edge where sheltered by a parapet they commanded the path they paid no attention to me and i kept as far away as possible the fire begana quiet steady fire a shot at a time and in strong contrast to the rattle kept up from the surrounding jungle but every shot must have told as man after man who strove to climb that steep path fell it lasted only ten minutes and then all was quiet again  the attack had failed as i knew it must do for two men could have held the place against an army a quarter of an hour later a gun from the crest above spoke out and a round shot whistled above our heads beyond annoyance an artillery fire could do no harm for the party could be absolutely safe in the store cave the instant the shot flew overhead however sivajee punt beckoned to me and motioned me to take my seat on the wall facing the guns hesitation was useless and i took my seat with my back to the dacoits and my face to the hill one of the dacoits as i did so pulled off the native cloth which covered my shoulders in order that i might be clearly seen  just as i took my place another round shot hummed by but then there was a long interval of silence with a fieldglass every feature must have been distinguishable to the gunners and i had no doubt that they were waiting for orders as to what to do next  i glanced round and saw that with the exception of one fellow squatted behind the parapet some halfdozen yards away clearly as a sentry to keep me in place all the others had disappeared some no doubt were on sentry down the path the others were in the store beneath me after half an hours silence the guns spoke out again evidently the gunners were told to be as careful as they could for some of the shots went wide on the left others on the right a few struck the rock below me the situation was not pleasant but i thought that at a thousand yards they ought not to hit me and i tried to distract my attention by thinking out what i should do under every possible contingency  presently i felt a crash and a shock and fell backwards to the ground i was not hurt and on picking myself up saw that the ball had struck the parapet to the left just where my guard was sitting and he lay covered with its fragments his turban lay some yards behind him whether he was dead or not i neither knew nor cared  i pushed down some of the parapet where i had been sitting dropped my cap on the edge outside so as to make it appear that i had fallen over and then picking up the mans turban ran to the other end of the platform and scrambled down to the ledge then i began to wave my arms abouti had nothing on above the waistand in a moment i saw a face with a uniform cap peer out through the jungle and a hand was waved i made signs to him to make his way to the foot of the perpendicular wall of rock beneath me i then unwound the turban whose length was i knew amply sufficient to reach to the bottom and then looked round for something to write on i had my pencil still in my trousers pocket but not a scrap of paper  i picked up a flattish piece of rock and wrote on it get a ropeladder quickly i can haul it up ten men in garrison they are all under cover keep on firing to distract their attention  i tied the stone to the end of the turban and looked over a noncommissioned officer of the police was already standing below i lowered the stone he took it waved his hand to me and was gone  an hour passed it seemed an age the round shots still rang overhead and the fire was now much more heavy and sustained than before presently i again saw a movement in the jungle and norworthys face appeared and he waved his arm in greeting  five minutes more and a party were gathered at the foot of the rock and a strong rope was tied to the cloth i pulled it up a ropeladder was attached to it and the top rung was in a minute or two in my hands to it was tied a piece of paper with the words can you fasten the ladder i wrote on the paper no but i can hold it for a light weight  i put the paper with a stone in the end of the cloth and lowered it again then i sat down tied the rope round my waist got my feet against two projections and waited there was a jerk and then i felt some one was coming up the ropeladder the strain was far less than i expected but the native policeman who came up first did not weigh half so much as an average englishman there were now two of us to hold the officer in command of the police came up next then norworthy then a dozen more police i explained the situation and we mounted to the upper level not a soul was to be seen quickly we advanced and took up a position to command the door of the underground chamber while one of the police waved a white cloth from his bayonet as a signal to the gunners to cease firing then the police officer hailed the party within the cave  sivajee punt you may as well come out and give yourself up we are in possession and resistance is useless  a yell of rage and surprise was heard and the dacoits all desperate men came bounding out firing as they did so half of their number were shot down at once and the rest after a short sharp struggle were bound hand and foot  that is pretty well all of the story i think sivajee punt was one of the killed the prisoners were all either hung or imprisoned for life i escaped my blowingup for having gone down the ghauts after the bear because after all sivajee punt might have defied their force for months had i not done so  it seemed that that scoundrel rahman had taken back word that i was killed norworthy had sent down a strong party who found the two dead bears and who having searched everywhere without finding any signs of my body came to the conclusion that i had been found and carried away especially as they ascertained that natives used that path they had offered rewards but nothing was heard of me till my note saying i was in sivajees hands arrived  and did you ever see the women who carried you off  no mary i never saw them again i did however after immense trouble succeed in finding out where it was that i had been taken to i went down at once but found the village deserted then after much inquiry i found where the people had moved to and sent messages to the women to come up to the camp but they never came and i was reduced at last to sending them down two sets of silver bracelets necklaces and bangles which must have rendered them the envy of all the women on the ghauts they sent back a message of grateful thanks and i never heard of them afterwards no doubt their relatives who knew that their connection with the dacoits was now known would not let them come however i had done all i could and i have no doubt the women were perfectly satisfied so you see my dear that the indian bear small as he is is an animal which it is as well to leave alone at any rate when he happens to be up on the side of a hill while you are at the foot  illustration     illustration  the paternosters  a yachting story   and do you really mean that we are to cross by the steamer mr virtue while you go over in the seabird i do not approve of that at all fanny why do you not rebel and say we wont be put ashore i call it horrid after a fortnight on board this dear little yacht to have to get on to a crowded steamer with no accommodation and lots of seasick women perhaps and crying children you surely cannot be in earnest  i do not like it any more than you do minnie but as tom says we had better do it and my husband agrees with him i am afraid we must submit do you really think it is quite necessary mr virtue minnie and i are both good sailors you know and we would much rather have a little extra tossing about on board the seabird than the discomforts of a steamer  i certainly think that it will be best mrs grantham you know very well we would rather have you on board and that we shall suffer from your loss more than you will by going the other way but theres no doubt the wind is getting up and though we dont feel it much here it must be blowing pretty hard outside the seabird is as good a seaboat as anything of her size that floats but you dont know what it is to be out in anything like a heavy sea in a thirtytonner it would be impossible for you to stay on deck and we should have our hands full and should not be able to give you the benefit of our society personally i should not mind being out in the seabird in any weather but i would certainly rather not have ladies on board  you dont think we should scream or do anything foolish mr virtue minnie graham said indignantly  not at all miss graham still i repeat the knowledge that there are women on board delightful at other times does not tend to comfort in bad weather of course if you prefer it we can put off our start till this puff of wind has blown itself out it may have dropped before morning it may last some little time i dont think myself that it will drop for the glass has fallen and i am afraid we may have a spell of broken weather  oh no dont put it off mrs grantham said we have only another fortnight before james must be back again in london and it would be a great pity to lose three or four days perhaps and we have been looking forward to cruising about among the channel islands and to st malo and all those places oh no i think the other is much the better planthat is if you wont take us with you  it would be bad manners to say that i wont mrs grantham but i must say i would rather not it will be a very short separation grantham will take you on shore at once and as soon as the boat comes back i shall be off you will start in the steamer this evening and get into jersey at nine or ten oclock tomorrow morning and if i am not there before you i shall not be many hours after you  well if it must be it must mrs grantham said with an air of resignation come minnie let us put a few things into a handbag for tonight you see the skipper is not to be moved by our pleadings  that is the worst of you married women fanny miss graham said with a little pout you get into the way of doing as you are ordered i call it too bad here have we been cruising about for the last fortnight with scarcely a breath of wind and longing for a good brisk breeze and a little change and excitement and now it comes at last we are to be packed off in a steamer i call it horrid of you mr virtue you may laugh but i do  tom virtue laughed but he showed no signs of giving way and ten minutes later mr and mrs grantham and miss graham took their places in the gig and were rowed into southampton harbour off which the seabird was lying  the last fortnight had been a very pleasant one and it had cost the owner of the seabird as much as his guests to come to the conclusion that it was better to break up the party for a few hours  tom virtue had up to the age of fiveandtwenty been possessed of a sufficient income for his wants he had entered at the bar not that he felt any particular vocation in that direction but because he thought it incumbent upon him to do something then at the death of an uncle he had come into a considerable fortune and was able to indulge his taste for yachting which was the sole amusement for which he really cared to the fullest  he sold the little fivetonner he had formerly possessed and purchased the seabird he could well have afforded a much larger craft but he knew that there was far more real enjoyment in sailing to be obtained from a small craft than a large one for in the latter he would be obliged to have a regular skipper and would be little more than a passenger whereas on board the seabird although his first hand was dignified by the name of skipper he was himself the absolute master the boat carried the aforesaid skipper three hands and a steward and with them he had twice been up the mediterranean across to norway and had several times made the circuit of the british isles  he had unlimited confidence in his boat and cared not what weather he was out in her this was the first time since his ownership of her that the seabird had carried lady passengers his friend grantham an old school and college chum was a hardworking barrister and virtue had proposed to him to take a months holiday on board the seabird  put aside your books old man he said you look fagged and overworked a months blow will do you all the good in the world  thank you tom i have made up my mind for a months holiday but i cant accept your invitation though i should enjoy it of all things but it would not be fair to my wife she doesnt get very much of my society and she has been looking forward to our having a run together so i must decline  virtue hesitated a moment he was not very fond of ladies society and thought them especially in the way on board a yacht but he had a great liking for his friends wife and was almost as much at home in his house as in his own chambers  why not bring the wife with you he said as soon as his mind was made up it will be a nice change for her too and i have heard her say that she is a good sailor the accommodation is not extensive but the aftercabin is a pretty good size and i would do all i could to make her comfortable perhaps she would like another lady with her if so by all means bring one they could have the aftercabin you could have the little stateroom and i could sleep in the saloon  it is very good of you tom especially as i know that it will put you out frightfully but the offer is a very tempting one i will speak to fanny and let you have an answer in the morning  that will be delightful james mrs grantham said when the invitation was repeated to her i should like it of all things and i am sure the rest and quiet and the sea air will be just the thing for you it is wonderful tom virtue making the offer and i take it as a great personal compliment for he certainly is not what is generally called a ladys man it is very nice too of him to think of my having another lady on board whom shall we ask oh i know she said suddenly that will be the thing of all others we will ask my cousin minnie she is full of fun and life and will make a charming wife for tom  james grantham laughed  what schemers you all are fanny now i should call it downright treachery to take anyone on board the seabird with the idea of capturing its master  nonsense treachery mrs grantham said indignantly minnie is the nicest girl i know and it would do tom a world of good to have a wife to look after him why he is thirty now and will be settling down into a confirmed old bachelor before long its the greatest kindness we could do him to take minnie on board and i am sure he is the sort of man any girl might fall in love with when she gets to know him the fact is hes shy he never had any sisters and spends all his time in winter at that horrid club so that really he has never had any womens society and even with us he will never come unless he knows we are alone i call it a great pity for i dont know a pleasanter fellow than he is i think it will be doing him a real service in asking minnie so thats settled i will sit down and write him a note  in for a penny in for a pound i suppose was tom virtues comment when he received mrs granthams letter thanking him warmly for the invitation and saying that she would bring her cousin miss graham with her if that young lady was disengaged  as a matter of selfdefence he at once invited jack harvey who was a mutual friend of himself and grantham to be of the party  jack can help grantham to amuse the women he said to himself that will be more in his line than mine i will run down to cowes tomorrow and have a chat with johnson we shall want a different sort of stores altogether to those we generally carry and i suppose we must do her up a bit below  having made up his mind to the infliction of female passengers tom virtue did it handsomely and when the party came on board at ryde they were delighted with the aspect of the yacht below she had been repainted the saloon and ladies cabin were decorated in delicate shades of gray picked out with gold and the upholsterer into whose hands the owner of the seabird had placed her had done his work with taste and judgment and the ladies cabin resembled a little boudoir  why tom i should have hardly known her grantham who had often spent a day on board the seabird said  i hardly know her myself tom said rather ruefully but i hope shes all right mrs grantham and that you and miss graham will find everything you want  it is charming mrs grantham said enthusiastically its awfully good of you tom and we appreciate it dont we minnie it is such a surprise too for james said that while i should find everything very comfortable i must not expect that a small yacht would be got up like a palace  so a fortnight had passed they had cruised along the coast as far as plymouth anchoring at night at the various ports on the way then they had returned to southampton and it had been settled that as none of the party with the exception of virtue himself had been to the channel islands the last fortnight of the trip should be spent there the weather had been delightful save that there had been some deficiency in wind and throughout the cruise the seabird had been under all the sail she could spread but when the gentlemen came on deck early in the morning a considerable change had taken place the sky was gray and the clouds flying fast overhead  we are going to have dirty weather tom virtue said at once i dont think its going to be a gale but there will be more sea on than will be pleasant for ladies i tell you what grantham the best thing will be for you to go on shore with the two ladies and cross by the boat tonight if you dont mind going directly after breakfast i will start at once and shall be at st heliers as soon as you are  and so it had been agreed but not as has been seen without opposition and protest on the part of the ladies  mrs granthams chief reason for objecting had not been given the little scheme on which she had set her mind seemed to be working satisfactorily from the first day tom virtue had exerted himself to play the part of host satisfactorily and had ere long shaken off any shyness he may have felt towards the one stranger of the party and he and miss graham had speedily got on friendly terms so things were going on as well as mrs grantham could have expected  no sooner had his guests left the side of the yacht than her owner began to make his preparations for a start  what do you think of the weather watkins he asked his skipper  its going to blow hard sir thats my view of it and if i was you i shouldnt up anchor today still its just as you likes the seabird wont mind it if we dont she has had a rough time of it before now still it will be a case of wet jackets and no mistake  yes i expect we shall have a rough time of it watkins but i want to get across we dont often let ourselves be weatherbound and i am not going to begin it today we had better house the topmast at once and get two reefs in the mainsail we can get the other down when we get clear of the island get number three jib up and the legofmutton mizzen put two reefs in the foresail  tom and his friend harvey who was a good sailor assisted the crew in reefing down the sails and a few minutes after the gig had returned and been hoisted in the yawl was running rapidly down southampton waters  we need hardly have reefed quite so closely jack harvey said as he puffed away at his pipe  not yet jack but you will see she has as much as she can carry before long its all the better to make all snug before starting it saves a lot of trouble afterwards and the extra canvas would not have made ten minutes difference to us at the outside we shall have pretty nearly a dead beat down the solent fortunately tide will be running strong with us but there will be a nasty kickup there you will see we shall feel the short choppy seas there more than we shall when we get outside she is a grand boat in a really heavy sea but in short waves she puts her nose into it with a will now if you will take my advice you will do as i am going to do put on a pair of fishermans boots and oilskin and souwester there are several sets for you to choose from below  as her owner had predicted the seabird put her bowsprit under pretty frequently in the solent the wind was blowing half a gale and as it met the tide it knocked up a short angry sea crested with white heads and jack harvey agreed that she had quite as much sail on her as she wanted the cabin doors were bolted and all made snug to prevent the water getting below before they got to the race off hurst castle and it was well that they did so for she was as much under water as she was above  i think if i had given way to the ladies and brought them with us they would have changed their minds by this time jack tom virtue said with a laugh  i should think so his friend agreed this is not a day for a fairweather sailor look what a sea is breaking on the shingles  yes five minutes there would knock her into matchwood another ten minutes and we shall be fairly out and i shant be sorry one feels as if one was playing football only just at present the seabird is the ball and the waves the kickers  another quarter of an hour and they had passed the needles  that is more pleasant jack as the short chopping motion was exchanged for a regular rise and fall this is what i enjoya steady wind and a regular sea the seabird goes over it like one of her namesakes she is not taking a teacupful now over her bows  watkins you may as well take the helm for a spell while we go down to lunch i am not sorry to give it up for a bit for it has been jerking like the kick of a horse  thats right jack hang up your oilskin there johnson give us a couple of towels we have been pretty well smothered up there on deck now what have you got for us  there is some soup ready sir and that cold pie you had for dinner yesterday  that will do open a couple of bottles of stout  lunch over they went on deck again  she likes a good blow as well as we do virtue said enthusiastically as the yawl rose lightly over each wave what do you think of it watkins is the wind going to lull a bit as the sun goes down  i think not sir it seems to me its blowing harder than it was  then we will prepare for the worst watkins get the trysail up on deck when you are ready we will bring her up into the wind and set it thats the comfort of a yawl jack one can always lie to without any bother and one hasnt got such a tremendous boom to handle  the trysail was soon on deck and then the seabird was brought up into the wind the weather foresheet hauled aft the mizzen sheeted almost fore and aft and the seabird lay head to wind rising and falling with a gentle motion in strong contrast to her impetuous rushes when under sail  she would ride out anything like that her owner said last time we came through the bay on our way from gib we were caught in a gale strong enough to blow the hair off ones head and we lay to for nearly three days and didnt ship a bucket of water all the time now let us lend a hand to get the mainsail stowed  ten minutes work and it was securely fastened and its cover on two reefs were put in the trysail two hands went to each of the halliards while as the sail rose tom virtue fastened the toggles round the mast  all ready watkins  all ready sir  slack off the weather foresheet then and haul aft the leeward slack out the mizzensheet a little jack thats it now shes off again like a duck  the seabird felt the relief from the pressure of the heavy boom to leeward and rose easily and lightly over the waves  she certainly is a splendid seaboat tom i dont wonder you are ready to go anywhere in her i thought we were rather fools for starting this morning although i enjoy a good blow but now i dont care how hard it comes on  by night it was blowing a downright gale  we will lie to till morning watkins so that we get in by daylight tomorrow evening that is all we want see our sidelights are burning well and you had better get up a couple of blue lights in case anything comes running up channel and dont see our lights we had better divide into two watches i will keep one with matthews and dawson mr harvey will go in your watch with nicholls we had better get the trysail down altogether and lie to under the foresail and mizzen but dont put many lashings on the trysail one will be enough and have it ready to cast off in a moment in case we want to hoist the sail in a hurry i will go down and have a glass of hot grog first and then i will take my watch to begin with let the two hands with me go down the steward will serve them out a tot each jack you had better turn in at once  virtue was soon on deck again muffled up in his oilskins  now watkins you can go below and turn in  i shant go below tonight sirnot to lie down theres nothing much to do here but i couldnt sleep if i did lie down  very well you had better go below and get a glass of grog tell the steward to give you a big pipe with a cover like this out of the locker and theres plenty of chewing tobacco if the men are short  i will take that instead of a pipe watkins said theres nothing like a quid in weather like this it aint never in your way and it lasts even with a cover a pipe would soon be out  please yourself watkins tell the two hands forward to keep a bright lookout for lights  the night passed slowly occasionally a sea heavier than usual came on board curling over the bow and falling with a heavy thud on the deck but for the most part the seabird breasted the waves easily the bowsprit had been reefed in to its fullest thereby adding to the lightness and buoyancy of the boat tom virtue did not go below when his friend came up to relieve him at the change of watch but sat smoking and doing much talking in the short intervals between the gusts  the morning broke gray and misty driving sleet came along on the wind and the horizon was closed in as by a dull curtain  how far can we see do you think watkins  perhaps a couple of miles sir  that will be enough i think we both know the position of every reef to within a hundred yards so we will shape our course for guernsey if we happen to hit it off we can hold on to st helier but if when we think we ought to be within sight of guernsey we see nothing of it we must lie to again till the storm has blown itself out or the clouds lift it would never do to go groping our way along with such currents as run among the islands put the last reef in the trysail before you hoist it i think you had better get the foresail down altogether and run up the spitfire jib  the seabird was soon under way again  now watkins you take the helm we will go down and have a cup of hot coffee and i will see that the steward has a good supply for you and the hands but first do you take the helm jack whilst watkins and i have a look at the chart and try and work out where we are and the course we had better lie for guernsey  five minutes were spent over the chart then watkins went up and jack harvey came down  you have got the coffee ready i hope johnson  yes sir coffee and chocolate i didnt know which you would like  chocolate by all means jack i recommend the chocolate bring two fullsized bowls johnson and put that cold pie on the table and a couple of knives and forks never mind about a cloth but first of all bring a couple of basins of hot water we shall enjoy our food more after a wash  the early breakfast was eaten dry coats and mufflers put on pipes lighted and they then went up upon deck tom took the helm  what time do you calculate we ought to make guernsey tom  about twelve the wind is freer than it was and we are walking along at a good pace matthews cast the log and lets see what we are doing about seven knots i should say  seven and a quarter sir the man said when he checked the line  not a bad guess tom its always difficult to judge pace in a heavy sea  at eleven oclock the mist ceased  thats fortunate tom virtue said i shouldnt be surprised if we get a glimpse of the sun between the clouds presently will you get my sextant and the chronometer up jack and put them handy  jack harvey did as he was asked but there was no occasion to use the instruments for ten minutes later watkins who was standing near the bow gazing fixedly ahead shouted  theres guernsey sir on her lee bow about six miles away i should say  thats it sure enough tom agreed as he gazed in the direction in which watkins was pointing theres a gleam of sunshine on it or we shouldnt have seen it yet yes i think you are about right as to the distance now let us take its bearings we may lose it again directly  having taken the bearings of the island they went below and marked off their position on the chart and they shaped their course for cape grosnez the northwestern point of jersey the gleam of sunshine was transientthe clouds closed in again overhead darker and grayer than before soon the drops of rain came flying before the wind the horizon closed in and they could not see half a mile away but though the sea was heavy the seabird was making capital weather of it and the two friends agreed that after all the excitement of a sail like this was worth a month of pottering about in calms  we must keep a bright lookout presently the skipper said there are some nasty rocks off the coast of jersey we must give them a wide berth we had best make round to the south of the island and lay to there till we can pick up a pilot to take us into st helier i dont think it will be worth while trying to get into st aubyns bay by ourselves  i think so too watkins but we will see what it is like before it gets dark if we can pick up a pilot all the better if not we will lie to till morning if the weather keeps thick but if it clears so that we can make out all the lights we ought to be able to get into the bay anyhow  an hour later the rain ceased and the sky appeared somewhat clearer suddenly watkins exclaimed there is a wreck sir there three miles away to leeward she is on the paternosters  good heavens she is a steamer tom exclaimed as he caught sight of her the next time the seabird lifted on a wave can she be the southampton boat do you think  like enough sir she may have had it thicker than we had and may not have calculated enough for the current  up helm jack and bear away towards her shall we shake out a reef watkins  i wouldnt sir she has got as much as she can carry on her now we must mind what we are doing sir the currents run like a millstream and if we get that reef under our lee and the wind and current both setting us on to it it will be all up with us in no time  yes i know that watkins jack take the helm a minute while we run down and look at the chart  our only chance watkins is to work up behind the reef and try and get so that they can either fasten a line to a buoy and let it float down to us or get into a boat if they have one left and drift to us  they are an awful group of rocks watkins said as they examined the chart you see some of them show merely at high tide and a lot of them are above at low water it will be an awful business to get among them rocks sir just about as near certain death as a thing can be  well its got to be done watkins tom said firmly i see the danger as well as you do but whatever the risk it must be tried mr grantham and the two ladies went on board by my persuasion and i should never forgive myself if anything happened to them but i will speak to the men  he went on deck again and called the men to him look here lads you see that steamer ashore on the paternosters in such a sea as this she may go to pieces in half an hour i am determined to make an effort to save the lives of those on board as you can see for yourselves there is no lying to weather of her with the current and wind driving us on to the reef we must beat up from behind now lads the sea there is full of rocks and the chances are ten to one we strike on to them and go to pieces but anyhow i am going to try but i wont take you unless you are willing the boat is a good one and the zinc chambers will keep her afloat if she fills well managed you ought to be able to make the coast of jersey in her mr harvey watkins and i can handle the yacht so you can take the boat if you like  the men replied that they would stick to the yacht wherever mr virtue chose to take her and muttered something about the ladies for the pleasant faces of mrs grantham and miss graham had during the fortnight they had been on board won the mens hearts  very well lads i am glad to find you will stick by me if we pull safely through it i will give each of you three months wages now set to work with a will and get the gig out we will tow her after us and take to her if we make a smash of it  they were now near enough to see the white breakers in the middle of which the ship was lying she was fast breaking up the jagged outline showed that the stern had been beaten in the masts and funnel were gone and the waves seemed to make a clean breach over her almost hiding her from sight in a white cloud of spray  wood and iron cant stand that much longer jack harvey said another hour and i should say there wont be two planks left together  it is awful jack i would give all i have in the world if i had not persuaded them to go on board keep her off a little more watkins  the seabird passed within a cableslength of the breakers at the northern end of the reef  now lads take your places at the sheets ready to haul or let go as i give the word so saying tom virtue took his place in the bow holding on by the forestay  the wind was full on the seabirds beam as she entered the broken water here and there the dark heads of the rocks showed above the water these were easy enough to avoid the danger lay in those hidden beneath its surface and whose position was indicated only by the occasional break of a sea as it passed over them every time the seabird sank on a wave those on board involuntarily held their breath but the water here was comparatively smooth the sea having spent its first force upon the outer reef with a wave of his hand tom directed the helmsman as to his course and the little yacht was admirably handled through the dangers  i begin to think we shall do it tom said to jack harvey who was standing close to him another five minutes and we shall be within reach of her  it could be seen now that there was a group of people clustered in the bow of the wreck two or three light lines were coiled in readiness for throwing  now watkins tom said going aft make straight for the wreck i see no broken water between us and them and possibly there may be deep water under their bow  it was an anxious moment as with the sails flattened in the yawl forged up nearly in the eye of the wind towards the wreck her progress was slow for she was now stemming the current  tom stood with a coil of line in his hand in the bow  you get ready to throw jack if i miss  nearer and nearer the yacht approached the wreck until the bowsprit of the latter seemed to stand almost over her then tom threw the line it fell over the bowsprit and a cheer broke from those on board the wreck and from the sailors of the seabird a stronger line was at once fastened to that thrown and to this a strong hawser was attached  down with the helm watkins now lads lower away the trysail as fast as you can now one of you clear that hawser as they haul on it now out with the anchors  these had been got into readiness it was not thought that they would get any hold on the rocky bottom still they might catch on a projecting ledge and at any rate their weight and that of the chain cable would relieve the strain upon the hawser  two sailors had run out on the bowsprit of the wreck as soon as the line was thrown and the end of the hawser was now on board the steamer  thank god theres grantham jack harvey exclaimed do you see him waving his hand  i see him tom said but i dont see the ladies  they are there no doubt jack said confidently crouching down i expect he would not be there if they werent you may be sure yes there they are those two muffledup figures there one of them has thrown back her cloak and is waving her arm  the two young men waved their caps  are the anchors holding watkins theres a tremendous strain on that hawser  i think so sir they are both tight  put them round the windlass and give a turn or two we must relieve the strain on that hawser  since they had first seen the wreck the waves had made great progress in the work of destruction and the steamer had broken in two just aft of the engines  get over the spare spars watkins and fasten them to float in front of her bows like a triangle matthews catch hold of that boathook and try to fend off any piece of timber that comes along you get hold of the sweeps lads and do the same they would stave her in like a nutshell if they struck her  thank god here comes the first of them  those on board the steamer had not been idle as soon as the yawl was seen approaching slings were prepared and no sooner was the hawser securely fixed than the slings were attached to it and a woman placed in them the hawser was tight and the descent sharp and without a check the figure ran down to the deck of the seabird she was lifted out of the slings by tom and jack harvey who found she was an old woman and had entirely lost consciousness  two of you carry her down below tell johnson to pour a little brandy down her throat give her some hot soup as soon as she comes to  another woman was lowered and helped below the next to descend was mrs grantham  thank god you are rescued tom said as he helped her out of the sling  thank god indeed mrs grantham said and thank you all oh tom we have had a terrible time of it and had lost all hope till we saw your sail and even then the captain said that he was afraid nothing could be done minnie was the first to make out it was you and then we began to hope she has been so brave dear girl ah here she comes  but minnies firmness came to an end now that she felt the need for it was over she was unable to stand when she was lifted from the slings and tom carried her below  are there any more women mrs grantham  no there was only one other lady passenger and the stewardess  then you had better take possession of your own cabin i ordered johnson to spread a couple more mattresses and some bedding on the floor so you will all four be able to turn in theres plenty of hot coffee and soup i should advise soup with two or three spoonfuls of brandy in it now excuse me i must go upon deck  twelve men descended by the hawser one of them with both legs broken by the fall of the mizzen the last to come was the captain  is that all tom asked  that is all the captain said six men were swept overboard when she first struck and two were killed by the fall of the funnel fortunately we had only three gentlemen passengers and three ladies on board the weather looked so wild when we started that no one else cared about making the passage god bless you sir for what you have done another halfhour and it would have been all over with us but it seems like a miracle your getting safe through the rocks to us  it was fortunate indeed that we came along tom said three of the passengers are dear friends of mine and as it was by my persuasion that they came across in the steamer instead of in the yacht i should never have forgiven myself if they had been lost take all your men below captain you will find plenty of hot soup there now watkins let us be off that steamer wont hold together many minutes longer so theres no time to lose we will go back as we came give me a hatchet now lads two of you stand at the chaincables knock out the shackles the moment i cut the hawser watkins you take the helm and let her head pay off till the jib fills jack you lend a hand to the other two and get up the trysail again as soon as we are free  in a moment all were at their stations the helm was put on the yacht and she payed off on the opposite tack to that on which she had before been sailing as soon as the jib filled tom gave two vigorous blows with his hatchet on the hawser and as he lifted his hand for a third it parted then came the sharp rattle of the chains as they ran round the hawserholes the trysail was hoisted and sheeted home and the seabird was under way again tom as before conned the ship from the bow several times she was in close proximity to the rocks but each time she avoided them a shout of gladness rose from all on deck as she passed the last patch of white water then she tacked and bore away for jersey  tom had now time to go down below and look after his passengers they consisted of the captain and two sailorsthe sole survivors of those who had been on deck when the vessel struckthree male passengers and six engineers and stokers  i have not had time to shake you by the hand before tom grantham said as tom virtue entered and i thought you would not want me on deck at present god bless you old fellow we all owe you our lives  how did it happen captain tom asked as the captain also came up to him  it was the currents i suppose the captain said it was so thick we could not see a quarter of a mile any way the weather was so wild i would not put into guernsey and passed the island without seeing it i steered my usual course but the gale must have altered the currents for i thought i was three miles away from the reef when we saw it on our beam not a hundred yards away it was too late to avoid it then and in another minute we ran upon it and the waves were sweeping over us every one behaved well i got all except those who had been swept overboard or crushed by the funnel up into the bow of the ship and there we waited there was nothing to be done no boat would live for a moment in the sea on that reef and all i could advise was that when she went to pieces every one should try to get hold of a floating fragment but i doubt whether a man would have been alive a quarter of an hour after she went to pieces  perhaps captain you will come on deck with me and give me the benefit of your advice my skipper and i know the islands pretty well but no doubt you know them a good deal better and i dont want another mishap  but the seabird avoided all further dangers and as it became dark the lights of st heliers were in sight and an hour later the yacht brought up in the port and landed her involuntary passengers  a fortnight afterwards the seabird returned to england and two months later mrs grantham had the satisfaction of being present at the ceremony which was the successful consummation of her little scheme in inviting minnie graham to be her companion on board the seabird  well my dear her husband said when she indulged in a little natural triumph i do not say that it has not turned out well and i am heartily glad for both tom and minnies sake it has so but you must allow that it very nearly had a disastrous ending and i think if i were you i should leave matters to take their natural course in future i have accepted toms invitation for the same party to take a cruise in the seabird next summer but i have bargained that next time a storm is brewing up we shall stop quietly in port  thats all very well james mrs grantham said saucily but you must remember that tom virtue will only be firstmate of the seabird in future  that i shall be able to tell you better my dear after our next cruise all husbands are not as docile and easily led as i am     illustration  a pipe of mystery   a jovial party were gathered round a blazing fire in an old grange near warwick the hour was getting late the very little ones had after dancing round the christmastree enjoying the snapdragon and playing a variety of games gone off to bed and the elder boys and girls now gathered round their uncle colonel harley and asked him for a storyabove all a ghost story  but i have never seen any ghosts the colonel said laughing and moreover i dont believe in them one bit i have travelled pretty well all over the world i have slept in houses said to be haunted but nothing have i seenno noises that could not be accounted for by rats or the wind have i ever heard i have neverand here he pausednever but once met with any circumstances or occurrence that could not be accounted for by the light of reason and i know you prefer hearing stories of my own adventures to mere invention  yes uncle but what was the once when circumstances happened that you could not explain  its rather a long story the colonel said and its getting late  oh no no uncle it does not matter a bit how late we sit up on christmas eve and the longer the story is the better and if you dont believe in ghosts how can it be a story of something you could not account for by the light of nature  you will see when i have done the colonel said it is rather a story of what the scotch call second sight than one of ghosts as to accounting for it you shall form your own opinion when you have heard me to the end  i landed in india in 50 and after going through the regular drill work marched with a detachment up country to join my regiment which was stationed at jubbalpore in the very heart of india it has become an important place since the railroad across india passes through it and no end of changes have taken place but at that time it was one of the most outoftheway stations in india and i may say one of the most pleasant it lay high there was capital boating on the nerbudda and above all it was a grand place for sport for it lay at the foot of the hill country an immense district then but little known covered with forests and jungle and abounding with big game of all kinds  my great friend there was a man named simmonds he was just of my own standing we had come out in the same ship had marched up the country together and were almost like brothers he was an old etonian i an old westminster and we were both fond of boating and indeed of sport of all kinds but i am not going to tell you of that now the people in these hills are called gonds a true hill tribethat is to say aborigines somewhat of the negro type the chiefs are of mixed blood but the people are almost black they are supposed to accept the religion of the hindus but are in reality deplorably ignorant and superstitious their priests are a sort of compound of a brahmin priest and a negro fetish man and among their principal duties is that of charming away tigers from the villages by means of incantations there as in other parts of india were a few wandering fakirs who enjoyed an immense reputation for holiness and wisdom the people would go to them from great distances for charms or predictions and believed in their power with implicit faith  at the time when we were at jubbalpore there was one of these fellows whose reputation altogether eclipsed that of his rivals and nothing could be done until his permission had been asked and his blessing obtained all sorts of marvellous stories were constantly coming to our ears of the unerring foresight with which he predicted the termination of diseases both in men and animals and so generally was he believed in that the colonel ordered that no one connected with the regiment should consult him for these predictions very frequently brought about their own fulfilment for those who were told that an illness would terminate fatally lost all hope and literally lay down to die  however many of the stories that we heard could not be explained on these grounds and the fakir and his doings were often talked over at mess some of the officers scoffing at the whole business others maintaining that some of these fakirs had in some way or another the power of foretelling the future citing many well authenticated anecdotes upon the subject  the older officers were the believers we young fellows were the scoffers but for the wellknown fact that it is very seldom indeed that these fakirs will utter any of their predictions to europeans some of us would have gone to him to test his powers as it was none of us had ever seen him  he lived in an old ruined temple in the middle of a large patch of jungle at the foot of the hills some ten or twelve miles away  i had been at jubbalpore about a year when i was woke up one night by a native who came in to say that at about eight oclock a tiger had killed a man in his village and had dragged off the body  simmonds and i were constantly out after tigers and the people in all the villages within twenty miles knew that we were always ready to pay for early information this tiger had been doing great damage and had carried off about thirty men women and children so great was the fear of him indeed that the people in the neighbourhood he frequented scarcely dared stir out of doors except in parties of five or six we had had several hunts after him but like all maneaters he was old and awfully crafty and although we got several snap shots at him he had always managed to save his skin  in a quarter of an hour after the receipt of the message charley simmonds and i were on the back of an elephant which was our joint property our shekarry a capital fellow was on foot beside us and with the native trotting on ahead as guide we went off at the best pace of old begaum for that was the elephants name the village was fifteen miles away but we got there soon after daybreak and were received with delight by the population in half an hour the hunt was organized all the male population turned out as beaters with sticks guns tomtoms and other instruments for making a noise  the trail was not difficult to find a broad path with occasional smears of blood showed where he had dragged his victim through the long grass to a cluster of trees a couple of hundred yards from the village  we scarcely expected to find him there but the villagers held back while we went forward with cocked rifles we found however nothing but a few bones and a quantity of blood the tiger had made off at the approach of daylight into the jungle which was about two miles distant we traced him easily enough and found that he had entered a large ravine from which several smaller ones branched off  it was an awkward place as it was next to impossible to surround it with the number of people at our command we posted them at last all along the upper ground and told them to make up in noise what they wanted in numbers at last all was ready and we gave the signal however i am not telling you a hunting story and need only say that we could neither find nor disturb him in vain we pushed begaum through the thickest of the jungle which clothed the sides and bottom of the ravine while the men shouted beat their tomtoms and showered imprecations against the tiger himself and his ancestors up to the remotest generations  the day was tremendously hot and after three hours march we gave it up for a time and lay down in the shade while the shekarries made a long examination of the ground all round the hillside to be sure that he had not left the ravine they came back with the news that no traces could be discovered and that beyond a doubt he was still there a tiger will crouch up in an exceedingly small clump of grass or bush and will sometimes almost allow himself to be trodden on before moving however we determined to have one more search and if that should prove unsuccessful to send off to jubbalpore for some more of the men to come out with elephants while we kept up a circle of fires and of noises of all descriptions so as to keep him a prisoner until the arrival of the reinforcements our next search was no more successful than our first had been and having as we imagined examined every clump and crevice in which he could have been concealed we had just reached the upper end of the ravine when we heard a tremendous roar followed by a perfect babel of yells and screams from the natives  the outburst came from the mouth of the ravine and we felt at once that he had escaped we hurried back to find as we had expected that the tiger was gone he had burst out suddenly from his hidingplace had seized a native torn him horribly and had made across the open plain  this was terribly provoking but we had nothing to do but follow him this was easy enough and we traced him to a detached patch of wood and jungle two miles distant this wood was four or five hundred yards across and the exclamations of the people at once told us that it was the one in which stood the ruined temple of the fakir of whom i have been telling you i forgot to say that as the tiger broke out one of the village shekarries had fired at and he declared wounded him  it was already getting late in the afternoon and it was hopeless to attempt to beat the jungle that night we therefore sent off a runner with a note to the colonel asking him to send the workelephants and to allow a party of volunteers to march over at night to help surround the jungle when we commenced beating it in the morning  we based our request upon the fact that the tiger was a notorious maneater and had been doing immense damage we then had a talk with our shekarry sent a man off to bring provisions for the people out with us and then set them to work cutting sticks and grass to make a circle of fires  we both felt much uneasiness respecting the fakir who might be seized at any moment by the enraged tiger the natives would not allow that there was any cause for fear as the tiger would not dare to touch so holy a man our belief in the respect of the tiger for sanctity was by no means strong and we determined to go in and warn him of the presence of the brute in the wood it was a mission which we could not intrust to anyone else for no native would have entered the jungle for untold gold so we mounted the begaum again and started the path leading towards the temple was pretty wide and as we went along almost noiselessly for the elephant was too well trained to tread upon fallen sticks it was just possible we might come upon the tiger suddenly so we kept our rifles in readiness in our hands  presently we came in sight of the ruins no one was at first visible but at that very moment the fakir came out from the temple he did not see or hear us for we were rather behind him and still among the trees but at once proceeded in a high voice to break into a singsong prayer he had not said two words before his voice was drowned in a terrific roar and in an instant the tiger had sprung upon him struck him to the ground seized him as a cat would a mouse and started off with him at a trot the brute evidently had not detected our presence for he came right towards us we halted the begaum and with our fingers on the triggers awaited the favourable moment he was a hundred yards from us when he struck down his victim he was not more than fifty when he caught sight of us he stopped for an instant in surprise charley muttered both barrels harley and as the beast turned to plunge into the jungle and so showed us his side we sent four bullets crashing into him and he rolled over lifeless  we went up to the spot made the begaum give him a kick to be sure that he was dead and then got down to examine the unfortunate fakir the tiger had seized him by the shoulder which was terribly torn and the bone broken he was still perfectly conscious  we at once fired three shots our usual signal that the tiger was dead and in a few minutes were surrounded by the villagers who hardly knew whether to be delighted at the death of their enemy or to grieve over the injury to the fakir we proposed taking the latter to our hospital at jubbalpore but this he positively refused to listen to however we finally persuaded him to allow his arm to be set and the wounds dressed in the first place by our regimental surgeon after which he could go to one of the native villages and have his arm dressed in accordance with his own notions a litter was soon improvised and away we went to jubbalpore which we reached about eight in the evening  the fakir refused to enter the hospital so we brought out a couple of trestles laid the litter upon them and the surgeon set his arm and dressed his wounds by torchlight when he was lifted into a dhoolie and his bearers again prepared to start for the village  hitherto he had only spoken a few words but he now briefly expressed his deep gratitude to simmonds and myself we told him that we would ride over to see him shortly and hoped to find him getting on rapidly another minute and he was gone  it happened that we had three or four fellows away on leave or on staff duty and several others knocked up with fever just about this time so that the duty fell very heavily upon the rest of us and it was over a month before we had time to ride over to see the fakir  we had heard he was going on well but we were surprised on reaching the village to find that he had already returned to his old abode in the jungle however we had made up our minds to see him especially as we had agreed that we would endeavour to persuade him to do a prediction for us so we turned our horses heads towards the jungle we found the fakir sitting on a rock in front of the temple just where he had been seized by the tiger he rose as we rode up  i knew that you would come today sahibs and was joyful in the thought of seeing those who have preserved my life  we are glad to see you looking pretty strong again though your arm is still in a sling i said for simmonds was not strong in hindustani  how did you know that we were coming i asked when we had tied up our horses  siva has given to his servant to know many things he said quietly  did you know beforehand that the tiger was going to seize you i asked  i knew that a great danger threatened and that siva would not let me die before my time had come  could you see into our future i asked  the fakir hesitated looked at me for a moment earnestly to see if i was speaking in mockery and then said  the sahibs do not believe in the power of siva or of his servants they call his messengers impostors and scoff at them when they speak of the events of the future  no indeed i said my friend and i have no idea of scoffing we have heard of so many of your predictions coming true that we are really anxious that you should tell us something of the future  the fakir nodded his head went into the temple and returned in a minute or two with two small pipes used by the natives for opiumsmoking and a brazier of burning charcoal the pipes were already charged he made signs to us to sit down and took his place in front of us then he began singing in a low voice rocking himself to and fro and waving a staff which he held in his hand gradually his voice rose and his gesticulations and actions became more violent so far as i could make out it was a prayer to siva that he would give some glimpse of the future which might benefit the sahibs who had saved the life of his servant presently he darted forward gave us each a pipe took two pieces of redhot charcoal from the brazier in his fingers without seeming to know that they were warm and placed them in the pipes then he recommenced his singing and gesticulations  a glance at charley to see if like myself he was ready to carry the thing through and then i put the pipe to my lips i felt at once that it was opium of which i had before made experiment but mixed with some other substance which was i imagine haschish a preparation of hemp a few puffs and i felt a drowsiness creeping over me i saw as through a mist the fakir swaying himself backwards and forwards his arms waving and his face distorted another minute and the pipe slipped from my fingers and i fell back insensible  how long i lay there i do not know i woke with a strange and not unpleasant sensation and presently became conscious that the fakir was gently pressing with a sort of shampooing action my temples and head when he saw that i opened my eyes he left me and performed the same process upon charley in a few minutes he rose from his stooping position waved his hand in token of adieu and walked slowly back into the temple  as he disappeared i sat up charley did the same  we stared at each other for a minute without speaking and then charley said  this is a rum go and no mistake old man  youre right charley my opinion is weve made fools of ourselves lets be off out of this  we staggered to our feet for we both felt like drunken men made our way to our horses poured a mussuk of water over our heads took a drink of brandy from our flasks and then feeling more like ourselves mounted and rode out of the jungle  well harley if the glimpse of futurity which i had is true all i can say is that it was extremely unpleasant  that was just my case charley  my dream or whatever you like to call it was about a mutiny of the men  you dont say so charley so was mine this is monstrously strange to say the least of it however you tell your story first and then i will tell mine  it was very short charley said we were at messnot in our present messroomwe were dining with the fellows of some other regiment suddenly without any warning the windows were filled with a crowd of sepoys who opened fire right and left into us half the fellows were shot down at once the rest of us made a rush to our swords just as the niggers came swarming into the room there was a desperate fight for a moment i remember that subadar piránone of the best native officers in the regiment by the waymade a rush at me and i shot him through the head with a revolver at the same moment a ball hit me and down i went at the moment a sepoy fell dead across me hiding me partly from sight the fight lasted a minute or two longer i fancy a few fellows escaped for i heard shots outside then the place became quiet in another minute i heard a crackling and saw that the devils had set the messroom on fire one of our men who was lying close by me got up and crawled to the window but he was shot down the moment he showed himself i was hesitating whether to do the same or to lie still and be smothered when suddenly i rolled the dead sepoy off crawled into the anteroom halfsuffocated by smoke raised the lid of a very heavy trapdoor and stumbled down some steps into a place half storehouse half cellar under the messroom how i knew about it being there i dont know the trap closed over my head with a bang that is all i remember  well charley curiously enough my dream was also about an extraordinary escape from danger lasting like yours only a minute or two the first thing i rememberthere seems to have been something before but what i dont knowi was on horseback holding a very pretty but awfully pale girl in front of me we were pursued by a whole troop of sepoy cavalry who were firing pistolshots at us we were not more than seventy or eighty yards in front and they were gaining fast just as i rode into a large deserted temple in the centre was a huge stone figure i jumped off my horse with the lady and as i did so she said blow out my brains edward dont let me fall alive into their hands  instead of answering i hurried her round behind the idol pushed against one of the leaves of a flower in the carving and the stone swung back and showed a hole just large enough to get through with a stone staircase inside the body of the idol made no doubt for the priest to go up and give responses through the mouth i hurried the girl through crept in after her and closed the stone just as our pursuers came clattering into the courtyard that is all i remember  well it is monstrously rum charley said after a pause did you understand what the old fellow was singing about before he gave us the pipes  yes i caught the general drift it was an entreaty to siva to give us some glimpse of futurity which might benefit us  we lit our cheroots and rode for some miles at a brisk canter without remark when we were within a short distance of home we reined up  i feel ever so much better charley said we have got that opium out of our heads now how do you account for it all harley  i account for it in this way charley the opium naturally had the effect of making us both dream and as we took similar doses of the same mixture under similar circumstances it is scarcely extraordinary that it should have effected the same portion of the brain and caused a certain similarity in our dreams in all nightmares something terrible happens or is on the point of happening and so it was here not unnaturally in both our cases our thoughts turned to soldiers if you remember there was a talk at mess some little time since as to what would happen in the extremely unlikely event of the sepoys mutinying in a body i have no doubt that was the foundation of both our dreams it is all natural enough when we come to think it over calmly i think by the way we had better agree to say nothing at all about it in the regiment  i should think not charley said we should never hear the end of it they would chaff us out of our lives  we kept our secret and came at last to laugh over it heartily when we were together then the subject dropped and by the end of a year had as much escaped our minds as any other dream would have done three months after the affair the regiment was ordered down to allahabad and the change of place no doubt helped to erase all memory of the dream four years after we had left jubbalpore we went to beerapore the time is very marked in my memory because the very week we arrived there your aunt then miss gardiner came out from england to her father our colonel the instant i saw her i was impressed with the idea that i knew her intimately i recollected her face her figure and the very tone of her voice but wherever i had met her i could not conceive upon the occasion of my first introduction to her i could not help telling her that i was convinced that we had met and asking her if she did not remember it no she did not remember but very likely she might have done so and she suggested the names of several people at whose houses we might have met i did not know any of them presently she asked how long i had been out in india  six years i said  and how old mr harley she said do you take me to be  i saw in one instant my stupidity and was stammering out an apology when she went on  i am very little over eighteen mr harley although i evidently look ever so many years older but papa can certify to my age so i was only twelve when you left england  i tried in vain to clear matters up your aunt would insist that i took her to be forty and the fun that my blunder made rather drew us together and gave me a start over the other fellows at the station half of whom fell straightway in love with her some months went on and when the mutiny broke out we were engaged to be married it is a proof of how completely the opiumdreams had passed out of the minds of both simmonds and myself that even when rumours of general disaffection among the sepoys began to be current they never once recurred to us and even when the news of the actual mutiny reached us we were just as confident as were the others of the fidelity of our own regiment it was the old story foolish confidence and black treachery as at very many other stations the mutiny broke out when we were at mess our regiment was dining with the 34th bengalees suddenly just as dinner was over the window was opened and a tremendous fire poured in four or five men fell dead at once and the poor colonel who was next to me was shot right through the head every one rushed to his sword and drew his pistolfor we had been ordered to carry pistols as part of our uniform i was next to charley simmonds as the sepoys of both regiments headed by subadar pirán poured in at the windows  i have it now charley said it is the scene i dreamed  as he spoke he fired his revolver at the subadar who fell dead in his tracks  a sepoy close by levelled his musket and fired charley fell and the fellow rushed forward to bayonet him as he did so i sent a bullet through his head and he fell across charley it was a wild fight for a minute or two and then a few of us made a sudden rush together cut our way through the mutineers and darted through an open window on to the parade there were shouts shots and screams from the officers bungalows and in several places flames were already rising what became of the other men i knew not i made as hard as i could tear for the colonels bungalow suddenly i came upon a sowar sitting on his horse watching the rising flames before he saw me i was on him and ran him through i leapt on his horse and galloped down to gardiners compound i saw lots of sepoys in and around the bungalow all engaged in looting i dashed into the compound  may may i shouted where are you  i had scarcely spoken before a dark figure rushed out of a clump of bushes close by with a scream of delight  in an instant she was on the horse before me and shooting down a couple of fellows who made a rush at my reins i dashed out again stray shots were fired after us but fortunately the sepoys were all busy looting most of them had laid down their muskets and no one really took up the pursuit i turned off from the paradeground dashed down between the hedges of two compounds and in another minute we were in the open country  fortunately the cavalry were all down looting their own lines or we must have been overtaken at once may happily had fainted as i lifted her on to my horsehappily because the fearful screams that we heard from the various bungalows almost drove me mad and would probably have killed her for the poor ladies were all her intimate friends  i rode on for some hours till i felt quite safe from any immediate pursuit and then we halted in the shelter of a clump of trees  by this time i had heard mays story she had felt uneasy at being alone but had laughed at herself for being so until upon her speaking to one of the servants he had answered in a tone of gross insolence which had astonished her she at once guessed that there was danger and the moment that she was alone caught up a large dark carriage rug wrapped it round her so as to conceal her white dress and stole out into the verandah the night was dark and scarcely had she left the house than she heard a burst of firing across at the messhouse she at once ran in among the bushes and crouched there as she heard the rush of men into the room she had just left she heard them searching for her but they were looking for a white dress and her dark rug saved her what she must have suffered in the five minutes between the firing of the first shots and my arrival she only knows may had spoken but very little since we started i believe that she was certain that her father was dead although i had given an evasive answer when she asked me and her terrible sense of loss added to the horror of that time of suspense in the garden had completely stunned her we waited in the tope until the afternoon and then set out again  we had gone but a short distance when we saw a body of the rebel cavalry in pursuit they had no doubt been scouring the country generally and the discovery was accidental for a short time we kept away from them but this could not be for long as our horse was carrying double i made for a sort of ruin i saw at the foot of a hill half a mile away i did so with no idea of the possibility of concealment my intention was simply to get my back to a rock and to sell my life as dearly as i could keeping the last two barrels of the revolver for ourselves certainly no remembrance of my dream influenced me in any way and in the wild whirl of excitement i had not given a second thought to charley simmonds exclamation as we rode up to the ruins only a hundred yards ahead of us may said  blow out my brains edward dont let me fall alive into their hands  a shock of remembrance shot across me the chase her pale face the words the templeall my dream rushed into my mind  we are saved i cried to her amazement as we rode into the courtyard in whose centre a great figure was sitting  i leapt from the horse snatched the mussuk of water from the saddle and then hurried may round the idol between which and the rock behind there was but just room to get along  not a doubt entered my mind but that i should find the spring as i had dreamed sure enough there was the carving fresh upon my memory as if i had seen it but the day before i placed my hand on the leaflet without hesitation a solid stone moved back i hurried my amazed companion in and shut to the stone i found and shot to a massive bolt evidently placed to prevent the door being opened by accident or design when anyone was in the idol  at first it seemed quite dark but a faint light streamed in from above we made our way up the stairs and found that the light came through a number of small holes pierced in the upper part of the head and through still smaller holes lower down not much larger than a goodsized knittingneedle could pass through these holes we afterwards found were in the ornaments round the idols neck the holes enlarged inside and enabled us to have a view all round  the mutineers were furious at our disappearance and for hours searched about then saying that we must be hidden somewhere and that they would wait till we came out they proceeded to bivouac in the courtyard of the temple  we passed four terrible days but on the morning of the fifth a scout came in to tell the rebels that a column of british troops marching on delhi would pass close by the temple they therefore hastily mounted and galloped off  three quarters of an hour later we were safe among our own people a fortnight afterwards your aunt and i were married it was no time for ceremony then there were no means of sending her away no place where she could have waited until the time for her mourning for her father was over so we were married quietly by one of the chaplains of the troops and as your storybooks say have lived very happily ever after  and how about mr simmonds uncle did he get safe off too  yes his dream came as vividly to his mind as mine had done he crawled to the place where he knew the trapdoor would be and got into the cellar fortunately for him there were plenty of eatables there and he lived there in concealment for a fortnight after that he crawled out and found the mutineers had marched for delhi he went through a lot but at last joined us before that city we often talked over our dreams together and there was no question that we owed our lives to them even then we did not talk much to other people about them for there would have been a lot of talk and inquiry and questions and you know fellows hate that sort of thing so we held our tongues poor charleys silence was sealed a year later at lucknow for on the advance with lord clyde he was killed  and now boys and girls you must run off to bed five minutes more and it will be christmasday so you see frank that although i dont believe in ghosts i have yet met with a circumstance which i cannot account for  it is very curious anyhow uncle and beats ghost stories into fits  i like it better certainly one of the girls said for we can go to bed without being afraid of dreaming about it  well you must not talk any more now off to bed off to bed colonel harley said or i shall get into terrible disgrace with your fathers and mothers who have been looking very gravely at me for the last three quarters of an hour  illustration     illustration  whitefaced dick  a story of pinetree gulch   how pinetree gulch got its name no one knew for in the early days every ravine and hillside was thickly covered with pines it may be that a tree of exceptional size caught the eye of the first explorer that he camped under it and named the place in its honour or may be some fallen giant lay in the bottom and hindered the work of the first prospectors at any rate pinetree gulch it was and the name was as good as any other the pinetrees were gone now cut up for firing or for the erection of huts or the construction of sluices but the hillside was ragged with their stumps  the principal camp was at the mouth of the gulch where the little stream which scarce afforded water sufficient for the cradles in the dry season but which was a rushing torrent in winter joined the yuba the best ground was at the junction of the streams and lay indeed in the yuba valley rather than in the gulch at first most gold had been found higher up but there was here comparatively little depth down to the bedrock and as the ground became exhausted the miners moved down towards the mouth of the gulch they were doing well as a whole how well no one knew for miners are chary of giving information as to what they are making still it was certain they were doing well for the bars were doing a roaring trade and the storekeepers never refused credita proof in itself that the prospects were good  the flat at the mouth of the gulch was a busy scene every foot was good paying stuff for in the eddy where the torrents in winter rushed down into the yuba the gold had settled down and lay thick among the gravel but most of the parties were sinking and it was a long way down to the bedrock for the hills on both sides sloped steeply and the yuba must here at one time have rushed through a narrow gorge until in some wild freak it brought down millions of tons of gravel and resumed its course seventy feet above its former level  a quarter of a mile higher up a ledge of rock ran across the valley and over it in the old time the yuba had poured in a cascade seventy feet deep into the ravine but the rock now was level with the gravel only showing its jagged points here and there above it this ledge had been invaluable to the diggers without it they could only have sunk their shafts with the greatest difficulty for the gravel would have been full of water and even with the greatest pains in puddling and timberwork the pumps would scarcely have sufficed to keep it down as it rose in the bottom of the shafts but the miners had made common cause together and giving each so many ounces of gold or so many days work had erected a dam thirty feet high along the ledge of rock and had cut a channel for the yuba along the lower slopes of the valley of course when the rain set in as everybody knew the dam would go and the river diggings must be abandoned till the water subsided and a fresh dam was made but there were two months before them yet and every one hoped to be down to the bedrock before the water interrupted their work  the hillside both in the yuba valley and for some distance along pinetree gulch was dotted by shanties and tents the former constructed for the most part of logs roughly squared the walls being some three feet in height on which the sharp sloping roof was placed thatched in the first place with boughs and made all snug perhaps with an old sail stretched over all the camp was quiet enough during the day the few women were away with their washing at the pools a quarter of a mile up the gulch and the only persons to be seen about were the men told off for cooking for their respective parties  but in the evening the camp was lively groups of men in red shirts and corded trousers tied at the knee in high boots sat round blazing fires and talked of their prospects or discussed the news of the luck at other camps the sound of music came from two or three plank erections which rose conspicuously above the huts of the diggers and were bright externally with the glories of white and coloured paints to and from these men were always sauntering and it needed not the clink of glasses and the sound of music to tell that they were the bars of the camp  here standing at the counter or seated at numerous small tables men were drinking villainous liquor smoking and talking and paying but scant attention to the strains of the fiddle or the accordion save when some wellknown air was played when all would join in a boisterous chorus some were always passing in or out of a door which led into a room behind here there was comparative quiet for men were gambling and gambling high  going backwards and forwards with liquors into the gamblingroom of the imperial saloon which stood just where pinetree gulch opened into yuba valley was a lad whose appearance had earned for him the name of whitefaced dick  whitefaced dick was not one of those who had done well at pinetree gulch he had come across the plains with his father who had died when halfway over and dick had been thrown on the world to shift for himself nature had not intended him for the work for he was a delicate timid lad what spirits he originally had having been years before beaten out of him by a brutal father so far indeed dick was the better rather than the worse for the event which had left him an orphan  they had been travelling with a large party for mutual security against indians and mormons and so long as the journey lasted dick had got on fairly well he was always ready to do odd jobs and as the draught cattle were growing weaker and weaker and every pound of weight was of importance no one grudged him his rations in return for his services but when the company began to descend the slopes of the sierra nevada they began to break up going off by twos and threes to the diggings of which they heard such glowing accounts some however kept straight on to sacramento determining there to obtain news as to the doings at all the different places and then to choose that which seemed to offer the best prospects of success  dick proceeded with them to the town and there found himself alone his companions were absorbed in the busy rush of population and each had so much to provide and arrange for that none gave a thought to the solitary boy however at that time no one who had a pair of hands however feeble to work need starve in sacramento and for some weeks dick hung around the town doing odd jobs and then having saved a few dollars determined to try his luck at the diggings and started on foot with a shovel on his shoulder and a few days provisions slung across it  arrived at his destination the lad soon discovered that golddigging was hard work for brawny and seasoned men and after a few feeble attempts in spots abandoned as worthless he gave up the effort and again began to drift and even in pinetree gulch it was not difficult to get a living at first he tried rocking cradles but the work was far harder than it appeared he was standing ankle deep in water from morning till night and his cheeks grew paler and his strength instead of increasing seemed to fade away still there were jobs within his strength he could keep a fire alight and watch a cookingpot he could carry up buckets of water or wash a flannel shirt and so he struggled on until at last some kindhearted man suggested to him that he should try to get a place at the new saloon which was about to be opened  you are not fit for this work young un and you ought to be at home with your mother if you like i will go up with you this evening to jeffries i knew him down on the flats and i daresay he will take you on i dont say as a saloon is a good place for a boy still you will always get your bellyful of victuals and a dry place to sleep in if its only under a table what do you say  dick thankfully accepted the offer and on red georges recommendation was that evening engaged his work was not hard now for till the miners knocked off there was little doing in the saloon a few men would come in for a drink at dinnertime but it was not until the lamps were lit that business began in earnest and then for four or five hours dick was busy  a rougher or healthier lad would not have minded the work but to dick it was torture every nerve in his body thrilled whenever rough miners cursed him for not carrying out their orders more quickly or for bringing them the wrong liquors which as his brain was in a whirl with the noise the shouting and the multiplicity of orders happened frequently he might have fared worse had not red george always stood his friend and red george was an authority in pinetree gulchpowerful in frame reckless in bearing and temper he had been in a score of fights and had come off them if not unscathed at least victorious he was notoriously a lucky digger but his earnings went as fast as they were made and he was always ready to open his belt and give a bountiful pinch of dust to any mate down on his luck  one evening dick was more helpless and confused than usual the saloon was full and he had been shouted at and badgered and cursed until he scarcely knew what he was doing high play was going on in the saloon and a good many men were clustered round the table red george was having a run of luck and there was a big pile of gold dust on the table before him one of the gamblers who was losing had ordered old rye and instead of bringing it to him dick brought a tumbler of hot liquor which someone else had called for with an oath the man took it up and threw it in his face  you cowardly hound red george exclaimed are you man enough to do that to a man  you bet the gambler who was a new arrival at pinetree gulch replied and picking up an empty glass he hurled it at red george the bystanders sprang aside and in a moment the two men were facing each other with outstretched pistols the two reports rung out simultaneously red george sat down unconcernedly with a streak of blood flowing down his face where the bullet had cut a furrow in his cheek the stranger fell back with the bullet hole in the centre of his forehead  the body was carried outside and the play continued as if no interruption had taken place they were accustomed to such occurrences in pinetree gulch and the piece of ground at the top of the hill that had been set aside as a burial place was already dotted thickly with graves filled in almost every instance by men who had died in the local phraseology with their boots on  neither then nor afterwards did red george allude to the subject to dick whose life after this signal instance of his championship was easier than it had hitherto been for there were few in pinetree gulch who cared to excite red georges anger and strangers going to the place were sure to receive a friendly warning that it was best for their health to keep their tempers over any shortcomings on the part of whitefaced dick  grateful as he was for red georges interference on his behalf dick felt the circumstance which had ensued more than anyone else in the camp with others it was the subject of five minutes talk but dick could not get out of his head the thought of the dead mans face as he fell back he had seen many such frays before but he was too full of his own troubles for them to make much impression upon him but in the present case he felt as if he himself was responsible for the death of the gambler if he had not blundered this would not have happened he wondered whether the dead man had a wife and children and if so were they expecting his return would they ever hear where he had died and how  but this feeling which tired out as he was when the time came for closing the bar often prevented him from sleeping for hours in no way lessened his gratitude and devotion towards red george and he felt that he could die willingly if his life would benefit his champion sometimes he thought too that his life would not be much to give for in spite of shelter and food the cough which he had caught while working in the water still clung to him and as his employer said to him angrily one day  your victuals dont do you no good dick you get thinner and thinner and folks will think as i starve you darned if you aint a disgrace to the establishment  the wind was whistling down the gorges and the clouds hung among the pinewoods which still clothed the upper slopes of the hills and the diggers as they turned out one morning looked up apprehensively  but it could not be they assured each other every one knew that the rains were not due for another month yet it could only be a passing shower if it rained at all  but as the morning went on men came in from camps higher up the river and reports were current that it had been raining for the last two days among the upper hills while those who took the trouble to walk across to the new channel could see for themselves at noon that it was filled very nigh to the brim the water rushing along with thick and turbid current but those who repeated the rumours or who reported that the channel was full were summarily put down men would not believe that such a calamity as a flood and the destruction of all their seasons work could be impending there had been some showers no doubt as there had often been before but it was ridiculous to talk of anything like rain a month before its time still in spite of these assertions there was uneasiness at pinetree gulch and men looked at the driving clouds above and shook their heads before they went down to the shafts to work after dinner  when the last customer had left and the bar was closed dick had nothing to do till evening and he wandered outside and sat down on a stump at first looking at the work going on in the valley then so absorbed in his own thoughts that he noticed nothing not even the driving mist which presently set in he was calculating that he had with his savings from his wages and what had been given him by the miners laid by eighty dollars when he got another hundred and twenty he would go he would make his way down to san francisco and then by ship to panama and up to new york and then west again to the village where he was born there would be people there who would know him and who would give him work for his mothers sake he did not care what it was anything would be better than this  then his thoughts came back to pinetree gulch and he started to his feet could he be mistaken were his eyes deceiving him no among the stones and boulders of the old bed of the yuba there was the gleam of water and even as he watched it he could see it widening out he started to run down the hill to give the alarm but before he was halfway he paused for there were loud shouts and a scene of bustle and confusion instantly arose  the cradles were deserted and the men working on the surface loaded themselves with their tools and made for the high ground while those at the windlasses worked their hardest to draw up their comrades below a man coming down from above stopped close to dick with a low cry and stood gazing with a white scared face dick had worked with him he was one of the company to which red george belonged  what is it saunders  my god they are lost the man replied i was at the windlass when they shouted up to me to go up and fetch them a bottle of rum they had just struck it rich and wanted a drink on the strength of it  dick understood at once red george and his mates were still in the bottom of the shaft ignorant of the danger which was threatening them  come on he cried we shall be in time yet and at the top of his speed dashed down the hill followed by saunders  what is it what is it asked parties of men mounting the hill red georges gang are still below  dicks eyes were fixed on the water there was a broad band now of yellow with a white edge down the centre of the stony flat and it was widening with terrible rapidity it was scarce ten yards from the windlass at the top of red georges shaft when dick followed closely by saunders reached it  come up mates quick for your lives the river is rising you will be flooded out directly every one else has gone  as he spoke he pulled at the rope by which the bucket was hanging and the handles of the windlass flew round rapidly as it descended when it had run out dick and he grasped the handles  all right below  an answering call came up and the two began their work throwing their whole strength into it quickly as the windlass revolved it seemed an endless time to dick before the bucket came up and the first man stepped out it was not red george dick had hardly expected it would be red george would be sure to see his two mates up before him and the man uttered a cry of alarm as he saw the water now within a few feet of the mouth of the shaft  it was a torrent now for not only was it coming through the dam but it was rushing down in cascades from the new channel without a word the miner placed himself facing dick and the moment the bucket was again down the three grasped the handles but quickly as they worked the edge of the water was within a few inches of the shaft when the next man reached the surface but again the bucket descended before the rope tightened however the water had began to run over the lipat first in a mere trickle and then almost instantaneously in a cascade which grew larger and larger  the bucket was halfway up when a sound like thunder was heard the ground seemed to tremble under their feet and then at the turn of the valley above a great wave of yellow water crested with foam was seen tearing along at the speed of a racehorse  the dam has burst saunders shouted run for your lives or we are all lost  the three men dropped the handles and ran at full speed towards the shore while loud shouts to dick to follow came from the crowd of men standing on the slope but the boy still grasped the handles and with lips tightly closed still toiled on slowly the bucket ascended for red george was a heavy man then suddenly the weight slackened and the handle went round faster the shaft was filling the water had reached the bucket and had risen to red georges neck so that his weight was no longer on the rope so fast did the water pour in that it was not half a minute before the bucket reached the surface and red george sprang out there was but time for one exclamation and then the great wave struck them red george was whirled like a straw in the current but he was a strong swimmer and at a point where the valley widened out half a mile lower he struggled to shore  two days later the news reached pinetree gulch that a boys body had been washed ashore twenty miles down and ten men headed by red george went and brought it solemnly back to pinetree gulch there among the stumps of pinetrees a grave was dug and there in the presence of the whole camp whitefaced dick was laid to rest  pinetree gulch is a solitude now the trees are growing again and none would dream that it was once a busy scene of industry but if the traveller searches among the pinetrees he will find a stone with the words  here lies whitefaced dick who died to save red george what can a man do more than give his life for a friend  the text was the suggestion of an exclergyman working as a miner in pinetree gulch  red george worked no more at the diggings but after seeing the stone laid in its place went east and with what little money came to him when the common fund of the company was divided after the flood on the yuba bought a small farm and settled down there but to the end of his life he was never weary of telling those who would listen to it the story of pinetree gulch  illustration     illustration  a brush with the chinese  and what came of it   it was early in december that hms perseus was cruising off the mouth of the canton river war had been declared with china in consequence of her continued evasions of the treaty she had made with us and it was expected that a strong naval force would soon gather to bring her to reason in the meantime the ships on the station had a busy time of it chasing the enemys junks when they ventured to show themselves beyond the reach of the guns of their forts and occasionally having a brush with the piratical boats which took advantage of the general confusion to plunder friend as well as foe  the perseus had that afternoon chased two government junks up a creek the sun had already set when they took refuge there and the captain did not care to send his boats after them in the dark as many of the creeks ran up for miles into the flat country and as they not unfrequently had many arms or branches the boats might in the dark miss the junks altogether orders were issued that four boats should be ready for starting at daybreak the next morning the perseus anchored off the mouth of the creek and two boats were ordered to row backwards and forwards off its mouth all night to insure that the enemy did not slip out in the darkness  jack fothergill the senior midshipman was commanding the gig and two of the other midshipmen were going in the pinnace and launch commanded respectively by the first lieutenant and the master the three other midshipmen of the perseus were loud in their lamentations that they were not to take share in the fun  you cant all go you know fothergill said and its no use making a row about it the captain has been very good to let three of us go  its all very well for you jack percy adcock the youngest of the lads replied because you are one of those chosen and it is not so hard for simmons and linthorpe because they went the other day in the boat that chased those junks under shelter of the guns of their battery but i havent had a chance for ever so long  what fun was there in chasing the junks simmons said we never got near the brutes till they were close to their battery and then just as the first shot came singing from their guns and we thought that we were going to have some excitement the first lieutenant sung out easy all and there was nothing for it but to turn round and to row for the ship and a nice hot row it wastwo hours and a half in a broiling sun of course i am not blaming oliphant for the captains orders were strict that we were not to try to cut the junks out if they got under the guns of any of their batteries still it was horribly annoying and i do think the captain might have remembered what beastly luck we had last time and given us a chance tomorrow  it is clear we could not all go fothergill said and naturally enough the captain chose the three seniors besides if you did have bad luck last time you had your chance and i dont suppose we shall have anything more exciting now these fellows always set fire to their junks and row for the shore directly they see us after firing a shot or two wildly in our direction  well jack if you dont expect any fun simmons replied perhaps you wouldnt mind telling the first lieutenant you do not care for going and that i am very anxious to take your place perhaps he will be good enough to allow me to relieve you  a likely thing that fothergill laughed no tom i am sorry you are not going but you must make the best of it till another chance comes  dont you think jack percy adcock said to his senior in a coaxing tone later on you could manage to smuggle me into the boat with you  not i percy suppose you got hurt what would the captain say then and firing as wildly as the chinese do a shot is just as likely to hit your little carcase as to lodge in one of the sailors no you must just make the best of it percy and i promise you that next time there is a boat expedition if you are not put in i will say a good word to the first luff for you  that promise is better than nothing the boy said but i would a deal rather go this time and take my chance next  but you see you cant percy and theres no use talking any more about it i really do not expect there will be any fighting two junks would hardly make any opposition to the boats of the ship and i expect we shall be back by nine oclock with the news that they were well on fire before we came up  percy adcock however was determined if possible to go he was a favourite among the men and when he spoke to the bow oar of the gig the latter promised to do anything he could to aid him to carry out his wishes  we are to start at daybreak tom so that it will be quite dark when the boats are lowered i will creep into the gig before that and hide myself as well as i can under your thwart and all you have got to do is to take no notice of me when the boat is lowered i think they will hardly make me out from the deck especially as you will be standing up in the bow holding on with the boathook till the rest get on board  well sir i will do my best but if you are caught you must not let out that i knew anything about it  i wont do that percy said i dont think there is much chance of my being noticed until we get on board the junks and then they wont know which boat i came off in and the first lieutenant will be too busy to blow me up of course i shall get it when i am on board again but i dont mind that so that i see the fun besides i want to send home some things to my sister and she will like them all the better if i can tell her i captured them on board some junks we seized and burnt  the next morning the crews mustered before daybreak percy had already taken his place under the bow thwart of the gig the davits were swung overboard and two men took their places in her as she was lowered down by the falls as soon as she touched the water the rest of the crew clambered down by the ladder and took their places then fothergill took his seat in the stern and the boat pushed off and lay a few lengths away from the ship until the heavier boats put off as soon as they were under way percy crawled out from his hidingplace and placed himself in the bow where he was sheltered by the body of the oarsmen from fothergills sight  day was just breaking now but it was still dark on the water and the boat rowed very slowly until it became lighter percy could just make out the shores of the creek on both sides they were but two or three feet above the level of the water and were evidently submerged at high tide the creek was about a hundred yards wide and the lad could not see far ahead for it was full of sharp windings and turnings here and there branches joined it but the boats were evidently following the main channel after another halfhours rowing the first lieutenant suddenly gave the order easy all and the men looking over their shoulders saw a village a quarter of a mile ahead with the two junks they had chased the night before lying in front of it almost at the same moment a sudden uproar was hearddrums were beaten and gongs sounded  they are on the lookout for us the first lieutenant said mr mason do you keep with me and attack the junk highest up the river mr bellew and mr fothergill do you take the one lower down row on men  the oars all touched the water together and the four boats leapt forward in a minute a scattering fire of gingals and matchlocks was opened from the junks and the bullets pattered on the water round the boats percy was kneeling up in the bow now as they passed a branch channel three or four hundred yards from the village he started and leapt to his feet  there are four or five junks in that passage fothergill they are poling out  the first lieutenant heard the words  row on men let us finish with these craft ahead before the others get out this must be that piratical village we have heard about mr mason as lying up one of these creeks that accounts for those two junks not going higher up i was surprised at seeing them here for they might guess that we should try to get them this morning evidently they calculated on catching us in a trap  percy was delighted at finding that in the excitement caused by his news the first lieutenant had forgotten to take any notice of his being there without orders and he returned a defiant nod to the threat conveyed by fothergill shaking his fist at him as they neared the junks the fire of those on board redoubled and was aided by that of many villagers gathered on the bank of the creek suddenly from a bank of rushes four cannons were fired a ball struck the pinnace smashing in her side the other boats gathered hastily round and took her crew on board and then dashed at the junks which were but a hundred yards distant the valour of the chinese evaporated as they saw the boats approaching and scores of them leapt overboard and swam for shore  in another minute the boats were alongside and the crews scrambling up the sides of the junks a few chinamen only attempted to oppose them these were speedily overcome and the british had now time to look round and saw that six junks crowded with men had issued from the side creek and were making towards them  let the boats tow astern the lieutenant ordered we should have to run the gauntlet of that battery on shore if we were to attack them and might lose another boat before we reached their side we will fight them here  the junks approached those on board firing their guns yelling and shouting while the drums and gongs were furiously beaten  they will find themselves mistaken percy if they think they are going to frighten us with all that row fothergill said you young rascal how did you get on board the boat without being seen the captain will be sure to suspect i had a hand in concealing you  the tars were now at work firing the gingals attached to the bulwarks and the matchlocks with which the deck was strewn at the approaching junks as they took steady aim leaning their pieces on the bulwarks they did considerable execution among the chinamen crowded on board the junks while the shot of the chinese for the most part whistled far overhead but the guns of the shore battery which had now been slewed round to bear upon them opened with a better aim and several shots came crashing into the sides of the two captured junks  get ready to board lads lieutenant oliphant shouted dont wait for them to board you but the moment they come alongside lash their rigging to ours and spring on board them  the leading junk was now about twenty yards away and presently grated alongside halfadozen sailors at once sprang into her rigging with ropes and after lashing the junks together leaped down upon her deck where fothergill was leading the gigs crew and some of those rescued from the pinnace while mr bellew with another party had boarded her at the stern several of the chinese fought stoutly but the greater part lost heart at seeing themselves attacked by the white devils instead of as they expected overwhelming them by their superior numbers many began at once to jump overboard and after two or three minutes sharp fighting the rest either followed their example or were beaten below  fothergill looked round the other junk had been attacked by two of the enemy one on each side and the little body of sailors were gathered in her waist and were defending themselves against an overwhelming number of the enemy  the other three piratical junks had been carried somewhat up the creek by the tide that was sweeping inward and could not for the moment take part in the fight  mr oliphant is hard pressed sir he asked the master shall we take to the boats  that will be the best plan mr bellew replied quick lads get the boats alongside and tumble in there is not a moment to be lost  the crew at once sprang to the boats and rowed to the other junk which was but some thirty yards away  the chinese absorbed in their contest with the crew of the pinnace did not perceive the newcomers until they gained the deck and with a shout fell furiously upon them in their surprise and consternation the pirates did not pause to note that they were still five to one superior in number but made a precipitate rush for their own vessels the english at once took the offensive the first lieutenant with his party boarded one while the newcomers leapt on to the deck of the other the panic which had seized the chinese was so complete that they attempted no resistance whatever but sprang overboard in great numbers and swam to the shore which was but twenty yards away and in three minutes the english were in undisputed possession of both vessels  back again mr fothergill or you will lose the craft you captured lieutenant oliphant said they have already cut her free  the chinese indeed who had been beaten below by the boarding party had soon perceived the sudden departure of their captors and gaining the deck again had cut the lashings which fastened them to the other junk and were proceeding to hoist their sails they were too late however almost before the craft had way on her fothergill and his crew were alongside the chinese did not wait for the attack but at once sprang overboard and made for the shore the other three junks seeing the capture of their comrades had already hoisted their sails and were making up the creek fothergill dropped an anchor left four of his men in charge and rowed back to mr oliphant  what shall we do next sir  we will give those fellows on shore a lesson and silence their battery two men have been killed since you left we must let the other junks go for the present four of my men were killed and eleven wounded before mr bellew and you came to our assistance the chinese were fighting pluckily up to that time and it would have gone very hard with us if you had not been at hand the beggars will fight when they think they have got it all their own way but before we land we will set fire to the five junks we have taken do you return and see that the two astern are well lighted mr fothergill mr mason will see to these three when you have done your work take to your boat and lay off till i join you keep the junks between you and the shore to protect you from the fire of the rascals there  i cannot come with you i suppose fothergill percy adcock said as the midshipman was about to descend into his boat again  yes come along percy it doesnt matter what you do now the captain will be so pleased when he hears that we have captured and burnt five junks that you will get off with a very light wigging i imagine  thats just what i was thinking jack has it not been fun  you wouldnt have thought it fun if you had got one of those matchlock balls in your body there are a good many of our poor fellows just at the present moment who do not see anything funny in the affair at all here we are clamber up  the crew soon set to work under fothergills orders the sails were cut off the masts and thrown down into the hold bamboos of which there were an abundance down there were heaped over them a barrel of oil was poured over the mass and the fire then applied  that will do lads now take to your boats and lets make a bonfire of the other junk  in ten minutes both vessels were a sheet of flame and the boat was lying a short distance from them waiting for further operations the inhabitants of the village furious at the failure of the plan which had been laid for the destruction of the white devils kept up a constant fusilade which however did no harm for the gig was completely sheltered by the burning junks close to her from their missiles  there go the others percy exclaimed after a minute or two as three columns of smoke arose simultaneously from the other junks and the sailors were seen dropping into their boats alongside  the killed and wounded were placed in the other gig with four sailors in charge they were directed to keep under shelter of the junks until rejoined by the pinnace and fothergills gig after these had done their work on shore  when all was ready the first lieutenant raised his hand as a signal and the two boats dashed between the burning junks and rowed for the shore such of the natives as had their weapons charged fired a hasty volley and then as the sailors leapt from their boats took to their heels  mr fothergill take your party into the village and set fire to the houses shoot down every man you see this place is a nest of pirates i will capture that battery and then join you  fothergill and his sailors at once entered the village the men had already fled the women were turned out of the houses and these were immediately set on fire the tars regarded the whole affair as a glorious joke and raced from house to house making a hasty search in each for concealed valuables before setting it on fire in a short time the whole village was in a blaze  there is a house there standing in that little grove a hundred yards away percy said  it looks like a temple fothergill replied however we will have a look at it and calling two sailors to accompany him he started at a run towards it percy keeping by his side  it is a temple fothergill said when they approached it still we will have a look at it but we wont burn it it will be as well to respect the religion even of a set of piratical scoundrels like these  at the head of his men he rushed in at the entrance there was a blaze of fire as half a dozen muskets were discharged in their faces one of the sailors dropped dead and before the others had time to realize what had happened they were beaten to the ground by a storm of blows from swords and other weapons  a heavy blow crashed down on percys head and he fell insensible even before he realized what had occurred  when he recovered his first sensation was that of a vague wonder as to what had happened to him he seemed to be in darkness and unable to move hand or foot he was compressed in some way that he could not at first understand and was being bumped and jolted in an extraordinary manner it was some little time before he could understand the situation he first remembered the fight with the junks then he recalled the landing and burning the village then as his brain cleared came the recollection of his start with fothergill for the temple among the trees his arrival there and a loud report and flash of fire  i must have been knocked down and stunned he said to himself and i suppose i am a prisoner now to these brutes and one of them must be carrying me on his back  yes he could understand it all now his hands and his feet were tied ropes were passed round his body in every direction and he was fastened back to back upon the shoulders of a chinaman percy remembered the tales he had heard of the imprisonment and torture of those who fell into the hands of the chinese and he bitterly regretted that he had not been killed instead of stunned in the surprise of the temple  it would have been just the same feeling he said to himself and there would have been an end of it now there is no saying what is going to happen i wonder whether jack was killed and the sailors  presently there was a jabber of voices the motion ceased percy could feel that the cords were being unwound and he was dropped on to his feet then the cloth was removed from his head and he could look round  a dozen chinese armed with matchlocks and bristling with swords and daggers stood around and among them bound like himself and gagged by a piece of bamboo forced lengthways across his mouth and kept there with a string going round the back of the head stood fothergill he was bleeding from several cuts in the head percys heart gave a bound of joy at finding that he was not alone then he tried to feel sorry that jack had not escaped but failed to do so although he told himself that his comrades presence would not in any way alleviate the fate which was certain to befall him still the thought of companionship even in wretchedness and perhaps a vague hope that jack with his energy and spirit might contrive some way for their escape cheered him up  as percy too was gagged no word could be exchanged by the midshipmen but they nodded to each other they were now put side by side and made to walk in the centre of their captors on the way they passed through several villages whose inhabitants poured out to gaze at the captives but the men in charge of them were evidently not disposed to delay as they passed through without a stop at last they halted before two cottages standing by themselves thrust the prisoners into a small room removed their gags and left them to themselves  well percy my boy so they caught you too i am awfully sorry it was my fault for going with only two men into that temple but as the village had been deserted and scarcely a man was found there it never entered my mind that there might be a party in the temple  of course not jack it was a surprise altogether i dont know anything about it for i was knocked down i suppose just as we went in and the first thing i knew about it was that i was being carried on the back of one of those fellows i thought it was awful at first but i dont seem to mind so much now you are with me  it is a comfort to have someone to speak to jack said yet i wish you were not here percy i cant do you any good and i shall never cease blaming myself for having brought you into this scrape i dont know much more about the affair than you do the guns were fired so close to us that my face was scorched with one of them and almost at the same instant i got a lick across my cheek with a sword i had just time to hit at one of them and then almost at the same moment i got two or three other blows and down i went they threw themselves on the top of me and tied and gagged me in no time then i was tied to a long bamboo and two fellows put the ends on their shoulders and went off with me through the fields of course i was face downwards and did not know you were with us till they stopped and loosed me from the bamboo and set me on my feet  but what are they going to do with us do you think jack  i should say they are going to take us to canton and claim a reward for our capture and there i suppose they will cut off our heads or saw us in two or put us to some other unpleasant kind of death i expect they are discussing it now do you hear what a jabber they are kicking up  voices were indeed heard raised in angry altercation in the next room after a time the din subsided and the conversation appeared to take a more amiable turn  i suppose they have settled it as far as they are concerned jack said anyhow you may be quite sure they mean to make something out of us if they hadnt they would have finished us at once for they must have been furious at the destruction of their junks and village as to the idea that mercy has anything to do with it we may as well put it out of our minds the chinaman at the best of times has no feeling of pity in his nature and after their defeat it is certain they would have killed us at once had they not hoped to do better by us if they had been indians i should have said they had carried us off to enjoy the satisfaction of torturing us but i dont suppose it is that with them  do you think there is any chance of our getting away percy asked after a pause  i should say not the least in the world percy my hands are fastened so tight now that the ropes seem cutting into my wrists and after they had set me on my feet and cut the cords of my legs i could scarcely stand at first my feet were so numbed by the pressure however we must keep up our pluck possibly they may keep us at canton for a bit and if they do the squadron may arrive and fight its way past the forts and take the city before they have quite made up their minds as to what kind of death will be most appropriate to the occasion i wonder what they are doing now they seem to be chopping sticks  i wish they would give us some water percy said i am frightfully thirsty  and so am i percy there is one comfort they wont let us die of thirst they could get no satisfaction out of our deaths now  two hours later some of the chinese reentered the room and led the captives outside and the lads then saw what was the meaning of the noise they had heard a cage had been manufactured of strong bamboos it was about four and a half feet long four feet wide and less than three feet high above it was fastened two long bamboos two or three of the bars of the cage had been left open  my goodness they never intend to put us in there percy exclaimed  that they do jack said they are going to carry us the rest of the way  the cords which bound the prisoners hands were now cut and they were motioned to crawl into the cage this they did the bars were then put in their places and securely lashed four men went to the ends of the poles and lifted the cage upon their shoulders two others took their places beside it and one man apparently the leader of the party walked on ahead the rest remained behind  i never quite realized what a fowl felt in a coop before jack said but if its sensations are at all like mine they must be decidedly unpleasant it isnt high enough to sit upright in it is nothing like long enough to lie down and as to getting out one might as well think of flying do you know percy i dont think they mean taking us to canton at all i did not think of it before but from the direction of the sun i feel sure that we cannot have been going that way what they are up to i cant imagine  in an hour they came to a large village here the cage was set down and the villagers closed round they were however kept a short distance from the cage by the men in charge of it then a wooden platter was placed on the ground and persons throwing a few copper coins into this were allowed to come near the cage  they are making a show of us fothergill exclaimed thats what they are up to you see if it isnt they are going to travel up country to show the white devils whom their valour has captured  this was indeed the purpose of the pirates at that time europeans seldom ventured beyond the limits assigned to them in the two or three towns where they were permitted to trade and few indeed of the country people had ever obtained a sight of the white barbarians of whose doings they had so frequently heard consequently a small crowd soon gathered round the cage eyeing the captives with the same interest they would have felt as to unknown and dangerous beasts they laughed and joked passed remarks upon them and even poked them with sticks fothergill furious at this treatment caught one of the sticks and wrenching it from the hands of the chinaman tried to strike at him through the bars a proceeding which excited shouts of laughter from the bystanders  i think jack percy said it will be best to try and keep our tempers and not to seem to mind what they do to us then if they find they cant get any fun out of us they will soon leave us alone  of course thats the best plan fothergill agreed but its not so easy to follow that fellow very nearly poked out my eye with his stick and no ones going to stand that if he can help it  it was some hours before the curiosity of the village was satisfied when all had paid who were likely to do so the guards broke up their circle and leaving two of their number at the cage to see that no actual harm was caused to their prisoners the rest went off to a refreshment house the place of the elders was now taken by the boys and children of the village who crowded round the cage prodded the prisoners with sticks and putting their hands through the bars pulled their ears and hair this amusement however was brought to an abrupt conclusion by fothergill suddenly seizing the wrist of a big boy and pulling his arm through the cage until his face was against the bars then he proceeded to punch him until the guard coming to his rescue poked fothergill with his stick until he released his hold  the punishment of their comrade excited neither anger nor resentment among the other boys who yelled with delight at his discomfiture but it made them more careful in approaching the cage and though they continued to poke the prisoners with sticks they did not venture again to thrust a hand through the bars at sunset the guards again came round lifted the cage and carried it into a shed a platter of dirty rice and a jug of water were put into the cage two of the men lighted their long pipes and sat down on guard beside it and the doors being closed the captives were left in peace  if this sort of thing is to go on as i suppose it is fothergill said the sooner they cut off our heads the better  it is very bad jack i am sore all over with those probes from their sharp sticks  i dont care for the pain percy so much as the humiliation of the thing to be stared at and poked at as if we were wild beasts by these curs when with half a dozen of our men we could send a hundred of them scampering i feel as if i could choke with rage  you had better try and eat some of this rice jack it is beastly but i daresay we shall get no more until tomorrow night and we must keep up our strength if we can at any rate the water is not bad thats a comfort  no thanks to them jack growled if there had been any bad water in the neighbourhood they would have given it to us  for six weeks the sufferings of the prisoners continued their captors avoided towns where the authorities would probably at once have taken the prisoners out of their hands no one would have recognized the two captives as the midshipmen of the perseus their clothes were in ragstorn to pieces by the thrusts of the sharppointed bamboos to which they had daily been subjectedthe bad food the cramped position and the misery which they suffered had worn both lads to skeletons their hair was matted with filth their faces begrimed with dirt percy was so weak that he felt he could not stand fothergill being three years older was less exhausted but he knew that he too could not support his sufferings for many days longer their bodies were covered with sores and try as they would they were able to catch only a few minutes sleep at a time so much did the bamboo bars hurt their wasted limbs  they seldom exchanged a word during the daytime suffering in silence the persecutions to which they were exposed but at night they talked over their homes and friends in england and their comrades on board ship seldom saying a word as to their present position they were now in a hilly country but had not the least idea of the direction in which it lay from canton or its distance from the coast  one evening jack said to his companion i think its nearly all over now percy the last two days we have made longer journeys and have not stopped at any of the smaller villages we passed through i fancy our guards must see that we cant last much longer and are taking us down to some town to hand us over to the authorities and get their reward for us  i hope it is so jack the sooner the better not that it makes much difference now to me for i do not think i can stand many more days of it  i am afraid i am tougher than you percy and shall take longer to kill so i hope with all my heart that i may be right and that they may be going to give us up to the authorities  the next evening they stopped at a large place and were subjected to the usual persecution this however was now less prolonged than during the early days of their captivity for they had now no longer strength or spirits to resent their treatment and as no fun was to be obtained from passive victims even the village boys soon ceased to find any amusement in tormenting them  when most of their visitors had left them an elderly chinaman approached the side of the cage he spoke to their guards and looked at them attentively for some minutes then he said in pigeon english you officer men  yes jack exclaimed starting at the sound of the english words the first they had heard spoken since their captivity yes we are officers of the perseus  me speeke english velly well the chinaman said me pilotman many years on canton river how you get here  we were attacking some piratical junks and landed to destroy the village where the people were firing on us we entered a place full of pirates and were knocked down and taken prisoners and carried away up the country that is six weeks ago and you see what we are now  pirate men velly bad the chinaman said plunder many junk on river and kill crew me muchee hate them  can you do anything for us jack asked you will be well rewarded if you could manage to get us free  the man shook his head  me no see what can do me stranger here come to stay with wifey people no do what me ask them english ships attack canton much fight and take town people all hate english bad country dis people in one village fight against another velly bad men here  how far is canton away jack asked could you not send down to tell the english we are here  fourteen days journey off the man said no see how can do anything  well jack said when you get back again to canton let our people know what has been the end of us we shall not last much longer  all light the man said will see what me can do muchee think tonight and after saying a few words to the guards who had been regarding this conversation with an air of surprise the chinaman retired  the guards had for some time abandoned the precaution of sitting up at night by the cage convinced that their captives had no longer strength to attempt to break through its fastenings or to drag themselves many yards away if they could do so they therefore left it standing in the open and wrapping themselves in their thicklywadded coats for the nights were cold lay down by the side of the cage  the coolness of the nights had indeed assisted to keep the two prisoners alive during the day the sun was excessively hot and the crowd of visitors round the cage impeded the circulation of the air and added to their sufferings it was true that the cold at night frequently prevented them from sleeping but it acted as a tonic and braced them up  what did he mean about the villages attacking each other percy asked  i have heard jack replied that in some parts of china things are very much the same as they used to be in the highlands of scotland there is no law or order the different villages are like clans and wage war on each other sometimes the government sends a number of troops who put the thing down for a time chop off a good many heads and then march away and the whole work begins again as soon as their backs are turned  that night the uneasy slumber of the lads was disturbed by a sudden firing shouts and yells were heard and the firing redoubled  the village is attacked jack said i noticed that like some other places we have come into lately there is a strong earthen wall round it with gates well there is one comfortit does not make much difference to us which side wins  the guards at the first alarm leapt to their feet caught up their matchlocks and ran to aid in the defence of the wall two minutes later a man ran up to the cage  all lightee he said just what me hopee  with his knife he cut the tough withes that held the bamboos in their places and pulled out three of the bars  come along he said no time to lose  jack scrambled out but in trying to stand upright gave a sharp exclamation of pain percy crawled out more slowly he tried to stand up but could not the chinaman caught him up and threw him on his shoulder  come along quickee he said to jack if takee village kill evely one he set off at a run jack followed as fast as he could groaning at every step from the pain the movement caused to his bruised body  they went to the side of the village opposite to that at which the attack was going on they met no one on the way the inhabitants having all rushed to the other side to repel the attack they stopped at a small gate in the wall the chinaman drew back the bolts and opened it and they passed out into the country for an hour they kept on by the end of that time jack could scarcely drag his limbs along the chinaman halted at length in a clump of trees surrounded by a thick undergrowth  allee safee here he said no searchee so far here food and he produced from a wallet a cold chicken and some boiled rice and unslung from his shoulder a gourd filled with cold tea  me go back now see what happen tomollow nightee come againbringee more food and without another word went off at a rapid pace  jack moistened his lips with the tea and then turned to his companion percy had not spoken a word since he had been released from the cage and had been insensible during the greater part of his journey jack poured some cold tea between his lips  cheer up percy old boy we are free now and with luck and that good fellows help we will work our way down to canton yet  i shall never get down there you may percy said feebly  oh nonsense you will pick up strength like a steamengine now here let me prop you against this tree thats better now drink a drop of this tea its like nectar after that filthy water we have been drinking now you will feel better now you must try and eat a little of this chicken and rice oh nonsense you have got to do it i am not going to let you give way when our trouble is just over think of your people at home percy and make an effort for their sakes good heavens now i think of it it must be christmas morning we were caught on the 2nd and we have been just twentytwo days on show i am sure that it must be past twelve oclock and it is christmasday it is a good omen percy this food isnt like roast beef and plumpudding but its not to be despised i can tell you come fire away thats a good fellow  percy made an effort and ate a few mouthfuls of rice and chicken then he took another draught of tea and lay down and was almost immediately asleep  jack ate his food slowly and contentedly till he finished half the supply then he too lay down and after a short but hearty thanksgiving for his escape from a slow and lingering death he too fell off to sleep the sun was rising when he woke being aroused by a slight movement on the part of percy he opened his eyes and sat up  well percy how do you feel this morning he asked cheerily  i feel too weak to move percy replied languidly  oh you will be all right when you have sat up and eaten breakfast jack said here you are here is a wing for you and this rice is as white as snow and the tea is first rate i thought last night after i lay down that i heard a murmur of water so after we have had breakfast i will look about and see if i can find it we should feel like new men after a wash you look awful and i am sure i am just as bad  the thought of a wash inspirited percy far more than that of eating and he sat up and made a great effort to do justice to breakfast he succeeded much better than he had done the night before and jack although he pretended to grumble was satisfied with his companions progress and finished off the rest of the food then he set out to search for water he had not very far to go a tiny stream a few inches wide and two or three inches deep ran through the wood from the higher ground after throwing himself down and taking a drink he hurried back to percy  it is all right percy i have found it we can wash to our hearts content think of that lad  percy could hardly stand but he made an effort and jack half carried him to the streamlet there the lads spent hours first they bathed their heads and hands and then stripping lay down in the stream and allowed it to flow over them then they rubbed themselves with handfuls of leaves dipped in the water and when they at last put on their rags again felt like new men percy was able to walk back to the spot they had quitted with the assistance only of jacks arm the latter feeling that his breakfast had by no means appeased his hunger now started for a search through the wood and presently returned to percy laden with nuts and berries  the nuts are sure to be all right i expect the berries are too i have certainly seen some like them in native markets and i think it will be quite safe to risk it  the rest of the day was spent in picking nuts and eating them then they sat down and waited for the arrival of their friend he came two hours after nightfall with a wallet stored with provisions and told them that he had regained the village unobserved the attack had been repulsed but with severe loss to the defenders as well as the assailants two of their guards had been among the killed the others had made a great clamour over the escape of the prisoners and had made a close search throughout the village and immediately round it for they were convinced that their captives had not had the strength to go any distance he thought however that although they had professed the greatest indignation and had offered many threats as to the vengeance that government would take upon the village one of whose inhabitants at least must have aided in the evasion of the prisoners they would not trouble themselves any further in the matter they had already reaped a rich harvest from the exhibition and would divide among themselves the share of their late comrades nor was it at all improbable that if they were to report the matter to the authorities they would themselves get into serious trouble for not having handed over the prisoners immediately after their capture  for a fortnight the pilot nursed and fed the two midshipmen he had already provided them with native clothes so that if by chance any villagers should catch sight of them they would not recognize them as the escaped white men at the end of that time both the lads had almost recovered from the effects of their sufferings jack indeed had picked up from the first but percy for some days continued so weak and ill that jack had feared that he was going to have an attack of fever of some kind his companions cheery and hopeful chat did as much good for percy as the nourishing food with which their friend supplied them and at the end of the fortnight he declared that he felt sufficiently strong to attempt to make his way down to the coast  the pilot acted as their guide when they inquired about his wife he told them carelessly that she would remain with her kinsfolk and would travel on to canton and join him there when she found an opportunity the journey was accomplished at night by very short stages at first but by increasing distances as percy gained strength during the daytime the lads lay hid in woods or jungles while their companion went into the village and purchased food they struck the river many miles above canton and the pilot going down first to a village on its banks bargained for a boat to take him and two women down to the city  the lads went on board at night and took their places in the little cabin formed of bamboos and covered with mats in the stern of the boat and remained thus sheltered not only from the view of people in boats passing up or down the stream but from the eyes of their own boatmen  after two days journey down the river without incident they arrived off canton where the british fleet was still lying while negotiations for peace were being carried on with the authorities at pekin peeping out between the mats the lads caught sight of the english warships and knowing that there was now no danger they dashed out of the cabin to the surprise of the native boatmen and shouted and waved their arms to the distant ships  in ten minutes they were alongside the perseus when they were hailed as if restored from the dead the pilot was very handsomely rewarded by the english authorities for his kindness to the prisoners and was highly satisfied with the result of his proceedings which more than doubled the little capital with which he had retired from business jack fothergill and percy adcock declare that they have never since eaten chicken without thinking of their christmas fare on the morning of their escape from the hands of the chinese pirates  the end     illustration blackie  sons books for
