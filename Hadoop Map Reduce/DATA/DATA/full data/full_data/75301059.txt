75301059	the autobiography of charles darwin  from the life and letters of charles darwin  by charles darwin  edited by his son francis darwin    my fathers autobiographical recollections given in the present chapter were written for his childrenand written without any thought that they would ever be published to many this may seem an impossibility but those who knew my father will understand how it was not only possible but natural the autobiography bears the heading recollections of the development of my mind and character and end with the following noteaug 3 1876 this sketch of my life was begun about may 28th at hopedene mr hensleigh wedgwoods house in surrey and since then i have written for nearly an hour on most afternoons it will easily be understood that in a narrative of a personal and intimate kind written for his wife and children passages should occur which must here be omitted and i have not thought it necessary to indicate where such omissions are made it has been found necessary to make a few corrections of obvious verbal slips but the number of such alterations has been kept down to the minimumfd    a german editor having written to me for an account of the development of my mind and character with some sketch of my autobiography i have thought that the attempt would amuse me and might possibly interest my children or their children i know that it would have interested me greatly to have read even so short and dull a sketch of the mind of my grandfather written by himself and what he thought and did and how he worked i have attempted to write the following account of myself as if i were a dead man in another world looking back at my own life nor have i found this difficult for life is nearly over with me i have taken no pains about my style of writing  i was born at shrewsbury on february 12th 1809 and my earliest recollection goes back only to when i was a few months over four years old when we went to near abergele for seabathing and i recollect some events and places there with some little distinctness  my mother died in july 1817 when i was a little over eight years old and it is odd that i can remember hardly anything about her except her deathbed her black velvet gown and her curiously constructed worktable in the spring of this same year i was sent to a dayschool in shrewsbury where i stayed a year i have been told that i was much slower in learning than my younger sister catherine and i believe that i was in many ways a naughty boy  by the time i went to this dayschool kept by rev g case minister of the unitarian chapel in the high street mrs darwin was a unitarian and attended mr cases chapel and my father as a little boy went there with his elder sisters but both he and his brother were christened and intended to belong to the church of england and after his early boyhood he seems usually to have gone to church and not to mr cases it appears st james gazette dec 15 1883 that a mural tablet has been erected to his memory in the chapel which is now known as the free christian church my taste for natural history and more especially for collecting was well developed i tried to make out the names of plants rev wa leighton who was a schoolfellow of my fathers at mr cases school remembers his bringing a flower to school and saying that his mother had taught him how by looking at the inside of the blossom the name of the plant could be discovered mr leighton goes on this greatly roused my attention and curiosity and i enquired of him repeatedly how this could be donebut his lesson was naturally enough not transmissiblefd and collected all sorts of things shells seals franks coins and minerals the passion for collecting which leads a man to be a systematic naturalist a virtuoso or a miser was very strong in me and was clearly innate as none of my sisters or brother ever had this taste  one little event during this year has fixed itself very firmly in my mind and i hope that it has done so from my conscience having been afterwards sorely troubled by it it is curious as showing that apparently i was interested at this early age in the variability of plants i told another little boy i believe it was leighton who afterwards became a wellknown lichenologist and botanist that i could produce variously coloured polyanthuses and primroses by watering them with certain coloured fluids which was of course a monstrous fable and had never been tried by me i may here also confess that as a little boy i was much given to inventing deliberate falsehoods and this was always done for the sake of causing excitement for instance i once gathered much valuable fruit from my fathers trees and hid it in the shrubbery and then ran in breathless haste to spread the news that i had discovered a hoard of stolen fruit  i must have been a very simple little fellow when i first went to the school a boy of the name of garnett took me into a cake shop one day and bought some cakes for which he did not pay as the shopman trusted him when we came out i asked him why he did not pay for them and he instantly answered why do you not know that my uncle left a great sum of money to the town on condition that every tradesman should give whatever was wanted without payment to any one who wore his old hat and moved it in a particular manner and he then showed me how it was moved he then went into another shop where he was trusted and asked for some small article moving his hat in the proper manner and of course obtained it without payment when we came out he said now if you like to go by yourself into that cakeshop how well i remember its exact position i will lend you my hat and you can get whatever you like if you move the hat on your head properly i gladly accepted the generous offer and went in and asked for some cakes moved the old hat and was walking out of the shop when the shopman made a rush at me so i dropped the cakes and ran for dear life and was astonished by being greeted with shouts of laughter by my false friend garnett  i can say in my own favour that i was as a boy humane but i owed this entirely to the instruction and example of my sisters i doubt indeed whether humanity is a natural or innate quality i was very fond of collecting eggs but i never took more than a single egg out of a birds nest except on one single occasion when i took all not for their value but from a sort of bravado  i had a strong taste for angling and would sit for any number of hours on the bank of a river or pond watching the float when at maer the house of his uncle josiah wedgwood i was told that i could kill the worms with salt and water and from that day i never spitted a living worm though at the expense probably of some loss of success  once as a very little boy whilst at the day school or before that time i acted cruelly for i beat a puppy i believe simply from enjoying the sense of power but the beating could not have been severe for the puppy did not howl of which i feel sure as the spot was near the house this act lay heavily on my conscience as is shown by my remembering the exact spot where the crime was committed it probably lay all the heavier from my love of dogs being then and for a long time afterwards a passion dogs seemed to know this for i was an adept in robbing their love from their masters  i remember clearly only one other incident during this year whilst at mr cases daily schoolnamely the burial of a dragoon soldier and it is surprising how clearly i can still see the horse with the mans empty boots and carbine suspended to the saddle and the firing over the grave this scene deeply stirred whatever poetic fancy there was in me  in the summer of 1818 i went to dr butlers great school in shrewsbury and remained there for seven years still midsummer 1825 when i was sixteen years old i boarded at this school so that i had the great advantage of living the life of a true schoolboy but as the distance was hardly more than a mile to my home i very often ran there in the longer intervals between the callings over and before locking up at night this i think was in many ways advantageous to me by keeping up home affections and interests i remember in the early part of my school life that i often had to run very quickly to be in time and from being a fleet runner was generally successful but when in doubt i prayed earnestly to god to help me and i well remember that i attributed my success to the prayers and not to my quick running and marvelled how generally i was aided  i have heard my father and elder sister say that i had as a very young boy a strong taste for long solitary walks but what i thought about i know not i often became quite absorbed and once whilst returning to school on the summit of the old fortifications round shrewsbury which had been converted into a public footpath with no parapet on one side i walked off and fell to the ground but the height was only seven or eight feet nevertheless the number of thoughts which passed through my mind during this very short but sudden and wholly unexpected fall was astonishing and seem hardly compatible with what physiologists have i believe proved about each thought requiring quite an appreciable amount of time  nothing could have been worse for the development of my mind than dr butlers school as it was strictly classical nothing else being taught except a little ancient geography and history the school as a means of education to me was simply a blank during my whole life i have been singularly incapable of mastering any language especial attention was paid to versemaking and this i could never do well i had many friends and got together a good collection of old verses which by patching together sometimes aided by other boys i could work into any subject much attention was paid to learning by heart the lessons of the previous day this i could effect with great facility learning forty or fifty lines of virgil or homer whilst i was in morning chapel but this exercise was utterly useless for every verse was forgotten in fortyeight hours i was not idle and with the exception of versification generally worked conscientiously at my classics not using cribs the sole pleasure i ever received from such studies was from some of the odes of horace which i admired greatly  when i left the school i was for my age neither high nor low in it and i believe that i was considered by all my masters and by my father as a very ordinary boy rather below the common standard in intellect to my deep mortification my father once said to me you care for nothing but shooting dogs and ratcatching and you will be a disgrace to yourself and all your family but my father who was the kindest man i ever knew and whose memory i love with all my heart must have been angry and somewhat unjust when he used such words  looking back as well as i can at my character during my school life the only qualities which at this period promised well for the future were that i had strong and diversified tastes much zeal for whatever interested me and a keen pleasure in understanding any complex subject or thing i was taught euclid by a private tutor and i distinctly remember the intense satisfaction which the clear geometrical proofs gave me i remember with equal distinctness the delight which my uncle gave me the father of francis galton by explaining the principle of the vernier of a barometer with respect to diversified tastes independently of science i was fond of reading various books and i used to sit for hours reading the historical plays of shakespeare generally in an old window in the thick walls of the school i read also other poetry such as thomsons seasons and the recently published poems of byron and scott i mention this because later in life i wholly lost to my great regret all pleasure from poetry of any kind including shakespeare in connection with pleasure from poetry i may add that in 1822 a vivid delight in scenery was first awakened in my mind during a riding tour on the borders of wales and this has lasted longer than any other aesthetic pleasure  early in my school days a boy had a copy of the wonders of the world which i often read and disputed with other boys about the veracity of some of the statements and i believe that this book first gave me a wish to travel in remote countries which was ultimately fulfilled by the voyage of the beagle in the latter part of my school life i became passionately fond of shooting i do not believe that any one could have shown more zeal for the most holy cause than i did for shooting birds how well i remember killing my first snipe and my excitement was so great that i had much difficulty in reloading my gun from the trembling of my hands this taste long continued and i became a very good shot when at cambridge i used to practise throwing up my gun to my shoulder before a lookingglass to see that i threw it up straight another and better plan was to get a friend to wave about a lighted candle and then to fire at it with a cap on the nipple and if the aim was accurate the little puff of air would blow out the candle the explosion of the cap caused a sharp crack and i was told that the tutor of the college remarked what an extraordinary thing it is mr darwin seems to spend hours in cracking a horsewhip in his room for i often hear the crack when i pass under his windows  i had many friends amongst the schoolboys whom i loved dearly and i think that my disposition was then very affectionate  with respect to science i continued collecting minerals with much zeal but quite unscientificallyall that i cared about was a newnamed mineral and i hardly attempted to classify them i must have observed insects with some little care for when ten years old 1819 i went for three weeks to plas edwards on the seacoast in wales i was very much interested and surprised at seeing a large black and scarlet hemipterous insect many moths zygaena and a cicindela which are not found in shropshire i almost made up my mind to begin collecting all the insects which i could find dead for on consulting my sister i concluded that it was not right to kill insects for the sake of making a collection from reading whites selborne i took much pleasure in watching the habits of birds and even made notes on the subject in my simplicity i remember wondering why every gentleman did not become an ornithologist  towards the close of my school life my brother worked hard at chemistry and made a fair laboratory with proper apparatus in the toolhouse in the garden and i was allowed to aid him as a servant in most of his experiments he made all the gases and many compounds and i read with great care several books on chemistry such as henry and parkes chemical catechism the subject interested me greatly and we often used to go on working till rather late at night this was the best part of my education at school for it showed me practically the meaning of experimental science the fact that we worked at chemistry somehow got known at school and as it was an unprecedented fact i was nicknamed gas i was also once publicly rebuked by the headmaster dr butler for thus wasting my time on such useless subjects and he called me very unjustly a poco curante and as i did not understand what he meant it seemed to me a fearful reproach  as i was doing no good at school my father wisely took me away at a rather earlier age than usual and sent me oct 1825 to edinburgh university with my brother where i stayed for two years or sessions my brother was completing his medical studies though i do not believe he ever really intended to practise and i was sent there to commence them but soon after this period i became convinced from various small circumstances that my father would leave me property enough to subsist on with some comfort though i never imagined that i should be so rich a man as i am but my belief was sufficient to check any strenuous efforts to learn medicine  the instruction at edinburgh was altogether by lectures and these were intolerably dull with the exception of those on chemistry by hope but to my mind there are no advantages and many disadvantages in lectures compared with reading dr duncans lectures on materia medica at 8 oclock on a winters morning are something fearful to remember dr made his lectures on human anatomy as dull as he was himself and the subject disgusted me it has proved one of the greatest evils in my life that i was not urged to practise dissection for i should soon have got over my disgust and the practice would have been invaluable for all my future work this has been an irremediable evil as well as my incapacity to draw i also attended regularly the clinical wards in the hospital some of the cases distressed me a good deal and i still have vivid pictures before me of some of them but i was not so foolish as to allow this to lessen my attendance i cannot understand why this part of my medical course did not interest me in a greater degree for during the summer before coming to edinburgh i began attending some of the poor people chiefly children and women in shrewsbury i wrote down as full an account as i could of the case with all the symptoms and read them aloud to my father who suggested further inquiries and advised me what medicines to give which i made up myself at one time i had at least a dozen patients and i felt a keen interest in the work my father who was by far the best judge of character whom i ever knew declared that i should make a successful physicianmeaning by this one who would get many patients he maintained that the chief element of success was exciting confidence but what he saw in me which convinced him that i should create confidence i know not i also attended on two occasions the operating theatre in the hospital at edinburgh and saw two very bad operations one on a child but i rushed away before they were completed nor did i ever attend again for hardly any inducement would have been strong enough to make me do so this being long before the blessed days of chloroform the two cases fairly haunted me for many a long year  my brother stayed only one year at the university so that during the second year i was left to my own resources and this was an advantage for i became well acquainted with several young men fond of natural science one of these was ainsworth who afterwards published his travels in assyria he was a wernerian geologist and knew a little about many subjects dr coldstream was a very different young man prim formal highly religious and most kindhearted he afterwards published some good zoological articles a third young man was hardie who would i think have made a good botanist but died early in india lastly dr grant my senior by several years but how i became acquainted with him i cannot remember he published some firstrate zoological papers but after coming to london as professor in university college he did nothing more in science a fact which has always been inexplicable to me i knew him well he was dry and formal in manner with much enthusiasm beneath this outer crust he one day when we were walking together burst forth in high admiration of lamarck and his views on evolution i listened in silent astonishment and as far as i can judge without any effect on my mind i had previously read the zoonomia of my grandfather in which similar views are maintained but without producing any effect on me nevertheless it is probable that the hearing rather early in life such views maintained and praised may have favoured my upholding them under a different form in my origin of species at this time i admired greatly the zoonomia but on reading it a second time after an interval of ten or fifteen years i was much disappointed the proportion of speculation being so large to the facts given  drs grant and coldstream attended much to marine zoology and i often accompanied the former to collect animals in the tidal pools which i dissected as well as i could i also became friends with some of the newhaven fishermen and sometimes accompanied them when they trawled for oysters and thus got many specimens but from not having had any regular practice in dissection and from possessing only a wretched microscope my attempts were very poor nevertheless i made one interesting little discovery and read about the beginning of the year 1826 a short paper on the subject before the plinian society this was that the socalled ova of flustra had the power of independent movement by means of cilia and were in fact larvae in another short paper i showed that the little globular bodies which had been supposed to be the young state of fucus loreus were the eggcases of the wormlike pontobdella muricata  the plinian society was encouraged and i believe founded by professor jameson it consisted of students and met in an underground room in the university for the sake of reading papers on natural science and discussing them i used regularly to attend and the meetings had a good effect on me in stimulating my zeal and giving me new congenial acquaintances one evening a poor young man got up and after stammering for a prodigious length of time blushing crimson he at last slowly got out the words mr president i have forgotten what i was going to say the poor fellow looked quite overwhelmed and all the members were so surprised that no one could think of a word to say to cover his confusion the papers which were read to our little society were not printed so that i had not the satisfaction of seeing my paper in print but i believe dr grant noticed my small discovery in his excellent memoir on flustra  i was also a member of the royal medical society and attended pretty regularly but as the subjects were exclusively medical i did not much care about them much rubbish was talked there but there were some good speakers of whom the best was the present sir j kayshuttleworth dr grant took me occasionally to the meetings of the wernerian society where various papers on natural history were read discussed and afterwards published in the transactions i heard audubon deliver there some interesting discourses on the habits of n american birds sneering somewhat unjustly at waterton by the way a negro lived in edinburgh who had travelled with waterton and gained his livelihood by stuffing birds which he did excellently he gave me lessons for payment and i used often to sit with him for he was a very pleasant and intelligent man  mr leonard horner also took me once to a meeting of the royal society of edinburgh where i saw sir walter scott in the chair as president and he apologised to the meeting as not feeling fitted for such a position i looked at him and at the whole scene with some awe and reverence and i think it was owing to this visit during my youth and to my having attended the royal medical society that i felt the honour of being elected a few years ago an honorary member of both these societies more than any other similar honour if i had been told at that time that i should one day have been thus honoured i declare that i should have thought it as ridiculous and improbable as if i had been told that i should be elected king of england  during my second year at edinburgh i attended s lectures on geology and zoology but they were incredibly dull the sole effect they produced on me was the determination never as long as i lived to read a book on geology or in any way to study the science yet i feel sure that i was prepared for a philosophical treatment of the subject for an old mr cotton in shropshire who knew a good deal about rocks had pointed out to me two or three years previously a wellknown large erratic boulder in the town of shrewsbury called the bellstone he told me that there was no rock of the same kind nearer than cumberland or scotland and he solemnly assured me that the world would come to an end before any one would be able to explain how this stone came where it now lay this produced a deep impression on me and i meditated over this wonderful stone so that i felt the keenest delight when i first read of the action of icebergs in transporting boulders and i gloried in the progress of geology equally striking is the fact that i though now only sixtyseven years old heard the professor in a field lecture at salisbury craigs discoursing on a trapdyke with amygdaloidal margins and the strata indurated on each side with volcanic rocks all around us say that it was a fissure filled with sediment from above adding with a sneer that there were men who maintained that it had been injected from beneath in a molten condition when i think of this lecture i do not wonder that i determined never to attend to geology  from attending s lectures i became acquainted with the curator of the museum mr macgillivray who afterwards published a large and excellent book on the birds of scotland i had much interesting naturalhistory talk with him and he was very kind to me he gave me some rare shells for i at that time collected marine mollusca but with no great zeal  my summer vacations during these two years were wholly given up to amusements though i always had some book in hand which i read with interest during the summer of 1826 i took a long walking tour with two friends with knapsacks on our backs through north wales we walked thirty miles most days including one day the ascent of snowdon i also went with my sister a riding tour in north wales a servant with saddlebags carrying our clothes the autumns were devoted to shooting chiefly at mr owens at woodhouse and at my uncle joss josiah wedgwood the son of the founder of the etruria works at maer my zeal was so great that i used to place my shootingboots open by my bedside when i went to bed so as not to lose half a minute in putting them on in the morning and on one occasion i reached a distant part of the maer estate on the 20th of august for blackgame shooting before i could see i then toiled on with the gamekeeper the whole day through thick heath and young scotch firs  i kept an exact record of every bird which i shot throughout the whole season one day when shooting at woodhouse with captain owen the eldest son and major hill his cousin afterwards lord berwick both of whom i liked very much i thought myself shamefully used for every time after i had fired and thought that i had killed a bird one of the two acted as if loading his gun and cried out you must not count that bird for i fired at the same time and the gamekeeper perceiving the joke backed them up after some hours they told me the joke but it was no joke to me for i had shot a large number of birds but did not know how many and could not add them to my list which i used to do by making a knot in a piece of string tied to a buttonhole this my wicked friends had perceived  how i did enjoy shooting but i think that i must have been halfconsciously ashamed of my zeal for i tried to persuade myself that shooting was almost an intellectual employment it required so much skill to judge where to find most game and to hunt the dogs well  one of my autumnal visits to maer in 1827 was memorable from meeting there sir j mackintosh who was the best converser i ever listened to i heard afterwards with a glow of pride that he had said there is something in that young man that interests me this must have been chiefly due to his perceiving that i listened with much interest to everything which he said for i was as ignorant as a pig about his subjects of history politics and moral philosophy to hear of praise from an eminent person though no doubt apt or certain to excite vanity is i think good for a young man as it helps to keep him in the right course  my visits to maer during these two or three succeeding years were quite delightful independently of the autumnal shooting life there was perfectly free the country was very pleasant for walking or riding and in the evening there was much very agreeable conversation not so personal as it generally is in large family parties together with music in the summer the whole family used often to sit on the steps of the old portico with the flowergarden in front and with the steep wooded bank opposite the house reflected in the lake with here and there a fish rising or a waterbird paddling about nothing has left a more vivid picture on my mind than these evenings at maer i was also attached to and greatly revered my uncle jos he was silent and reserved so as to be a rather awful man but he sometimes talked openly with me he was the very type of an upright man with the clearest judgment i do not believe that any power on earth could have made him swerve an inch from what he considered the right course i used to apply to him in my mind the wellknown ode of horace now forgotten by me in which the words nec vultus tyranni etc come in       justum et tenacem propositi virum      non civium ardor prava jubentium      non vultus instantis tyranni      mente quatit solida     cambridge 18281831  after having spent two sessions in edinburgh my father perceived or he heard from my sisters that i did not like the thought of being a physician so he proposed that i should become a clergyman he was very properly vehement against my turning into an idle sporting man which then seemed my probable destination i asked for some time to consider as from what little i had heard or thought on the subject i had scruples about declaring my belief in all the dogmas of the church of england though otherwise i liked the thought of being a country clergyman accordingly i read with care pearson on the creed and a few other books on divinity and as i did not then in the least doubt the strict and literal truth of every word in the bible i soon persuaded myself that our creed must be fully accepted  considering how fiercely i have been attacked by the orthodox it seems ludicrous that i once intended to be a clergyman nor was this intention and my fathers wish ever formerly given up but died a natural death when on leaving cambridge i joined the beagle as naturalist if the phrenologists are to be trusted i was well fitted in one respect to be a clergyman a few years ago the secretaries of a german psychological society asked me earnestly by letter for a photograph of myself and some time afterwards i received the proceedings of one of the meetings in which it seemed that the shape of my head had been the subject of a public discussion and one of the speakers declared that i had the bump of reverence developed enough for ten priests  as it was decided that i should be a clergyman it was necessary that i should go to one of the english universities and take a degree but as i had never opened a classical book since leaving school i found to my dismay that in the two intervening years i had actually forgotten incredible as it may appear almost everything which i had learnt even to some few of the greek letters i did not therefore proceed to cambridge at the usual time in october but worked with a private tutor in shrewsbury and went to cambridge after the christmas vacation early in 1828 i soon recovered my school standard of knowledge and could translate easy greek books such as homer and the greek testament with moderate facility  during the three years which i spent at cambridge my time was wasted as far as the academical studies were concerned as completely as at edinburgh and at school i attempted mathematics and even went during the summer of 1828 with a private tutor a very dull man to barmouth but i got on very slowly the work was repugnant to me chiefly from my not being able to see any meaning in the early steps in algebra this impatience was very foolish and in after years i have deeply regretted that i did not proceed far enough at least to understand something of the great leading principles of mathematics for men thus endowed seem to have an extra sense but i do not believe that i should ever have succeeded beyond a very low grade with respect to classics i did nothing except attend a few compulsory college lectures and the attendance was almost nominal in my second year i had to work for a month or two to pass the littlego which i did easily again in my last year i worked with some earnestness for my final degree of ba and brushed up my classics together with a little algebra and euclid which latter gave me much pleasure as it did at school in order to pass the ba examination it was also necessary to get up paleys evidences of christianity and his moral philosophy this was done in a thorough manner and i am convinced that i could have written out the whole of the evidences with perfect correctness but not of course in the clear language of paley the logic of this book and as i may add of his natural theology gave me as much delight as did euclid the careful study of these works without attempting to learn any part by rote was the only part of the academical course which as i then felt and as i still believe was of the least use to me in the education of my mind i did not at that time trouble myself about paleys premises and taking these on trust i was charmed and convinced by the long line of argumentation by answering well the examination questions in paley by doing euclid well and by not failing miserably in classics i gained a good place among the oi polloi or crowd of men who do not go in for honours oddly enough i cannot remember how high i stood and my memory fluctuates between the fifth tenth or twelfth name on the list tenth in the list of january 1831  public lectures on several branches were given in the university attendance being quite voluntary but i was so sickened with lectures at edinburgh that i did not even attend sedgwicks eloquent and interesting lectures had i done so i should probably have become a geologist earlier than i did i attended however henslows lectures on botany and liked them much for their extreme clearness and the admirable illustrations but i did not study botany henslow used to take his pupils including several of the older members of the university field excursions on foot or in coaches to distant places or in a barge down the river and lectured on the rarer plants and animals which were observed these excursions were delightful  although as we shall presently see there were some redeeming features in my life at cambridge my time was sadly wasted there and worse than wasted from my passion for shooting and for hunting and when this failed for riding across country i got into a sporting set including some dissipated lowminded young men we used often to dine together in the evening though these dinners often included men of a higher stamp and we sometimes drank too much with jolly singing and playing at cards afterwards i know that i ought to feel ashamed of days and evenings thus spent but as some of my friends were very pleasant and we were all in the highest spirits i cannot help looking back to these times with much pleasure  but i am glad to think that i had many other friends of a widely different nature i was very intimate with whitley rev c whitley hon canon of durham formerly reader in natural philosophy in durham university who was afterwards senior wrangler and we used continually to take long walks together he inoculated me with a taste for pictures and good engravings of which i bought some i frequently went to the fitzwilliam gallery and my taste must have been fairly good for i certainly admired the best pictures which i discussed with the old curator i read also with much interest sir joshua reynolds book this taste though not natural to me lasted for several years and many of the pictures in the national gallery in london gave me much pleasure that of sebastian del piombo exciting in me a sense of sublimity  i also got into a musical set i believe by means of my warmhearted friend herbert the late john maurice herbert county court judge of cardiff and the monmouth circuit who took a high wranglers degree from associating with these men and hearing them play i acquired a strong taste for music and used very often to time my walks so as to hear on week days the anthem in kings college chapel this gave me intense pleasure so that my backbone would sometimes shiver i am sure that there was no affectation or mere imitation in this taste for i used generally to go by myself to kings college and i sometimes hired the chorister boys to sing in my rooms nevertheless i am so utterly destitute of an ear that i cannot perceive a discord or keep time and hum a tune correctly and it is a mystery how i could possibly have derived pleasure from music  my musical friends soon perceived my state and sometimes amused themselves by making me pass an examination which consisted in ascertaining how many tunes i could recognise when they were played rather more quickly or slowly than usual god save the king when thus played was a sore puzzle there was another man with almost as bad an ear as i had and strange to say he played a little on the flute once i had the triumph of beating him in one of our musical examinations  but no pursuit at cambridge was followed with nearly so much eagerness or gave me so much pleasure as collecting beetles it was the mere passion for collecting for i did not dissect them and rarely compared their external characters with published descriptions but got them named anyhow i will give a proof of my zeal one day on tearing off some old bark i saw two rare beetles and seized one in each hand then i saw a third and new kind which i could not bear to lose so that i popped the one which i held in my right hand into my mouth alas it ejected some intensely acrid fluid which burnt my tongue so that i was forced to spit the beetle out which was lost as was the third one  i was very successful in collecting and invented two new methods i employed a labourer to scrape during the winter moss off old trees and place it in a large bag and likewise to collect the rubbish at the bottom of the barges in which reeds are brought from the fens and thus i got some very rare species no poet ever felt more delighted at seeing his first poem published than i did at seeing in stephens illustrations of british insects the magic words captured by c darwin esq i was introduced to entomology by my second cousin w darwin fox a clever and most pleasant man who was then at christs college and with whom i became extremely intimate afterwards i became well acquainted and went out collecting with albert way of trinity who in after years became a wellknown archaeologist also with h thompson of the same college afterwards a leading agriculturist chairman of a great railway and member of parliament it seems therefore that a taste for collecting beetles is some indication of future success in life  i am surprised what an indelible impression many of the beetles which i caught at cambridge have left on my mind i can remember the exact appearance of certain posts old trees and banks where i made a good capture the pretty panagaeus cruxmajor was a treasure in those days and here at down i saw a beetle running across a walk and on picking it up instantly perceived that it differed slightly from p cruxmajor and it turned out to be p quadripunctatus which is only a variety or closely allied species differing from it very slightly in outline i had never seen in those old days licinus alive which to an uneducated eye hardly differs from many of the black carabidous beetles but my sons found here a specimen and i instantly recognised that it was new to me yet i had not looked at a british beetle for the last twenty years  i have not as yet mentioned a circumstance which influenced my whole career more than any other this was my friendship with professor henslow before coming up to cambridge i had heard of him from my brother as a man who knew every branch of science and i was accordingly prepared to reverence him he kept open house once every week when all undergraduates and some older members of the university who were attached to science used to meet in the evening i soon got through fox an invitation and went there regularly before long i became well acquainted with henslow and during the latter half of my time at cambridge took long walks with him on most days so that i was called by some of the dons the man who walks with henslow and in the evening i was very often asked to join his family dinner his knowledge was great in botany entomology chemistry mineralogy and geology his strongest taste was to draw conclusions from longcontinued minute observations his judgment was excellent and his whole mind well balanced but i do not suppose that any one would say that he possessed much original genius he was deeply religious and so orthodox that he told me one day he should be grieved if a single word of the thirtynine articles were altered his moral qualities were in every way admirable he was free from every tinge of vanity or other petty feeling and i never saw a man who thought so little about himself or his own concerns his temper was imperturbably good with the most winning and courteous manners yet as i have seen he could be roused by any bad action to the warmest indignation and prompt action  i once saw in his company in the streets of cambridge almost as horrid a scene as could have been witnessed during the french revolution two bodysnatchers had been arrested and whilst being taken to prison had been torn from the constable by a crowd of the roughest men who dragged them by their legs along the muddy and stony road they were covered from head to foot with mud and their faces were bleeding either from having been kicked or from the stones they looked like corpses but the crowd was so dense that i got only a few momentary glimpses of the wretched creatures never in my life have i seen such wrath painted on a mans face as was shown by henslow at this horrid scene he tried repeatedly to penetrate the mob but it was simply impossible he then rushed away to the mayor telling me not to follow him but to get more policemen i forget the issue except that the two men were got into the prison without being killed  henslows benevolence was unbounded as he proved by his many excellent schemes for his poor parishioners when in after years he held the living of hitcham my intimacy with such a man ought to have been and i hope was an inestimable benefit i cannot resist mentioning a trifling incident which showed his kind consideration whilst examining some pollengrains on a damp surface i saw the tubes exserted and instantly rushed off to communicate my surprising discovery to him now i do not suppose any other professor of botany could have helped laughing at my coming in such a hurry to make such a communication but he agreed how interesting the phenomenon was and explained its meaning but made me clearly understand how well it was known so i left him not in the least mortified but well pleased at having discovered for myself so remarkable a fact but determined not to be in such a hurry again to communicate my discoveries  dr whewell was one of the older and distinguished men who sometimes visited henslow and on several occasions i walked home with him at night next to sir j mackintosh he was the best converser on grave subjects to whom i ever listened leonard jenyns the wellknown soame jenyns was cousin to mr jenyns father who afterwards published some good essays in natural history mr jenyns now blomefield described the fish for the zoology of the beagle and is author of a long series of papers chiefly zoological often stayed with henslow who was his brotherinlaw i visited him at his parsonage on the borders of the fens swaffham bulbeck and had many a good walk and talk with him about natural history i became also acquainted with several other men older than me who did not care much about science but were friends of henslow one was a scotchman brother of sir alexander ramsay and tutor of jesus college he was a delightful man but did not live for many years another was mr dawes afterwards dean of hereford and famous for his success in the education of the poor these men and others of the same standing together with henslow used sometimes to take distant excursions into the country which i was allowed to join and they were most agreeable  looking back i infer that there must have been something in me a little superior to the common run of youths otherwise the abovementioned men so much older than me and higher in academical position would never have allowed me to associate with them certainly i was not aware of any such superiority and i remember one of my sporting friends turner who saw me at work with my beetles saying that i should some day be a fellow of the royal society and the notion seemed to me preposterous  during my last year at cambridge i read with care and profound interest humboldts personal narrative this work and sir j herschels introduction to the study of natural philosophy stirred up in me a burning zeal to add even the most humble contribution to the noble structure of natural science no one or a dozen other books influenced me nearly so much as these two i copied out from humboldt long passages about teneriffe and read them aloud on one of the abovementioned excursions to i think henslow ramsay and dawes for on a previous occasion i had talked about the glories of teneriffe and some of the party declared they would endeavour to go there but i think that they were only half in earnest i was however quite in earnest and got an introduction to a merchant in london to enquire about ships but the scheme was of course knocked on the head by the voyage of the beagle  my summer vacations were given up to collecting beetles to some reading and short tours in the autumn my whole time was devoted to shooting chiefly at woodhouse and maer and sometimes with young eyton of eyton upon the whole the three years which i spent at cambridge were the most joyful in my happy life for i was then in excellent health and almost always in high spirits  as i had at first come up to cambridge at christmas i was forced to keep two terms after passing my final examination at the commencement of 1831 and henslow then persuaded me to begin the study of geology therefore on my return to shropshire i examined sections and coloured a map of parts round shrewsbury professor sedgwick intended to visit north wales in the beginning of august to pursue his famous geological investigations amongst the older rocks and henslow asked him to allow me to accompany him in connection with this tour my father used to tell a story about sedgwick they had started from their inn one morning and had walked a mile or two when sedgwick suddenly stopped and vowed that he would return being certain that damned scoundrel the waiter had not given the chambermaid the sixpence intrusted to him for the purpose he was ultimately persuaded to give up the project seeing that there was no reason for suspecting the waiter of especial perfidyfd accordingly he came and slept at my fathers house  a short conversation with him during this evening produced a strong impression on my mind whilst examining an old gravelpit near shrewsbury a labourer told me that he had found in it a large worn tropical volute shell such as may be seen on the chimneypieces of cottages and as he would not sell the shell i was convinced that he had really found it in the pit i told sedgwick of the fact and he at once said no doubt truly that it must have been thrown away by some one into the pit but then added if really embedded there it would be the greatest misfortune to geology as it would overthrow all that we know about the superficial deposits of the midland counties these gravelbeds belong in fact to the glacial period and in after years i found in them broken arctic shells but i was then utterly astonished at sedgwick not being delighted at so wonderful a fact as a tropical shell being found near the surface in the middle of england nothing before had ever made me thoroughly realise though i had read various scientific books that science consists in grouping facts so that general laws or conclusions may be drawn from them  next morning we started for llangollen conway bangor and capel curig this tour was of decided use in teaching me a little how to make out the geology of a country sedgwick often sent me on a line parallel to his telling me to bring back specimens of the rocks and to mark the stratification on a map i have little doubt that he did this for my good as i was too ignorant to have aided him on this tour i had a striking instance of how easy it is to overlook phenomena however conspicuous before they have been observed by any one we spent many hours in cwm idwal examining all the rocks with extreme care as sedgwick was anxious to find fossils in them but neither of us saw a trace of the wonderful glacial phenomena all around us we did not notice the plainly scored rocks the perched boulders the lateral and terminal moraines yet these phenomena are so conspicuous that as i declared in a paper published many years afterwards in the philosophical magazine philosophical magazine 1842 a house burnt down by fire did not tell its story more plainly than did this valley if it had still been filled by a glacier the phenomena would have been less distinct than they now are  at capel curig i left sedgwick and went in a straight line by compass and map across the mountains to barmouth never following any track unless it coincided with my course i thus came on some strange wild places and enjoyed much this manner of travelling i visited barmouth to see some cambridge friends who were reading there and thence returned to shrewsbury and to maer for shooting for at that time i should have thought myself mad to give up the first days of partridgeshooting for geology or any other science     voyage of the beagle from december 27 1831 to october 2 1836  on returning home from my short geological tour in north wales i found a letter from henslow informing me that captain fitzroy was willing to give up part of his own cabin to any young man who would volunteer to go with him without pay as naturalist to the voyage of the beagle i have given as i believe in my ms journal an account of all the circumstances which then occurred i will here only say that i was instantly eager to accept the offer but my father strongly objected adding the words fortunate for me if you can find any man of common sense who advises you to go i will give my consent so i wrote that evening and refused the offer on the next morning i went to maer to be ready for september 1st and whilst out shooting my uncle josiah wedgwood sent for me offering to drive me over to shrewsbury and talk with my father as my uncle thought it would be wise in me to accept the offer my father always maintained that he was one of the most sensible men in the world and he at once consented in the kindest manner i had been rather extravagant at cambridge and to console my father said that i should be deuced clever to spend more than my allowance whilst on board the beagle but he answered with a smile but they tell me you are very clever  next day i started for cambridge to see henslow and thence to london to see fitzroy and all was soon arranged afterwards on becoming very intimate with fitzroy i heard that i had run a very narrow risk of being rejected on account of the shape of my nose he was an ardent disciple of lavater and was convinced that he could judge of a mans character by the outline of his features and he doubted whether any one with my nose could possess sufficient energy and determination for the voyage but i think he was afterwards well satisfied that my nose had spoken falsely  fitzroys character was a singular one with very many noble features he was devoted to his duty generous to a fault bold determined and indomitably energetic and an ardent friend to all under his sway he would undertake any sort of trouble to assist those whom he thought deserved assistance he was a handsome man strikingly like a gentleman with highly courteous manners which resembled those of his maternal uncle the famous lord castlereagh as i was told by the minister at rio nevertheless he must have inherited much in his appearance from charles ii for dr wallich gave me a collection of photographs which he had made and i was struck with the resemblance of one to fitzroy and on looking at the name i found it ch e sobieski stuart count dalbanie a descendant of the same monarch  fitzroys temper was a most unfortunate one it was usually worst in the early morning and with his eagle eye he could generally detect something amiss about the ship and was then unsparing in his blame he was very kind to me but was a man very difficult to live with on the intimate terms which necessarily followed from our messing by ourselves in the same cabin we had several quarrels for instance early in the voyage at bahia in brazil he defended and praised slavery which i abominated and told me that he had just visited a great slaveowner who had called up many of his slaves and asked them whether they were happy and whether they wished to be free and all answered no i then asked him perhaps with a sneer whether he thought that the answer of slaves in the presence of their master was worth anything this made him excessively angry and he said that as i doubted his word we could not live any longer together i thought that i should have been compelled to leave the ship but as soon as the news spread which it did quickly as the captain sent for the first lieutenant to assuage his anger by abusing me i was deeply gratified by receiving an invitation from all the gunroom officers to mess with them but after a few hours fitzroy showed his usual magnanimity by sending an officer to me with an apology and a request that i would continue to live with him  his character was in several respects one of the most noble which i have ever known  the voyage of the beagle has been by far the most important event in my life and has determined my whole career yet it depended on so small a circumstance as my uncle offering to drive me thirty miles to shrewsbury which few uncles would have done and on such a trifle as the shape of my nose i have always felt that i owe to the voyage the first real training or education of my mind i was led to attend closely to several branches of natural history and thus my powers of observation were improved though they were always fairly developed  the investigation of the geology of all the places visited was far more important as reasoning here comes into play on first examining a new district nothing can appear more hopeless than the chaos of rocks but by recording the stratification and nature of the rocks and fossils at many points always reasoning and predicting what will be found elsewhere light soon begins to dawn on the district and the structure of the whole becomes more or less intelligible i had brought with me the first volume of lyells principles of geology which i studied attentively and the book was of the highest service to me in many ways the very first place which i examined namely st jago in the cape de verde islands showed me clearly the wonderful superiority of lyells manner of treating geology compared with that of any other author whose works i had with me or ever afterwards read  another of my occupations was collecting animals of all classes briefly describing and roughly dissecting many of the marine ones but from not being able to draw and from not having sufficient anatomical knowledge a great pile of ms which i made during the voyage has proved almost useless i thus lost much time with the exception of that spent in acquiring some knowledge of the crustaceans as this was of service when in after years i undertook a monograph of the cirripedia  during some part of the day i wrote my journal and took much pains in describing carefully and vividly all that i had seen and this was good practice my journal served also in part as letters to my home and portions were sent to england whenever there was an opportunity  the above various special studies were however of no importance compared with the habit of energetic industry and of concentrated attention to whatever i was engaged in which i then acquired everything about which i thought or read was made to bear directly on what i had seen or was likely to see and this habit of mind was continued during the five years of the voyage i feel sure that it was this training which has enabled me to do whatever i have done in science  looking backwards i can now perceive how my love for science gradually preponderated over every other taste during the first two years my old passion for shooting survived in nearly full force and i shot myself all the birds and animals for my collection but gradually i gave up my gun more and more and finally altogether to my servant as shooting interfered with my work more especially with making out the geological structure of a country i discovered though unconsciously and insensibly that the pleasure of observing and reasoning was a much higher one than that of skill and sport that my mind became developed through my pursuits during the voyage is rendered probable by a remark made by my father who was the most acute observer whom i ever saw of a sceptical disposition and far from being a believer in phrenology for on first seeing me after the voyage he turned round to my sisters and exclaimed why the shape of his head is quite altered  to return to the voyage on september 11th 1831 i paid a flying visit with fitzroy to the beagle at plymouth thence to shrewsbury to wish my father and sisters a long farewell on october 24th i took up my residence at plymouth and remained there until december 27th when the beagle finally left the shores of england for her circumnavigation of the world we made two earlier attempts to sail but were driven back each time by heavy gales these two months at plymouth were the most miserable which i ever spent though i exerted myself in various ways i was out of spirits at the thought of leaving all my family and friends for so long a time and the weather seemed to me inexpressibly gloomy i was also troubled with palpitation and pain about the heart and like many a young ignorant man especially one with a smattering of medical knowledge was convinced that i had heart disease i did not consult any doctor as i fully expected to hear the verdict that i was not fit for the voyage and i was resolved to go at all hazards  i need not here refer to the events of the voyagewhere we went and what we didas i have given a sufficiently full account in my published journal the glories of the vegetation of the tropics rise before my mind at the present time more vividly than anything else though the sense of sublimity which the great deserts of patagonia and the forestclad mountains of tierra del fuego excited in me has left an indelible impression on my mind the sight of a naked savage in his native land is an event which can never be forgotten many of my excursions on horseback through wild countries or in the boats some of which lasted several weeks were deeply interesting their discomfort and some degree of danger were at that time hardly a drawback and none at all afterwards i also reflect with high satisfaction on some of my scientific work such as solving the problem of coral islands and making out the geological structure of certain islands for instance st helena nor must i pass over the discovery of the singular relations of the animals and plants inhabiting the several islands of the galapagos archipelago and of all of them to the inhabitants of south america  as far as i can judge of myself i worked to the utmost during the voyage from the mere pleasure of investigation and from my strong desire to add a few facts to the great mass of facts in natural science but i was also ambitious to take a fair place among scientific menwhether more ambitious or less so than most of my fellowworkers i can form no opinion  the geology of st jago is very striking yet simple a stream of lava formerly flowed over the bed of the sea formed of triturated recent shells and corals which it has baked into a hard white rock since then the whole island has been upheaved but the line of white rock revealed to me a new and important fact namely that there had been afterwards subsidence round the craters which had since been in action and had poured forth lava it then first dawned on me that i might perhaps write a book on the geology of the various countries visited and this made me thrill with delight that was a memorable hour to me and how distinctly i can call to mind the low cliff of lava beneath which i rested with the sun glaring hot a few strange desert plants growing near and with living corals in the tidal pools at my feet later in the voyage fitzroy asked me to read some of my journal and declared it would be worth publishing so here was a second book in prospect  towards the close of our voyage i received a letter whilst at ascension in which my sisters told me that sedgwick had called on my father and said that i should take a place among the leading scientific men i could not at the time understand how he could have learnt anything of my proceedings but i heard i believe afterwards that henslow had read some of the letters which i wrote to him before the philosophical society of cambridge read at the meeting held november 16 1835 and printed in a pamphlet of 31 pages for distribution among the members of the society and had printed them for private distribution my collection of fossil bones which had been sent to henslow also excited considerable attention amongst palaeontologists after reading this letter i clambered over the mountains of ascension with a bounding step and made the volcanic rocks resound under my geological hammer all this shows how ambitious i was but i think that i can say with truth that in after years though i cared in the highest degree for the approbation of such men as lyell and hooker who were my friends i did not care much about the general public i do not mean to say that a favourable review or a large sale of my books did not please me greatly but the pleasure was a fleeting one and i am sure that i have never turned one inch out of my course to gain fame     from my return to england october 2 1836 to my marriage january 29 1839  these two years and three months were the most active ones which i ever spent though i was occasionally unwell and so lost some time after going backwards and forwards several times between shrewsbury maer cambridge and london i settled in lodgings at cambridge in fitzwilliam street on december 13th where all my collections were under the care of henslow i stayed here three months and got my minerals and rocks examined by the aid of professor miller  i began preparing my journal of travels which was not hard work as my ms journal had been written with care and my chief labour was making an abstract of my more interesting scientific results i sent also at the request of lyell a short account of my observations on the elevation of the coast of chile to the geological society geolog soc proc ii 1838 pages 446449  on march 7th 1837 i took lodgings in great marlborough street in london and remained there for nearly two years until i was married during these two years i finished my journal read several papers before the geological society began preparing the ms for my geological observations and arranged for the publication of the zoology of the voyage of the beagle in july i opened my first notebook for facts in relation to the origin of species about which i had long reflected and never ceased working for the next twenty years  during these two years i also went a little into society and acted as one of the honorary secretaries of the geological society i saw a great deal of lyell one of his chief characteristics was his sympathy with the work of others and i was as much astonished as delighted at the interest which he showed when on my return to england i explained to him my views on coral reefs this encouraged me greatly and his advice and example had much influence on me during this time i saw also a good deal of robert brown i used often to call and sit with him during his breakfast on sunday mornings and he poured forth a rich treasure of curious observations and acute remarks but they almost always related to minute points and he never with me discussed large or general questions in science  during these two years i took several short excursions as a relaxation and one longer one to the parallel roads of glen roy an account of which was published in the philosophical transactions 1839 pages 3982 this paper was a great failure and i am ashamed of it having been deeply impressed with what i had seen of the elevation of the land of south america i attributed the parallel lines to the action of the sea but i had to give up this view when agassiz propounded his glacierlake theory because no other explanation was possible under our then state of knowledge i argued in favour of seaaction and my error has been a good lesson to me never to trust in science to the principle of exclusion  as i was not able to work all day at science i read a good deal during these two years on various subjects including some metaphysical books but i was not well fitted for such studies about this time i took much delight in wordsworths and coleridges poetry and can boast that i read the excursion twice through formerly miltons paradise lost had been my chief favourite and in my excursions during the voyage of the beagle when i could take only a single volume i always chose milton     from my marriage january 29 1839 and residence in upper gower street to our leaving london and settling at down september 14 1842  after speaking of his happy married life and of his children he continues  during the three years and eight months whilst we resided in london i did less scientific work though i worked as hard as i possibly could than during any other equal length of time in my life this was owing to frequently recurring unwellness and to one long and serious illness the greater part of my time when i could do anything was devoted to my work on coral reefs which i had begun before my marriage and of which the last proofsheet was corrected on may 6th 1842 this book though a small one cost me twenty months of hard work as i had to read every work on the islands of the pacific and to consult many charts it was thought highly of by scientific men and the theory therein given is i think now well established  no other work of mine was begun in so deductive a spirit as this for the whole theory was thought out on the west coast of south america before i had seen a true coral reef i had therefore only to verify and extend my views by a careful examination of living reefs but it should be observed that i had during the two previous years been incessantly attending to the effects on the shores of south america of the intermittent elevation of the land together with denudation and the deposition of sediment this necessarily led me to reflect much on the effects of subsidence and it was easy to replace in imagination the continued deposition of sediment by the upward growth of corals to do this was to form my theory of the formation of barrierreefs and atolls  besides my work on coralreefs during my residence in london i read before the geological society papers on the erratic boulders of south america geolog soc proc iii 1842 on earthquakes geolog trans v 1840 and on the formation by the agency of earthworms of mould geolog soc proc ii 1838 i also continued to superintend the publication of the zoology of the voyage of the beagle nor did i ever intermit collecting facts bearing on the origin of species and i could sometimes do this when i could do nothing else from illness  in the summer of 1842 i was stronger than i had been for some time and took a little tour by myself in north wales for the sake of observing the effects of the old glaciers which formerly filled all the larger valleys i published a short account of what i saw in the philosophical magazine philosophical magazine 1842 this excursion interested me greatly and it was the last time i was ever strong enough to climb mountains or to take long walks such as are necessary for geological work  during the early part of our life in london i was strong enough to go into general society and saw a good deal of several scientific men and other more or less distinguished men i will give my impressions with respect to some of them though i have little to say worth saying  i saw more of lyell than of any other man both before and after my marriage his mind was characterised as it appeared to me by clearness caution sound judgment and a good deal of originality when i made any remark to him on geology he never rested until he saw the whole case clearly and often made me see it more clearly than i had done before he would advance all possible objections to my suggestion and even after these were exhausted would long remain dubious a second characteristic was his hearty sympathy with the work of other scientific men the slight repetition here observable is accounted for by the notes on lyell etc having been added in april 1881 a few years after the rest of the recollections were written  on my return from the voyage of the beagle i explained to him my views on coralreefs which differed from his and i was greatly surprised and encouraged by the vivid interest which he showed his delight in science was ardent and he felt the keenest interest in the future progress of mankind he was very kindhearted and thoroughly liberal in his religious beliefs or rather disbeliefs but he was a strong theist his candour was highly remarkable he exhibited this by becoming a convert to the descent theory though he had gained much fame by opposing lamarcks views and this after he had grown old he reminded me that i had many years before said to him when discussing the opposition of the old school of geologists to his new views what a good thing it would be if every scientific man was to die when sixty years old as afterwards he would be sure to oppose all new doctrines but he hoped that now he might be allowed to live  the science of geology is enormously indebted to lyellmore so as i believe than to any other man who ever lived when i was starting on the voyage of the beagle the sagacious henslow who like all other geologists believed at that time in successive cataclysms advised me to get and study the first volume of the principles which had then just been published but on no account to accept the views therein advocated how differently would anyone now speak of the principles i am proud to remember that the first place namely st jago in the cape de verde archipelago in which i geologised convinced me of the infinite superiority of lyells views over those advocated in any other work known to me  the powerful effects of lyells works could formerly be plainly seen in the different progress of the science in france and england the present total oblivion of elie de beaumonts wild hypotheses such as his craters of elevation and lines of elevation which latter hypothesis i heard sedgwick at the geological society lauding to the skies may be largely attributed to lyell  i saw a good deal of robert brown facile princeps botanicorum as he was called by humboldt he seemed to me to be chiefly remarkable for the minuteness of his observations and their perfect accuracy his knowledge was extraordinarily great and much died with him owing to his excessive fear of ever making a mistake he poured out his knowledge to me in the most unreserved manner yet was strangely jealous on some points i called on him two or three times before the voyage of the beagle and on one occasion he asked me to look through a microscope and describe what i saw this i did and believe now that it was the marvellous currents of protoplasm in some vegetable cell i then asked him what i had seen but he answered me that is my little secret  he was capable of the most generous actions when old much out of health and quite unfit for any exertion he daily visited as hooker told me an old manservant who lived at a distance and whom he supported and read aloud to him this is enough to make up for any degree of scientific penuriousness or jealousy  i may here mention a few other eminent men whom i have occasionally seen but i have little to say about them worth saying i felt a high reverence for sir j herschel and was delighted to dine with him at his charming house at the cape of good hope and afterwards at his london house i saw him also on a few other occasions he never talked much but every word which he uttered was worth listening to  i once met at breakfast at sir r murchisons house the illustrious humboldt who honoured me by expressing a wish to see me i was a little disappointed with the great man but my anticipations probably were too high i can remember nothing distinctly about our interview except that humboldt was very cheerful and talked much  reminds me of buckle whom i once met at hensleigh wedgwoods i was very glad to learn from him his system of collecting facts he told me that he bought all the books which he read and made a full index to each of the facts which he thought might prove serviceable to him and that he could always remember in what book he had read anything for his memory was wonderful i asked him how at first he could judge what facts would be serviceable and he answered that he did not know but that a sort of instinct guided him from this habit of making indices he was enabled to give the astonishing number of references on all sorts of subjects which may be found in his history of civilisation this book i thought most interesting and read it twice but i doubt whether his generalisations are worth anything buckle was a great talker and i listened to him saying hardly a word nor indeed could i have done so for he left no gaps when mrs farrer began to sing i jumped up and said that i must listen to her after i had moved away he turned around to a friend and said as was overheard by my brother well mr darwins books are much better than his conversation  of other great literary men i once met sydney smith at dean milmans house there was something inexplicably amusing in every word which he uttered perhaps this was partly due to the expectation of being amused he was talking about lady cork who was then extremely old this was the lady who as he said was once so much affected by one of his charity sermons that she borrowed a guinea from a friend to put in the plate he now said it is generally believed that my dear old friend lady cork has been overlooked and he said this in such a manner that no one could for a moment doubt that he meant that his dear old friend had been overlooked by the devil how he managed to express this i know not  i likewise once met macaulay at lord stanhopes the historians house and as there was only one other man at dinner i had a grand opportunity of hearing him converse and he was very agreeable he did not talk at all too much nor indeed could such a man talk too much as long as he allowed others to turn the stream of his conversation and this he did allow  lord stanhope once gave me a curious little proof of the accuracy and fulness of macaulays memory many historians used often to meet at lord stanhopes house and in discussing various subjects they would sometimes differ from macaulay and formerly they often referred to some book to see who was right but latterly as lord stanhope noticed no historian ever took this trouble and whatever macaulay said was final  on another occasion i met at lord stanhopes house one of his parties of historians and other literary men and amongst them were motley and grote after luncheon i walked about chevening park for nearly an hour with grote and was much interested by his conversation and pleased by the simplicity and absence of all pretension in his manners  long ago i dined occasionally with the old earl the father of the historian he was a strange man but what little i knew of him i liked much he was frank genial and pleasant he had strongly marked features with a brown complexion and his clothes when i saw him were all brown he seemed to believe in everything which was to others utterly incredible he said one day to me why dont you give up your fiddlefaddle of geology and zoology and turn to the occult sciences the historian then lord mahon seemed shocked at such a speech to me and his charming wife much amused  the last man whom i will mention is carlyle seen by me several times at my brothers house and two or three times at my own house his talk was very racy and interesting just like his writings but he sometimes went on too long on the same subject i remember a funny dinner at my brothers where amongst a few others were babbage and lyell both of whom liked to talk carlyle however silenced every one by haranguing during the whole dinner on the advantages of silence after dinner babbage in his grimmest manner thanked carlyle for his very interesting lecture on silence  carlyle sneered at almost every one one day in my house he called grotes history a fetid quagmire with nothing spiritual about it i always thought until his reminiscences appeared that his sneers were partly jokes but this now seems rather doubtful his expression was that of a depressed almost despondent yet benevolent man and it is notorious how heartily he laughed i believe that his benevolence was real though stained by not a little jealousy no one can doubt about his extraordinary power of drawing pictures of things and menfar more vivid as it appears to me than any drawn by macaulay whether his pictures of men were true ones is another question  he has been allpowerful in impressing some grand moral truths on the minds of men on the other hand his views about slavery were revolting in his eyes might was right his mind seemed to me a very narrow one even if all branches of science which he despised are excluded it is astonishing to me that kingsley should have spoken of him as a man well fitted to advance science he laughed to scorn the idea that a mathematician such as whewell could judge as i maintained he could of goethes views on light he thought it a most ridiculous thing that any one should care whether a glacier moved a little quicker or a little slower or moved at all as far as i could judge i never met a man with a mind so ill adapted for scientific research  whilst living in london i attended as regularly as i could the meetings of several scientific societies and acted as secretary to the geological society but such attendance and ordinary society suited my health so badly that we resolved to live in the country which we both preferred and have never repented of     residence at down from september 14 1842 to the present time 1876  after several fruitless searches in surrey and elsewhere we found this house and purchased it i was pleased with the diversified appearance of vegetation proper to a chalk district and so unlike what i had been accustomed to in the midland counties and still more pleased with the extreme quietness and rusticity of the place it is not however quite so retired a place as a writer in a german periodical makes it who says that my house can be approached only by a muletrack our fixing ourselves here has answered admirably in one way which we did not anticipate namely by being very convenient for frequent visits from our children  few persons can have lived a more retired life than we have done besides short visits to the houses of relations and occasionally to the seaside or elsewhere we have gone nowhere during the first part of our residence we went a little into society and received a few friends here but my health almost always suffered from the excitement violent shivering and vomiting attacks being thus brought on i have therefore been compelled for many years to give up all dinnerparties and this has been somewhat of a deprivation to me as such parties always put me into high spirits from the same cause i have been able to invite here very few scientific acquaintances  my chief enjoyment and sole employment throughout life has been scientific work and the excitement from such work makes me for the time forget or drives quite away my daily discomfort i have therefore nothing to record during the rest of my life except the publication of my several books perhaps a few details how they arose may be worth giving     my several publications  in the early part of 1844 my observations on the volcanic islands visited during the voyage of the beagle were published in 1845 i took much pains in correcting a new edition of my journal of researches which was originally published in 1839 as part of fitzroys work the success of this my first literary child always tickles my vanity more than that of any of my other books even to this day it sells steadily in england and the united states and has been translated for the second time into german and into french and other languages this success of a book of travels especially of a scientific one so many years after its first publication is surprising ten thousand copies have been sold in england of the second edition in 1846 my geological observations on south america were published i record in a little diary which i have always kept that my three geological books coral reefs included consumed four and a half years steady work and now it is ten years since my return to england how much time have i lost by illness i have nothing to say about these three books except that to my surprise new editions have lately been called for geological observations 2nd edit1876 coral reefs 2nd edit 1874  in october 1846 i began to work on cirripedia when on the coast of chile i found a most curious form which burrowed into the shells of concholepas and which differed so much from all other cirripedes that i had to form a new suborder for its sole reception lately an allied burrowing genus has been found on the shores of portugal to understand the structure of my new cirripede i had to examine and dissect many of the common forms and this gradually led me on to take up the whole group i worked steadily on this subject for the next eight years and ultimately published two thick volumes published by the ray society describing all the known living species and two thin quartos on the extinct species i do not doubt that sir e lytton bulwer had me in his mind when he introduced in one of his novels a professor long who had written two huge volumes on limpets  although i was employed during eight years on this work yet i record in my diary that about two years out of this time was lost by illness on this account i went in 1848 for some months to malvern for hydropathic treatment which did me much good so that on my return home i was able to resume work so much was i out of health that when my dear father died on november 13th 1848 i was unable to attend his funeral or to act as one of his executors  my work on the cirripedia possesses i think considerable value as besides describing several new and remarkable forms i made out the homologies of the various partsi discovered the cementing apparatus though i blundered dreadfully about the cement glandsand lastly i proved the existence in certain genera of minute males complemental to and parasitic on the hermaphrodites this latter discovery has at last been fully confirmed though at one time a german writer was pleased to attribute the whole account to my fertile imagination the cirripedes form a highly varying and difficult group of species to class and my work was of considerable use to me when i had to discuss in the origin of species the principles of a natural classification nevertheless i doubt whether the work was worth the consumption of so much time  from september 1854 i devoted my whole time to arranging my huge pile of notes to observing and to experimenting in relation to the transmutation of species during the voyage of the beagle i had been deeply impressed by discovering in the pampean formation great fossil animals covered with armour like that on the existing armadillos secondly by the manner in which closely allied animals replace one another in proceeding southwards over the continent and thirdly by the south american character of most of the productions of the galapagos archipelago and more especially by the manner in which they differ slightly on each island of the group none of the islands appearing to be very ancient in a geological sense  it was evident that such facts as these as well as many others could only be explained on the supposition that species gradually become modified and the subject haunted me but it was equally evident that neither the action of the surrounding conditions nor the will of the organisms especially in the case of plants could account for the innumerable cases in which organisms of every kind are beautifully adapted to their habits of lifefor instance a woodpecker or a treefrog to climb trees or a seed for dispersal by hooks or plumes i had always been much struck by such adaptations and until these could be explained it seemed to me almost useless to endeavour to prove by indirect evidence that species have been modified  after my return to england it appeared to me that by following the example of lyell in geology and by collecting all facts which bore in any way on the variation of animals and plants under domestication and nature some light might perhaps be thrown on the whole subject my first notebook was opened in july 1837 i worked on true baconian principles and without any theory collected facts on a wholesale scale more especially with respect to domesticated productions by printed enquiries by conversation with skilful breeders and gardeners and by extensive reading when i see the list of books of all kinds which i read and abstracted including whole series of journals and transactions i am surprised at my industry i soon perceived that selection was the keystone of mans success in making useful races of animals and plants but how selection could be applied to organisms living in a state of nature remained for some time a mystery to me  in october 1838 that is fifteen months after i had begun my systematic enquiry i happened to read for amusement malthus on population and being well prepared to appreciate the struggle for existence which everywhere goes on from longcontinued observation of the habits of animals and plants it at once struck me that under these circumstances favourable variations would tend to be preserved and unfavourable ones to be destroyed the result of this would be the formation of new species here then i had at last got a theory by which to work but i was so anxious to avoid prejudice that i determined not for some time to write even the briefest sketch of it in june 1842 i first allowed myself the satisfaction of writing a very brief abstract of my theory in pencil in 35 pages and this was enlarged during the summer of 1844 into one of 230 pages which i had fairly copied out and still possess  but at that time i overlooked one problem of great importance and it is astonishing to me except on the principle of columbus and his egg how i could have overlooked it and its solution this problem is the tendency in organic beings descended from the same stock to diverge in character as they become modified that they have diverged greatly is obvious from the manner in which species of all kinds can be classed under genera genera under families families under suborders and so forth and i can remember the very spot in the road whilst in my carriage when to my joy the solution occurred to me and this was long after i had come to down the solution as i believe is that the modified offspring of all dominant and increasing forms tend to become adapted to many and highly diversified places in the economy of nature  early in 1856 lyell advised me to write out my views pretty fully and i began at once to do so on a scale three or four times as extensive as that which was afterwards followed in my origin of species yet it was only an abstract of the materials which i had collected and i got through about half the work on this scale but my plans were overthrown for early in the summer of 1858 mr wallace who was then in the malay archipelago sent me an essay on the tendency of varieties to depart indefinitely from the original type and this essay contained exactly the same theory as mine mr wallace expressed the wish that if i thought well of his essay i should sent it to lyell for perusal  the circumstances under which i consented at the request of lyell and hooker to allow of an abstract from my ms together with a letter to asa gray dated september 5 1857 to be published at the same time with wallaces essay are given in the journal of the proceedings of the linnean society 1858 page 45 i was at first very unwilling to consent as i thought mr wallace might consider my doing so unjustifiable for i did not then know how generous and noble was his disposition the extract from my ms and the letter to asa gray had neither been intended for publication and were badly written mr wallaces essay on the other hand was admirably expressed and quite clear nevertheless our joint productions excited very little attention and the only published notice of them which i can remember was by professor haughton of dublin whose verdict was that all that was new in them was false and what was true was old this shows how necessary it is that any new view should be explained at considerable length in order to arouse public attention  in september 1858 i set to work by the strong advice of lyell and hooker to prepare a volume on the transmutation of species but was often interrupted by illhealth and short visits to dr lanes delightful hydropathic establishment at moor park i abstracted the ms begun on a much larger scale in 1856 and completed the volume on the same reduced scale it cost me thirteen months and ten days hard labour it was published under the title of the origin of species in november 1859 though considerably added to and corrected in the later editions it has remained substantially the same book  it is no doubt the chief work of my life it was from the first highly successful the first small edition of 1250 copies was sold on the day of publication and a second edition of 3000 copies soon afterwards sixteen thousand copies have now 1876 been sold in england and considering how stiff a book it is this is a large sale it has been translated into almost every european tongue even into such languages as spanish bohemian polish and russian it has also according to miss bird been translated into japanese miss bird is mistaken as i learn from prof mitsukurifd and is there much studied even an essay in hebrew has appeared on it showing that the theory is contained in the old testament the reviews were very numerous for some time i collected all that appeared on the origin and on my related books and these amount excluding newspaper reviews to 265 but after a time i gave up the attempt in despair many separate essays and books on the subject have appeared and in germany a catalogue or bibliography on darwinismus has appeared every year or two  the success of the origin may i think be attributed in large part to my having long before written two condensed sketches and to my having finally abstracted a much larger manuscript which was itself an abstract by this means i was enabled to select the more striking facts and conclusions i had also during many years followed a golden rule namely that whenever a published fact a new observation or thought came across me which was opposed to my general results to make a memorandum of it without fail and at once for i had found by experience that such facts and thoughts were far more apt to escape from the memory than favourable ones owing to this habit very few objections were raised against my views which i had not at least noticed and attempted to answer  it has sometimes been said that the success of the origin proved that the subject was in the air or that mens minds were prepared for it i do not think that this is strictly true for i occasionally sounded not a few naturalists and never happened to come across a single one who seemed to doubt about the permanence of species even lyell and hooker though they would listen with interest to me never seemed to agree i tried once or twice to explain to able men what i meant by natural selection but signally failed what i believe was strictly true is that innumerable wellobserved facts were stored in the minds of naturalists ready to take their proper places as soon as any theory which would receive them was sufficiently explained another element in the success of the book was its moderate size and this i owe to the appearance of mr wallaces essay had i published on the scale in which i began to write in 1856 the book would have been four or five times as large as the origin and very few would have had the patience to read it  i gained much by my delay in publishing from about 1839 when the theory was clearly conceived to 1859 and i lost nothing by it for i cared very little whether men attributed most originality to me or wallace and his essay no doubt aided in the reception of the theory i was forestalled in only one important point which my vanity has always made me regret namely the explanation by means of the glacial period of the presence of the same species of plants and of some few animals on distant mountain summits and in the arctic regions this view pleased me so much that i wrote it out in extenso and i believe that it was read by hooker some years before e forbes published his celebrated memoir geolog survey mem 1846 on the subject in the very few points in which we differed i still think that i was in the right i have never of course alluded in print to my having independently worked out this view  hardly any point gave me so much satisfaction when i was at work on the origin as the explanation of the wide difference in many classes between the embryo and the adult animal and of the close resemblance of the embryos within the same class no notice of this point was taken as far as i remember in the early reviews of the origin and i recollect expressing my surprise on this head in a letter to asa gray within late years several reviewers have given the whole credit to fritz muller and hackel who undoubtedly have worked it out much more fully and in some respects more correctly than i did i had materials for a whole chapter on the subject and i ought to have made the discussion longer for it is clear that i failed to impress my readers and he who succeeds in doing so deserves in my opinion all the credit  this leads me to remark that i have almost always been treated honestly by my reviewers passing over those without scientific knowledge as not worthy of notice my views have often been grossly misrepresented bitterly opposed and ridiculed but this has been generally done as i believe in good faith on the whole i do not doubt that my works have been over and over again greatly overpraised i rejoice that i have avoided controversies and this i owe to lyell who many years ago in reference to my geological works strongly advised me never to get entangled in a controversy as it rarely did any good and caused a miserable loss of time and temper  whenever i have found out that i have blundered or that my work has been imperfect and when i have been contemptuously criticised and even when i have been overpraised so that i have felt mortified it has been my greatest comfort to say hundreds of times to myself that i have worked as hard and as well as i could and no man can do more than this i remember when in good success bay in tierra del fuego thinking and i believe that i wrote home to the effect that i could not employ my life better than in adding a little to natural science this i have done to the best of my abilities and critics may say what they like but they cannot destroy this conviction  during the two last months of 1859 i was fully occupied in preparing a second edition of the origin and by an enormous correspondence on january 1st 1860 i began arranging my notes for my work on the variation of animals and plants under domestication but it was not published until the beginning of 1868 the delay having been caused partly by frequent illnesses one of which lasted seven months and partly by being tempted to publish on other subjects which at the time interested me more  on may 15th 1862 my little book on the fertilisation of orchids which cost me ten months work was published most of the facts had been slowly accumulated during several previous years during the summer of 1839 and i believe during the previous summer i was led to attend to the crossfertilisation of flowers by the aid of insects from having come to the conclusion in my speculations on the origin of species that crossing played an important part in keeping specific forms constant i attended to the subject more or less during every subsequent summer and my interest in it was greatly enhanced by having procured and read in november 1841 through the advice of robert brown a copy of ck sprengels wonderful book das entdeckte geheimniss der natur for some years before 1862 i had specially attended to the fertilisation of our british orchids and it seemed to me the best plan to prepare as complete a treatise on this group of plants as well as i could rather than to utilise the great mass of matter which i had slowly collected with respect to other plants  my resolve proved a wise one for since the appearance of my book a surprising number of papers and separate works on the fertilisation of all kinds of flowers have appeared and these are far better done than i could possibly have effected the merits of poor old sprengel so long overlooked are now fully recognised many years after his death  during the same year i published in the journal of the linnean society a paper on the two forms or dimorphic condition of primula and during the next five years five other papers on dimorphic and trimorphic plants i do not think anything in my scientific life has given me so much satisfaction as making out the meaning of the structure of these plants i had noticed in 1838 or 1839 the dimorphism of linum flavum and had at first thought that it was merely a case of unmeaning variability but on examining the common species of primula i found that the two forms were much too regular and constant to be thus viewed i therefore became almost convinced that the common cowslip and primrose were on the high road to become dioeciousthat the short pistil in the one form and the short stamens in the other form were tending towards abortion the plants were therefore subjected under this point of view to trial but as soon as the flowers with short pistils fertilised with pollen from the short stamens were found to yield more seeds than any other of the four possible unions the abortiontheory was knocked on the head after some additional experiment it became evident that the two forms though both were perfect hermaphrodites bore almost the same relation to one another as do the two sexes of an ordinary animal with lythrum we have the still more wonderful case of three forms standing in a similar relation to one another i afterwards found that the offspring from the union of two plants belonging to the same forms presented a close and curious analogy with hybrids from the union of two distinct species  in the autumn of 1864 i finished a long paper on climbing plants and sent it to the linnean society the writing of this paper cost me four months but i was so unwell when i received the proofsheets that i was forced to leave them very badly and often obscurely expressed the paper was little noticed but when in 1875 it was corrected and published as a separate book it sold well i was led to take up this subject by reading a short paper by asa gray published in 1858 he sent me seeds and on raising some plants i was so much fascinated and perplexed by the revolving movements of the tendrils and stems which movements are really very simple though appearing at first sight very complex that i procured various other kinds of climbing plants and studied the whole subject i was all the more attracted to it from not being at all satisfied with the explanation which henslow gave us in his lectures about twining plants namely that they had a natural tendency to grow up in a spire this explanation proved quite erroneous some of the adaptations displayed by climbing plants are as beautiful as those of orchids for ensuring crossfertilisation  my variation of animals and plants under domestication was begun as already stated in the beginning of 1860 but was not published until the beginning of 1868 it was a big book and cost me four years and two months hard labour it gives all my observations and an immense number of facts collected from various sources about our domestic productions in the second volume the causes and laws of variation inheritance etc are discussed as far as our present state of knowledge permits towards the end of the work i give my wellabused hypothesis of pangenesis an unverified hypothesis is of little or no value but if anyone should hereafter be led to make observations by which some such hypothesis could be established i shall have done good service as an astonishing number of isolated facts can be thus connected together and rendered intelligible in 1875 a second and largely corrected edition which cost me a good deal of labour was brought out  my descent of man was published in february 1871 as soon as i had become in the year 1837 or 1838 convinced that species were mutable productions i could not avoid the belief that man must come under the same law accordingly i collected notes on the subject for my own satisfaction and not for a long time with any intention of publishing although in the origin of species the derivation of any particular species is never discussed yet i thought it best in order that no honourable man should accuse me of concealing my views to add that by the work light would be thrown on the origin of man and his history it would have been useless and injurious to the success of the book to have paraded without giving any evidence my conviction with respect to his origin  but when i found that many naturalists fully accepted the doctrine of the evolution of species it seemed to me advisable to work up such notes as i possessed and to publish a special treatise on the origin of man i was the more glad to do so as it gave me an opportunity of fully discussing sexual selectiona subject which had always greatly interested me this subject and that of the variation of our domestic productions together with the causes and laws of variation inheritance and the intercrossing of plants are the sole subjects which i have been able to write about in full so as to use all the materials which i have collected the descent of man took me three years to write but then as usual some of this time was lost by ill health and some was consumed by preparing new editions and other minor works a second and largely corrected edition of the descent appeared in 1874  my book on the expression of the emotions in men and animals was published in the autumn of 1872 i had intended to give only a chapter on the subject in the descent of man but as soon as i began to put my notes together i saw that it would require a separate treatise  my first child was born on december 27th 1839 and i at once commenced to make notes on the first dawn of the various expressions which he exhibited for i felt convinced even at this early period that the most complex and fine shades of expression must all have had a gradual and natural origin during the summer of the following year 1840 i read sir c bells admirable work on expression and this greatly increased the interest which i felt in the subject though i could not at all agree with his belief that various muscles had been specially created for the sake of expression from this time forward i occasionally attended to the subject both with respect to man and our domesticated animals my book sold largely 5267 copies having been disposed of on the day of publication  in the summer of 1860 i was idling and resting near hartfield where two species of drosera abound and i noticed that numerous insects had been entrapped by the leaves i carried home some plants and on giving them insects saw the movements of the tentacles and this made me think it probable that the insects were caught for some special purpose fortunately a crucial test occurred to me that of placing a large number of leaves in various nitrogenous and nonnitrogenous fluids of equal density and as soon as i found that the former alone excited energetic movements it was obvious that here was a fine new field for investigation  during subsequent years whenever i had leisure i pursued my experiments and my book on insectivorous plants was published in july 1875that is sixteen years after my first observations the delay in this case as with all my other books has been a great advantage to me for a man after a long interval can criticise his own work almost as well as if it were that of another person the fact that a plant should secrete when properly excited a fluid containing an acid and ferment closely analogous to the digestive fluid of an animal was certainly a remarkable discovery  during this autumn of 1876 i shall publish on the effects of cross and selffertilisation in the vegetable kingdom this book will form a complement to that on the fertilisation of orchids in which i showed how perfect were the means for crossfertilisation and here i shall show how important are the results i was led to make during eleven years the numerous experiments recorded in this volume by a mere accidental observation and indeed it required the accident to be repeated before my attention was thoroughly aroused to the remarkable fact that seedlings of selffertilised parentage are inferior even in the first generation in height and vigour to seedlings of crossfertilised parentage i hope also to republish a revised edition of my book on orchids and hereafter my papers on dimorphic and trimorphic plants together with some additional observations on allied points which i never have had time to arrange my strength will then probably be exhausted and i shall be ready to exclaim nunc dimittis     written may 1st 1881  the effects of cross and selffertilisation was published in the autumn of 1876 and the results there arrived at explain as i believe the endless and wonderful contrivances for the transportal of pollen from one plant to another of the same species i now believe however chiefly from the observations of hermann muller that i ought to have insisted more strongly than i did on the many adaptations for selffertilisation though i was well aware of many such adaptations a much enlarged edition of my fertilisation of orchids was published in 1877  in this same year the different forms of flowers etc appeared and in 1880 a second edition this book consists chiefly of the several papers on heterostyled flowers originally published by the linnean society corrected with much new matter added together with observations on some other cases in which the same plant bears two kinds of flowers as before remarked no little discovery of mine ever gave me so much pleasure as the making out the meaning of heterostyled flowers the results of crossing such flowers in an illegitimate manner i believe to be very important as bearing on the sterility of hybrids although these results have been noticed by only a few persons  in 1879 i had a translation of dr ernst krauses life of erasmus darwin published and i added a sketch of his character and habits from material in my possession many persons have been much interested by this little life and i am surprised that only 800 or 900 copies were sold  in 1880 i published with my son franks assistance our power of movement in plants this was a tough piece of work the book bears somewhat the same relation to my little book on climbing plants which crossfertilisation did to the fertilisation of orchids for in accordance with the principle of evolution it was impossible to account for climbing plants having been developed in so many widely different groups unless all kinds of plants possess some slight power of movement of an analogous kind this i proved to be the case and i was further led to a rather wide generalisation viz that the great and important classes of movements excited by light the attraction of gravity etc are all modified forms of the fundamental movement of circumnutation it has always pleased me to exalt plants in the scale of organised beings and i therefore felt an especial pleasure in showing how many and what admirably well adapted movements the tip of a root possesses  i have now may 1 1881 sent to the printers the ms of a little book on the formation of vegetable mould through the action of worms this is a subject of but small importance and i know not whether it will interest any readers between november 1881 and february 1884 8500 copies have been sold but it has interested me it is the completion of a short paper read before the geological society more than forty years ago and has revived old geological thoughts  i have now mentioned all the books which i have published and these have been the milestones in my life so that little remains to be said i am not conscious of any change in my mind during the last thirty years excepting in one point presently to be mentioned nor indeed could any change have been expected unless one of general deterioration but my father lived to his eightythird year with his mind as lively as ever it was and all his faculties undimmed and i hope that i may die before my mind fails to a sensible extent i think that i have become a little more skilful in guessing right explanations and in devising experimental tests but this may probably be the result of mere practice and of a larger store of knowledge i have as much difficulty as ever in expressing myself clearly and concisely and this difficulty has caused me a very great loss of time but it has had the compensating advantage of forcing me to think long and intently about every sentence and thus i have been led to see errors in reasoning and in my own observations or those of others  there seems to be a sort of fatality in my mind leading me to put at first my statement or proposition in a wrong or awkward form formerly i used to think about my sentences before writing them down but for several years i have found that it saves time to scribble in a vile hand whole pages as quickly as i possibly can contracting half the words and then correct deliberately sentences thus scribbled down are often better ones than i could have written deliberately  having said thus much about my manner of writing i will add that with my large books i spend a good deal of time over the general arrangement of the matter i first make the rudest outline in two or three pages and then a larger one in several pages a few words or one word standing for a whole discussion or series of facts each one of these headings is again enlarged and often transferred before i begin to write in extenso as in several of my books facts observed by others have been very extensively used and as i have always had several quite distinct subjects in hand at the same time i may mention that i keep from thirty to forty large portfolios in cabinets with labelled shelves into which i can at once put a detached reference or memorandum i have bought many books and at their ends i make an index of all the facts that concern my work or if the book is not my own write out a separate abstract and of such abstracts i have a large drawer full before beginning on any subject i look to all the short indexes and make a general and classified index and by taking the one or more proper portfolios i have all the information collected during my life ready for use  i have said that in one respect my mind has changed during the last twenty or thirty years up to the age of thirty or beyond it poetry of many kinds such as the works of milton gray byron wordsworth coleridge and shelley gave me great pleasure and even as a schoolboy i took intense delight in shakespeare especially in the historical plays i have also said that formerly pictures gave me considerable and music very great delight but now for many years i cannot endure to read a line of poetry i have tried lately to read shakespeare and found it so intolerably dull that it nauseated me i have also almost lost my taste for pictures or music music generally sets me thinking too energetically on what i have been at work on instead of giving me pleasure i retain some taste for fine scenery but it does not cause me the exquisite delight which it formerly did on the other hand novels which are works of the imagination though not of a very high order have been for years a wonderful relief and pleasure to me and i often bless all novelists a surprising number have been read aloud to me and i like all if moderately good and if they do not end unhappilyagainst which a law ought to be passed a novel according to my taste does not come into the first class unless it contains some person whom one can thoroughly love and if a pretty woman all the better  this curious and lamentable loss of the higher aesthetic tastes is all the odder as books on history biographies and travels independently of any scientific facts which they may contain and essays on all sorts of subjects interest me as much as ever they did my mind seems to have become a kind of machine for grinding general laws out of large collections of facts but why this should have caused the atrophy of that part of the brain alone on which the higher tastes depend i cannot conceive a man with a mind more highly organised or better constituted than mine would not i suppose have thus suffered and if i had to live my life again i would have made a rule to read some poetry and listen to some music at least once every week for perhaps the parts of my brain now atrophied would thus have been kept active through use the loss of these tastes is a loss of happiness and may possibly be injurious to the intellect and more probably to the moral character by enfeebling the emotional part of our nature  my books have sold largely in england have been translated into many languages and passed through several editions in foreign countries i have heard it said that the success of a work abroad is the best test of its enduring value i doubt whether this is at all trustworthy but judged by this standard my name ought to last for a few years therefore it may be worth while to try to analyse the mental qualities and the conditions on which my success has depended though i am aware that no man can do this correctly  i have no great quickness of apprehension or wit which is so remarkable in some clever men for instance huxley i am therefore a poor critic a paper or book when first read generally excites my admiration and it is only after considerable reflection that i perceive the weak points my power to follow a long and purely abstract train of thought is very limited and therefore i could never have succeeded with metaphysics or mathematics my memory is extensive yet hazy it suffices to make me cautious by vaguely telling me that i have observed or read something opposed to the conclusion which i am drawing or on the other hand in favour of it and after a time i can generally recollect where to search for my authority so poor in one sense is my memory that i have never been able to remember for more than a few days a single date or a line of poetry  some of my critics have said oh he is a good observer but he has no power of reasoning i do not think that this can be true for the origin of species is one long argument from the beginning to the end and it has convinced not a few able men no one could have written it without having some power of reasoning i have a fair share of invention and of common sense or judgment such as every fairly successful lawyer or doctor must have but not i believe in any higher degree  on the favourable side of the balance i think that i am superior to the common run of men in noticing things which easily escape attention and in observing them carefully my industry has been nearly as great as it could have been in the observation and collection of facts what is far more important my love of natural science has been steady and ardent  this pure love has however been much aided by the ambition to be esteemed by my fellow naturalists from my early youth i have had the strongest desire to understand or explain whatever i observedthat is to group all facts under some general laws these causes combined have given me the patience to reflect or ponder for any number of years over any unexplained problem as far as i can judge i am not apt to follow blindly the lead of other men i have steadily endeavoured to keep my mind free so as to give up any hypothesis however much beloved and i cannot resist forming one on every subject as soon as facts are shown to be opposed to it indeed i have had no choice but to act in this manner for with the exception of the coral reefs i cannot remember a single firstformed hypothesis which had not after a time to be given up or greatly modified this has naturally led me to distrust greatly deductive reasoning in the mixed sciences on the other hand i am not very scepticala frame of mind which i believe to be injurious to the progress of science a good deal of scepticism in a scientific man is advisable to avoid much loss of time but i have met with not a few men who i feel sure have often thus been deterred from experiment or observations which would have proved directly or indirectly serviceable  in illustration i will give the oddest case which i have known a gentleman who as i afterwards heard is a good local botanist wrote to me from the eastern counties that the seed or beans of the common fieldbean had this year everywhere grown on the wrong side of the pod i wrote back asking for further information as i did not understand what was meant but i did not receive any answer for a very long time i then saw in two newspapers one published in kent and the other in yorkshire paragraphs stating that it was a most remarkable fact that the beans this year had all grown on the wrong side so i thought there must be some foundation for so general a statement accordingly i went to my gardener an old kentish man and asked him whether he had heard anything about it and he answered oh no sir it must be a mistake for the beans grow on the wrong side only on leapyear and this is not leapyear i then asked him how they grew in common years and how on leapyears but soon found that he knew absolutely nothing of how they grew at any time but he stuck to his belief  after a time i heard from my first informant who with many apologies said that he should not have written to me had he not heard the statement from several intelligent farmers but that he had since spoken again to every one of them and not one knew in the least what he had himself meant so that here a beliefif indeed a statement with no definite idea attached to it can be called a beliefhad spread over almost the whole of england without any vestige of evidence  i have known in the course of my life only three intentionally falsified statements and one of these may have been a hoax and there have been several scientific hoaxes which however took in an american agricultural journal it related to the formation in holland of a new breed of oxen by the crossing of distinct species of bos some of which i happen to know are sterile together and the author had the impudence to state that he had corresponded with me and that i had been deeply impressed with the importance of his result the article was sent to me by the editor of an english agricultural journal asking for my opinion before republishing it  a second case was an account of several varieties raised by the author from several species of primula which had spontaneously yielded a full complement of seed although the parent plants had been carefully protected from the access of insects this account was published before i had discovered the meaning of heterostylism and the whole statement must have been fraudulent or there was neglect in excluding insects so gross as to be scarcely credible  the third case was more curious mr huth published in his book on consanguineous marriage some long extracts from a belgian author who stated that he had interbred rabbits in the closest manner for very many generations without the least injurious effects the account was published in a most respectable journal that of the royal society of belgium but i could not avoid feeling doubtsi hardly know why except that there were no accidents of any kind and my experience in breeding animals made me think this very improbable  so with much hesitation i wrote to professor van beneden asking him whether the author was a trustworthy man i soon heard in answer that the society had been greatly shocked by discovering that the whole account was a fraud the falseness of the published statements on which mr huth relied has been pointed out by himself in a slip inserted in all the copies of his book which then remained unsold the writer had been publicly challenged in the journal to say where he had resided and kept his large stock of rabbits while carrying on his experiments which must have consumed several years and no answer could be extracted from him  my habits are methodical and this has been of not a little use for my particular line of work lastly i have had ample leisure from not having to earn my own bread even illhealth though it has annihilated several years of my life has saved me from the distractions of society and amusement  therefore my success as a man of science whatever this may have amounted to has been determined as far as i can judge by complex and diversified mental qualities and conditions of these the most important have beenthe love of scienceunbounded patience in long reflecting over any subjectindustry in observing and collecting factsand a fair share of invention as well as of common sense with such moderate abilities as i possess it is truly surprising that i should have influenced to a considerable extent the belief of scientific men on some important points
