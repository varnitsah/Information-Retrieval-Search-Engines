the war      xi   the great collapse      the epilogue     preface to reprint edition  the reader should grasp clearly the date at which this book was written it was done in 1907 it appeared in various magazines as a serial in 1908 and it was published in the fall of that year at that time the aeroplane was for most people merely a rumour and the sausage held the air the contemporary reader has all the advantage of ten years experience since this story was imagined he can correct his author at a dozen points and estimate the value of these warnings by the standard of a decade of realities the book is weak on antiaircraft guns for example and still more negligent of submarines much no doubt will strike the reader as quaint and limited but upon much the writer may not unreasonably plume himself the interpretation of the german spirit must have read as a caricature in 1908 was it a caricature prince karl seemed a fantasy then reality has since copied prince carl with an astonishing faithfulness is it too much to hope that some democratic bert may not ultimately get even with his highness our author tells us in this book as he has told us in others more especially in the world set free and as he has been telling us this year in his war and the future that if mankind goes on with war the smashup of civilization is inevitable it is chaos or the united states of the world for mankind there is no other choice ten years have but added an enormous conviction to the message of this book it remains essentially right a pamphlet storyin support of the league to enforce peace k      the war in the air    chapter i of progress and the smallways family   1  this here progress said mr tom smallways it keeps on  youd hardly think it could keep on said mr tom smallways  it was along before the war in the air began that mr smallways made this remark he was sitting on the fence at the end of his garden and surveying the great bun hill gasworks with an eye that neither praised nor blamed above the clustering gasometers three unfamiliar shapes appeared thin wallowing bladders that flapped and rolled about and grew bigger and bigger and rounder and rounderballoons in course of inflation for the south of england aero clubs saturdayafternoon ascent  they goes up every saturday said his neighbour mr stringer the milkman its only yestiday so to speak when all london turned out to see a balloon go over and now every little place in the country has its weeklyoutingsuppings rather its been the salvation of them gas companies  larst satiday i got three barrerloads of gravel off my petaters said mr tom smallways three barrerloads what they dropped as ballase some of the plants was broke and some was buried  ladies they say goes up  i suppose we got to call em ladies said mr tom smallways  still it aint hardly my idea of a ladyflying about in the air and throwing gravel at people it aint what i been accustomed to consider ladylike whether or no  mr stringer nodded his head approvingly and for a time they continued to regard the swelling bulks with expressions that had changed from indifference to disapproval  mr tom smallways was a greengrocer by trade and a gardener by disposition his little wife jessica saw to the shop and heaven had planned him for a peaceful world unfortunately heaven had not planned a peaceful world for him he lived in a world of obstinate and incessant change and in parts where its operations were unsparingly conspicuous vicissitude was in the very soil he tilled even his garden was upon a yearly tenancy and overshadowed by a huge board that proclaimed it not so much a garden as an eligible building site he was horticulture under notice to quit the last patch of country in a district flooded by new and other things he did his best to console himself to imagine matters near the turn of the tide  youd hardly think it could keep on he said  mr smallways aged father could remember bun hill as an idyllic kentish village he had driven sir peter bone until he was fifty and then he took to drink a little and driving the station bus which lasted him until he was seventyeight then he retired he sat by the fireside a shrivelled very very old coachman full charged with reminiscences and ready for any careless stranger he could tell you of the vanished estate of sir peter bone long since cut up for building and how that magnate ruled the countryside when it was countryside of shooting and hunting and of caches along the high road of how where the gasworks is was a cricketfield and of the coming of the crystal palace the crystal palace was six miles away from bun hill a great facade that glittered in the morning and was a clear blue outline against the sky in the afternoon and of a night a source of gratuitous fireworks for all the population of bun hill and then had come the railway and then villas and villas and then the gasworks and the waterworks and a great ugly sea of workmens houses and then drainage and the water vanished out of the otterbourne and left it a dreadful ditch and then a second railway station bun hill south and more houses and more more shops more competition plateglass shops a schoolboard rates omnibuses tramcarsgoing right away into london itselfbicycles motorcars and then more motorcars a carnegie library  youd hardly think it could keep on said mr tom smallways growing up among these marvels  but it kept on even from the first the greengrocers shop which he had set up in one of the smallest of the old surviving village houses in the tail of the high street had a submerged air an air of hiding from something that was looking for it when they had made up the pavement of the high street they levelled that up so that one had to go down three steps into the shop tom did his best to sell only his own excellent but limited range of produce but progress came shoving things into his window french artichokes and aubergines foreign applesapples from the state of new york apples from california apples from canada apples from new zealand pretty lookin fruit but not what i should call english apples said tombananas unfamiliar nuts grape fruits mangoes  the motorcars that went by northward and southward grew more and more powerful and efficient whizzed faster and smelt worse there appeared great clangorous petrol trolleys delivering coal and parcels in the place of vanishing horsevans motoromnibuses ousted the horseomnibuses even the kentish strawberries going londonward in the night took to machinery and clattered instead of creaking and became affected in flavour by progress and petrol  and then young bert smallways got a motor bicycle  2  bert it is necessary to explain was a progressive smallways  nothing speaks more eloquently of the pitiless insistence of progress and expansion in our time than that it should get into the smallways blood but there was something advanced and enterprising about young smallways before he was out of short frocks he was lost for a whole day before he was five and nearly drowned in the reservoir of the new waterworks before he was seven he had a real pistol taken away from him by a real policeman when he was ten and he learnt to smoke not with pipes and brown paper and cane as tom had done but with a penny packet of boys of england american cigarettes his language shocked his father before he was twelve and by that age what with touting for parcels at the station and selling the bun hill weekly express he was making three shillings a week or more and spending it on chips comic cuts ally slopers halfholiday cigarettes and all the concomitants of a life of pleasure and enlightenment all of this without hindrance to his literary studies which carried him up to the seventh standard at an exceptionally early age i mention these things so that you may have no doubt at all concerning the sort of stuff bert had in him  he was six years younger than tom and for a time there was an attempt to utilise him in the greengrocers shop when tom at twentyone married jessicawho was thirty and had saved a little money in service but it was not berts forte to be utilised he hated digging and when he was given a basket of stuff to deliver a nomadic instinct arose irresistibly it became his pack and he did not seem to care how heavy it was nor where he took it so long as he did not take it to its destination glamour filled the world and he strayed after it basket and all so tom took his goods out himself and sought employers for bert who did not know of this strain of poetry in his nature and bert touched the fringe of a number of trades in successiondrapers porter chemists boy doctors page junior assistant gasfitter envelope addresser milkcart assistant golf caddie and at last helper in a bicycle shop here apparently he found the progressive quality his nature had craved his employer was a piratesouled young man named grubb with a blacksmeared face by day and a musichall side in the evening who dreamt of a patent lever chain and it seemed to bert that he was the perfect model of a gentleman of spirit he hired out quite the dirtiest and unsafest bicycles in the whole south of england and conducted the subsequent discussions with astonishing verve bert and he settled down very well together bert lived in became almost a trick riderhe could ride bicycles for miles that would have come to pieces instantly under you or metook to washing his face after business and spent his surplus money upon remarkable ties and collars cigarettes and shorthand classes at the bun hill institute  he would go round to tom at times and look and talk so brilliantly that tom and jessie who both had a natural tendency to be respectful to anybody or anything looked up to him immensely  hes a goahead chap is bert said tom he knows a thing or two  lets hope he dont know too much said jessica who had a fine sense of limitations  its goahead times said tom noo petaters and english at that well be having em in march if things go on as they do go i never see such times see his tie last night  it wasnt suited to him tom it was a gentlemans tie he wasnt up to itnot the rest of him it wasnt becoming  then presently bert got a cyclists suit cap badge and all and to see him and grubb going down to brighton and backheads down handlebars down backbones curvedwas a revelation in the possibilities of the smallways blood  goahead times  old smallways would sit over the fire mumbling of the greatness of other days of old sir peter who drove his coach to brighton and back in eightandtwenty hours of old sir peters white tophats of lady bone who never set foot to ground except to walk in the garden of the great prizefights at crawley he talked of pink and pigskin breeches of foxes at rings bottom where now the county council pauper lunatics were enclosed of lady bones chintzes and crinolines nobody heeded him the world had thrown up a new type of gentleman altogethera gentleman of most ungentlemanly energy a gentleman in dusty oilskins and motor goggles and a wonderful cap a stinkmaking gentleman a swift highclass badger who fled perpetually along high roads from the dust and stink he perpetually made and his lady as they were able to see her at bun hill was a weatherbitten goddess as free from refinement as a gipsynot so much dressed as packed for transit at a high velocity  so bert grew up filled with ideals of speed and enterprise and became so far as he became anything a kind of bicycle engineer of the letshavealookatit and enamel chipping variety even a roadracer geared to a hundred and twenty failed to satisfy him and for a time he pined in vain at twenty miles an hour along roads that were continually more dusty and more crowded with mechanical traffic but at last his savings accumulated and his chance came the hirepurchase system bridged a financial gap and one bright and memorable sunday morning he wheeled his new possession through the shop into the road got on to it with the advice and assistance of grubb and teufteuffed off into the haze of the traffictortured high road to add himself as one more voluntary public danger to the amenities of the south of england  orf to brighton said old smallways regarding his youngest son from the sittingroom window over the greengrocers shop with something between pride and reprobation when i was is age id never been to london never bin south of crawleynever bin anywhere on my own where i couldnt walk and nobody didnt go not unless they was gentry now every bodys orf everywhere the whole dratted country sims flying to pieces wonder they all get back orf to brighton indeed anybody want to buy orses  you cant say i bin to brighton father said tom  nor dont want to go said jessica sharply creering about and spendin your money  3  for a time the possibilities of the motorbicycle so occupied berts mind that he remained regardless of the new direction in which the striving soul of man was finding exercise and refreshment he failed to observe that the type of motorcar like the type of bicycle was settlingdown and losing its adventurous quality indeed it is as true as it is remarkable that tom was the first to observe the new development but his gardening made him attentive to the heavens and the proximity of the bun hill gasworks and the crystal palace from which ascents were continually being made and presently the descent of ballast upon his potatoes conspired to bear in upon his unwilling mind the fact that the goddess of change was turning her disturbing attention to the sky the first great boom in aeronautics was beginning  grubb and bert heard of it in a musichall then it was driven home to their minds by the cinematograph then berts imagination was stimulated by a sixpenny edition of that aeronautic classic mr george griffiths clipper of the clouds and so the thing really got hold of them  at first the most obvious aspect was the multiplication of balloons the sky of bun hill began to be infested by balloons on wednesday and saturday afternoons particularly you could scarcely look skyward for a quarter of an hour without discovering a balloon somewhere and then one bright day bert motoring toward croydon was arrested by the insurgence of a huge bolstershaped monster from the crystal palace grounds and obliged to dismount and watch it it was like a bolster with a broken nose and below it and comparatively small was a stiff framework bearing a man and an engine with a screw that whizzed round in front and a sort of canvas rudder behind the framework had an air of dragging the reluctant gascylinder after it like a brisk little terrier towing a shy gasdistended elephant into society the combined monster certainly travelled and steered it went overhead perhaps a thousand feet up bert heard the engine sailed away southward vanished over the hills reappeared a little blue outline far off in the east going now very fast before a gentle southwest gale returned above the crystal palace towers circled round them chose a position for descent and sank down out of sight  bert sighed deeply and turned to his motorbicycle again  and that was only the beginning of a succession of strange phenomena in the heavenscylinders cones pearshaped monsters even at last a thing of aluminium that glittered wonderfully and that grubb through some confusion of ideas about armour plates was inclined to consider a war machine  there followed actual flight  this however was not an affair that was visible from bun hill it was something that occurred in private grounds or other enclosed places and under favourable conditions and it was brought home to grubb and bert smallways only by means of the magazine page of the halfpenny newspapers or by cinematograph records but it was brought home very insistently and in those days if ever one heard a man saying in a public place in a loud reassuring confident tone its bound to come the chances were ten to one he was talking of flying and bert got a box lid and wrote out in correct windowticket style and grubb put in the window this inscription aeroplanes made and repaired it quite upset tomit seemed taking ones shop so lightly but most of the neighbours and all the sporting ones approved of it as being very good indeed  everybody talked of flying everybody repeated over and over again bound to come and then you know it didnt come there was a hitch they flewthat was all right they flew in machines heavier than air but they smashed sometimes they smashed the engine sometimes they smashed the aeronaut usually they smashed both machines that made flights of three or four miles and came down safely went up the next time to headlong disaster there seemed no possible trusting to them the breeze upset them the eddies near the ground upset them a passing thought in the mind of the aeronaut upset them also they upsetsimply  its this stability does em said grubb repeating his newspaper they pitch and they pitch till they pitch themselves to pieces  experiments fell away after two expectant years of this sort of success the public and then the newspapers tired of the expensive photographic reproductions the optimistic reports the perpetual sequence of triumph and disaster and silence flying slumped even ballooning fell away to some extent though it remained a fairly popular sport and continued to lift gravel from the wharf of the bun hill gasworks and drop it upon deserving peoples lawns and gardens there were half a dozen reassuring years for tomat least so far as flying was concerned but that was the great time of monorail development and his anxiety was only diverted from the high heavens by the most urgent threats and symptoms of change in the lower sky  there had been talk of monorails for several years but the real mischief began when brennan sprang his gyroscopic monorail car upon the royal society it was the leading sensation of the 1907 soirees that celebrated demonstrationroom was all too small for its exhibition brave soldiers leading zionists deserving novelists noble ladies congested the narrow passage and thrust distinguished elbows into ribs the world would not willingly let break deeming themselves fortunate if they could see just a little bit of the rail inaudible but convincing the great inventor expounded his discovery and sent his obedient little model of the trains of the future up gradients round curves and across a sagging wire it ran along its single rail on its single wheels simple and sufficient it stopped reversed stood still balancing perfectly it maintained its astounding equilibrium amidst a thunder of applause the audience dispersed at last discussing how far they would enjoy crossing an abyss on a wire cable suppose the gyroscope stopped few of them anticipated a tithe of what the brennan monorail would do for their railway securities and the face of the world  in a few years they realised better in a little while no one thought anything of crossing an abyss on a wire and the monorail was superseding the tramlines railways and indeed every form of track for mechanical locomotion where land was cheap the rail ran along the ground where it was dear the rail lifted up on iron standards and passed overhead its swift convenient cars went everywhere and did everything that had once been done along made tracks upon the ground  when old smallways died tom could think of nothing more striking to say of him than that when he was a boy there wasnt nothing higher than your chimbleysthere wasnt a wire nor a cable in the sky  old smallways went to his grave under an intricate network of wires and cables for bun hill became not only a sort of minor centre of power distributionthe home counties power distribution company set up transformers and a generating station close beside the old gasworksbut also a junction on the suburban monorail system moreover every tradesman in the place and indeed nearly every house had its own telephone  the monorail cable standard became a striking fact in urban landscape for the most part stout iron erections rather like tapering trestles and painted a bright bluish green one it happened bestrode toms house which looked still more retiring and apologetic beneath its immensity and another giant stood just inside the corner of his garden which was still not built upon and unchanged except for a couple of advertisement boards one recommending a twoandsixpenny watch and one a nerve restorer these by the bye were placed almost horizontally to catch the eye of the passing monorail passengers above and so served admirably to roof over a toolshed and a mushroomshed for tom all day and all night the fast cars from brighton and hastings went murmuring by overhead long broad comfortablelooking cars that were brightly lit after dusk as they flew by at night transient flares of light and a rumbling sound of passage they kept up a perpetual summer lightning and thunderstorm in the street below  presently the english channel was bridgeda series of great iron eiffel tower pillars carrying monorail cables at a height of a hundred and fifty feet above the water except near the middle where they rose higher to allow the passage of the london and antwerp shipping and the hamburgamerica liners  then heavy motorcars began to run about on only a couple of wheels one behind the other which for some reason upset tom dreadfully and made him gloomy for days after the first one passed the shop  all this gyroscopic and monorail development naturally absorbed a vast amount of public attention and there was also a huge excitement consequent upon the amazing gold discoveries off the coast of anglesea made by a submarine prospector miss patricia giddy she had taken her degree in geology and mineralogy in the university of london and while working upon the auriferous rocks of north wales after a brief holiday spent in agitating for womens suffrage she had been struck by the possibility of these reefs cropping up again under the water she had set herself to verify this supposition by the use of the submarine crawler invented by doctor alberto cassini by a happy mingling of reasoning and intuition peculiar to her sex she found gold at her first descent and emerged after three hours submersion with about two hundredweight of ore containing gold in the unparalleled quantity of seventeen ounces to the ton but the whole story of her submarine mining intensely interesting as it is must be told at some other time suffice it now to remark simply that it was during the consequent great rise of prices confidence and enterprise that the revival of interest in flying occurred  it is curious how that revival began it was like the coming of a breeze on a quiet day nothing started it it came people began to talk of flying with an air of never having for one moment dropped the subject pictures of flying and flying machines returned to the newspapers articles and allusions increased and multiplied in the serious magazines people asked in monorail trains when are we going to fly a new crop of inventors sprang up in a night or so like fungi the aero club announced the project of a great flying exhibition in a large area of ground that the removal of slums in whitechapel had rendered available  the advancing wave soon produced a sympathetic ripple in the bun hill establishment grubb routed out his flyingmachine model again tried it in the yard behind the shop got a kind of flight out of it and broke seventeen panes of glass and nine flowerpots in the greenhouse that occupied the next yard but one  and then springing from nowhere sustained one knew not how came a persistent disturbing rumour that the problem had been solved that the secret was known bert met it one earlyclosing afternoon as he refreshed himself in an inn near nutfield whither his motorbicycle had brought him there smoked and meditated a person in khaki an engineer who presently took an interest in berts machine it was a sturdy piece of apparatus and it had acquired a kind of documentary value in these quickchanging times it was now nearly eight years old its points discussed the soldier broke into a new topic with my nexts going to be an aeroplane so far as i can see ive had enough of roads and ways  they tork said bert  they talkand they do said the soldier  the things coming  it keeps on coming said bert i shall believe when i see it  that wont be long said the soldier  the conversation seemed degenerating into an amiable wrangle of contradiction  i tell you they are flying the soldier insisted i see it myself  weve all seen it said bert  i dont mean flap up and smash up i mean real safe steady controlled flying against the wind good and right  you aint seen that  i ave aldershot they try to keep it a secret they got it right enough you betour war office isnt going to be caught napping this time  berts incredulity was shaken he asked questionsand the soldier expanded  i tell you they got nearly a square mile fenced ina sort of valley fences of barbed wire ten feet high and inside that they do things chaps about the campnow and then we get a peep it isnt only us neither theres the japanese you bet they got it tooand the germans  the soldier stood with his legs very wide apart and filled his pipe thoughtfully bert sat on the low wall against which his motorbicycle was leaning  funny thing fightingll be he said  flyings going to break out said the soldier when it does come when the curtain does go up i tell you youll find every one on the stagebusy such fighting too i suppose you dont read the papers about this sort of thing  i read em a bit said bert  well have you noticed what one might call the remarkable case of the disappearing inventorthe inventor who turns up in a blaze of publicity fires off a few successful experiments and vanishes  cant say i ave said bert  well i ave anyhow you get anybody come along who does anything striking in this line and you bet he vanishes just goes off quietly out of sight after a bit you dont hear anything more of em at all see they disappear goneno address firstoh its an old story nowthere was those wright brothers out in america they glidedthey glided miles and miles finally they glided off stage why it must be nineteen hundred and four or five they vanished then there was those people in irelandno i forget their names everybody said they could fly they went they aint dead that ive heard tell but you cant say theyre alive not a feather of em can you see then that chap who flew round paris and upset in the seine de booley was it i forget that was a grand fly in spite of the accident but wheres he got to the accident didnt hurt him eh es gone to cover  the soldier prepared to light his pipe  looks like a secret society got hold of them said bert  secret society naw  the soldier lit his match and drew secret society he repeated with his pipe between his teeth and the match flaring in response to his words war departments thats more like it he threw his match aside and walked to his machine i tell you sir he said there isnt a big power in europe or asia or america or africa that hasnt got at least one or two flying machines hidden up its sleeve at the present time not one real workable flying machines and the spying the spying and manoeuvring to find out what the others have got i tell you sir a foreigner or for the matter of that an unaccredited native cant get within four miles of lydd nowadaysnot to mention our little circus at aldershot and the experimental camp in galway no  well said bert id like to see one of them anyhow jest to help believing ill believe when i see that ill promise you  youll see em fast enough said the soldier and led his machine out into the road  he left bert on his wall grave and pensive with his cap on the back of his head and a cigarette smouldering in the corner of his mouth  if what he says is true said bert me and grubb we been wasting our blessed old time besides incurring expense with that greenouse  5  it was while this mysterious talk with the soldier still stirred in bert smallways imagination that the most astounding incident in the whole of that dramatic chapter of human history the coming of flying occurred people talk glibly enough of epochmaking events this was an epochmaking event it was the unanticipated and entirely successful flight of mr alfred butteridge from the crystal palace to glasgow and back in a small businesslikelooking machine heavier than airan entirely manageable and controllable machine that could fly as well as a pigeon  it wasnt one felt a fresh step forward in the matter so much as a giant stride a leap mr butteridge remained in the air altogether for about nine hours and during that time he flew with the ease and assurance of a bird his machine was however neither birdlike nor butterflylike nor had it the wide lateral expansion of the ordinary aeroplane the effect upon the observer was rather something in the nature of a bee or wasp parts of the apparatus were spinning very rapidly and gave one a hazy effect of transparent wings but parts including two peculiarly curved wingcasesif one may borrow a figure from the flying beetlesremained expanded stiffly in the middle was a long rounded body like the body of a moth and on this mr butteridge could be seen sitting astride much as a man bestrides a horse the wasplike resemblance was increased by the fact that the apparatus flew with a deep booming hum exactly the sound made by a wasp at a windowpane  mr butteridge took the world by surprise he was one of those gentlemen from nowhere fate still succeeds in producing for the stimulation of mankind he came it was variously said from australia and america and the south of france he was also described quite incorrectly as the son of a man who had amassed a comfortable fortune in the manufacture of gold nibs and the butteridge fountain pens but this was an entirely different strain of butteridges for some years in spite of a loud voice a large presence an aggressive swagger and an implacable manner he had been an undistinguished member of most of the existing aeronautical associations then one day he wrote to all the london papers to announce that he had made arrangements for an ascent from the crystal palace of a machine that would demonstrate satisfactorily that the outstanding difficulties in the way of flying were finally solved few of the papers printed his letter still fewer were the people who believed in his claim no one was excited even when a fracas on the steps of a leading hotel in piccadilly in which he tried to horsewhip a prominent german musician upon some personal account delayed his promised ascent the quarrel was inadequately reported and his name spelt variously betteridge and betridge until his flight indeed he did not and could not contrive to exist in the public mind there were scarcely thirty people on the lookout for him in spite of all his clamour when about six oclock one summer morning the doors of the big shed in which he had been putting together his apparatus openedit was near the big model of a megatherium in the crystal palace groundsand his giant insect came droning out into a negligent and incredulous world  but before he had made his second circuit of the crystal palace towers fame was lifting her trumpet she drew a deep breath as the startled tramps who sleep on the seats of trafalgar square were roused by his buzz and awoke to discover him circling the nelson column and by the time he had got to birmingham which place he crossed about halfpast ten her deafening blast was echoing throughout the country the despairedof thing was done  a man was flying securely and well  scotland was agape for his coming glasgow he reached by one oclock and it is related that scarcely a shipyard or factory in that busy hive of industry resumed work before halfpast two the public mind was just sufficiently educated in the impossibility of flying to appreciate mr butteridge at his proper value he circled the university buildings and dropped to within shouting distance of the crowds in west end park and on the slope of gilmorehill the thing flew quite steadily at a pace of about three miles an hour in a wide circle making a deep hum that would have drowned his full rich voice completely had he not provided himself with a megaphone he avoided churches buildings and monorail cables with consummate ease as he conversed  me names butteridge he shouted butteridgegot it me mother was scotch  and having assured himself that he had been understood he rose amidst cheers and shouting and patriotic cries and then flew up very swiftly and easily into the southeastern sky rising and falling with long easy undulations in an extraordinarily wasplike manner  his return to londonhe visited and hovered over manchester and liverpool and oxford on his way and spelt his name out to each placewas an occasion of unparalleled excitement every one was staring heavenward more people were run over in the streets upon that one day than in the previous three months and a county council steamboat the isaac walton collided with a pier of westminster bridge and narrowly escaped disaster by running ashoreit was low wateron the mud on the south side he returned to the crystal palace grounds that classic startingpoint of aeronautical adventure about sunset reentered his shed without disaster and had the doors locked immediately upon the photographers and journalists who been waiting his return  look here you chaps he said as his assistant did so im tired to death and saddle sore i cant give you a word of talk im toodone my names butteridge butteridge get that right im an imperial englishman ill talk to you all tomorrow  foggy snapshots still survive to record that incident his assistant struggles in a sea of aggressive young men carrying notebooks or upholding cameras and wearing bowler hats and enterprising ties he himself towers up in the doorway a big figure with a mouthan eloquent cavity beneath a vast black moustachedistorted by his shout to these relentless agents of publicity he towers there the most famous man in the country  almost symbolically he holds and gesticulates with a megaphone in his left hand  6  tom and bert smallways both saw that return they watched from the crest of bun hill from which they had so often surveyed the pyrotechnics of the crystal palace bert was excited tom kept calm and lumpish but neither of them realised how their own lives were to be invaded by the fruits of that beginning praps old grubbll mind the shop a bit now he said and put his blessed model in the fire not that that can save us if we dont tide over with steinharts account  bert knew enough of things and the problem of aeronautics to realise that this gigantic imitation of a bee would to use his own idiom give the newspapers fits the next day it was clear the fits had been given even as he said their magazine pages were black with hasty photographs their prose was convulsive they foamed at the headline the next day they were worse before the week was out they were not so much published as carried screaming into the street  the dominant fact in the uproar was the exceptional personality of mr butteridge and the extraordinary terms he demanded for the secret of his machine  for it was a secret and he kept it secret in the most elaborate fashion he built his apparatus himself in the safe privacy of the great crystal palace sheds with the assistance of inattentive workmen and the day next following his flight he took it to pieces single handed packed certain portions and then secured unintelligent assistance in packing and dispersing the rest sealed packingcases went north and east and west to various pantechnicons and the engines were boxed with peculiar care it became evident these precautions were not inadvisable in view of the violent demand for any sort of photograph or impressions of his machine but mr butteridge having once made his demonstration intended to keep his secret safe from any further risk of leakage he faced the british public now with the question whether they wanted his secret or not he was he said perpetually an imperial englishman and his first wish and his last was to see his invention the privilege and monopoly of the empire only  it was there the difficulty began  mr butteridge it became evident was a man singularly free from any false modestyindeed from any modesty of any kindsingularly willing to see interviewers answer questions upon any topic except aeronautics volunteer opinions criticisms and autobiography supply portraits and photographs of himself and generally spread his personality across the terrestrial sky the published portraits insisted primarily upon an immense black moustache and secondarily upon a fierceness behind the moustache the general impression upon the public was that butteridge was a small man no one big it was felt could have so virulently aggressive an expression though as a matter of fact butteridge had a height of six feet two inches and a weight altogether proportionate to that moreover he had a love affair of large and unusual dimensions and irregular circumstances and the still largely decorous british public learnt with reluctance and alarm that a sympathetic treatment of this affair was inseparable from the exclusive acquisition of the priceless secret of aerial stability by the british empire the exact particulars of the similarity never came to light but apparently the lady had in a fit of highminded inadvertence had gone through the ceremony of marriage with one quotes the unpublished discourse of mr butteridgea whitelivered skunk and this zoological aberration did in some legal and vexatious manner mar her social happiness he wanted to talk about the business to show the splendour of her nature in the light of its complications it was really most embarrassing to a press that has always possessed a considerable turn for reticence that wanted things personal indeed in the modern fashion yet not too personal it was embarrassing i say to be inexorably confronted with mr butteridges great heart to see it laid open in relentlesss selfvivisection and its pulsating dissepiments adorned with emphatic flag labels  confronted they were and there was no getting away from it he would make this appalling viscus beat and throb before the shrinking journalistsno uncle with a big watch and a little baby ever harped upon it so relentlessly whatever evasion they attempted he set aside he gloried in his love he said and compelled them to write it down  thats of course a private affair mr butteridge they would object  the injustice sorr is public i do not care either i am up against institutions or individuals i do not care if i am up against the universal all i am pleading the cause of a woman a woman i lurve sorra noble womanmisunderstood i intend to vindicate her sorr to the four winds of heaven  i lurve england he used to saylurve england but puritanism sorr i abhor it fills me with loathing it raises my gorge take my own case  he insisted relentlessly upon his heart and upon seeing proofs of the interview if they had not done justice to his erotic bellowings and gesticulations he stuck in in a large inky scrawl all and more than they had omitted  it was a strangely embarrassing thing for british journalism never was there a more obvious or uninteresting affair never had the world heard the story of erratic affection with less appetite or sympathy on the other hand it was extremely curious about mr butteridges invention but when mr butteridge could be deflected for a moment from the cause of the lady he championed then he talked chiefly and usually with tears of tenderness in his voice about his mother and his childhoodhis mother who crowned a complete encyclopedia of maternal virtue by being largely scotch she was not quite neat but nearly so i owe everything in me to me mother he assertedeverything eh andask any man whos done anything youll hear the same story all we have we owe to women they are the species sorr man is but a dream he comes and goes the womans soul leadeth us upward and on  he was always going on like that  what in particular he wanted from the government for his secret did not appear nor what beyond a money payment could be expected from a modern state in such an affair the general effect upon judicious observers indeed was not that he was treating for anything but that he was using an unexampled opportunity to bellow and show off to an attentive world rumours of his real identity spread abroad it was said that he had been the landlord of an ambiguous hotel in cape town and had there given shelter to and witnessed the experiments and finally stolen the papers and plans of an extremely shy and friendless young inventor named palliser who had come to south africa from england in an advanced stage of consumption and died there this at any rate was the allegation of the more outspoken american press but the proof or disproof of that never reached the public  mr butteridge also involved himself passionately in a tangle of disputes for the possession of a great number of valuable money prizes some of these had been offered so long ago as 1906 for successful mechanical flight by the time of mr butteridges success a really very considerable number of newspapers tempted by the impunity of the pioneers in this direction had pledged themselves to pay in some cases quite overwhelming sums to the first person to fly from manchester to glasgow from london to manchester one hundred miles two hundred miles in england and the like most had hedged a little with ambiguous conditions and now offered resistance one or two paid at once and vehemently called attention to the fact and mr butteridge plunged into litigation with the more recalcitrant while at the same time sustaining a vigorous agitation and canvass to induce the government to purchase his invention  one fact however remained permanent throughout all the developments of this affair behind butteridges preposterous love interest his politics and personality and all his shouting and boasting and that was that so far as the mass of people knew he was in sole possession of the secret of the practicable aeroplane in which for all one could tell to the contrary the key of the future empire of the world resided and presently to the great consternation of innumerable people including among others mr bert smallways it became apparent that whatever negotiations were in progress for the acquisition of this precious secret by the british government were in danger of falling through the london daily requiem first voiced the universal alarm and published an interview under the terrific caption of mr butteridge speaks his mind  therein the inventorif he was an inventorpoured out his heart  i came from the end of the earth he said which rather seemed to confirm the cape town story bringing me motherland the secret that would give her the empire of the world and what do i get he paused i am sniffed at by elderly mandarins and the woman i love is treated like a leper  i am an imperial englishman he went on in a splendid outburst subsequently written into the interview by his own hand but there there are limits to the human heart there are younger nationsliving nations nations that do not snore and gurgle helplessly in paroxysms of plethora upon beds of formality and red tape there are nations that will not fling away the empire of earth in order to slight an unknown man and insult a noble woman whose boots they are not fitted to unlatch there are nations not blinded to science not given over hand and foot to effete snobocracies and degenerate decadents in short mark my wordsthere are other nations  this speech it was that particularly impressed bert smallways if them germans or them americans get hold of this he said impressively to his brother the british empires done its up the union jack so to speak wont be worth the paper its written on tom  i suppose you couldnt lend us a hand this morning said jessica in his impressive pause everybody in bun hill seems wanting early potatoes at once tom cant carry half of them  were living on a volcano said bert disregarding the suggestion at any moment war may comesuch a war  he shook his head portentously  youd better take this lot first tom said jessica she turned briskly on bert can you spare us a morning she asked  i dessay i can said bert the shops very quiet smorning though all this danger to the empire worries me something frightful  workll take it off your mind said jessica  and presently he too was going out into a world of change and wonder bowed beneath a load of potatoes and patriotic insecurity that merged at last into a very definite irritation at the weight and want of style of the potatoes and a very clear conception of the entire detestableness of jessica    chapter ii how bert smallways got into difficulties  it did not occur to either tom or bert smallways that this remarkable aerial performance of mr butteridge was likely to affect either of their lives in any special manner that it would in any way single them out from the millions about them and when they had witnessed it from the crest of bun hill and seen the flylike mechanism its rotating planes a golden haze in the sunset sink humming to the harbour of its shed again they turned back towards the sunken greengrocery beneath the great iron standard of the london to brighton monorail and their minds reverted to the discussion that had engaged them before mr butteridges triumph had come in sight out of the london haze  it was a difficult and unsuccessful discussions they had to carry it on in shouts because of the moaning and roaring of the gyroscopic motorcars that traversed the high street and in its nature it was contentious and private the grubb business was in difficulties and grubb in a moment of financial eloquence had given a halfshare in it to bert whose relations with his employer had been for some time unsalaried and pallish and informal  bert was trying to impress tom with the idea that the reconstructed grubb  smallways offered unprecedented and unparalleled opportunities to the judicious small investor it was coming home to bert as though it were an entirely new fact that tom was singularly impervious to ideas in the end he put the financial issues on one side and making the thing entirely a matter of fraternal affection succeeded in borrowing a sovereign on the security of his word of honour  the firm of grubb  smallways formerly grubb had indeed been singularly unlucky in the last year or so for many years the business had struggled along with a flavour of romantic insecurity in a small dissolutelooking shop in the high street adorned with brilliantly coloured advertisements of cycles a display of bells trouserclips oilcans pumpclips framecases wallets and other accessories and the announcement of bicycles on hire repairs free inflation petrol and similar attractions they were agents for several obscure makes of bicycletwo samples constituted the stockand occasionally they effected a sale they also repaired punctures and did their bestthough luck was not always on their sidewith any other repairing that was brought to them they handled a line of cheap gramophones and did a little with musical boxes  the staple of their business was however the letting of bicycles on hire it was a singular trade obeying no known commercial or economic principlesindeed no principles there was a stock of ladies and gentlemens bicycles in a state of disrepair that passes description and these the hiring stock were let to unexacting and reckless people inexpert in the things of this world at a nominal rate of one shilling for the first hour and sixpence per hour afterwards but really there were no fixed prices and insistent boys could get bicycles and the thrill of danger for an hour for so low a sum as threepence provided they could convince grubb that that was all they had the saddle and handlebar were then sketchily adjusted by grubb a deposit exacted except in the case of familiar boys the machine lubricated and the adventurer started upon his career usually he or she came back but at times when the accident was serious bert or grubb had to go out and fetch the machine home hire was always charged up to the hour of return to the shop and deducted from the deposit it was rare that a bicycle started out from their hands in a state of pedantic efficiency romantic possibilities of accident lurked in the worn thread of the screw that adjusted the saddle in the precarious pedals in the looseknit chain in the handlebars above all in the brakes and tyres tappings and clankings and strange rhythmic creakings awoke as the intrepid hirer pedalled out into the country then perhaps the bell would jam or a brake fail to act on a hill or the seatpillar would get loose and the saddle drop three or four inches with a disconcerting bump or the loose and rattling chain would jump the cogs of the chainwheel as the machine ran downhill and so bring the mechanism to an abrupt and disastrous stop without at the same time arresting the forward momentum of the rider or a tyre would bang or sigh quietly and give up the struggle for efficiency  when the hirer returned a heated pedestrian grubb would ignore all verbal complaints and examine the machine gravely  this aint ad fair usage he used to begin  he became a mild embodiment of the spirit of reason you cant expect a bicycle to take you up in its arms and carry you he used to say you got to show intelligence after allits machinery  sometimes the process of liquidating the consequent claims bordered on violence it was always a very rhetorical and often a trying affair but in these progressive times you have to make a noise to get a living it was often hard work but nevertheless this hiring was a fairly steady source of profit until one day all the panes in the window and door were broken and the stock on sale in the window greatly damaged and disordered by two overcritical hirers with no sense of rhetorical irrelevance they were big coarse stokers from gravesend one was annoyed because his left pedal had come off and the other because his tyre had become deflated small and indeed negligible accidents by bun hill standards due entirely to the ungentle handling of the delicate machines entrusted to themand they failed to see clearly how they put themselves in the wrong by this method of argument it is a poor way of convincing a man that he has let you a defective machine to throw his footpump about his shop and take his stock of gongs outside in order to return them through the windowpanes it carried no real conviction to the minds of either grubb or bert it only irritated and vexed them one quarrel makes many and this unpleasantness led to a violent dispute between grubb and the landlord upon the moral aspects of and legal responsibility for the consequent reglazing in the end grubb and smallways were put to the expense of a strategic nocturnal removal to another position  it was a position they had long considered it was a small shedlike shop with a plateglass window and one room behind just at the sharp bend in the road at the bottom of bun hill and here they struggled along bravely in spite of persistent annoyance from their former landlord hoping for certain eventualities the peculiar situation of the shop seemed to promise here too they were doomed to disappointment  the high road from london to brighton that ran through bun hill was like the british empire or the british constitutiona thing that had grown to its present importance unlike any other roads in europe the british high roads have never been subjected to any organised attempts to grade or straighten them out and to that no doubt their peculiar picturesqueness is to be ascribed the old bun hill high street drops at its end for perhaps eighty or a hundred feet of descent at an angle of one in five turns at right angles to the left runs in a curve for about thirty yards to a brick bridge over the dry ditch that had once been the otterbourne and then bends sharply to the right again round a dense clump of trees and goes on a simple straightforward peaceful high road there had been one or two horseandvan and bicycle accidents in the place before the shop bert and grubb took was built and to be frank it was the probability of others that attracted them to it  its possibilities had come to them first with a humorous flavour  heres one of the places where a chap might get a living by keeping hens said grubb  you cant get a living by keeping hens said bert  youd keep the hen and have it spatchcocked said grubb the motor chaps would pay for it  when they really came to take the place they remembered this conversation hens however were out of the question there was no place for a run unless they had it in the shop it would have been obviously out of place there the shop was much more modern than their former one and had a plateglass front sooner or later said bert we shall get a motorcar through this  thats all right said grubb compensation i dont mind when that motorcar comes along i dont mind even if it gives me a shock to the system  and meanwhile said bert with great artfulness im going to buy myself a dog  he did he bought three in succession he surprised the people at the dogs home in battersea by demanding a deaf retriever and rejecting every candidate that pricked up its ears i want a good deaf slowmoving dog he said a dog that doesnt put himself out for things  they displayed inconvenient curiosity they declared a great scarcity of deaf dogs  you see they said dogs arent deaf  mines got to be said bert ive had dogs that arent deaf all i want its like this you seei sell gramophones naturally i got to make em talk and tootle a bit to show em orf well a dog that isnt deaf doesnt like itgets excited smells round barks growls that upsets the customer see then a dog that has his hearing fancies things makes burglars out of passing tramps wants to fight every motor that makes a whizz all very well if you want livening up but our place is lively enough i dont want a dog of that sort i want a quiet dog  in the end he got three in succession but none of them turned out well the first strayed off into the infinite heeding no appeals the second was killed in the night by a fruit motorwaggon which fled before grubb could get down the third got itself entangled in the front wheel of a passing cyclist who came through the plate glass and proved to be an actor out of work and an undischarged bankrupt he demanded compensation for some fancied injury would hear nothing of the valuable dog he had killed or the window he had broken obliged grubb by sheer physical obduracy to straighten his buckled front wheel and pestered the struggling firm with a series of inhumanly worded solicitors letters grubb answered themstingingly and put himself bert thought in the wrong  affairs got more and more exasperating and strained under these pressures the window was boarded up and an unpleasant altercation about their delay in repairing it with the new landlord a bun hill butcherand a loud bellowing unreasonable person at thatserved to remind them of their unsettled troubles with the old things were at this pitch when bert bethought himself of creating a sort of debenture capital in the business for the benefit of tom but as i have said tom had no enterprise in his composition his idea of investment was the stocking he bribed his brother not to keep the offer open  and then illluck made its last lunge at their crumbling business and brought it to the ground  2  it is a poor heart that never rejoices and whitsuntide had an air of coming as an agreeable break in the business complications of grubb  smallways encouraged by the practical outcome of berts negotiations with his brother and by the fact that half the hiringstock was out from saturday to monday they decided to ignore the residuum of hiringtrade on sunday and devote that day to muchneeded relaxation and refreshmentto have in fact an unstinted good time a beano on whit sunday and return invigorated to grapple with their difficulties and the bank holiday repairs on the monday no good thing was ever done by exhausted and dispirited men it happened that they had made the acquaintance of two young ladies in employment in clapham miss flossie bright and miss edna bunthorne and it was resolved therefore to make a cheerful little cyclist party of four into the heart of kent and to picnic and spend an indolent afternoon and evening among the trees and bracken between ashford and maidstone  miss bright could ride a bicycle and a machine was found for her not among the hiring stock but specially in the sample held for sale miss bunthorne whom bert particularly affected could not ride and so with some difficulty he hired a basketwork trailer from the big business of wrays in the clapham road  to see our young men brightly dressed and cigarettes alight wheeling off to the rendezvous grubb guiding the ladys machine beside him with one skilful hand and bert teufteuffing steadily was to realise how pluck may triumph even over insolvency their landlord the butcher said gurr as they passed and shouted go it in a loud savage tone to their receding backs  much they cared  the weather was fine and though they were on their way southward before nine oclock there was already a great multitude of holiday people abroad upon the roads there were quantities of young men and women on bicycles and motorbicycles and a majority of gyroscopic motorcars running bicyclefashion on two wheels mingled with oldfashioned fourwheeled traffic bank holiday times always bring out old storedaway vehicles and odd people one saw tricars and electric broughams and dilapidated old racing motors with huge pneumatic tyres once our holidaymakers saw a horse and cart and once a youth riding a black horse amidst the badinage of the passersby and there were several navigable gas airships not to mention balloons in the air it was all immensely interesting and refreshing after the dark anxieties of the shop edna wore a brown straw hat with poppies that suited her admirably and sat in the trailer like a queen and the eightyearold motorbicycle ran like a thing of yesterday  little it seemed to matter to mr bert smallways that a newspaper placard proclaimed  germany denounces the monroe           doctrine     ambiguous attitude of japan what will britain do is it war  this sort of thing was alvays going on and on holidays one disregarded it as a matter of course weekdavs in the slack time after the midday meal then perhaps one might worry about the empire and international politics but not on a sunny sunday with a pretty girl trailing behind one and envious cyclists trying to race you nor did our young people attach any great importance to the flitting suggestions of military activity they glimpsed ever and again near maidstone they came on a string of eleven motorguns of peculiar construction halted by the roadside with a number of businesslike engineers grouped about them watching through fieldglasses some sort of entrenchment that was going on near the crest of the downs it signified nothing to bert  whats up said edna  ohmanoeuvres said bert  oh i thought they did them at easter said edna and troubled no more  the last great british war the boer war was over and forgotten and the public had lost the fashion of expert military criticism  our four young people picnicked cheerfully and were happy in the manner of a happiness that was an ancient mode in nineveh eyes were bright grubb was funny and almost witty and bert achieved epigrams the hedges were full of honeysuckle and dogroses in the woods the distant toottoottoot of the traffic on the dusthazy high road might have been no more than the horns of elfland they laughed and gossiped and picked flowers and made love and talked and the girls smoked cigarettes also they scuffled playfully among other things they talked aeronautics and how thev would come for a picnic together in berts flyingmachine before ten years were out the world seemed full of amusing possibilities that afternoon they wondered what their greatgrandparents would have thought of aeronautics in the evening about seven the party turned homeward expecting no disaster and it was only on the crest of the downs between wrotham and kingsdown that disaster came  they had come up the hill in the twilight bert was anxious to get as far as possible before he litor attempted to light for the issue was a doubtful onehis lamps and they had scorched past a number of cyclists and by a fourwheeled motorcar of the old style lamed by a deflated tyre some dust had penetrated berts horn and the result was a curious amusing wheezing sound had got into his honk honk for the sake of merriment and glory he was making this sound as much as possible and edna was in fits of laughter in the trailer they made a sort of rushing cheerfulness along the road that affected their fellow travellers variously according to their temperaments she did notice a good lot of bluish evilsmelling smoke coming from about the bearings between his feet but she thought this was one of the natural concomitants of motortraction and troubled no more about it until abruptly it burst into a little yellowtipped flame  bert she screamed  but bert had put on the brakes with such suddenness that she found herself involved with his leg as he dismounted she got to the side of the road and hastily readjusted her hat which had suffered  gaw said bert  he stood for some fatal seconds watching the petrol drip and catch and the flame which was now beginning to smell of enamel as well as oil spread and grew his chief idea was the sorrowful one that he had not sold the machine secondhand a year ago and that he ought to have done soa good idea in its way but not immediately helpful he turned upon edna sharply get a lot of wet sand he said then he wheeled the machine a little towards the side of the roadway and laid it down and looked about for a supply of wet sand the flames received this as a helpful attention and made the most of it they seemed to brighten and the twilight to deepen about them the road was a flinty road in the chalk country and illprovided with sand  edna accosted a short fat cyclist we want wet sand she said and added our motors on fire the short fat cyclist stared blankly for a moment then with a helpful cry began to scrabble in the roadgrit whereupon bert and edna also scrabbled in the roadgrit other cyclists arrived dismounted and stood about and their flamelit faces expressed satisfaction interest curiosity wet sand said the short fat man scrabbling terriblywet sand one joined him they threw hardearned handfuls of roadgrit upon the flames which accepted them with enthusiasm  grubb arrived riding hard he was shouting something he sprang off and threw his bicycle into the hedge dont throw water on it he saiddont throw water on it he displayed commanding presence of mind he became captain of the occasion others were glad to repeat the things he said and imitate his actions  dont throw water on it they cried also there was no water  beat it out you fools he said  he seized a rug from the trailer it was an austrian blanket and berts winter coverlet and began to beat at the burning petrol for a wonderful minute he seemed to succeed but he scattered burning pools of petrol on the road and others fired by his enthusiasm imitated his action bert caught up a trailercushion and began to beat there was another cushion and a tablecloth and these also were seized a young hero pulled off his jacket and joined the beating for a moment there was less talking than hard breathing and a tremendous flapping flossie arriving on the outskirts of the crowd cried oh my god and burst loudly into tears help she said and fire  the lame motorcar arrived and stopped in consternation a tall goggled greyhaired man who was driving inquired with an oxford intonation and a clear careful enunciation can we help at all  it became manifest that the rug the tablecloth the cushions the jacket were getting smeared with petrol and burning the soul seemed to go out of the cushion bert was swaying and the air was full of feathers like a snowstorm in the still twilight  bert had got very dusty and sweaty and strenuous it seemed to him his weapon had been wrested from him at the moment of victory the fire lay like a dying thing close to the ground and wicked it gave a leap of anguish at every whack of the beaters but now grubb had gone off to stamp out the burning blanket the others were lacking just at the moment of victory one had dropped the cushion and was running to the motorcar ere cried bert keep on  he flung the deflated burning rags of cushion aside whipped off his jacket and sprang at the flames with a shout he stamped into the ruin until flames ran up his boots edna saw him a redlit hero and thought it was good to be a man  a bystander was hit by a hot halfpenny flying out of the air then bert thought of the papers in his pockets and staggered back trying to extinguish his burning jacketchecked repulsed dismayed  edna was struck by the benevolent appearance of an elderly spectator in a silk hat and sabbatical garments oh she cried to him help this young man how can you stand and see it  a cry of the tarpaulin arose  an earnestlooking man in a very light grey cyclingsuit had suddenly appeared at the side of the lame motorcar and addressed the owner have you a tarpaulin he said  yes said the gentlemanly man yes weve got a tarpaulin  thats it said the earnestlooking man suddenly shouting lets have it quick  the gentlemanly man with feeble and deprecatory gestures and in the manner of a hypnotised person produced an excellent large tarpaulin  here cried the earnestlooking man to grubb ketch holt  then everybody realised that a new method was to be tried a number of willing hands seized upon the oxford gentlemans tarpaulin the others stood away with approving noises the tarpaulin was held over the burning bicycle like a canopy and then smothered down upon it  we ought to have done this before panted grubb  there was a moment of triumph the flames vanished every one who could contrive to do so touched the edge of the tarpaulin bert held down a corner with two hands and a foot the tarpaulin bulged up in the centre seemed to be suppressing triumphant exultation then its selfapproval became too much for it it burst into a bright red smile in the centre it was exactly like the opening of a mouth it laughed with a gust of flames they were reflected redly in the observant goggles of the gentleman who owned the tarpaulin everybody recoiled  save the trailer cried some one and that was the last round in the battle but the trailer could not be detached its wickerwork had caught and it was the last thing to burn a sort of hush fell upon the gathering the petrol burnt low the wickerwork trailer banged and crackled the crowd divided itself into an outer circle of critics advisers and secondary characters who had played undistinguished parts or no parts at all in the affair and a central group of heated and distressed principals a young man with an inquiring mind and a considerable knowledge of motorbicycles fixed on to grubb and wanted to argue that the thing could not have happened grubb wass short and inattentive with him and the young man withdrew to the back of the crowd and there told the benevolent old gentleman in the silk hat that people who went out with machines they didnt understand had only themselves to blame if things went wrong  the old gentleman let him talk for some time and then remarked in a tone of rapturous enjoyment stone deaf and added nasty things  a rosyfaced man in a straw hat claimed attention i did save the front wheel he said youd have had that tyre catch too if i hadnt kept turning it round it became manifest that this was so the front wheel had retained its tyre was intact was still rotating slowly among the blackened and twisted ruins of the rest of the machine it had something of that air of conscious virtue of unimpeachable respectability that distinguishes a rent collector in a low neighbourhood that wheels worth a pound said the rosyfaced man making a song of it i kep turning it round  newcomers kept arriving from the south with the question whats up until it got on grubbs nerves londonward the crowd was constantly losing people they would mount their various wheels with the satisfied manner of spectators who have had the best their voices would recede into the twilight one would hear a laugh at the memory of this particularly salient incident or that  im afraid said the gentleman of the motorcar my tarpaulins a bit done for  grubb admitted that the owner was the best judge of that  nothin else i can do for you said the gentleman of the motorcar it may be with a suspicion of irony  bert was roused to action look here he said theres my young lady if she aint ome by ten they lock her out see well all my money was in my jacket pocket and its all mixed up with the burnt stuff and thats too ot to touch is clapham out of your way  all in the days work said the gentleman with the motorcar and turned to edna very pleased indeed he said if youll come with us were late for dinner as it is so it wont make much difference for us to go home by way of clapham weve got to get to surbiton anyhow im afraid youll find us a little slow  but whats bert going to do said edna  i dont know that we can accommodate bert said the motorcar gentleman though were tremendously anxious to oblige  you couldnt take the whole lot said bert waving his hand at the deboshed and blackened ruins on the ground  im awfully afraid i cant said the oxford man awfully sorry you know  then ill have to stick ere for a bit said bert i got to see the thing through you go on edna  dont like leavin you bert  you cant elp it edna  the last edna saw of bert was his figure in charred and blackened shirtsleeves standing in the dusk he was musing deeply by the mixed ironwork and ashes of his vanished motorbicycle a melancholy figure his retinue of spectators had shrunk now to half a dozen figures flossie and grubb were preparing to follow her desertion  cheer up old bert cried edna with artificial cheerfulness so long  so long edna said bert  see you tomorrer  see you tomorrer said bert though he was destined as a matter of fact to see much of the habitable globe before he saw her again  bert began to light matches from a borrowed boxful and search for a halfcrown that still eluded him among the charred remains  his face was grave and melancholy  i wish that adnt appened said flossie riding on with grubb  and at last bert was left almost alone a sad blackened promethean figure cursed by the gift of fire he had entertained vague ideas of hiring a cart of achieving miraculous repairs of still snatching some residual value from his one chief possession now in the darkening night he perceived the vanity of such intentions truth came to him bleakly and laid her chill conviction upon him he took hold of the handlebar stood the thing up tried to push it forward the tyreless hindwheel was jammed hopelessly even as he feared for a minute or so he stood upholding his machine a motionless despair then with a great effort he thrust the ruins from him into the ditch kicked at it once regarded it for a moment and turned his face resolutely londonward  he did not once look back  thats the end of that game said bert no more teufteufteuf for bert smallways for a year or two goodbye olidays oh i ought to ave sold the blasted thing when i had a chance three years ago  3  the next morning found the firm of grubb  smallways in a state of profound despondency it seemed a small matter to them that the newspaper and cigarette shop opposite displayed such placards as this   reported american ultimatum         britain must fight    our infatuated war office still refuses to listen to mr butteridge  great monorail disaster at timbuctoo  or this  war a question of hours          new york calm       excitement in berlin  or again  washington still silent       what will paris do      the panic on the bourse  the kings garden party to the       masked twaregs  mr butteridge takes an offer  latest betting from teheran  or this  will america fight       antigerman riot in bagdad    the municipal scandals at damascus  mr butteridges invention for america  bert stared at these over the card of pumpclips in the pane in the door with unseeing eyes he wore a blackened flannel shirt and the jacketless ruins of the holiday suit of yesterday the boardedup shop was dark and depressing beyond words the few scandalous hiring machines had never looked so hopelessly disreputable he thought of their fellows who were out and of the approaching disputations of the afternoon he thought of their new landlord and of their old landlord and of bills and claims life presented itself for the first time as a hopeless fight against fate  grubb o man he said distilling the quintessence im fair sick of this shop  som i said grubb  im out of conceit with it i dont seem to care ever to speak to a customer again  theres that trailer said grubb after a pause  blow the trailer said bert anyhow i didnt leave a deposit on it i didnt do that still  he turned round on his friend look ere he said we arent gettin on here we been losing money hand over fist we got things tied up in fifty knots  what can we do said grubb  clear out sell what we can for what it will fetch and quit see its no good anging on to a losing concern no sort of good jest foolishness  thats all right said grubbthats all right but it aint your capital been sunk in it  no need for us to sink after our capital said bert ignoring the point  im not going to be held responsible for that trailer anyhow that aint my affair  nobody arst you to make it your affair if you like to stick on here well and good im quitting ill see bank holiday through and then im orph see  leavin me  leavin you if you must be left  grubb looked round the shop it certainly had become distasteful once upon a time it had been bright with hope and new beginnings and stock and the prospect of credit nownow it was failure and dust very likely the landlord would be round presently to go on with the row about the window where dyou think of going bert grubb asked  bert turned round and regarded him i thought it out as i was walking ome and in bed i couldnt sleep a wink  what did you think out  plans  what plans  oh youre for stickin here  not if anything better was to offer  its only an ideer said bert  you made the girls laugh yestiday that song you sang  seems a long time ago now said grubb  and old edna nearly criedover that bit of mine  she got a fly in her eye said grubb i saw it but whats this got to do with your plan  no end said bert  ow  dont you see  not singing in the streets  streets no fear but ow about the tour of the waterin places of england grubb singing young men of family doing it for a lark you aint got a bad voice you know and mines all right i never see a chap singing on the beach yet that i couldnt ave sung into a cocked hat and we both know how to put on the toff a bit eh well thats my ideer me and you grubb with a refined song and a breakdown like we was doing for foolery yestiday that was what put it into my ead easy make up a programmeeasy six choice items and one or two for encores and patter im all right for the patter anyhow  grubb remained regarding his darkened and disheartening shop he thought of his former landlord and his present landlord and of the general disgustingness of business in an age which reechoes to the bitter cry of the middle class and then it seemed to him that afar off he heard the twankle twankle of a banjo and the voice of a stranded siren singing he had a sense of hot sunshine upon sand of the children of at least transiently opulent holiday makers in a circle round about him of the whisper they are really gentlemen and then dollop dollop came the coppers in the hat sometimes even silver it was all income no outgoings no bills im on bert he said  right o said bert and now we shant be long  we neednt start without capital neither said grubb if we take the best of these machines up to the bicycle mart in finsbury wed raise six or seven pounds on em we could easy do that tomorrow before anybody much was about  nice to think of old suetandbones coming round to make his usual row with us and finding a card up closed for repairs  well do that said grubb with zestwell do that and well put up another notice and jest arst all inquirers to go round to im and inquire see then theyll know all about us  before the day was out the whole enterprise was planned they decided at first that they would call themselves the naval mr os a plagiarism and not perhaps a very good one from the title of the wellknown troupe of scarlet mr es and bert rather clung to the idea of a uniform of bright blue serge with a lot of gold lace and cord and ornamentation rather like a naval officers but more so but that had to be abandoned as impracticable it would have taken too much time and money to prepare they perceived they must wear some cheaper and more readily prepared costume and grubb fell back on white dominoes they entertained the notion for a time of selecting the two worst machines from the hiringstock painting them over with crimson enamel paint replacing the bells by the loudest sort of motorhorn and doing a ride about to begin and end the entertainment they doubted the advisability of this step  theres people in the world said bert who wouldnt recognise us whod know them bicycles again like a shot and we dont want to go on with no old stories we want a fresh start  i do said grubb badly  we want to forget thingsand cut all these rotten old worries they aint doin us good  nevertheless they decided to take the risk of these bicycles and they decided their costumes should be brown stockings and sandals and cheap unbleached sheets with a hole cut in the middle and wigs and beards of tow the rest their normal selves the desert dervishes they would call themselves and their chief songs would be those popular ditties in my trailer and what price hairpins now  they decided to begin with small seaside places and gradually as they gained confidence attack larger centres to begin with they selected littlestone in kent chiefly because of its unassuming name  so they planned and it seemed a small and unimportant thing to them that as they clattered the governments of half the world and more were drifting into war about midday they became aware of the first of the eveningpaper placards shouting to them across the street   the warcloud darkens  nothing else but that  always rottin about war now said bert  theyll get it in the neck in real earnest one of these days if they aint precious careful  4  so you will understand the sudden apparition that surprised rather than delighted the quiet informality of dymchurch sands dymchurch was one of the last places on the coast of england to be reached by the monorail and so its spacious sands were still at the time of this story the secret and delight of quite a limited number of people they went there to flee vulgarity and extravagances and to bathe and sit and talk and play with their children in peace and the desert dervishes did not please them at all  the two white figures on scarlet wheels came upon them out of the infinite along the sands from littlestone grew nearer and larger and more audible honkhonking and emitting weird cries and generally threatening liveliness of the most aggressive type good heavens said dymchurch whats this  then our young men according to a preconcerted plan wheeled round from file to line dismounted and stood it attention ladies and gentlemen they said we beg to present ourselvesthe desert dervishes they bowed profoundly  the few scattered groups upon the beach regarded them with horror for the most part but some of the children and young people were interested and drew nearer there aint a bob on the beach said grubb in an undertone and the desert dervishes plied their bicycles with comic business that got a laugh from one very unsophisticated little boy then they took a deep breath and struck into the cheerful strain of what price hairpins now grubb sang the song bert did his best to make the chorus a rousing one and it the end of each verse they danced certain steps skirts in hand that they had carefully rehearsed       tingalingatingalingatingalingatang      what price hairpins now  so they chanted and danced their steps in the sunshine on dymchurch beach and the children drew near these foolish young men marvelling that they should behave in this way and the older people looked cold and unfriendly  all round the coasts of europe that morning banjos were ringing voices were bawling and singing children were playing in the sun pleasureboats went to and fro the common abundant life of the time unsuspicious of all dangers that gathered darkly against it flowed on its cheerful aimless way in the cities men fussed about their businesses and engagements the newspaper placards that had cried wolf so often cried wolf now in vain  5  now as bert and grubb bawled their chorus for the third time they became aware of a very big goldenbrown balloon low in the sky to the northwest and coming rapidly towards them jest as were gettin hold of em muttered grubb up comes a counterattraction go it bert       tingalingatingalingatingalingatang      what price hairpins now  the balloon rose and fell went out of sightlanded thank goodness said grubbreappeared with a leap eng said grubb step it bert or theyll see it  they finished their dance and then stood frankly staring  theres something wrong with that balloon said bert  everybody now was looking at the balloon drawing rapidly nearer before a brisk northwesterly breeze the song and dance were a dead frost nobody thought any more about it even bert and grubb forgot it and ignored the next item on the programme altogether the balloon was bumping as though its occupants were trying to land it would approach sinking slowly touch the ground and instantly jump fifty feet or so in the air and immediately begin to fall again its car touched a clump of trees and the black figure that had been struggling in the ropes fell back or jumped back into the car in another moment it was quite close it seemed a huge affair as big as a house and it floated down swiftly towards the sands a long rope trailed behind it and enormous shouts came from the man in the car he seemed to be taking off his clothes then his head came over the side of the car catch hold of the rope they heard quite plain  salvage bert cried grubb and started to head off the rope  bert followed him and collided without upsetting with a fisherman bent upon a similar errand a woman carrying a baby in her arms two small boys with toy spades and a stout gentleman in flannels all got to the trailing rope at about the same time and began to dance over it in their attempts to secure it bert came up to this wriggling elusive serpent and got his foot on it went down on all fours and achieved a grip in half a dozen seconds the whole diffused population of the beach had as it were crystallised on the rope and was pulling against the balloon under the vehement and stimulating directions of the man in the car pull i tell you said the man in the carpull  for a second or so the balloon obeyed its momentum and the wind and tugged its human anchor seaward it dropped touched the water and made a flat silvery splash and recoiled as ones finger recoils when one touches anything hot pull her in said the man in the car shes fainted  he occupied himself with some unseen object while the people on the rope pulled him in bert was nearest the balloon and much excited and interested he kept stumbling over the tail of the dervish costume in his zeal he had never imagined before what a big light wallowing thing a balloon was the car was of brown coarse wickerwork and comparatively small the rope he tugged at was fastened to a stoutlooking ring four or five feet above the car at each tug he drew in a yard or so of rope and the waggling wickerwork was drawn so much nearer out of the car came wrathful bellowings fainted she has and then its her heartbroken with all shes had to go through  the balloon ceased to struggle and sank downward bert dropped the rope and ran forward to catch it in a new place in another moment he had his hand on the car lay hold of it said the man in the car and his face appeared close to bertsa strangely familiar face fierce eyebrows a flattish nose a huge black moustache he had discarded coat and waistcoatperhaps with some idea of presently having to swim for his lifeand his black hair was extraordinarily disordered will all you people get hold round the car he said theres a lady here faintedor got failure of the heart heaven alone knows which my name is butteridge butteridge my name isin a balloon now please all on to the edge this is the last time i trust myself to one of these paleolithic contrivances the rippingcord failed and the valve wouldnt act if ever i meet the scoundrel who ought to have seen  he stuck his head out between the ropes abruptly and said in a note of earnest expostulation get some brandysome neat brandy some one went up the beach for it  in the car sprawling upon a sort of bedbench in an attitude of elaborate selfabandonment was a large blond lady wearing a fur coat and a big floriferous hat her head lolled back against the padded corner of the car and her eyes were shut and her mouth open me dear said mr butteridge in a common loud voice were safe  she gave no sign  me dear said mr butteridge in a greatly intensified loud voice were safe  she was still quite impassive  then mr butteridge showed the fiery core of his soul if she is dead he said slowly lifting a fist towards the balloon above him and speaking in an immense tremulous bellowif she is dead i will rrrend the heavens like a garment i must get her out he cried his nostrils dilated with emotioni must get her out i cannot have her die in a wickerwork basket nine feet squareshe who was made for kings palaces keep holt of this car is there a strong man among ye to take her if i hand her out  he swept the lady together by a powerful movement of his arms and lifted her keep the car from jumping he said to those who clustered about him keep your weight on it she is no light woman and when she is out of itit will be relieved  bert leapt lightly into a sitting position on the edge of the car the others took a firmer grip upon the ropes and ring  are you ready said mr butteridge  he stood upon the bedbench and lifted the lady carefully then he sat down on the wicker edge opposite to bert and put one leg over to dangle outside a rope or so seemed to incommode him will some one assist me he said if they would take this lady  it was just at this moment with mr butteridge and the lady balanced finely on the basket brim that she cameto she cameto suddenly and violently with a loud heartrending cry of alfred save me and she waved her arms searchingly and then clasped mr butteridge about  it seemed to bert that the car swayed for a moment and then buckjumped and kicked him also he saw the boots of the lady and the right leg of the gentleman describing arcs through the air preparatory to vanishing over the side of the car his impressions were complex but they also comprehended the fact that he had lost his balance and was going to stand on his head inside this creaking basket he spread out clutching arms he did stand on his head more or less his towbeard came off and got in his mouth and his cheek slid along against padding his nose buried itself in a bag of sand the car gave a violent lurch and became still  confound it he said  he had an impression he must be stunned because of a surging in his ears and because all the voices of the people about him had become small and remote they were shouting like elves inside a hill  he found it a little difficult to get on his feet his limbs were mixed up with the garments mr butteridge had discarded when that gentleman had thought he must needs plunge into the sea bert bawled out half angry half rueful you might have said you were going to tip the basket then he stood up and clutched the ropes of the car convulsively  below him far below him shining blue were the waters of the english channel far off a little thing in the sunshine and rushing down as if some one was bending it hollow was the beach and the irregular cluster of houses that constitutes dymchurch he could see the little crowd of people he had so abruptly left grubb in the white wrapper of a desert dervish was running along the edge of the sea mr butteridge was kneedeep in the water bawling immensely the lady was sitting up with her floriferous hat in her lap shockingly neglected the beach east and west was dotted with little peoplethey seemed all heads and feetlooking up and the balloon released from the twentyfive stone or so of mr butteridge and his lady was rushing up into the sky at the pace of a racing motorcar my crikey said bert heres a go  he looked down with a pinched face at the receding beach and reflected that he wasnt giddy then he made a superficial survey of the cords and ropes about him with a vague idea of doing something im not going to mess about with the thing he said at last and sat down upon the mattress im not going to touch it i wonder what one ought to do  soon he got up again and stared for a long time it the sinking world below at white cliffs to the east and flattening marsh to the left at a minute wide prospect of weald and downland at dim towns and harbours and rivers and ribbonlike roads at ships and ships decks and foreshortened funnels upon the everwidening sea and at the great monorail bridge that straddled the channel from folkestone to boulogne until at last first little wisps and then a veil of filmy cloud hid the prospect from his eyes he wasnt at all giddy nor very much frightened only in a state of enormous consternation    chapter iii the balloon  i  bert smallways was a vulgar little creature the sort of pert limited soul that the old civilisation of the early twentieth century produced by the million in every country of the world he had lived all his life in narrow streets and between mean houses he could not look over and in a narrow circle of ideas from which there was no escape he thought the whole duty of man was to be smarter than his fellows get his hands as he put it on the dibs and have a good time he was in fact the sort of man who had made england and america what they were the luck had been against him so far but that was by the way he was a mere aggressive and acquisitive individual with no sense of the state no habitual loyalty no devotion no code of honour no code even of courage now by a curious accident he found himself lifted out of his marvellous modern world for a time out of all the rush and confused appeals of it and floating like a thing dead and disembodied between sea and sky it was as if heaven was experimenting with him had picked him out as a sample from the english millions to look at him more nearly and to see what was happening to the soul of man but what heaven made of him in that case i cannot profess to imagine for i have long since abandoned all theories about the ideals and satisfactions of heaven  to be alone in a balloon at a height of fourteen or fifteen thousand feetand to that height bert smallways presently rose is like nothing else in human experience it is one of the supreme things possible to man no flying machine can ever better it it is to pass extraordinarily out of human things it is to be still and alone to an unprecedented degree it is solitude without the suggestion of intervention it is calm without a single irrelevant murmur it is to see the sky no sound reaches one of all the roar and jar of humanity the air is clear and sweet beyond the thought of defilement no bird no insect comes so high no wind blows ever in a balloon no breeze rustles for it moves with the wind and is itself a part of the atmosphere once started it does not rock nor sway you cannot feel whether it rises or falls bert felt acutely cold but he wasnt mountainsick he put on the coat and overcoat and gloves butteridge had discardedput them over the desert dervish sheet that covered his cheap best suitand sat very still for a long time overawed by the newfound quiet of the world above him was the light translucent billowing globe of shining brown oiled silk and the blazing sunlight and the great deep blue dome of the sky  below far below was a torn floor of sunlit cloud slashed by enormous rents through which he saw the sea  if you had been watching him from below you would have seen his head a motionless little black knob sticking out from the car first of all for a long time on one side and then vanishing to reappear after a time at some other point  he wasnt in the least degree uncomfortable nor afraid he did think that as this uncontrollable thing had thus rushed up the sky with him it might presently rush down again but this consideration did not trouble him very much essentially his state was wonder there is no fear nor trouble in balloonsuntil they descend  gollys he said at last feeling a need for talking its better than a motorbike  its all right  i suppose theyre telegraphing about about me  the second hour found him examining the equipment of the car with great particularity above him was the throat of the balloon bunched and tied together but with an open lumen through which bert could peer up into a vast empty quiet interior and out of which descended two fine cords of unknown import one white one crimson to pockets below the ring the netting about the balloonended in cords attached to the ring a big steelbound hoop to which the car was slung by ropes from it depended the trail rope and grapnel and over the sides of the car were a number of canvas bags that bert decided must be ballast to chuck down if the balloon fell not much falling just yet said bert  there were an aneroid and another boxshaped instrument hanging from the ring the latter had an ivory plate bearing statoscope and other words in french and a little indicator quivered and waggled between montee and descente thats all right said bert that tells if youre going up or down on the crimson padded seat of the balloon there lay a couple of rugs and a kodak and in opposite corners of the bottom of the car were an empty champagne bottle and a glass refreshments said bert meditatively tilting the empty bottle then he had a brilliant idea the two padded bedlike seats each with blankets and mattress he perceived were boxes and within he found mr butteridges conception of an adequate equipment for a balloon ascent a hamper which included a game pie a roman pie a cold fowl tomatoes lettuce ham sandwiches shrimp sandwiches a large cake knives and forks and paper plates selfheating tins of coffee and cocoa bread butter and marmalade several carefully packed bottles of champagne bottles of perrier water and a big jar of water for washing a portfolio maps and a compass a rucksack containing a number of conveniences including curlingtongs and hairpins a cap with earflaps and so forth  a ome from ome said bert surveying this provision as he tied the earflaps under his chin he looked over the side of the car far below were the shining clouds they had thickened so that the whole world was hidden southward they were piled in great snowy masses so that he was half disposed to think them mountains northward and eastward they were in wavelike levels and blindingly sunlit  wonder how long a balloon keeps up he said  he imagined he was not moving so insensibly did the monster drift with the air about it no good coming down till we shift a bit he said  he consulted the statoscope  still monty he said  wonder what would happen if you pulled a cord  no he decided i aint going to mess it about  afterwards he did pull both the ripping and the valvecords but as mr butteridge had already discovered they had fouled a fold of silk in the throat nothing happened but for that little hitch the rippingcord would have torn the balloon open as though it had been slashed by a sword and hurled mr smallways to eternity at the rate of some thousand feet a second no go he said giving it a final tug then he lunched  he opened a bottle of champagne which as soon as he cut the wire blew its cork out with incredible violence and for the most part followed it into space bert however got about a tumblerful atmospheric pressure said bert finding a use at last for the elementary physiography of his seventhstandard days ill have to be more careful next time no good wastin drink  then he routed about for matches to utilise mr butteridges cigars but here again luck was on his side and he couldnt find any wherewith to set light to the gas above him or else he would have dropped in a flare a splendid but transitory pyrotechnic display eng old grubb said bert slapping unproductive pockets e didnt ought to ave kep my box es always sneaking matches  he reposed for a time then he got up paddled about rearranged the ballast bags on the floor watched the clouds for a time and turned over the maps on the locker bert liked maps and he spent some time in trying to find one of france or the channel but they were all british ordnance maps of english counties that set him thinking about languages and trying to recall his seventhstandard french je suis anglais cest une meprise je suis arrive par accident ici he decided upon as convenient phrases then it occurred to him that he would entertain himself by reading mr butteridges letters and examining his pocketbook and in this manner he whiled away the afternoon  2  he sat upon the padded locker wrapped about very carefully for the air though calm was exhilaratingly cold and clear he was wearing first a modest suit of blue serge and all the unpretending underwear of a suburban young man of fashion with sandallike cyclingshoes and brown stockings drawn over his trouser ends then the perforated sheet proper to a desert dervish then the coat and waistcoat and big furtrimmed overcoat of mr butteridge then a ladys large fur cloak and round his knees a blanket over his head was a tow wig surmounted by a large cap of mr butteridges with the flaps down over his ears and some fur sleepingboots of mr butteridges warmed his feet the car of the balloon was small and neat some bags of ballast the untidiest of its contents and he had found a light foldingtable and put it at his elbow and on that was a glass with champagne and about him above and below was spacesuch a clear emptiness and silence of space as only the aeronaut can experience  he did not know where he might be drifting or what might happen next he accepted this state of affairs with a serenity creditable to the smallways courage which one might reasonably have expected to be of a more degenerate and contemptible quality altogether his impression was that he was bound to come down somewhere and that then if he wasnt smashed some one some society perhaps would probably pack him and the balloon back to england if not he would ask very firmly for the british consul  le consuelo britannique he decided this would be apportez moi a le consuelo britannique sil vous plait he would say for he was by no means ignorant of french in the meanwhile he found the intimate aspects of mr butteridge an interesting study  there were letters of an entirely private character addressed to mr butteridge and among others several loveletters of a devouring sort in a large feminine hand these are no business of ours and one remarks with regret that bert read them  when he had read them he remarked gollys in an awestricken tone and then after a long interval i wonder if that was her  lord  he mused for a time  he resumed his exploration of the butteridge interior it included a number of press cuttings of interviews and also several letters in german then some in the same german handwriting but in english hullo said bert  one of the latter the first he took began with an apology to butteridge for not writing to him in english before and for the inconvenience and delay that had been caused him by that and went on to matter that bert found exciting in the highest degree we can understand entirely the difficulties of your position and that you shall possibly be watched at the present juncturebut sir we do not believe that any serious obstacles will be put in your way if you wished to endeavour to leave the country and come to us with your plans by the customary routeseither via dover ostend boulogne or dieppe we find it difficult to think you are right in supposing yourself to be in danger of murder for your invaluable invention  funny said bert and meditated  then he went through the other letters  they seem to want him to come said bert but they dont seem hurting themselves to get im or else theyre shamming dont care to get his prices down  they dont quite seem to be the govment he reflected after an interval its more like some firms paper all this printed stuff at the top drachenflieger drachenballons ballonstoffe kugelballons greek to me  but he was trying to sell his blessed secret abroad thats all right no greek about that gollys here is the secret  he tumbled off the seat opened the locker and had the portfolio open before him on the foldingtable it was full of drawings done in the peculiar flat style and conventional colours engineers adopt and in addition there were some rather underexposed photographs obviously done by an amateur at close quarters of the actual machines mutterings had made in its shed near the crystal palace bert found he was trembling lord he said here am i and the whole blessed secret of flyinglost up here on the roof of everywhere  lets see he fell to studying the drawings and comparing them with the photographs they puzzled him half of them seemed to be missing he tried to imagine how they fitted together and found the effort too great for his mind  its tryin said bert i wish id been brought up to the engineering if i could only make it out  he went to the side of the car and remained for a time staring with unseeing eyes at a huge cluster of great cloudsa cluster of slowly dissolving monte rosas sunlit below his attention was arrested by a strange black spot that moved over them it alarmed him it was a black spot moving slowly with him far below following him down there indefatigably over the cloud mountains why should such a thing follow him what could it be  he had an inspiration uv course he said it was the shadow of the balloon but he still watched it dubiously for a time  he returned to the plans on the table  he spent a long afternoon between his struggles to understand them and fits of meditation he evolved a remarkable new sentence in french  voici mossooje suis un inventeur anglais mon nom est butteridge beh oo teh teh eh arr i deh geh eh javais ici pour vendre le secret de le flyingmachine comprenez vendre pour largent tout suite largent en main comprenez cest le machine a jouer dans lair comprenez cest le machine a faire loiseau comprenez balancer oui exactement battir loiseau en fait a son propre jeu je desire de vendre ceci a votre government national voulez vous me directer la  bit rummy i expect from the point of view of grammar said bert but they ought to get the hang of it all right  but then if they arst me to explain the blessed thing  he returned in a worried way to the plans i dont believe its all here he said  he got more and more perplexed up there among the clouds as to what he should do with this wonderful find of his at any moment so far as he knew he might descend among he knew not what foreign people  its the chance of my life he said  it became more and more manifest to him that it wasnt directly i come down theyll telegraphput it in the papers butteridgell know of it and come alongon my track  butteridge would be a terrible person to be on any ones track bert thought of the great black moustaches the triangular nose the searching bellow and the glare his afternoons dream of a marvellous seizure and sale of the great butteridge secret crumpled up in his mind dissolved and vanished he awoke to sanity again  wouldnt do whats the good of thinking of it he proceeded slowly and reluctantly to replace the butteridge papers in pockets and portfolio as he had found them he became aware of a splendid golden light upon the balloon above him and of a new warmth in the blue dome of the sky he stood up and beheld the sun a great ball of blinding gold setting upon a tumbled sea of goldedged crimson and purple clouds strange and wonderful beyond imagining eastward cloudland stretched for ever darkling blue and it seemed to bert the whole round hemisphere of the world was under his eyes  then far away over the blue he caught sight of three long dark shapes like hurrying fish that drove one after the other as porpoises follow one another in the water they were very fishlike indeedwith tails it was an unconvincing impression in that light he blinked his eyes stared again and they had vanished for a long time he scrutinised those remote blue levels and saw no more  wonder if i ever saw anything he said and then there aint such things  down went the sun and down not diving steeply but passing northward as it sank and then suddenly daylight and the expansive warmth of daylight had gone altogether and the index of the statoscope quivered over to descente  3  now whats going to appen said bert  he found the cold grey cloud wilderness rising towards him with a wide slow steadiness as he sank down among them the clouds ceased to seem the snowclad mountainslopes they had resembled heretofore became unsubstantial confessed an immense silent drift and eddy in their substance for a moment when he was nearly among their twilight masses his descent was checked then abruptly the sky was hidden the last vestiges of daylight gone and he was falling rapidly in an evening twilight through a whirl of fine snowflakes that streamed past him towards the zenith that drifted in upon the things about him and melted that touched his face with ghostly fingers he shivered his breath came smoking from his lips and everything was instantly bedewed and wet  he had an impression of a snowstorm pouring with unexampled and increasing fury upward then he realised that he was falling faster and faster  imperceptibly a sound grew upon his ears the great silence of the world was at an end what was this confused sound  he craned his head over the side concerned perplexed  first he seemed to see and then not to see then he saw clearly little edges of foam pursuing each other and a wide waste of weltering waters below him far away was a pilot boat with a big sail bearing dim black letters and a little pinkishyellow light and it was rolling and pitching rolling and pitching in a gale while he could feel no wind at all soon the sound of waters was loud and near he was dropping droppinginto the sea  he became convulsively active  ballast he cried and seized a little sack from the floor and heaved it overboard he did not wait for the effect of that but sent another after it he looked over in time to see a minute white splash in the dim waters below him and then he was back in the snow and clouds again  he sent out quite needlessly a third sack of ballast and a fourth and presently had the immense satisfaction of soaring up out of the damp and chill into the clear cold upper air in which the day still lingered thanggod he said with all his heart  a few stars now had pierced the blue and in the east there shone brightly a prolate moon  4  that first downward plunge filled bert with a haunting sense of boundless waters below it was a summers night but it seemed to him nevertheless extraordinarily long he had a feeling of insecurity that he fancied quite irrationally the sunrise would dispel also he was hungry he felt in the dark in the locker put his fingers in the roman pie and got some sandwiches and he also opened rather successfully a halfbottle of champagne that warmed and restored him he grumbled at grubb about the matches wrapped himself up warmly on the locker and dozed for a time he got up once or twice to make sure that he was still securely high above the sea the first time the moonlit clouds were white and dense and the shadow of the balloon ran athwart them like a dog that followed afterwards they seemed thinner as he lay still staring up at the huge dark balloon above he made a discovery hisor rather mr butteridgeswaistcoat rustled as he breathed it was lined with papers but bert could not see to get them out or examine them much as he wished to do so  he was awakened by the crowing of cocks the barking of dogs and a clamour of birds he was driving slowly at a low level over a broad land lit golden by sunrise under a clear sky he stared out upon hedgeless wellcultivated fields intersected by roads each lined with cablebearing red poles he had just passed over a compact whitewashed village with a straight church tower and steep redtiled roofs a number of peasants men and women in shiny blouses and lumpish footwear stood regarding him arrested on their way to work he was so low that the end of his rope was trailing  he stared out at these people i wonder how you land he thought  spose i ought to land  he found himself drifting down towards a monorail line and hastily flung out two or three handfuls of ballast to clear it  lemme see one might say just prenez wish i knew the french for take hold of the rope i suppose they are french  he surveyed the country again might be holland or luxembourg or lorraine s far as i know wonder what those big affairs over there are some sort of kiln prosperouslooking country  the respectability of the countrys appearance awakened answering chords in his nature  make myself a bit shipshape first he said  he resolved to rise a little and get rid of his wig which now felt hot on his head and so forth he threw out a bag of ballast and was astonished to find himself careering up through the air very rapidly  blow said mr smallways ive overdone the ballast trick wonder when i shall get down again brekfus on board anyhow  he removed his cap and wig for the air was warm and an improvident impulse made him cast the latter object overboard the statoscope responded with a vigorous swing to monte  the blessed thing goes up if you only look overboard he remarked and assailed the locker he found among other items several tins of liquid cocoa containing explicit directions for opening that he followed with minute care he pierced the bottom with the key provided in the holes indicated and forthwith the can grew from cold to hotter and hotter until at last he could scarcely touch it and then he opened the can at the other end and there was his cocoa smoking without the use of match or flame of any sort it was an old invention but new to bert there was also ham and marmalade and bread so that he had a really very tolerable breakfast indeed  then he took off his overcoat for the sunshine was now inclined to be hot and that reminded him of the rustling he had heard in the night he took off the waistcoat and examined it old butteridge wont like me unpicking this he hesitated and finally proceeded to unpick it he found the missing drawings of the lateral rotating planes on which the whole stability of the flying machine depended  an observant angel would have seen bert sitting for a long time after this discovery in a state of intense meditation then at last he rose with an air of inspiration took mr butteridges ripped demolished and ransacked waistcoat and hurled it from the balloon whence it fluttered down slowly and eddyingly until at last it came to rest with a contented flop upon the face of german tourist sleeping peacefully beside the hohenweg near wildbad also this sent the balloon higher and so into a position still more convenient for observation by our imaginary angel who would next have seen mr smallways tear open his own jacket and waistcoat remove his collar open his shirt thrust his hand into his bosom and tear his heart outor at least if not his heart some large bright scarlet object if the observer overcoming a thrill of celestial horror had scrutinised this scarlet object more narrowly one of berts most cherished secrets one of his essential weaknesses would have been laid bare it was a redflannel chestprotector one of those large quasihygienic objects that with pills and medicines take the place of beneficial relics and images among the protestant peoples of christendom always bert wore this thing it was his cherished delusion based on the advice of a shilling fortuneteller at margate that he was weak in the lungs  he now proceeded to unbutton his fetish to attack it with a penknife and to thrust the newfound plans between the two layers of imitation saxony flannel of which it was made then with the help of mr butteridges small shaving mirror and his folding canvas basin he readjusted his costume with the gravity of a man who has taken an irrevocable step in life buttoned up his jacket cast the white sheet of the desert dervish on one side washed temperately shaved resumed the big cap and the fur overcoat and much refreshed by these exercises surveyed the country below him  it was indeed a spectacle of incredible magnificence if perhaps it was not so strange and magnificent as the sunlit cloudland of the previous day it was at any rate infinitely more interesting  the air was at its utmost clearness and except to the south and southwest there was not a cloud in the sky the country was hilly with occasional fir plantations and bleak upland spaces but also with numerous farms and the hills were deeply intersected by the gorges of several winding rivers interrupted at intervals by the bankedup ponds and weirs of electric generating wheels it was dotted with brightlooking steeproofed villages and each showed a distinctive and interesting church beside its wireless telegraph steeple here and there were large chateaux and parks and white roads and paths lined with red and white cable posts were extremely conspicuous in the landscape there were walled enclosures like gardens and rickyards and great roofs of barns and many electric dairy centres the uplands were mottled with cattle at places he would see the track of one of the old railroads converted now to monorails dodging through tunnels and crossing embankments and a rushing hum would mark the passing of a train everything was extraordinarily clear as well as minute once or twice he saw guns and soldiers and was reminded of the stir of military preparations he had witnessed on the bank holiday in england but there was nothing to tell him that these military preparations were abnormal or to explain an occasional faint irregular firing of guns that drifted up to him  wish i knew how to get down said bert ten thousand feet or so above it all and gave himself to much futile tugging at the red and white cords afterwards he made a sort of inventory of the provisions life in the high air was giving him an appalling appetite and it seemed to him discreet at this stage to portion out his supply into rations so far as he could see he might pass a week in the air  at first all the vast panorama below had been as silent as a painted picture but as the day wore on and the gas diffused slowly from the balloon it sank earthward again details increased men became more visible and he began to hear the whistle and moan of trains and cars sounds of cattle bugles and kettle drums and presently even mens voices and at last his guiderope was trailing again and he found it possible to attempt a landing once or twice as the rope dragged over cables he found his hair erect with electricity and once he had a slight shock and sparks snapped about the car he took these things among the chances of the voyage he had one idea now very clear in his mind and that was to drop the iron grapnel that hung from the ring  from the first this attempt was unfortunate perhaps because the place for descent was illchosen a balloon should come down in an empty open space and he chose a crowd he made his decision suddenly and without proper reflection as he trailed bert saw ahead of him one of the most attractive little towns in the worlda cluster of steep gables surmounted by a high church tower and diversified with trees walled and with a fine large gateway opening out upon a treelined high road all the wires and cables of the countryside converged upon it like guests to entertainment it had a most homelike and comfortable quality and it was made gayer by abundant flags along the road a quantity of peasant folk in big pairwheeled carts and afoot were coming and going besides an occasional monorail car and at the carjunction under the trees outside the town was a busy little fair of booths it seemed a warm human wellrooted and altogether delightful place to bert he came low over the treetops with his grapnel ready to throw and so anchor hima curious interested and interesting guest so his imagination figured it in the very middle of it all  he thought of himself performing feats with the sign language and chance linguistics amidst a circle of admiring rustics  and then the chapter of adverse accidents began  the rope made itself unpopular long before the crowd had fully realised his advent over the trees an elderly and apparently intoxicated peasant in a shiny black hat and carrying a large crimson umbrella caught sight of it first as it trailed past him and was seized with a discreditable ambition to kill it he pursued it briskly with unpleasant cries it crossed the road obliquely splashed into a pail of milk upon a stall and slapped its milky tail athwart a motorcar load of factory girls halted outside the town gates they screamed loudly people looked up and saw bert making what he meant to be genial salutations but what they considered in view of the feminine outcry to be insulting gestures then the car hit the roof of the gatehouse smartly snapped a flag staff played a tune upon some telegraph wires and sent a broken wire like a whiplash to do its share in accumulating unpopularity bert by clutching convulsively just escaped being pitched headlong two young soldiers and several peasants shouted things up to him and shook fists at him and began to run in pursuit as he disappeared over the wall into the town  admiring rustics indeed  the balloon leapt at once in the manner of balloons when part of their weight is released by touching down with a sort of flippancy and in another moment bert was over a street crowded with peasants and soldiers that opened into a busy marketsquare the wave of unfriendliness pursued him  grapnel said bert and then with an afterthought shouted tetes there you i say i say tetes eng it  the grapnel smashed down a steeply sloping roof followed by an avalanche of broken tiles jumped the street amidst shrieks and cries and smashed into a plateglass window with an immense and sickening impact the balloon rolled nauseatingly and the car pitched but the grapnel had not held it emerged at once bearing on one fluke with a ridiculous air of fastidious selection a small childs chair and pursued by a maddened shopman it lifted its catch swung about with an appearance of painful indecision amidst a roar of wrath and dropped it at last neatly and as if by inspiration over the head of a peasant woman in charge of an assortment of cabbages in the marketplace  everybody now was aware of the balloon everybody was either trying to dodge the grapnel or catch the trail rope with a pendulumlike swoop through the crowd that sent people flying right and left the grapnel came to earth again tried for and missed a stout gentleman in a blue suit and a straw hat smacked away a trestle from under a stall of haberdashery made a cyclist soldier in knickerbockers leap like a chamois and secured itself uncertainly among the hindlegs of a sheepwhich made convulsive ungenerous efforts to free itself and was dragged into a position of rest against a stone cross in the middle of the place the balloon pulled up with a jerk in another moment a score of willing hands were tugging it earthward at the same instant bert became aware for the first time of a fresh breeze blowing about him  for some seconds he stood staggering in the car which now swayed sickeningly surveying the exasperated crowd below him and trying to collect his mind he was extraordinarily astonished at this run of mishaps were the people really so annoyed everybody seemed angry with him no one seemed interested or amused by his arrival a disproportionate amount of the outcry had the flavour of imprecationhad indeed a strong flavour of riot several greatly uniformed officials in cocked hats struggled in vain to control the crowd fists and sticks were shaken and when bert saw a man on the outskirts of the crowd run to a haycart and get a brightly pronged pitchfork and a blueclad soldier unbuckle his belt his rising doubt whether this little town was after all such a good place for a landing became a certainty  he had clung to the fancy that they would make something of a hero of him now he knew that he was mistaken  he was perhaps ten feet above the people when he made his decision his paralysis ceased he leapt up on the seat and at imminent risk of falling headlong released the grapnelrope from the toggle that held it sprang on to the trail rope and disengaged that also a hoarse shout of disgust greeted the descent of the grapnelrope and the swift leap of the balloon and somethinghe fancied afterwards it was a turnipwhizzed by his head the trailrope followed its fellow the crowd seemed to jump away from him with an immense and horrifying rustle the balloon brushed against a telephone pole and for a tense instant he anticipated either an electric explosion or a bursting of the oiled silk or both but fortune was with him  in another second he was cowering in the bottom of the car and released from the weight of the grapnel and the two ropes rushing up once more through the air for a time he remained crouching and when at last he looked out again the little town was very small and travelling with the rest of lower germany in a circular orbit round and round the caror at least it appeared to be doing that when he got used to it he found this rotation of the balloon rather convenient it saved moving about in the car  5  late in the afternoon of a pleasant summer day in the year 191 if one may borrow a mode of phrasing that once found favour with the readers of the late g p r james a solitary balloonistreplacing the solitary horseman of the classic romancesmight have been observed wending his way across franconia in a northeasterly direction and at a height of about eleven thousand feet above the sea and still spindling slowly his head was craned over the side of the car and he surveyed the country below with an expression of profound perplexity ever and again his lips shaped inaudible words shootin at a chap for example and ill come down right enough soon as i find out ow over the side of the basket the robe of the desert dervish was hanging an appeal for consideration an ineffectual white flag  he was now very distinctly aware that the world below him so far from being the naive countryside of his earlier imaginings that day sleepily unconscious of him and capable of being amazed and nearly reverential at his descent was acutely irritated by his career and extremely impatient with the course he was takingbut indeed it was not he who took that course but his masters the winds of heaven mysterious voices spoke to him in his ear jerking the words up to him by means of megaphones in a weird and startling manner in a great variety of languages officiallooking persons had signalled to him by means of flag flapping and arm waving on the whole a guttural variant of english prevailed in the sentences that alighted upon the balloon chiefly he was told to gome down or you will be shot  all very well said bert but ow  then they shot a little wide of the car latterly he had been shot at six or seven times and once the bullet had gone by with a sound so persuasively like the tearing of silk that he had resigned himself to the prospect of a headlong fall but either they were aiming near him or they had missed and as yet nothing was torn but the air about himand his anxious soul  he was now enjoying a respite from these attentions but he felt it was at best an interlude and he was doing what he could to appreciate his position incidentally he was having some hot coffee and pie in an untidy inadvertent manner with an eye fluttering nervously over the side of the car at first he had ascribed the growing interest in his career to his illconceived attempt to land in the bright little upland town but now he was beginning to realise that the military rather than the civil arm was concerned about him  he was quite involuntarily playing that weird mysterious partthe part of an international spy he was seeing secret things he had in fact crossed the designs of no less a power than the german empire he had blundered into the hot focus of weltpolitik he was drifting helplessly towards the great imperial secret the immense aeronautic park that had been established at a headlong pace in franconia to develop silently swiftly and on an immense scale the great discoveries of hunstedt and stossel and so to give germany before all other nations a fleet of airships the air power and the empire of the world  later just before they shot him down altogether bert saw that great area of passionate work warm lit in the evening light a great area of upland on which the airships lay like a herd of grazing monsters at their feed it was a vast busy space stretching away northward as far as he could see methodically cut up into numbered sheds gasometers squad encampments storage areas interlaced with the omnipresent monorail lines and altogether free from overhead wires or cables everywhere was the white black and yellow of imperial germany everywhere the black eagles spread their wings even without these indications the large vigorous neatness of everything would have marked it german vast multitudes of men went to and fro many in white and drab fatigue uniforms busy about the balloons others drilling in sensible drab here and there a full uniform glittered the airships chiefly engaged his attention and he knew at once it was three of these he had seen on the previous night taking advantage of the cloud welkin to manoeuvre unobserved they were altogether fishlike for the great airships with which germany attacked new york in her last gigantic effort for world supremacybefore humanity realized that world supremacy was a dreamwere the lineal descendants of the zeppelin airship that flew over lake constance in 1906 and of the lebaudy navigables that made their memorable excursions over paris in 1907 and 1908  these german airships were held together by riblike skeletons of steel and aluminium and a stout inelastic canvas outerskin within which was an impervious rubber gasbag cut up by transverse dissepiments into from fifty to a hundred compartments these were all absolutely gas tight and filled with hydrogen and the entire aerostat was kept at any level by means of a long internal balloonette of oiled and toughened silk canvas into which air could be forced and from which it could be pumped so the airship could be made either heavier or lighter than air and losses of weight through the consumption of fuel the casting of bombs and so forth could also be compensated by admitting air to sections of the general gasbag ultimately that made a highly explosive mixture but in all these matters risks must be taken and guarded against there was a steel axis to the whole affair a central backbone which terminated in the engine and propeller and the men and magazines were forward in a series of cabins under the expanded headlike forepart the engine which was of the extraordinarily powerful pforzheim type that supreme triumph of german invention was worked by wires from this forepart which was indeed the only really habitable part of the ship if anything went wrong the engineers went aft along a rope ladder beneath the frame the tendency of the whole affair to roll was partly corrected by a horizontal lateral fin on either side and steering was chiefly effected by two vertical fins which normally lay back like gillflaps on either side of the head it was indeed a most complete adaptation of the fish form to aerial conditions the position of swimming bladder eyes and brain being however below instead of above a striking and unfishlike feature was the apparatus for wireless telegraphy that dangled from the forward cabinthat is to say under the chin of the fish  these monsters were capable of ninety miles an hour in a calm so that they could face and make headway against nearly everything except the fiercest tornado they varied in length from eight hundred to two thousand feet and they had a carrying power of from seventy to two hundred tons how many germany possessed history does not record but bert counted nearly eighty great bulks receding in perspective during his brief inspection such were the instruments on which she chiefly relied to sustain her in her repudiation of the monroe doctrine and her bold bid for a share in the empire of the new world but not altogether did she rely on these she had also a oneman bombthrowing drachenflieger of unknown value among the resources  but the drachenflieger were away in the second great aeronautic park east of hamburg and bert smallways saw nothing of them in the birdseye view he took of the franconian establishment before they shot him down very neatly the bullet tore past him and made a sort of pop as it pierced his balloona pop that was followed by a rustling sigh and a steady downward movement and when in the confusion of the moment he dropped a bag of ballast the germans very politely but firmly overcame his scruples by shooting his balloon again twice    chapter iv the german airfleet  1  of all the productions of the human imagination that make the world in which mr bert smallways lived confusingly wonderful there was none quite so strange so headlong and disturbing so noisy and persuasive and dangerous as the modernisations of patriotism produced by imperial and international politics in the soul of all men is a liking for kind a pride in ones own atmosphere a tenderness for ones mother speech and ones familiar land before the coming of the scientific age this group of gentle and noble emotions had been a fine factor in the equipment of every worthy human being a fine factor that had its less amiable aspect in a usually harmless hostility to strange people and a usually harmless detraction of strange lands but with the wild rush of change in the pace scope materials scale and possibilities of human life that then occurred the old boundaries the old seclusions and separations were violently broken down all the old settled mental habits and traditions of men found themselves not simply confronted by new conditions but by constantly renewed and changing new conditions they had no chance of adapting themselves they were annihilated or perverted or inflamed beyond recognition  bert smallways grandfather in the days when bun hill was a village under the sway of sir peter bones parent had known his place to the uttermost farthing touched his hat to his betters despised and condescended to his inferiors and hadnt changed an idea from the cradle to the grave he was kentish and english and that meant hops beer dogroses and the sort of sunshine that was best in the world newspapers and politics and visits to lunnon werent for the likes of him then came the change these earlier chapters have given an idea of what happened to bun hill and how the flood of novel things had poured over its devoted rusticity bert smallways was only one of countless millions in europe and america and asia who instead of being born rooted in the soil were born struggling in a torrent they never clearly understood all the faiths of their fathers had been taken by surprise and startled into the strangest forms and reactions particularly did the fine old tradition of patriotism get perverted and distorted in the rush of the new times instead of the sturdy establishment in prejudice of berts grandfather to whom the word frenchified was the ultimate term of contempt there flowed through berts brain a squittering succession of thinly violent ideas about german competition about the yellow danger about the black peril about the white mans burthenthat is to say berts preposterous right to muddle further the naturally very muddled politics of the entirely similar little cads to himself except for a smear of brown who smoked cigarettes and rode bicycles in buluwayo kingston jamaica or bombay these were berts subject races and he was ready to dieby proxy in the person of any one who cared to enlistto maintain his hold upon that right it kept him awake at nights to think that he might lose it  the essential fact of the politics of the age in which bert smallways livedthe age that blundered at last into the catastrophe of the war in the airwas a very simple one if only people had had the intelligence to be simple about it the development of science had altered the scale of human affairs by means of rapid mechanical traction it had brought men nearer together so much nearer socially economically physically that the old separations into nations and kingdoms were no longer possible a newer wider synthesis was not only needed but imperatively demanded just as the once independent dukedoms of france had to fuse into a nation so now the nations had to adapt themselves to a wider coalescence they had to keep what was precious and possible and concede what was obsolete and dangerous a saner world would have perceived this patent need for a reasonable synthesis would have discussed it temperately achieved and gone on to organise the great civilisation that was manifestly possible to mankind the world of bert smallways did nothing of the sort its national governments its national interests would not hear of anything so obvious they were too suspicious of each other too wanting in generous imaginations they began to behave like illbred people in a crowded public car to squeeze against one another elbow thrust dispute and quarrel vain to point out to them that they had only to rearrange themselves to be comfortable everywhere all over the world the historian of the early twentieth century finds the same thing the flow and rearrangement of human affairs inextricably entangled by the old areas the old prejudices and a sort of heated irascible stupidity and everywhere congested nations in inconvenient areas slopping population and produce into each other annoying each other with tariffs and every possible commercial vexation and threatening each other with navies and armies that grew every year more portentous  it is impossible now to estimate how much of the intellectual and physical energy of the world was wasted in military preparation and equipment but it was an enormous proportion great britain spent upon army and navy money and capacity that directed into the channels of physical culture and education would have made the british the aristocracy of the world her rulers could have kept the whole population learning and exercising up to the age of eighteen and made a broadchested and intelligent man of every bert smallways in the islands had they given the resources they spent in war material to the making of men instead of which they waggled flags at him until he was fourteen incited him to cheer and then turned him out of school to begin that career of private enterprise we have compactly recorded france achieved similar imbecilities germany was if possible worse russia under the waste and stresses of militarism festered towards bankruptcy and decay all europe was producing big guns and countless swarms of little smallways the asiatic peoples had been forced in selfdefence into a like diversion of the new powers science had brought them on the eve of the outbreak of the war there were six great powers in the world and a cluster of smaller ones each armed to the teeth and straining every nerve to get ahead of the others in deadliness of equipment and military efficiency the great powers were first the united states a nation addicted to commerce but roused to military necessities by the efforts of germany to expand into south america and by the natural consequences of her own unwary annexations of land in the very teeth of japan she maintained two immense fleets east and west and internally she was in violent conflict between federal and state governments upon the question of universal service in a defensive militia next came the great alliance of eastern asia a closeknit coalescence of china and japan advancing with rapid strides year by year to predominance in the worlds affairs then the german alliance still struggled to achieve its dream of imperial expansion and its imposition of the german language upon a forcibly united europe these were the three most spirited and aggressive powers in the world far more pacific was the british empire perilously scattered over the globe and distracted now by insurrectionary movements in ireland and among all its subject races it had given these subject races cigarettes boots bowler hats cricket race meetings cheap revolvers petroleum the factory system of industry halfpenny newspapers in both english and the vernacular inexpensive university degrees motorbicycles and electric trams it had produced a considerable literature expressing contempt for the subject races and rendered it freely accessible to them and it had been content to believe that nothing would result from these stimulants because somebody once wrote the immemorial east and also in the inspired words of kipling               east is east and west is west              and never the twain shall meet   instead of which egypt india and the subject countries generally had produced new generations in a state of passionate indignation and the utmost energy activity and modernity the governing class in great britain was slowly adapting itself to a new conception of the subject races as waking peoples and finding its efforts to keep the empire together under these strains and changing ideas greatly impeded by the entirely sporting spirit with which bert smallways at home by the million cast his vote and by the tendency of his more highly coloured equivalents to be disrespectful to irascible officials their impertinence was excessive it was no mere stonethrowing and shouting they would quote burns at them and mill and darwin and confute them in arguments  even more pacific than the british empire were france and its allies the latin powers heavily armed states indeed but reluctant warriors and in many ways socially and politically leading western civilisation russia was a pacific power perforce divided within itself torn between revolutionaries and reactionaries who were equally incapable of social reconstruction and so sinking towards a tragic disorder of chronic political vendetta wedged in among these portentous larger bulks swayed and threatened by them the smaller states of the world maintained a precarious independence each keeping itself armed as dangerously as its utmost ability could contrive  so it came about that in every country a great and growing body of energetic and inventive men was busied either for offensive or defensive ends in elaborating the apparatus of war until the accumulating tensions should reach the breakingpoint each power sought to keep its preparations secret to hold new weapons in reserve to anticipate and learn the preparations of its rivals the feeling of danger from fresh discoveries affected the patriotic imagination of every people in the world now it was rumoured the british had an overwhelming gun now the french an invincible rifle now the japanese a new explosive now the americans a submarine that would drive every ironclad from the seas each time there would be a war panic  the strength and heart of the nations was given to the thought of war and yet the mass of their citizens was a teeming democracy as heedless of and unfitted for fighting mentally morally physically as any population has ever beenor one ventures to add could ever be that was the paradox of the time it was a period altogether unique in the worlds history the apparatus of warfare the art and method of fighting changed absolutely every dozen years in a stupendous progress towards perfection and people grew less and less warlike and there was no war  and then at last it came it came as a surprise to all the world because its real causes were hidden relations were strained between germany and the united states because of the intense exasperation of a tariff conflict and the ambiguous attitude of the former power towards the monroe doctrine and they were strained between the united states and japan because of the perennial citizenship question but in both cases these were standing causes of offence the real deciding cause it is now known was the perfecting of the pforzheim engine by germany and the consequent possibility of a rapid and entirely practicable airship at that time germany was by far the most efficient power in the world better organised for swift and secret action better equipped with the resources of modern science and with her official and administrative classes at a higher level of education and training these things she knew and she exaggerated that knowledge to the pitch of contempt for the secret counsels of her neighbours it may be that with the habit of selfconfidence her spying upon them had grown less thorough moreover she had a tradition of unsentimental and unscrupulous action that vitiated her international outlook profoundly with the coming of these new weapons her collective intelligence thrilled with the sense that now her moment had come once again in the history of progress it seemed she held the decisive weapon now she might strike and conquerbefore the others had anything but experiments in the air  particularly she must strike america swiftly because there if anywhere lay the chance of an aerial rival it was known that america possessed a flyingmachine of considerable practical value developed out of the wright model but it was not supposed that the washington war office had made any wholesale attempts to create an aerial navy it was necessary to strike before they could do so france had a fleet of slow navigables several dating from 1908 that could make no possible headway against the new type they had been built solely for reconnoitring purposes on the eastern frontier they were mostly too small to carry more than a couple of dozen men without arms or provisions and not one could do forty miles an hour great britain it seemed in an access of meanness temporised and wrangled with the imperial spirited butteridge and his extraordinary invention that also was not in playand could not be for some months at the earliest from asia there came no sign the germans explained this by saying the yellow peoples were without invention no other competitor was worth considering now or never said the germansnow or never we may seize the airas once the british seized the seas while all the other powers are still experimenting  swift and systematic and secret were their preparations and their plan most excellent so far as their knowledge went america was the only dangerous possibility america which was also now the leading trade rival of germany and one of the chief barriers to her imperial expansion so at once they would strike at america they would fling a great force across the atlantic heavens and bear america down unwarned and unprepared  altogether it was a wellimagined and most hopeful and spirited enterprise having regard to the information in the possession of the german government the chances of it being a successful surprise were very great the airship and the flyingmachine were very different things from ironclads which take a couple of years to build given hands given plant they could be made innumerably in a few weeks once the needful parks and foundries were organised airships and drachenflieger could be poured into the sky indeed when the time came they did pour into the sky like as a bitter french writer put it flies roused from filth  the attack upon america was to be the first move in this tremendous game but no sooner had it started than instantly the aeronautic parks were to proceed to put together and inflate the second fleet which was to dominate europe and manoeuvre significantly over london paris rome st petersburg or wherever else its moral effect was required a world surprise it was to beno less a world conquest and it is wonderful how near the calmly adventurous minds that planned it came to succeeding in their colossal design  von sternberg was the moltke of this war in the air but it was the curious hard romanticism of prince karl albert that won over the hesitating emperor to the scheme prince karl albert was indeed the central figure of the world drama he was the darling of the imperialist spirit in german and the ideal of the new aristocratic feelingthe new chivalry as it was calledthat followed the overthrow of socialism through its internal divisions and lack of discipline and the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few great families he was compared by obsequious flatterers to the black prince to alcibiades to the young caesar to many he seemed nietzsches overman revealed he was big and blond and virile and splendidly nonmoral the first great feat that startled europe and almost brought about a new trojan war was his abduction of the princess helena of norway and his blank refusal to marry her then followed his marriage with gretchen krass a swiss girl of peerless beauty then came the gallant rescue which almost cost him his life of three drowning sailors whose boat had upset in the sea near heligoland for that and his victory over the american yacht defender cci the emperor forgave him and placed him in control of the new aeronautic arm of the german forces this he developed with marvellous energy and ability being resolved as he said to give to germany land and sea and sky the national passion for aggression found in him its supreme exponent and achieved through him its realisation in this astounding war but his fascination was more than national all over the world his ruthless strength dominated minds as the napoleonic legend had dominated minds englishmen turned in disgust from the slow complex civilised methods of their national politics to this uncompromising forceful figure frenchmen believed in him poems were written to him in american  he made the war  quite equally with the rest of the world the general german population was taken by surprise by the swift vigour of the imperial government a considerable literature of military forecasts beginning as early as 1906 with rudolf martin the author not merely of a brilliant book of anticipations but of a proverb the future of germany lies in the air had however partially prepared the german imagination for some such enterprise  2  of all these worldforces and gigantic designs bert smallways knew nothing until he found himself in the very focus of it all and gaped down amazed on the spectacle of that giant herd of airships each one seemed as long as the strand and as big about as trafalgar square some must have been a third of a mile in length he had never before seen anything so vast and disciplined as this tremendous park for the first time in his life he really had an intimation of the extraordinary and quite important things of which a contemporary may go in ignorance he had always clung to the illusion that germans were fat absurd men who smoked china pipes and were addicted to knowledge and horseflesh and sauerkraut and indigestible things generally  his birdseye view was quite transitory he ducked at the first shot and directly his balloon began to drop his mind ran confusedly upon how he might explain himself and whether he should pretend to be butteridge or not o lord he groaned in an agony of indecision then his eye caught his sandals and he felt a spasm of selfdisgust theyll think im a bloomin idiot he said and then it was he rose up desperately and threw over the sandbag and provoked the second and third shots  it flashed into his head as he cowered in the bottom of the car that he might avoid all sorts of disagreeable and complicated explanations by pretending to be mad  that was his last idea before the airships seemed to rush up about him as if to look at him and his car hit the ground and bounded and pitched him out on his head  he awoke to find himself famous and to hear a voice crying booteraidge ja jai herr booteraidge selbst  he was lying on a little patch of grass beside one of the main avenues of the aeronautic park the airships receded down a great vista an immense perspective and the blunt prow of each was adorned with a black eagle of a hundred feet or so spread down the other side of the avenue ran a series of gas generators and big hosepipes trailed everywhere across the intervening space close at hand was his now nearly deflated balloon and the car on its side looking minutely small a mere broken toy a shrivelled bubble in contrast with the gigantic bulk of the nearer airship this he saw almost endon rising like a cliff and sloping forward towards its fellow on the other side so as to overshadow the alley between them there was a crowd of excited people about him big men mostly in tight uniforms everybody was talking and several were shouting in german he knew that because they splashed and aspirated sounds like startled kittens  only one phrase repeated again and again could he recognizethe name of herr booteraidge  gollys said bert theyve spotted it  besser said some one and some rapid german followed  he perceived that close at hand was a field telephone and that a tall officer in blue was talking thereat about him another stood close beside him with the portfolio of drawings and photographs in his hand they looked round at him  do you spik cherman herr booteraidge  bert decided that he had better be dazed he did his best to seem thoroughly dazed where am i he asked  volubility prevailed der prinz was mentioned a bugle sounded far away and its call was taken up by one nearer and then by one close at hand this seemed to increase the excitement greatly a monorail car bumbled past the telephone bell rang passionately and the tall officer seemed to engage in a heated altercation then he approached the group about bert calling out something about mitbringen  an earnestfaced emaciated man with a white moustache appealed to bert herr booteraidge sir we are chust to start  where am i bert repeated  some one shook him by the other shoulder are you herr booteraidge he asked  herr booteraidge we are chust to start repeated the white moustache and then helplessly what is de goot what can we do  the officer from the telephone repeated his sentence about der prinz and mitbringen the man with the moustache stared for a moment grasped an idea and became violently energetic stood up and bawled directions at unseen people questions were asked and the doctor at berts side answered ja ja several times also something about kopf with a certain urgency he got bert rather unwillingly to his feet two huge soldiers in grey advanced upon bert and seized hold of him ullo said bert startled whats up  it is all right the doctor explained they are to carry you  where asked bert unanswered  put your arms roundt theirhalsround them  yes but where  hold tight  before bert could decide to say anything more he was whisked up by the two soldiers they joined hands to seat him and his arms were put about their necks vorwarts some one ran before him with the portfolio and he was borne rapidly along the broad avenue between the gas generators and the airships rapidly and on the whole smoothly except that once or twice his bearers stumbled over hosepipes and nearly let him down  he was wearing mr butteridges alpine cap and his little shoulders were in mr butteridges furlined overcoat and he had responded to mr butteridges name the sandals dangled helplessly gaw everybody seemed in a devil of a hurry why he was carried joggling and gaping through the twilight marvelling beyond measure  the systematic arrangement of wide convenient spaces the quantities of businesslike soldiers everywhere the occasional neat piles of material the ubiquitous monorail lines and the towering shiplike hulls about him reminded him a little of impressions he had got as a boy on a visit to woolwich dockyard the whole camp reflected the colossal power of modern science that had created it a peculiar strangeness was produced by the lowness of the electric light which lay upon the ground casting all shadows upwards and making a grotesque shadow figure of himself and his bearers on the airship sides fusing all three of them into a monstrous animal with attenuated legs and an immense fanlike humped body the lights were on the ground because as far as possible all poles and standards had been dispensed with to prevent complications when the airships rose  it was deep twilight now a tranquil blueskyed evening everything rose out from the splashes of light upon the ground into dim translucent tall masses within the cavities of the airships small inspecting lamps glowed like cloudveiled stars and made them seem marvellously unsubstantial each airship had its name in black letters on white on either flank and forward the imperial eagle sprawled an overwhelming bird in the dimness  bugles sounded monorail cars of quiet soldiers slithered burbling by the cabins under the heads of the airships were being lit up doors opened in them and revealed padded passages  now and then a voice gave directions to workers indistinctly seen  there was a matter of sentinels gangways and a long narrow passage a scramble over a disorder of baggage and then bert found himself lowered to the ground and standing in the doorway of a spacious cabinit was perhaps ten feet square and eight high furnished with crimson padding and aluminium a tall birdlike young man with a small head a long nose and very pale hair with his hands full of things like shavingstrops boottrees hairbrushes and toilet tidies was saying things about gott and thunder and dummer booteraidge as bert entered he was apparently an evicted occupant then he vanished and bert was lying back on a couch in the corner with a pillow under his head and the door of the cabin shut upon him he was alone everybody had hurried out again astonishingly  gollys said bert what next  he stared about him at the room  butteridge shall i try to keep it up or shant i  the room he was in puzzled him tisnt a prison and tisnt a norfis then the old trouble came uppermost i wish to eaven i adnt these silly sandals on he cried querulously to the universe they give the whole blessed show away  3  his door was flung open and a compact young man in uniform appeared carrying mr butteridges portfolio rucksac and shavingglass  i say he said in faultless english as he entered he had a beaming face and a sort of pinkish blond hair fancy you being butteridge he slapped berts meagre luggage down  wed have started he said in another halfhour you didnt give yourself much time  he surveyed bert curiously his gaze rested for a fraction of a moment on the sandals you ought to have come on your flyingmachine mr butteridge  he didnt wait for an answer the prince says ive got to look after you naturally he cant see you now but he thinks your comings providential last grace of heaven like a sign hullo  he stood still and listened  outside there was a going to and fro of feet a sound of distant bugles suddenly taken up and echoed close at hand men called out in loud tones short sharp seemingly vital things and were answered distantly a bell jangled and feet went down the corridor then came a stillness more distracting than sound and then a great gurgling and rushing and splashing of water the young mans eyebrows lifted he hesitated and dashed out of the room presently came a stupendous bang to vary the noises without then a distant cheering the young man reappeared  theyre running the water out of the ballonette already  what water asked bert  the water that anchored us artful dodge eh  bert tried to take it in  of course said the compact young man you dont understand  a gentle quivering crept upon berts senses thats the engine said the compact young man approvingly now we shant be long  another long listening interval  the cabin swayed by jove were starting already he cried were starting  starting cried bert sitting up where  but the young man was out of the room again there were noises of german in the passage and other nerveshaking sounds  the swaying increased the young man reappeared were off right enough  i say said bert where are we starting i wish youd explain whats this place i dont understand  what cried the young man you dont understand  no im all dazedlike from that crack on the nob i got where are we where are we starting  dont you know where you arewhat this is  not a bit of it whats all the swaying and the row  what a lark cried the young man i say what a thundering lark dont you know were off to america and you havent realised youve just caught us by a neck youre on the blessed old flagship with the prince you wont miss anything whatevers on you bet the vaterland will be there  usoff to america  rather  in an airship  what do you think  me going to america on an airship after that balloon ere i sayi dont want to go i want to walk about on my legs let me get out i didnt understand  he made a dive for the door  the young man arrested bert with a gesture took hold of a strap lifted up a panel in the padded wall and a window appeared look he said side by side they looked out  gaw said bert were going up  we are said the young man cheerfully fast  they were rising in the air smoothly and quietly and moving slowly to the throb of the engine athwart the aeronautic park down below it stretched dimly geometrical in the darkness picked out at regular intervals by glowworm spangles of light one black gap in the long line of grey roundbacked airships marked the position from which the vaterland had come beside it a second monster now rose softly released from its bonds and cables into the air then taking a beautifully exact distance a third ascended and then a fourth  too late mr butteridge the young man remarked were off i daresay it is a bit of a shock to you but there you are the prince said youd have to come  look ere said bert i really am dazed whats this thing where are we going  this mr butteridge said the young man taking pains to be explicit is an airship its the flagship of prince karl albert this is the german airfleet and it is going over to america to give that spirited people what for the only thing we were at all uneasy about was your invention and here you are  butyou a german asked bert  lieutenant kurt luftlieutenant kurt at your service  but you speak english  mother was englishwent to school in england afterwards rhodes scholar german none the less for that detailed for the present mr butteridge to look after you youre shaken by your fall its all right really theyre going to buy your machine and everything you sit down and take it quite calmly youll soon get the hang of the position  4  bert sat down on the locker collecting his mind and the young man talked to him about the airship  he was really a very tactful young man indeed in a natural sort of way daresay all this is new to you he said not your sort of machine these cabins arent half bad  he got up and walked round the little apartment showing its points  here is the bed he said whipping down a couch from the wall and throwing it back again with a click here are toilet things and he opened a neatly arranged cupboard not much washing no water weve got no water at all except for drinking no baths or anything until we get to america and land rub over with loofah one pint of hot for shaving thats all in the locker below you are rugs and blankets you will need them presently they say it gets cold i dont know never been up before except a little work with gliderswhich is mostly going down threequarters of the chaps in the fleet havent heres a foldingchair and table behind the door compact eh  he took the chair and balanced it on his little finger pretty light eh aluminium and magnesium alloy and a vacuum inside all these cushions stuffed with hydrogen foxy the whole ships like that and not a man in the fleet except the prince and one or two others over eleven stone couldnt sweat the prince you know well go all over the thing tomorrow im frightfully keen on it  he beamed at bert you do look young he remarked i always thought youd be an old man with a bearda sort of philosopher i dont know why one should expect clever people always to be old i do  bert parried that compliment a little awkwardly and then the lieutenant was struck with the riddle why herr butteridge had not come in his own flying machine  its a long story said bert look here he said abruptly i wish youd lend me a pair of slippers or something im regular sick of these sandals theyre rotten things ive been trying them for a friend  right o  the exrhodes scholar whisked out of the room and reappeared with a considerable choice of footwearpumps cloth bathslippers and a purple pair adorned with golden sunflowers  but these he repented of at the last moment  i dont even wear them myself he said only brought em in the zeal of the moment he laughed confidentially had em worked for mein oxford by a friend take em everywhere  so bert chose the pumps  the lieutenant broke into a cheerful snigger here we are trying on slippers he said and the world going by like a panorama below rather a lark eh look  bert peeped with him out of the window looking from the bright pettiness of the redandsilver cabin into a dark immensity the land below except for a lake was black and featureless and the other airships were hidden see more outside said the lieutenant lets go theres a sort of little gallery  he led the way into the long passage which was lit by one small electric light past some notices in german to an open balcony and a light ladder and gallery of metal lattice overhanging empty space bert followed his leader down to the gallery slowly and cautiously from it he was able to watch the wonderful spectacle of the first airfleet flying through the night they flew in a wedgeshaped formation the vaterland highest and leading the tail receding into the corners of the sky they flew in long regular undulations great dark fishlike shapes showing hardly any light at all the engines making a throbthrobthrobbing sound that was very audible out on the gallery they were going at a level of five or six thousand feet and rising steadily below the country lay silent a clear darkness dotted and lined out with clusters of furnaces and the lit streets of a group of big towns the world seemed to lie in a bowl the overhanging bulk of the airship above hid all but the lowest levels of the sky  they watched the landscape for a space  jolly it must be to invent things said the lieutenant suddenly how did you come to think of your machine first  worked it out said bert after a pause jest ground away at it  our people are frightfully keen on you they thought the british had got you werent the british keen  in a way said bert stillits a long story  i think its an immense thingto invent i couldnt invent a thing to save my life  they both fell silent watching the darkened world and following their thoughts until a bugle summoned them to a belated dinner bert was suddenly alarmed dont you ave to dress and things he said ive always been too hard at science and things to go into society and all that  no fear said kurt nobodys got more than the clothes they wear were travelling light you might perhaps take your overcoat off theyve an electric radiator each end of the room  and so presently bert found himself sitting to eat in the presence of the german alexanderthat great and puissant prince prince karl albert the war lord the hero of two hemispheres he was a handsome blond man with deepset eyes a snub nose upturned moustache and long white hands a strangelooking man he sat higher than the others under a black eagle with widespread wings and the german imperial flags he was as it were enthroned and it struck bert greatly that as he ate he did not look at people but over their heads like one who sees visions twenty officers of various ranks stood about the tableand bert they all seemed extremely curious to see the famous butteridge and their astonishment at his appearance was illcontrolled the prince gave him a dignified salutation to which by an inspiration he bowed standing next the prince was a brownfaced wrinkled man with silver spectacles and fluffy dingygrey sidewhiskers who regarded bert with a peculiar and disconcerting attention the company sat after ceremonies bert could not understand at the other end of the table was the birdfaced officer bert had dispossessed still looking hostile and whispering about bert to his neighbour two soldiers waited the dinner was a plain onea soup some fresh mutton and cheeseand there was very little talk  a curious solemnity indeed brooded over every one partly this was reaction after the intense toil and restrained excitement of starting partly it was the overwhelming sense of strange new experiences of portentous adventure the prince was lost in thought he roused himself to drink to the emperor in champagne and the company cried hoch like men repeating responses in church  no smoking was permitted but some of the officers went down to the little open gallery to chew tobacco no lights whatever were safe amidst that bundle of inflammable things bert suddenly fell yawning and shivering he was overwhelmed by a sense of his own insignificance amidst these great rushing monsters of the air he felt life was too big for himtoo much for him altogether  he said something to kurt about his head went up the steep ladder from the swaying little gallery into the airship again and so as if it were a refuge to bed  5  bert slept for a time and then his sleep was broken by dreams mostly he was fleeing from formless terrors down an interminable passage in an airshipa passage paved at first with ravenous trapdoors and then with openwork canvas of the most careless description  gaw said bert turning over after his seventh fall through infinite space that night  he sat up in the darkness and nursed his knees the progress of the airship was not nearly so smooth as a balloon he could feel a regular swaying up up up and then down down down and the throbbing and tremulous quiver of the engines  his mind began to teem with memoriesmore memories and more  through them like a struggling swimmer in broken water came the perplexing question what am i to do tomorrow tomorrow kurt had told him the princes secretary the graf von winterfeld would come to him and discuss his flyingmachine and then he would see the prince he would have to stick it out now that he was butteridge and sell his invention and then if they found him out he had a vision of infuriated butteridges suppose after all he owned up pretended it was their misunderstanding he began to scheme devices for selling the secret and circumventing butteridge  what should he ask for the thing somehow twenty thousand pounds struck him as about the sum indicated  he fell into that despondency that lies in wait in the small hours he had got too big a job ontoo big a job  memories swamped his scheming  where was i this time last night  he recapitulated his evenings tediously and lengthily last night he had been up above the clouds in butteridges balloon he thought of the moment when he dropped through them and saw the cold twilight sea close below he still remembered that disagreeable incident with a nightmare vividness and the night before he and grubb had been looking for cheap lodgings at littlestone in kent how remote that seemed now it might be years ago for the first time he thought of his fellow desert dervish left with the two redpainted bicycles on dymchurch sands e wont make much of a show of it not without me anyow e did ave the treasurysuch as it wasin his pocket the night before that was bank holiday night and they had sat discussing their minstrel enterprise drawing up a programme and rehearsing steps and the night before was whit sunday lord cried bert what a doing that motorbicycle give me he recalled the empty flapping of the eviscerated cushion the feeling of impotence as the flames rose again from among the confused memories of that tragic flare one little figure emerged very bright and poignantly sweet edna crying back reluctantly from the departing motorcar see you tomorrer bert  other memories of edna clustered round that impression they led berts mind step by step to an agreeable state that found expression in ill marry er if she dont look out and then in a flash it followed in his mind that if he sold the butteridge secret he could suppose after all he did get twenty thousand pounds such sums have been paid with that he could buy house and garden buy new clothes beyond dreaming buy a motor travel have every delight of the civilised life as he knew it for himself and edna of course risks were involved ill ave old butteridge on my track i expect  he meditated upon that he declined again to despondency as yet he was only in the beginning of the adventure he had still to deliver the goods and draw the cash and before thatjust now he was by no means on his way home he was flying off to america to fight there not much fighting he considered all our own way still if a shell did happen to hit the vaterland on the underside  spose i ought to make my will  he lay back for some time composing willschiefly in favour of edna he had settled now it was to be twenty thousand pounds he left a number of minor legacies the wills became more and more meandering and extravagant  he woke from the eighth repetition of his nightmare fall through space this flying gets on ones nerves he said  he could feel the airship diving down down down then slowly swinging to up up up throb throb throb throb quivered the engine  he got up presently and wrapped himself about with mr butteridges overcoat and all the blankets for the air was very keen then he peeped out of the window to see a grey dawn breaking over clouds then turned up his light and bolted his door sat down to the table and produced his chestprotector  he smoothed the crumpled plans with his hand and contemplated them then he referred to the other drawings in the portfolio twenty thousand pounds if he worked it right it was worth trying anyhow  presently he opened the drawer in which kurt had put paper and writingmaterials  bert smallways was by no means a stupid person and up to a certain limit he had not been badly educated his board school had taught him to draw up to certain limits taught him to calculate and understand a specification if at that point his country had tired of its efforts and handed him over unfinished to scramble for a living in an atmosphere of advertisments and individual enterprise that was really not his fault he was as his state had made him and the reader must not imagine because he was a little cockney cad that he was absolutely incapable of grasping the idea of the butteridge flyingmachine but he found it stiff and perplexing his motorbicycle and grubbs experiments and the mechanical drawing he had done in standard seven all helped him out and moreover the maker of these drawings whoever he was had been anxious to make his intentions plain bert copied sketches he made notes he made a quite tolerable and intelligent copy of the essential drawings and sketches of the others then he fell into a meditation upon them  at last he rose with a sigh folded up the originals that had formerly been in his chestprotector and put them into the breastpocket of his jacket and then very carefully deposited the copies he had made in the place of the originals he had no very clear plan in his mind in doing this except that he hated the idea of altogether parting with the secret for a long time he meditated profoundlynodding then he turned out his light and went to bed again and schemed himself to sleep  6  the hochgeboren graf von winterfeld was also a light sleeper that night but then he was one of these people who sleep little and play chess problems in their heads to while away the timeand that night he had a particularly difficult problem to solve  he came in upon bert while he was still in bed in the glow of the sunlight reflected from the north sea below consuming the rolls and coffee a soldier had brought him he had a portfolio under his arm and in the clear early morning light his dingy grey hair and heavy silverrimmed spectacles made him look almost benevolent he spoke english fluently but with a strong german flavour he was particularly bad with his bs and his ths softened towards weak zds he called bert explosively pooterage he began with some indistinct civilities bowed took a foldingtable and chair from behind the door put the former between himself and bert sat down on the latter coughed drily and opened his portfolio then he put his elbows on the table pinched his lower lip with his two forefingers and regarded bert disconcertingly with magnified eyes you came to us herr pooterage against your will he said at last  ow dyou make that out asked bert after a pause of astonishment  i chuge by ze maps in your car they were all english and your provisions they were all picnic also your cords were entangled you haf been tuggingbut no good you could not manage ze balloon and anuzzer power than yours prought you to us is it not so  bert thought  alsowhere is ze laty  erewhat lady  you started with a laty that is evident you shtarted for an afternoon excursiona picnic a man of your temperamenthe would take a laty she was not wiz you in your balloon when you came down at dornhof no only her chacket it is your affair still i am curious  bert reflected ow dyou

such cheap plue clothes these are outside my instructions trifles perhaps officially they are to be ignored laties come and goi am a man of ze worldt i haf known wise men wear sandals and efen

its emotional quality his magnified eyes seemed to dilatehas prought you and your secret straight to us sohe bowed his headso pe it it is ze destiny of chermany and my prince i can undershtandt you always carry zat secret you are afraidt of roppers and spies so it comes wiz youto us mr pooterage chermany will puy it  will she  she will said the secretary looking hard at berts abandoned sandals in the corner of the locker he roused himself consulted a paper of notes for a moment and bert eyed his brown and wrinkled face with expectation and terror chermany i am instructed to say said the secretary with his eyes on the table and his notes spread out has always been willing to puy your secret we haf indeed peen eager to acquire it fery eager and it was only ze fear that you might be on patriotic groundts acting in collusion with your pritish war office zat has made us discreet in offering for your marvellous invention through intermediaries we haf no hesitation whatefer now i am instructed in agreeing to your proposal of a hundert tousand poundts  crikey said bert overwhelmed  i peg your pardon  jest a twinge said bert raising his hand to his bandaged head  ah also i am instructed to say that as for that noble unrightly accused laty you haf championed so brafely against pritish hypocrisy and coldness all ze chivalry of chermany is on her site  lady said bert faintly and then recalled the great butteridge love story had the old chap also read the letters he must think him a scorcher if he had oh thats awright he said about er i adnt any doubts about that i  he stopped the secretary certainly had a most appalling stare it seemed ages before he looked down again well ze laty as you please she is your affair i haf performt my instructions and ze title of paron zat also can pe done it can all pe done herr pooterage  he drummed on the table for a second or so and resumed i haf to tell you sir zat you come to us at a crisis inweltpolitik there can be no harm now for me to put our plans before you pefore you leafe this ship again they will be manifest to all ze worldt war is perhaps already declared we goto america our fleet will descend out of ze air upon

and fro ofer ze united states terrorising cities dominating washington levying what is necessary until ze terms we dictate are accepted you follow me  go on said bert  we could haf done all zis wiz

great pritain wizout you sir great pritain ze land you lofed so well and zat has requited you so ill zat land of pharisees and reptiles can do nozzingnozzing you see i am perfectly frank wiz you well i am instructed that chermany recognises all this we want you to place yourself at our disposal we want you to become our chief head flight engineer we want you to manufacture we want to equip a swarm of hornets under your direction we want you to direct this force and it is at our depot in america we want you so we offer you simply and without haggling ze full terms you demanded weeks agoone hundert tousand poundts in cash a salary of three tousand poundts a year a pension of one tousand poundts a year and ze title of paron as you desired these are my instructions  he resumed his scrutiny of berts face  thats all right of course said bert a little short of breath but otherwise resolute and calm and it seemed to him that now was the time to bring his nocturnal scheming to the issue  the secretary contemplated berts collar with sustained attention only for one moment did his gaze move to the sandals and back  jes lemme think a bit said bert finding the stare debilitating look ere he said at last with an air of great explicitness i got the secret  yes  but i dont want the name of butteridge to appearsee i been thinking that over  a little delicacy  exactly you buy the secretleastways i give it youfrom bearersee  his voice failed him a little and the stare continued i want to do the thing enonymously see  still staring bert drifted on like a swimmer caught by a current fact is im going to edop the name of smallways i dont want no title of baron ive altered my mind and i want the money quietlike i want the hundred thousand pounds paid into benksthirty thousand into the london and county benk branch at bun hill in kent directly i and over the plans twenty thousand into the benk of england arf the rest into a good french bank the other arf the german national bank see i want it put there right away i dont want it put in the name of butteridge i want it put in the name of albert peter smallways thats the name im going to edop thats condition one  go on said the secretary  the nex condition said bert is that you dont make any inquiries as to title i mean what english gentlemen do when they sell or let you land you dont arst ow i got it see ere i ami deliver you the goodsthats all right some people ave the cheek to say this isnt my invention see it is you knowthats all right but i dont want that gone into i want a fair and square agreement saying thats all right see  his see faded into a profound silence  the secretary sighed at last leant back in his chair and produced a toothpick and used it to assist his meditation on berts case what was that name he asked at last putting away the toothpick i must write it down  albert peter smallways said bert in a mild tone  the secretary wrote it down after a little difficulty about the spelling because of the different names of the letters of the alphabet in the two languages  and now mr schmallvays he said at last leaning back and resuming the stare tell me how did you ket hold of mister pooterages balloon  7  when at last the graf von winterfold left bert smallways he left him in an extremely deflated condition with all his little story told  he had as people say made a clean breast of it he had been pursued into details he had had to explain the blue suit the sandals the desert dervisheseverything for a time scientific zeal consumed the secretary and the question of the plans remained in suspense he even went into speculation about the previous occupants of the balloon i suppose he said the laty was the laty bot that is not our affair  it is fery curious and amusing yes but i am afraid the prince may be annoyt he acted wiz his usual decisionalways he acts wiz wonterful decision like napoleon directly he was tolt of your descent into the camp at dornhof he said pring himpring him it is my schtar his schtar of destiny you see he will be dthwarted he directed you to come as herr pooterage and you haf not done so you haf triet of course but it has peen a poor try his chugments of men are fery just and right and it is better for men to act up to themgompletely especially now particularly now  he resumed that attitude of his with his underlip pinched between his forefingers he spoke almost confidentially it will be awkward i triet to suggest some doubt but i was overruled the prince does not listen he is impatient in the high air perhaps he will think his schtar has been making a fool of him perhaps he will think i haf been making a fool of him  he wrinkled his forehead and drew in the corners of his mouth  i got the plans said bert  yes there is that yes but you see the prince was interested in herr pooterage because of his romantic seit herr pooterage was so much moreahin the picture i am afraid you are not equal to controlling the flying machine department of our aerial park as he wished you to do he hadt promised himself that  and der was also the prestigethe worldt prestige of pooterage with us well we must see what we can do he held out his hand gif me the plans  a terrible chill ran through the being of mr smallways to this day he is not clear in his mind whether he wept or no but certainly there was weeping in his voice ere i say he protested aint i to avenothin for em  the secretary regarded him with benevolent eyes you do not deserve anyzing he said  i might ave tore em up  zey are not yours  they werent butteridges  no need to pay anyzing  berts being seemed to tighten towards desperate deeds gaw he said clutching his coat aint there  pe galm said the secretary listen you shall haf five hundert poundts you shall haf it on my promise i will do that for you and that is all i can do take it from me gif me the name of that bank write it down so i tell you the princeis no choke i do not think he approffed of your appearance last night no i cant answer for him he wanted pooterage and you haf spoilt it the princei do not understand quite he is in a strange state it is the excitement of the starting and this great soaring in the air i cannot account for what he does but if all goes well i will see to ityou shall haf five hundert poundts will that do then gif me the plans  old beggar said bert as the door clicked gawwhat an ole beggarsharp  he sat down in the foldingchair and whistled noiselessly for a time  nice old swindle for im if i tore em up i could ave  he rubbed the bridge of his nose thoughtfully i gave the whole blessed show away if id jes kep quiet about being enonymous gaw too soon bert my boytoo soon and too rushy id like to kick my silly self  i couldnt ave kep it up  after all it aint so very bad he said  after all five undred pounds it isnt my secret anyhow its jes a pickup on the road five undred  wonder what the fare is from america back home  8  and later in the day an extremely shattered and disorganised bert smallways stood in the presence of the prince karl albert  the proceedings were in german the prince was in his own cabin the end room of the airship a charming apartment furnished in wickerwork with a long window across its entire breadth looking forward he was sitting at a foldingtable of green baize with von winterfeld and two officers sitting beside him and littered before them was a number of american maps and mr butteridges letters and his portfolio and a number of loose papers bert was not asked to sit down and remained standing throughout the interview von winterfeld told his story and every now and then the words ballon and pooterage struck on berts ears the princes face remained stern and ominous and the two officers watched it cautiously or glanced at bert there was something a little strange in their scrutiny of the princea curiosity an apprehension then presently he was struck by an idea and they fell discussing the plans the prince asked bert abruptly in english did you ever see this thing go op  bert jumped saw it from bun ill your royal highness  von winterfeld made some explanation  how fast did it go  couldnt say your royal highness the papers leastways the daily courier said eighty miles an hour  they talked german over that for a time  couldt it standt still op in the air that is what i want to know  it could ovver your royal highness like a wasp said bert  viel besser nicht wahr said the prince to von winterfeld and then went on in german for a time  presently they came to an end and the two officers looked at bert one rang a bell and the portfolio was handed to an attendant who took it away  then they reverted to the case of bert and it was evident the prince was inclined to be hard with him von winterfeld protested apparently theological considerations came in for there were several mentions of gott some conclusions emerged and it was apparent that von winterfeld was instructed to convey them to bert  mr schmallvays you haf obtained a footing in this airship he said by disgraceful and systematic lying  ardly systematic said bert i  the prince silenced him by a gesture  and it is within the power of his highness to dispose of you as a spy  erei came to sell  ssh said one of the officers  however in consideration of the happy chance that mate you the instrument unter gott of this pooterage flyingmachine reaching his highnesss hand you haf been spared yesyou were the pearer of goot tidings you will be allowed to remain on this ship until it is convenient to dispose of you do you understandt  we will bring him said the prince and added terribly with a terrible glare als ballast  you are to come with us said winterfeld as pallast do you understandt  bert opened his mouth to ask about the five hundred pounds and then a saving gleam of wisdom silenced him he met von winterfelds eye and it seemed to him the secretary nodded slightly  go said the prince with a sweep of the great arm and hand towards the door bert went out like a leaf before a gale  9  but in between the time when the graf von winterfeld had talked to him and this alarming conference with the prince bert had explored the vaterland from end to end he had found it interesting in spite of grave preoccupations kurt like the greater number of the men upon the german airfleet had known hardly anything of aeronautics before his appointment to the new flagship but he was extremely keen upon this wonderful new weapon germany had assumed so suddenly and dramatically he showed things to bert with a boyish eagerness and appreciation it was as if he showed them over again to himself like a child showing a new toy lets go all over the ship he said with zest he pointed out particularly the lightness of everything the use of exhausted aluminium tubing of springy cushions inflated with compressed hydrogen the partitions were hydrogen bags covered with light imitation leather the very crockery was a light biscuit glazed in a vacuum and weighed next to nothing where strength was needed there was the new charlottenburg alloy german steel as it was called the toughest and most resistant metal in the world  there was no lack of space space did not matter so long as load did not grow the habitable part of the ship was two hundred and fifty feet long and the rooms in two tiers above these one could go up into remarkable little whitemetal turrets with big windows and airtight double doors that enabled one to inspect the vast cavity of the gaschambers this inside view impressed bert very much he had never realised before that an airship was not one simple continuous gasbag containing nothing but gas now he saw far above him the backbone of the apparatus and its big ribs like the neural and haemal canals said kurt who had dabbled in biology  rather said bert appreciatively though he had not the ghost of an idea what these phrases meant  little electric lights could be switched on up there if anything went wrong in the night there were even ladders across the space but you cant go into the gas protested bert you cant breve it  the lieutenant opened a cupboard door and displayed a divers suit only that it was made of oiled silk and both its compressedair knapsack and its helmet were of an alloy of aluminium and some light metal we can go all over the inside netting and stick up bullet holes or leaks he explained theres netting inside and out the whole outercase is rope ladder so to speak  aft of the habitable part of the airship was the magazine of explosives coming near the middle of its length they were all bombs of various types mostly in glassnone of the german airships carried any guns at all except one small pompom to use the old english nickname dating from the boer war which was forward in the gallery upon the shield at the heart of the eagle  from the magazine amidships a covered canvas gallery with aluminium treads on its floor and a handrope ran back underneath the gaschamber to the engineroom at the tail but along this bert did not go and from first to last he never saw the engines but he went up a ladder against a gale of ventilationa ladder that was encased in a kind of gastight fire escapeand ran right athwart the great forward airchamber to the little lookout gallery with a telephone that gallery that bore the light pompom of german steel and its locker of shells this gallery was all of aluminium magnesium alloy the tight front of the airship swelled clifflike above and below and the black eagle sprawled overwhelmingly gigantic its extremities all hidden by the bulge of the gasbag and far down under the soaring eagles was england four thousand feet below perhaps and looking very small and defenceless indeed in the morning sunlight  the realisation that there was england gave bert sudden and unexpected qualms of patriotic compunction he was struck by a quite novel idea after all he might have torn up those plans and thrown them away these people could not have done so very much to him and even if they did ought not an englishman to die for his country it was an idea that had hitherto been rather smothered up by the cares of a competitive civilisation he became violently depressed he ought he perceived to have seen it in that light before why hadnt he seen it in that light before  indeed wasnt he a sort of traitor he wondered how the aerial fleet must look from down there tremendous no doubt and dwarfing all the buildings  he was passing between manchester and liverpool kurt told him a gleaming band across the prospect was the ship canal and a weltering ditch of shipping far away ahead the mersey estuary bert was a southerner he had never been north of the midland counties and the multitude of factories and chimneysthe latter for the most part obsolete and smokeless now superseded by huge electric generating stations that consumed their own reekold railway viaducts monorail networks and goods yards and the vast areas of dingy homes and narrow streets spreading aimlessly struck him as though camberwell and rotherhithe had run to seed here and there as if caught in a net were fields and agricultural fragments it was a sprawl of undistinguished population there were no doubt museums and town halls and even cathedrals of a sort to mark theoretical centres of municipal and religious organisation in this confusion but bert could not see them they did not stand out at all in that wide disorderly vision of congested workers houses and places to work and shops and meanly conceived chapels and churches and across this landscape of an industrial civilisation swept the shadows of the german airships like a hurrying shoal of fishes  kurt and he fell talking of aerial tactics and presently went down to the undergallery in order that bert might see the drachenflieger that the airships of the right wing had picked up overnight and were towing behind them each airship towing three or four they looked like big boxkites of an exaggerated form soaring at the ends of invisible cords they had long square heads and flattened tails with lateral propellers  much skill is required for thosemuch skill  rather  pause  your machine is different from that mr butteridge  quite different said bert more like an insect and less like a bird and it buzzes and dont drive about so what can those things do  kurt was not very clear upon that himself and was still explaining when bert was called to the conference we have recorded with the prince  and after that was over the last traces of butteridge fell from bert like a garment and he became smallways to all on board the soldiers ceased to salute him and the officers ceased to seem aware of his existence except lieutenant kurt he was turned out of his nice cabin and packed in with his belongings to share that of lieutenant kurt whose luck it was to be junior and the birdheaded officer still swearing slightly and carrying strops and aluminium boottrees and weightless hairbrushes and handmirrors and pomade in his hands resumed possession bert was put in with kurt because there was nowhere else for him to lay his bandaged head in that closepacked vessel he was to mess he was told with the men  kurt came and stood with his legs wide apart and surveyed him for a moment as he sat despondent in his new quarters  whats your real name then said kurt who was only imperfectly informed of the new state of affairs  smallways  i thought you were a bit of a fraudeven when i thought you were butteridge youre jolly lucky the prince took it calmly hes a pretty tidy blazer when hes roused he wouldnt stick a moment at pitching a chap of your sort overboard if he thought fit no theyve shoved you on to me but its my cabin you know  i wont forget said bert  kurt left him and when he came to look about him the first thing he saw pasted on the padded wall was a reproduction of the great picture by siegfried schmalz of the war god that terrible trampling figure with the viking helmet and the scarlet cloak wading through destruction sword in hand which had so strong a resemblance to karl albert the prince it was painted to please    chapter v the battle of the north atlantic  1  the prince karl albert had made a profound impression upon bert he was quite the most terrifying person bert had ever encountered he filled the smallways soul with passionate dread and antipathy for a long time bert sat alone in kurts cabin doing nothing and not venturing even to open the door lest he should be by that much nearer that appalling presence  so it came about that he was probably the last person on board to hear the news that wireless telegraphy was bringing to the airship in throbs and fragments of a great naval battle in progress in midatlantic  he learnt it at last from kurt  kurt came in with a general air of ignoring bert but muttering to himself in english nevertheless stupendous bert heard him say here he said get off this locker and he proceeded to rout out two books and a case of maps he spread them on the foldingtable and stood regarding them for a time his germanic discipline struggled with his english informality and his natural kindliness and talkativeness and at last lost  theyre at it smallways he said  at what sir said bert broken and respectful  fighting the american north atlantic squadron and pretty nearly the whole of our fleet our eiserne kreuz has had a gruelling and is sinking and their miles standishshes one of their biggesthas sunk with all hands torpedoes i suppose she was a bigger ship than the karl der grosse but five or six years older gods i wish we could see it smallways a square fight in blue water guns or nothing and all of em steaming ahead  he spread his maps he had to talk and so he delivered a lecture on the naval situation to bert  here it is he said latitude 30 degrees 50 minutes n longitude 30 degrees 50 minutes w its a good day off us anyhow and theyre all going southwest by south at full pelt as hard as they can go we shant see a bit of it worse luck not a sniff we shant get  2  the naval situation in the north atlantic at that time was a peculiar one the united states was by far the stronger of the two powers upon the sea but the bulk of the american fleet was still in the pacific it was in the direction of asia that war had been most feared for the situation between asiatic and white had become unusually violent and dangerous and the japanese government had shown itself quite unprecedentedly difficult the german attack therefore found half the american strength at manila and what was called the second fleet strung out across the pacific in wireless contact between the asiatic station and san francisco the north atlantic squadron was the sole american force on her eastern shore it was returning from a friendly visit to france and spain and was pumping oilfuel from tenders in midatlanticfor most of its ships were steamshipswhen the international situation became acute it was made up of four battleships and five armoured cruisers ranking almost with battleships not one of which was of a later date than 1913 the americans had indeed grown so accustomed to the idea that great britain could be trusted to keep the peace of the atlantic that a naval attack on the eastern seaboard found them unprepared even in their imaginations but long before the declaration of warindeed on whit mondaythe whole german fleet of eighteen battleships with a flotilla of fuel tenders and converted liners containing stores to be used in support of the airfleet had passed through the straits of dover and headed boldly for new york not only did these german battleships outnumber the americans two to one but they were more heavily armed and more modern in constructionseven of them having high explosive engines built of charlottenburg steel and all carrying charlottenburg steel guns  the fleets came into contact on wednesday before any actual declaration of war the americans had strung out in the modern fashion at distances of thirty miles or so and were steaming to keep themselves between the germans and either the eastern states or panama because vital as it was to defend the seaboard cities and particularly new york it was still more vital to save the canal from any attack that might prevent the return of the main fleet from the pacific no doubt said kurt this was now making records across that ocean unless the japanese have had the same idea as the germans it was obviously beyond human possibility that the american north atlantic fleet could hope to meet and defeat the german but on the other hand with luck it might fight a delaying action and inflict such damage as to greatly weaken the attack upon the coast defences its duty indeed was not victory but devotion the severest task in the world meanwhile the submarine defences of new york panama and the other more vital points could be put in some sort of order  this was the naval situation and until wednesday in whit week it was the only situation the american people had realised it was then they heard for the first time of the real scale of the dornhof aeronautic park and the possibility of an attack coming upon them not only by sea but by the air but it is curious that so discredited were the newspapers of that period that a large majority of new yorkers for example did not believe the most copious and circumstantial accounts of the german airfleet until it was actually in sight of new york  kurts talk was half soliloquy he stood with a map on mercators projection before him swaying to the swinging of the ship and talking of guns and tonnage of ships and their build and powers and speed of strategic points and bases of operation a certain shyness that reduced him to the status of a listener at the officers table no longer silenced him  bert stood by saying very little but watching kurts finger on the map theyve been saying things like this in the papers for a long time he remarked fancy it coming real  kurt had a detailed knowledge of the miles standish she used to be a crack ship for gunneryheld the record i wonder if we beat her shooting or how i wish i was in it i wonder which of our ships beat her maybe she got a shell in her engines its a running fight i wonder what the barbarossa is doing he went on shes my old ship not a firstrater but good stuff i bet shes got a shot or two home by now if old schneiders up to form just think of it there they are whacking away at each other great guns going shells exploding magazines bursting ironwork flying about like straw in a gale all weve been dreaming of for years i suppose we shall fly right away to new yorkjust as though it wasnt anything at all i suppose we shall reckon we arent wanted down there its no more than a covering fight on our side all those tenders and storeships of ours are going on southwest by west to new york to make a floating depot for us see he dabbed his forefinger on the map here we are our train of stores goes there our battleships elbow the americans out of our way there  when bert went down to the mens messroom to get his evening ration hardly any one took notice of him except just to point him out for an instant every one was talking of the battle suggesting contradictingat times until the petty officers hushed them it rose to a great uproar there was a new bulletin but what it said he did not gather except that it concerned the barbarossa some of the men stared at him and he heard the name of booteraidge several times but no one molested him and there was no difficulty about his soup and bread when his turn at the end of the queue came he had feared there might be no ration for him and if so he did not know what he would have done  afterwards he ventured out upon the little hanging gallery with the solitary sentinel the weather was still fine but the wind was rising and the rolling swing of the airship increasing he clutched the rail tightly and felt rather giddy they were now out of sight of land and over blue water rising and falling in great masses a dingy old brigantine under the british flag rose and plunged amid the broad blue wavesthe only ship in sight  3  in the evening it began to blow and the airship to roll like a porpoise as it swung through the air kurt said that several of the men were seasick but the motion did not inconvenience bert whose luck it was to be of that mysterious gastric disposition which constitutes a good sailor he slept well but in the small hours the light awoke him and he found kurt staggering about in search of something he found it at last in the locker and held it in his hand unsteadilya compass then he compared his map  weve changed our direction he said and come into the wind i cant make it out weve turned away from new york to the south almost as if we were going to take a hand  he continued talking to himself for some time  day came wet and windy the window was bedewed externally and they could see nothing through it it was also very cold and bert decided to keep rolled up in his blankets on the locker until the bugle summoned him to his morning ration that consumed he went out on the little gallery but he could see nothing but eddying clouds driving headlong by and the dim outlines of the nearer airships only at rare intervals could he get a glimpse of grey sea through the pouring clouddrift  later in the morning the vaterland changed altitude and soared up suddenly in a high clear sky going kurt said to a height of nearly thirteen thousand feet  bert was in his cabin and chanced to see the dew vanish from the window and caught the gleam of sunlight outside he looked out and saw once more that sunlit cloud floor he had seen first from the balloon and the ships of the german airfleet rising one by one from the white as fish might rise and become visible from deep water he stared for a moment and then ran out to the little gallery to see this wonder better below was cloudland and storm a great drift of tumbled weather going hard away to the northeast and the air about him was clear and cold and serene save for the faintest chill breeze and a rare drifting snowflake throb throb throb throb went the engines in the stillness that huge herd of airships rising one after another had an effect of strange portentous monsters breaking into an altogether unfamiliar world  either there was no news of the naval battle that morning or the prince kept to himself whatever came until past midday then the bulletins came with a rush bulletins that made the lieutenant wild with excitement  barbarossa disabled and sinking he cried gott im himmel der alte barbarossa aber welch ein braver krieger  he walked about the swinging cabin and for a time he was wholly german  then he became english again think of it smallways the old ship we kept so clean and tidy all smashed about and the iron flying about in fragments and the chaps one knewgottflying about too scalding water squirting fire and the smash smash of the guns they smash when youre near like everything bursting to pieces wool wont stop itnothing and me up hereso near and so far der alte barbarossa  any other ships asked smallways presently  gott yes weve lost the karl der grosse our best and biggest run down in the night by a british liner that blundered into the fighting in trying to blunder out theyre fighting in a gale the liners afloat with her nose broken sagging about there never was such a battlenever before good ships and good men on both sidesand a storm and the night and the dawn and all in the open ocean full steam ahead no stabbing no submarines guns and shooting half our ships we dont hear of any more because their masts are shot away latitude 30 degrees 40 minutes nlongitude 40 degrees 30 minutes wwheres that  he routed out his map again and stared at it with eyes that did not see  der alte barbarossa i cant get it out of my headwith shells in her engineroom and the fires flying out of her furnaces and the stokers and engineers scalded and dead men ive messed with smallwaysmen ive talked to close and theyve had their day at last and it wasnt all luck for them  disabled and sinking i suppose everybody cant have all the luck in a battle poor old schneider i bet he gave em something back  so it was the news of the battle came filtering through to them all that morning the americans had lost a second ship name unknown the hermann had been damaged in covering the barbarossa kurt fretted like an imprisoned animal about the airship now going up to the forward gallery under the eagle now down into the swinging gallery now poring over his maps he infected smallways with a sense of the immediacy of this battle that was going on just over the curve of the earth but when bert went down to the gallery the world was empty and still a clear inkyblue sky above and a rippled veil of still thin sunlit cirrus below through which one saw a racing drift of raincloud and never a glimpse of sea throb throb throb throb went the engines and the long undulating wedge of airships hurried after the flagship like a flight of swans after their leader save for the quiver of the engines it was as noiseless as a dream and down there somewhere in the wind and rain guns roared shells crashed home and after the old manner of warfare men toiled and died  4  as the afternoon wore on the lower weather abated and the sea became intermittently visible again the airfleet dropped slowly to the middle air and towards sunset they had a glimpse of the disabled barbarossa far away to the east smallways heard men hurrying along the passage and was drawn out to the gallery where he found nearly a dozen officers collected and scrutinising the helpless ruins of the battleship through fieldglasses two other vessels stood by her one an exhausted petrol tank very high out of the water and the other a converted liner kurt was at the end of the gallery a little apart from the others  gott he said at last lowering his binocular it is like seeing an old friend with his nose cut offwaiting to be finished der barbarossa  with a sudden impulse he handed his glass to bert who had peered beneath his hands ignored by every one seeing the three ships merely as three brownblack lines upon the sea  never had bert seen the like of that magnified slightly hazy image before it was not simply a battered ironclad that wallowed helpless it was a mangled ironclad it seemed wonderful she still floated her powerful engines had been her ruin in the long chase of the night she had got out of line with her consorts and nipped in between the susquehanna and the kansas city they discovered her proximity dropped back until she was nearly broadside on to the former battleship and signalled up the theodore roosevelt and the little monitor as dawn broke she had found herself hostess of a circle the fight had not lasted five minutes before the appearance of the hermann to the east and immediately after of the furst bismarck in the west forced the americans to leave her but in that time they had smashed her iron to rags they had vented the accumulated tensions of their hard days retreat upon her as bert saw her she seemed a mere metalworkers fantasy of frozen metal writhings he could not tell part from part of her except by its position  gott murmured kurt taking the glasses bert restored to himgott da waren albrechtder gute albrecht und der alte zimmermannund von rosen  long after the barbarosa had been swallowed up in the twilight and distance he remained on the gallery peering through his glasses and when he came back to his cabin he was unusually silent and thoughtful  this is a rough game smallways he said at lastthis war is a rough game somehow one sees it different after a thing like that many men there were worked to make that barbarossa and there were men in itone does not meet the like of them every day albrechtthere was a man named albrechtplayed the zither and improvised i keep on wondering what has happened to him he and iwe were very close friends after the german fashion  smallways woke the next night to discover the cabin in darkness a draught blowing through it and kurt talking to himself in german he could see him dimly by the window which he had unscrewed and opened peering down that cold clear attenuated light which is not so much light as a going of darkness which casts inky shadows and so often heralds the dawn in the high air was on his face  whats the row said bert  shut up said the lieutenant cant you hear  into the stillness came the repeated heavy thud of guns one two a pause then three in quick succession  gaw said bertguns and was instantly at the lieutenants side the airship was still very high and the sea below was masked by a thin veil of clouds the wind had fallen and bert following kurts pointing finger saw dimly through the colourless veil first a red glow then a quick red flash and then at a little distance from it another they were it seemed for a while silent flashes and seconds after when one had ceased to expect them came the belated thudsthud thud kurt spoke in german very quickly  a bugle call rang through the airship  kurt sprang to his feet saying something in an excited tone still using german and went to the door  i say whats up cried bert whats that  the lieutenant stopped for an instant in the doorway dark against the light passage you stay where you are smallways you keep there and do nothing were going into action he explained and vanished  berts heart began to beat rapidly he felt himself poised over the fighting vessels far below in a moment were they to drop like a hawk striking a bird gaw he whispered at last in awestricken tones  thud thud he discovered far away a second ruddy flare flashing guns back at the first he perceived some difference on the vaterland for which he could not account and then he realised that the engines had slowed to an almost inaudible beat he stuck his head out of the windowit was a tight fitand saw in the bleak air the other airships slowed down to a scarcely perceptible motion  a second bugle sounded was taken up faintly from ship to ship out went the lights the fleet became dim dark bulks against an intense blue sky that still retained an occasional star for a long time they hung for an interminable time it seemed to him and then began the sound of air being pumped into the balloonette and slowly slowly the vaterland sank down towards the clouds  he craned his neck but he could not see if the rest of the fleet was following them the overhang of the gaschambers intervened there was something that stirred his imagination deeply in that stealthy noiseless descent the obscurity deepened for a time the last fading star on the horizon vanished and he felt the cold presence of cloud then suddenly the glow beneath assumed distinct outlines became flames and the vaterland ceased to descend and hung observant and it would seem unobserved just beneath a drifting stratum of cloud a thousand feet perhaps over the battle below  in the night the struggling naval battle and retreat had entered upon a new phase the americans had drawn together the ends of the flying line skilfully and dexterously until at last it was a column and well to the south of the lax sweeping pursuit of the germans then in the darkness before the dawn they had come about and steamed northward in close order with the idea of passing through the german battleline and falling upon the flotilla that was making for new york in support of the german airfleet much had altered since the first contact of the fleets by this time the american admiral oconnor was fully informed of the existence of the airships and he was no longer vitally concerned for panama since the submarine flotilla was reported arrived there from key west and the delaware and abraham lincoln two powerful and entirely modern ships were already at rio grande on the pacific side of the canal his manoeuvre was however delayed by a boiler explosion on board the susquehanna and dawn found this ship in sight of and indeed so close to the bremen and weimar that they instantly engaged there was no alternative to her abandonment but a fleet engagement oconnor chose the latter course it was by no means a hopeless fight the germans though much more numerous and powerful than the americans were in a dispersed line measuring nearly fortyfive miles from end to end and there were many chances that before they could gather in for the fight the column of seven americans would have ripped them from end to end  the day broke dim and overcast and neither the bremen nor the weimar realised they had to deal with more than the susquehanna until the whole column drew out from behind her at a distance of a mile or less and bore down on them this was the position of affairs when the vaterland appeared in the sky the red glow bert had seen through the column of clouds came from the luckless susquehanna she lay almost immediately below burning fore and aft but still fighting two of her guns and steaming slowly southward the bremen and the weimar both hit in several places were going west by south and away from her the american fleet headed by the theodore roosevelt was crossing behind them pounding them in succession steaming in between them and the big modern furst bismarck which was coming up from the west to bert however the names of all these ships were unknown and for a considerable time indeed misled by the direction in which the combatants were moving he imagined the germans to be americans and the americans germans he saw what appeared to him to be a column of six battleships pursuing three others who were supported by a newcomer until the fact that the bremen and weimar were firing into the susquehanna upset his calculations then for a time he was hopelessly at a loss the noise of the guns too confused him they no longer seemed to boom they went whack whack whack whack and each faint flash made his heart jump in anticipation of the instant impact he saw these ironclads too not in profile as he was accustomed to see ironclads in pictures but in plan and curiously foreshortened for the most part they presented empty decks but here and there little knots of men sheltered behind steel bulwarks the long agitated noses of their big guns jetting thin transparent flashes and the broadside activity of the quickfirers were the chief facts in this birdseye view the americans being steamturbine ships had from two to four blast funnels each the germans lay lower in the water having explosive engines which now for some reason made an unwonted muttering roar because of their steam propulsion the american ships were larger and with a more graceful outline he saw all these foreshortened ships rolling considerably and fighting their guns over a sea of huge low waves and under the cold explicit light of dawn the whole spectacle waved slowly with the long rhythmic rising and beat of the airship  at first only the vaterland of all the flying fleet appeared upon the scene below she hovered high over the theodore roosevelt keeping pace with the full speed of that ship from that ship she must have been intermittently visible through the drifting clouds the rest of the german fleet remained above the cloud canopy at a height of six or seven thousand feet communicating with the flagship by wireless telegraphy but risking no exposure to the artillery below  it is doubtful at what particular time the unlucky americans realised the presence of this new factor in the fight no account now survives of their experience we have to imagine as well as we can what it must have been to a battledstrained sailor suddenly glancing upward to discover that huge long silent shape overhead vaster than any battleship and trailing now from its hinder quarter a big german flag presently as the sky cleared more of such ships appeared in the blue through the dissolving clouds and more all disdainfully free of guns or armour all flying fast to keep pace with the running fight below  from first to last no gun whatever was fired at the vaterland and only a few rifle shots it was a mere adverse stroke of chance that she had a man killed aboard her nor did she take any direct share in the fight until the end she flew above the doomed american fleet while the prince by wireless telegraphy directed the movements of her consorts meanwhile the vogelstern and preussen each with half a dozen drachenflieger in tow went full speed ahead and then dropped through the clouds perhaps five miles ahead of the americans the theodore roosevelt let fly at once with the big guns in her forward barbette but the shells burst far below the vogelstern and forthwith a dozen singleman drachenflieger were swooping down to make their attack  bert craning his neck through the cabin porthole saw the whole of that incident that first encounter of aeroplane and ironclad he saw the queer german drachenflieger with their wide flat wings and square boxshaped heads their wheeled bodies and their singleman riders soar down the air like a flight of birds gaw he said one to the right pitched extravagantly shot steeply up into the air burst with a loud report and flamed down into the sea another plunged nose forward into the water and seemed to fly to pieces as it hit the waves he saw little men on the deck of the theodore roosevelt below men foreshortened in plan into mere heads and feet running out preparing to shoot at the others then the foremost flyingmachine was rushing between bert and the americans deck and then bang came the thunder of its bomb flung neatly at the forward barbette and a thin little crackling of rifle shots in reply whack whack whack went the quickfiring guns of the americans battery and smash came an answering shell from the furst bismarck then a second and third flyingmachine passed between bert and the american ironclad dropping bombs also and a fourth its rider hit by a bullet reeled down and dashed itself to pieces and exploded between the shottorn funnels blowing them apart bert had a momentary glimpse of a little black creature jumping from the crumpling frame of the flyingmachine hitting the funnel and falling limply to be instantly caught and driven to nothingness by the blaze and rush of the explosion  smash came a vast explosion in the forward part of the flagship and a huge piece of metalwork seemed to lift out of her and dump itself into the sea dropping men and leaving a gap into which a prompt drachenflieger planted a flaring bomb and then for an instant bert perceived only too clearly in the growing pitiless light a number of minute convulsively active animalcula scorched and struggling in the theodore roosevelts foaming wake what were they not mensurely not men those drowning mangled little creatures tore with their clutching fingers at berts soul oh gord he cried oh gord almost whimpering he looked again and they had gone and the black stem of the andrew jackson a little disfigured by the sinking bremens last shot was parting the water that had swallowed them into two neatly symmetrical waves for some moments sheer blank horror blinded bert to the destruction below  then with an immense rushing sound bearing as it were a straggling volley of crashing minor explosions on its back the susquehanna three miles and more now to the east blew up and vanished abruptly in a boiling steaming welter for a moment nothing was to be seen but tumbled water andthen there came belching up from below with immense gulping noises eructations of steam and air and petrol and fragments of canvas and woodwork and men  that made a distinct pause in the fight it seemed a long pause to bert he found himself looking for the drachenflieger the flattened ruin of one was floating abeam of the monitor the rest had passed dropping bombs down the american column several were in the water and apparently uninjured and three or four were still in the air and coming round now in a wide circle to return to their mother airships the american ironclads were no longer in column formation the theodore roosevelt badly damaged had turned to the southeast and the andrew jackson greatly battered but uninjured in any fighting part was passing between her and the still fresh and vigorous furst bismarck to intercept and meet the latters fire away to the west the hermann and the germanicus had appeared and were coming into action  in the pause after the susquehannas disaster bert became aware of a trivial sound like the noise of an illgreased illhung door that falls ajarthe sound of the men in the furst bismarck cheering  and in that pause in the uproar too the sun rose the dark waters became luminously blue and a torrent of golden light irradiated the world it came like a sudden smile in a scene of hate and terror the cloud veil had vanished as if by magic and the whole immensity of the german airfleet was revealed in the sky the airfleet stooping now upon its prey  whackbang whackbang the guns resumed but ironclads were not built to fight the zenith and the only hits the americans scored were a few lucky chances in a generally ineffectual rifle fire their column was now badly broken the susquehanna had gone the theodore roosevelt had fallen astern out of the line with her forward guns disabled in a heap of wreckage and the monitor was in some grave trouble these two had ceased fire altogether and so had the bremen and weimar all four ships lying within shot of each other in an involuntary truce and with their respective flags still displayed only four american ships now with the andrew jackson leading kept to the southeasterly course and the furst bismarck the hermann and the germanicus steamed parallel to them and drew ahead of them fighting heavily the vaterland rose slowly in the air in preparation for the concluding act of the drama  then falling into place one behind the other a string of a dozen airships dropped with unhurrying swiftness down the air in pursuit of the american fleet they kept at a height of two thousand feet or more until they were over and a little in advance of the rearmost ironclad and then stooped swiftly down into a fountain of bullets and going just a little faster than the ship below pelted her thinly protected decks with bombs until they became sheets of detonating flame so the airships passed one after the other along the american column as it sought to keep up its fight with the furst bismarck the hermann and the germanicus and each airship added to the destruction and confusion its predecessor had made the american gunfire ceased except for a few heroic shots but they still steamed on obstinately unsubdued bloody battered and wrathfully resistant spitting bullets at the airships and unmercifully pounded by the german ironclads but now bert had but intermittent glimpses of them between the nearer bulks of the airships that assailed them  it struck bert suddenly that the whole battle was receding and growing small and less thunderously noisy the vaterland was rising in the air steadily and silently until the impact of the guns no longer smote upon the heart but came to the ear dulled by distance until the four silenced ships to the eastward were little distant things but were there four bert now could see only three of those floating blackened and smoking rafts of ruin against the sun but the bremen had two boats out the theodore roosevelt was also dropping boats to where the drift of minute objects struggled rising and falling on the big broad atlantic waves the vaterland was no longer following the fight the whole of that hurrying tumult drove away to the southeastward growing smaller and less audible as it passed one of the airships lay on the water burning a remote monstrous fount of flames and far in the southwest appeared first one and then three other german ironclads hurrying in support of their consorts  5  steadily the vaterland soared and the airfleet soared with her and came round to head for new york and the battle became a little thing far away an incident before the breakfast it dwindled to a string of dark shapes and one smoking yellow flare that presently became a mere indistinct smear upon the vast horizon and the bright new day that was at last altogether lost to sight  so it was that bert smallways saw the first fight of the airship and the last fight of those strangest things in the whole history of war the ironclad battleships which began their career with the floating batteries of the emperor napoleon iii in the crimean war and lasted with an enormous expenditure of human energy and resources for seventy years in that space of time the world produced over twelve thousand five hundred of these strange monsters in schools in types in series each larger and heavier and more deadly than its predecessors each in its turn was hailed as the last birth of time most in their turn were sold for old iron only about five per cent of them ever fought in a battle some foundered some went ashore and broke up several rammed one another by accident and sank the lives of countless men were spent in their service the splendid genius and patience of thousands of engineers and inventors wealth and material beyond estimating to their account we must put stunted and starved lives on land millions of children sent to toil unduly innumerable opportunities of fine living undeveloped and lost money had to be found for them at any costthat was the law of a nations existence during that strange time surely they were the weirdest most destructive and wasteful megatheria in the whole history of mechanical invention  and then cheap things of gas and basketwork made an end of them altogether smiting out of the sky  never before had bert smallways seen pure destruction never had he realised the mischief and waste of war his startled mind rose to the conception this also is in life out of all this fierce torrent of sensation one impression rose and became cardinalthe impression of the men of the theodore roosevelt who had struggled in the water after the explosion of the first bomb gaw he said at the memory it might ave been me and grubb i suppose you kick about and get the water in your mouf i dont suppose it lasts long  he became anxious to see how kurt was affected by these things also he perceived he was hungry he hesitated towards the door of the cabin and peeped out into the passage down forward near the gangway to the mens mess stood a little group of air sailors looking at something that was hidden from him in a recess one of them was in the light divers costume bert had already seen in the gas chamber turret and he was moved to walk along and look at this person more closely and examine the helmet he carried under his arm but he forgot about the helmet when he got to the recess because there he found lying on the floor the dead body of the boy who had been killed by a bullet from the theodore roosevelt  bert had not observed that any bullets at all had reached the vaterland or indeed imagined himself under fire he could not understand for a time what had killed the lad and no one explained to him  the boy lay just as he had fallen and died with his jacket torn and scorched his shoulderblade smashed and burst away from his body and all the left side of his body ripped and rent there was much blood the sailors stood listening to the man with the helmet who made explanations and pointed to the round bullet hole in the floor and the smash in the panel of the passage upon which the still vicious missile had spent the residue of its energy all the faces were grave and earnest they were the faces of sober blond blueeyed men accustomed to obedience and an orderly life to whom this waste wet painful thing that had been a comrade came almost as strangely as it did to bert  a peal of wild laughter sounded down the passage in the direction of the little gallery and something spokealmost shoutedin german in tones of exultation  other voices at a lower more respectful pitch replied  der prinz said a voice and all the men became stiffer and less natural down the passage appeared a group of figures lieutenant kurt walking in front carrying a packet of papers  he stopped point blank when he saw the thing in the recess and his ruddy face went white  so said he in surprise  the prince was following him talking over his shoulder to von winterfeld and the kapitan  eh he said to kurt stopping in midsentence and followed the gesture of kurts hand he glared at the crumpled object in the recess and seemed to think for a moment  he made a slight careless gesture towards the boys body and turned to the kapitan  dispose of that he said in german and passed on finishing his sentence to von winterfeld in the same cheerful tone in which it had begun  6  the deep impression of helplessly drowning men that bert had brought from the actual fight in the atlantic mixed itself up inextricably with that of the lordly figure of prince karl albert gesturing aside the dead body of the vaterland sailor hitherto he had rather liked the idea of war as being a jolly smashing exciting affair something like a bank holiday rag on a large scale and on the whole agreeable and exhilarating now he knew it a little better  the next day there was added to his growing disillusionment a third ugly impression trivial indeed to describe a mere necessary everyday incident of a state of war but very distressing to his urbanised imagination one writes urbanised to express the distinctive gentleness of the period it was quite peculiar to the crowded townsmen of that time and different altogether from the normal experience of any preceding age that they never saw anything killed never encountered save through the mitigating media of book or picture the fact of lethal violence that underlies all life three times in his existence and three times only had bert seen a dead human being and he had never assisted at the killing of anything bigger than a newborn kitten  the incident that gave him his third shock was the execution of one of the men on the adler for carrying a box of matches the case was a flagrant one the man had forgotten he had it upon him when coming aboard ample notice had been given to every one of the gravity of this offence and notices appeared at numerous points all over the airships the mans defence was that he had grown so used to the notices and had been so preoccupied with his work that he hadnt applied them to himself he pleaded in his defence what is indeed in military affairs another serious crime inadvertency he was tried by his captain and the sentence confirmed by wireless telegraphy by the prince and it was decided to make his death an example to the whole fleet the germans the prince declared hadnt crossed the atlantic to go wool gathering and in order that this lesson in discipline and obedience might be visible to every one it was determined not to electrocute or drown but hang the offender  accordingly the airfleet came clustering round the flagship like carp in a pond at feeding time the adler hung at the zenith immediately alongside the flagship the whole crew of the vaterland assembled upon the hanging gallery the crews of the other airships manned the airchambers that is to say clambered up the outer netting to the upper sides the officers appeared upon the machinegun platforms bert thought it an altogether stupendous sight looking down as he was upon the entire fleet far off below two steamers on the rippled blue water one british and the other flying the american flag seemed the minutest objects and marked the scale they were immensely distant bert stood on the gallery curious to see the execution but uncomfortable because that terrible blond prince was within a dozen feet of him glaring terribly with his arms folded and his heels together in military fashion  they hung the man from the adler they gave him sixty feet of rope so that he should hang and dangle in the sight of all evildoers who might be hiding matches or contemplating any kindred disobedience bert saw the man standing a living reluctant man no doubt scared and rebellious enough in his heart but outwardly erect and obedient on the lower gallery of the adler about a hundred yards away then they had thrust him overboard  down he fell hands and feet extending until with a jerk he was at the end of the rope then he ought to have died and swung edifyingly but instead a more terrible thing happened his head came right off and down the body went spinning to the sea feeble grotesque fantastic with the head racing it in its fall  ugh said bert clutching the rail before him and a sympathetic grunt came from several of the men beside him  so said the prince stiffer and sterner glared for some seconds then turned to the gang way up into the airship  for a long time bert remained clinging to the railing of the gallery he was almost physically sick with the horror of this trifling incident he found it far more dreadful than the battle he was indeed a very degenerate latterday civilised person  late that afternoon kurt came into the cabin and found him curled up on his locker and looking very white and miserable kurt had also lost something of his pristine freshness  seasick he asked  no  we ought to reach new york this evening theres a good breeze coming up under our tails then we shall see things  bert did not answer  kurt opened out folding chair and table and rustled for a time with his maps then he fell thinking darkly he roused himself presently and looked at his companion whats the matter he said  nothing  kurt stared threateningly whats the matter  i saw them kill that chap i saw that flyingmachine man hit the funnels of the big ironclad i saw that dead chap in the passage i seen too much smashing and killing lately thats the matter i dont like it i didnt know war was this sort of thing im a civilian i dont like it  i dont like it said kurt by jove no  ive read about war and all that but when you see it its different and im gettin giddy im gettin giddy i didnt mind a bit being up in that balloon at first but all this looking down and floating over things and smashing up people its getting on my nerves see  itll have to get off again  kurt thought youre not the only one the men are all getting strung up the flyingthats just flying naturally it makes one a little swimmy in the head at first as for the killing weve got to be blooded thats all were tame civilised men and weve got to get blooded i suppose theres not a dozen men on the ship whove really seen bloodshed nice quiet lawabiding germans theyve been so far here they arein for it theyre a bit squeamy now but you wait till theyve got their hands in  he reflected everybodys getting a bit strung up he said  he turned again to his maps bert sat crumpled up in the corner apparently heedless of him for some time both kept silence  what did the prince want to go and ang that chap for asked bert suddenly  that was all right said kurt that was all right quite right here were the orders plain as the nose on your face and here was that fool going about with matches  gaw i shant forget that bit in a urry said bert irrelevantly  kurt did not answer him he was measuring their distance from new york and speculating wonder what the american aeroplanes are like he said something like our drachenflieger we shall know by this time tomorrow i wonder what we shall know i wonder suppose after all they put up a fight rum sort of fight  he whistled softly and mused presently he fretted out of the cabin and later bert found him in the twilight upon the swinging platform staring ahead and speculating about the things that might happen on the morrow clouds veiled the sea again and the long straggling wedge of airships rising and falling as they flew seemed like a flock of strange new births in a chaos that had neither earth nor water but only mist and sky    chapter vi how war came to new york  1  the city of new york was in the year of the german attack the largest richest in many respects the most splendid and in some the wickedest city the world had ever seen she was the supreme type of the city of the scientific commercial age she displayed its greatness its power its ruthless anarchic enterprise and its social disorganisation most strikingly and completely she had long ousted london from her pride of place as the modern babylon she was the centre of the worlds finance the worlds trade and the worlds pleasure and men likened her to the apocalyptic cities of the ancient prophets she sat drinking up the wealth of a continent as rome once drank the wealth of the mediterranean and babylon the wealth of the east in her streets one found the extremes of magnificence and misery of civilisation and disorder in one quarter palaces of marble laced and crowned with light and flame and flowers towered up into her marvellous twilights beautiful beyond description in another a black and sinister polyglot population sweltered in indescribable congestion in warrens and excavations beyond the power and knowledge of government her vice her crime her law alike were inspired by a fierce and terrible energy and like the great cities of mediaeval italy her ways were dark and adventurous with private war  it was the peculiar shape of manhattan island pressed in by arms of the sea on either side and incapable of comfortable expansion except along a narrow northward belt that first gave the new york architects their bias for extreme vertical dimensions every need was lavishly supplied themmoney material labour only space was restricted to begin therefore they built high perforce but to do so was to discover a whole new world of architectural beauty of exquisite ascendant lines and long after the central congestion had been relieved by tunnels under the sea four colossal bridges over the east river and a dozen monorail cables east and west the upward growth went on in many ways new york and her gorgeous plutocracy repeated venice in the magnificence of her architecture painting metalwork and sculpture for example in the grim intensity of her political method in her maritime and commercial ascendancy but she repeated no previous state at all in the lax disorder of her internal administration a laxity that made vast sections of her area lawless beyond precedent so that it was possible for whole districts to be impassable while civil war raged between street and street and for alsatias to exist in her midst in which the official police never set foot she was an ethnic whirlpool the flags of all nations flew in her harbour and at the climax the yearly coming and going overseas numbered together upwards of two million human beings to europe she was america to america she was the gateway of the world but to tell the story of new york would be to write a social history of the world saints and martyrs dreamers and scoundrels the traditions of a thousand races and a thousand religions went to her making and throbbed and jostled in her streets and over all that torrential confusion of men and purposes fluttered that strange flag the stars and stripes that meant at once the noblest thing in life and the least noble that is to say liberty on the one hand and on the other the base jealousy the individual selfseeker feels towards the common purpose of the state  for many generations new york had taken no heed of war save as a thing that happened far away that affected prices and supplied the newspapers with exciting headlines and pictures the new yorkers felt perhaps even more certainly than the english had done that war in their own land was an impossible thing in that they shared the delusion of all north america they felt as secure as spectators at a bullfight they risked their money perhaps on the result but that was all and such ideas of war as the common americans possessed were derived from the limited picturesque adventurous war of the past they saw war as they saw history through an iridescent mist deodorised scented indeed with all its essential cruelties tactfully hidden away they were inclined to regret it as something ennobling to sigh that it could no longer come into their own private experience they read with interest if not with avidity of their new guns of their immense and still more immense ironclads of their incredible and still more incredible explosives but just what these tremendous engines of destruction might mean for their personal lives never entered their heads they did not so far as one can judge from their contemporary literature think that they meant anything to their personal lives at all they thought america was safe amidst all this piling up of explosives they cheered the flag by habit and tradition they despised other nations and whenever there was an international difficulty they were intensely patriotic that is to say they were ardently against any native politician who did not say threaten and do harsh and uncompromising things to the antagonist people they were spirited to asia spirited to germany so spirited to great britain that the international attitude of the mother country to her great daughter was constantly compared in contemporary caricature to that between a henpecked husband and a vicious young wife and for the rest they all went about their business and pleasure as if war had died out with the megatherium  and then suddenly into a world peacefully busied for the most part upon armaments and the perfection of explosives war came came the shock of realising that the guns were going off that the masses of inflammable material all over the world were at last ablaze  2  the immediate effect upon new york of the sudden onset of war was merely to intensify her normal vehemence  the newspapers and magazines that fed the american mindfor books upon this impatient continent had become simply material for the energy of collectorswere instantly a coruscation of war pictures and of headlines that rose like rockets and burst like shells to the normal highstrung energy of new york streets was added a touch of warfever great crowds assembled more especially in the dinner hour in madison square about the farragut monument to listen to and cheer patriotic speeches and a veritable epidemic of little flags and buttons swept through these great torrents of swiftly moving young people who poured into new york of a morning by car and monorail and subway and train to toil and ebb home again between the hours of five and seven it was dangerous not to wear a war button the splendid musichalls of the time sank every topic in patriotism and evolved scenes of wild enthusiasm strong men wept at the sight of the national banner sustained by the whole strength of the ballet and special searchlights and illuminations amazed the watching angels the churches reechoed the national enthusiasm in graver key and slower measure and the aerial and naval preparations on the east river were greatly incommoded by the multitude of excursion steamers which thronged helpfully cheering about them the trade in smallarms was enormously stimulated and many overwrought citizens found an immediate relief for their emotions in letting off fireworks of a more or less heroic dangerous and national character in the public streets small childrens airballoons of the latest model attached to string became a serious check to the pedestrian in central park and amidst scenes of indescribable emotion the albany legislature in permanent session and with a generous suspension of rules and precedents passed through both houses the longdisputed bill for universal military service in new york state  critics of the american character are disposed to considerthat up to the actual impact of the german attack the people of new york dealt altogether too much with the war as if it was a political demonstration little or no damage they urge was done to either the german or japanese forces by the wearing of buttons the waving of small flags the fireworks or the songs they forgot that under the conditions of warfare a century of science had brought about the nonmilitary section of the population could do no serious damage in any form to their enemies and that there was no reason therefore why they should not do as they did the balance of military efficiency was shifting back from the many to the few from the common to the specialised  the days when the emotional infantryman decided battles had passed by for ever war had become a matter of apparatus of special training and skill of the most intricate kind it had become undemocratic and whatever the value of the popular excitement there can be no denying that the small regular establishment of the united states government confronted by this totally unexpected emergency of an armed invasion from europe acted with vigour science and imagination they were taken by surprise so far as the diplomatic situation was concerned and their equipment for building either navigables or aeroplanes was contemptible in comparison with the huge german parks still they set to work at once to prove to the world that the spirit that had created the monitor and the southern submarines of 1864 was not dead the chief of the aeronautic establishment near west point was cabot sinclair and he allowed himself but one single moment of the posturing that was so universal in that democratic time we have chosen our epitaphs he said to a reporter and we are going to have they did all they could now run away  the curious thing is that they did all do all they could there is no exception known their only defect indeed was a defect of style one of the most striking facts historically about this war and the one that makes the complete separation that had arisen between the methods of warfare and the necessity of democratic support is the effectual secrecy of the washington authorities about their airships they did not bother to confide a single fact of their preparations to the public they did not even condescend to talk to congress they burked and suppressed every inquiry the war was fought by the president and the secretaries of state in an entirely autocratic manner such publicity as they sought was merely to anticipate and prevent inconvenient agitation to defend particular points they realised that the chief danger in aerial warfare from an excitable and intelligent public would be a clamour for local airships and aeroplanes to defend local interests this with such resources as they possessed might lead to a fatal division and distribution of the national forces particularly they feared that they might be forced into a premature action to defend new york they realised with prophetic insight that this would be the particular advantage the germans would seek so they took great pains to direct the popular mind towards defensive artillery and to divert it from any thought of aerial battle their real preparations they masked beneath ostensible ones there was at washington a large reserve of naval guns and these were distributed rapidly conspicuously and with much press attention among the eastern cities they were mounted for the most part upon hills and prominent crests around the threatened centres of population they were mounted upon rough adaptations of the doan swivel which at that time gave the maximum vertical range to a heavy gun much of this artillery was still unmounted and nearly all of it was unprotected when the german airfleet reached new york and down in the crowded streets when that occurred the readers of the new york papers were regaling themselves with wonderful and wonderfully illustrated accounts of such matters as  the secret of the thunderbolt  aged scientist perfects electric gun  to electrocute airship crews by upward lightning  washington orders five hundred  war secretary lodge delighted  says they will suit the germans down to the ground  president publicly applauds this merry quip  3  the german fleet reached new york in advance of the news of the american naval disaster it reached new york in the late afternoon and was first seen by watchers at ocean grove and long branch coming swiftly out of the southward sea and going away to the northwest the flagship passed almost vertically over the sandy hook observation station rising rapidly as it did so and in a few minutes all new york was vibrating to the staten island guns  several of these guns and especially that at giffords and the one on beacon hill above matawan were remarkably well handled the former at a distance of five miles and with an elevation of six thousand feet sent a shell to burst so close to the vaterland that a pane of the princes forward window was smashed by a fragment this sudden explosion made bert tuck in his head with the celerity of a startled tortoise the whole airfleet immediately went up steeply to a height of about twelve thousand feet and at that level passed unscathed over the ineffectual guns the airships lined out as they moved forward into the form of a flattened v with its apex towards the city and with the flagship going highest at the apex the two ends of the v passed over plumfield and jamaica bay respectively and the prince directed his course a little to the east of the narrows soared over upper bay and came to rest over jersey city in a position that dominated lower new york there the monsters hung large and wonderful in the evening light serenely regardless of the occasional rocket explosions and flashing shellbursts in the lower air  it was a pause of mutual inspection for a time naive humanity swamped the conventions of warfare altogether the interest of the millions below and of the thousands above alike was spectacular the evening was unexpectedly fineonly a few thin level bands of clouds at seven or eight thousand feet broke its luminous clarity the wind had dropped it was an evening infinitely peaceful and still the heavy concussions of the distant guns and those incidental harmless pyrotechnics at the level of the clouds seemed to have as little to do with killing and force terror and submission as a salute at a naval review below every point of vantage bristled with spectators the roofs of the towering buildings the public squares the active ferry boats and every favourable street intersection had its crowds all the river piers were dense with people the battery park was solid black with eastside population and every position of advantage in central park and along riverside drive had its peculiar and characteristic assembly from the adjacent streets the footways of the great bridges over the east river were also closely packed and blocked everywhere shopkeepers had left their shops men their work and women and children their homes to come out and see the marvel  it beat they declared the newspapers  and from above many of the occupants of the airships stared with an equal curiosity no city in the world was ever so finely placed as new york so magnificently cut up by sea and bluff and river so admirably disposed to display the tall effects of buildings the complex immensities of bridges and monorailways and feats of engineering london paris berlin were shapeless low agglomerations beside it its port reached to its heart like venice and like venice it was obvious dramatic and proud seen from above it was alive with crawling trains and cars and at a thousand points it was already breaking into quivering light new york was altogether at its best that evening its splendid best  gaw what a place said bert  it was so great and in its collective effect so pacifically magnificent that to make war upon it seemed incongruous beyond measure like laying siege to the national gallery or attacking respectable people in an hotel diningroom with battleaxe and mail it was in its entirety so large so complex so delicately immense that to bring it to the issue of warfare was like driving a crowbar into the mechanism of a clock and the fishlike shoal of great airships hovering light and sunlit above filling the sky seemed equally remote from the ugly forcefulness of war to kurt to smallways to i know not how many more of the people in the airfleet came the distinctest apprehension of these incompatibilities but in the head of the prince karl albert were the vapours of romance he was a conqueror and this was the enemys city the greater the city the greater the triumph no doubt he had a time of tremendous exultation and sensed beyond all precedent the sense of power that night  there came an end at last to that pause some wireless communications had failed of a satisfactory ending and fleet and city remembered they were hostile powers look cried the multitude look  what are they doing  what down through the twilight sank five attacking airships one to the navy yard on east river one to city hall two over the great business buildings of wall street and lower broadway one to the brooklyn bridge dropping from among their fellows through the danger zone from the distant guns smoothly and rapidly to a safe proximity to the city masses at that descent all the cars in the streets stopped with dramatic suddenness and all the lights that had been coming on in the streets and houses went out again for the city hall had awakened and was conferring by telephone with the federal command and taking measures for defence the city hall was asking for airships refusing to surrender as washington advised and developing into a centre of intense emotion of hectic activity everywhere and hastily the police began to clear the assembled crowds go to your homes they said and the word was passed from mouth to mouth theres going to be trouble a chill of apprehension ran through the city and men hurrying in the unwonted darkness across city hall park and union square came upon the dim forms of soldiers and guns and were challenged and sent back in half an hour new york had passed from serene sunset and gaping admiration to a troubled and threatening twilight  the first loss of life occurred in the panic rush from brooklyn bridge as the airship approached it with the cessation of the traffic an unusual stillness came upon new york and the disturbing concussions of the futile defending guns on the hills about grew more and more audible at last these ceased also a pause of further negotiation followed people sat in darkness sought counsel from telephones that were dumb then into the expectant hush came a great crash and uproar the breaking down of the brooklyn bridge the rifle fire from the navy yard and the bursting of bombs in wall street and the city hall new york as a whole could do nothing could understand nothing new york in the darkness peered and listened to these distant sounds until presently they died away as suddenly as they had begun what could be happening they asked it in vain  a long vague period intervened and people looking out of the windows of upper rooms discovered the dark hulls of german airships gliding slowly and noiselessly quite close at hand then quietly the electric lights came on again and an uproar of nocturnal newsvendors began in the streets  the units of that vast and varied population bought and learnt what had happened there had been a fight and new york had hoisted the white flag  4  the lamentable incidents that followed the surrender of new york seem now in the retrospect to be but the necessary and inevitable consequence of the clash of modern appliances and social conditions produced by the scientific century on the one hand and the tradition of a crude romantic patriotism on the other at first people received the fact with an irresponsible detachment much as they would have received the slowing down of the train in which they were travelling or the erection of a public monument by the city to which they belonged  we have surrendered dear me have we was rather the manner in which the first news was met they took it in the same spectacular spirit they had displayed at the first apparition of the airfleet only slowly was this realisation of a capitulation suffused with the flush of passion only with reflection did they make any personal application we have surrendered came later in us america is defeated then they began to burn and tingle  the newspapers which were issued about one in the morning contained no particulars of the terms upon which new york had yieldednor did they give any intimation of the quality of the brief conflict that had preceded the capitulation the later issues remedied these deficiencies there came the explicit statement of the agreement to victual the german airships to supply the complement of explosives to replace those employed in the fight and in the destruction of the north atlantic fleet to pay the enormous ransom of forty million dollars and to surrender the flotilla in the east river there came too longer and longer descriptions of the smashing up of the city hall and the navy yard and people began to realise faintly what those brief minutes of uproar had meant they read the tale of men blown to bits of futile soldiers in that localised battle fighting against hope amidst an indescribable wreckage of flags hauled down by weeping men and these strange nocturnal editions contained also the first brief cables from europe of the fleet disaster the north atlantic fleet for which new york had always felt an especial pride and solicitude slowly hour by hour the collective consciousness woke up the tide of patriotic astonishment and humiliation came floating in america had come upon disaster suddenly new york discovered herself with amazement giving place to wrath unspeakable a conquered city under the hand of her conqueror  as that fact shaped itself in the public mind there sprang up as flames spring up an angry repudiation no cried new york waking in the dawn no i am not defeated this is a dream before day broke the swift american anger was running through all the city through every soul in those contagious millions before it took action before it took shape the men in the airships could feel the gigantic insurgence of emotion as cattle and natural creatures feel it is said the coming of an earthquake the newspapers of the knype group first gave the thing words and a formula we do not agree they said simply we have been betrayed men took that up everywhere it passed from mouth to mouth at every street corner under the paling lights of dawn orators stood unchecked calling upon the spirit of america to arise making the shame a personal reality to every one who heard to bert listening five hundred feet above it seemed that the city which had at first produced only confused noises was now humming like a hive of beesof very angry bees  after the smashing of the city hall and postoffice the white flag had been hoisted from a tower of the old park row building and thither had gone mayor ohagen urged thither indeed by the terrorstricken property owners of lower new york to negotiate the capitulation with von winterfeld the vaterland having dropped the secretary by a rope ladder remained hovering circling very slowly above the great buildings old and new that clustered round city hall park while the helmholz which had done the fighting there rose overhead to a height of perhaps two thousand feet so bert had a near view of all that occurred in that central place the city hall and court house the postoffice and a mass of buildings on the west side of broadway had been badly damaged and the three former were a heap of blackened ruins in the case of the first two the loss of life had not been considerable but a great multitude of workers including many girls and women had been caught in the destruction of the postoffice and a little army of volunteers with white badges entered behind the firemen bringing out the often still living bodies for the most part frightfully charred and carrying them into the big monson building close at hand everywhere the busy firemen were directing their bright streams of water upon the smouldering masses their hose lay about the square and long cordons of police held back the gathering black masses of people chiefly from the east side from these central activities  in violent and extraordinary contrast with this scene of destruction close at hand were the huge newspaper establishments of park row they were all alight and working they had not been abandoned even while the actual bomb throwing was going on and now staff and presses were vehemently active getting out the story the immense and dreadful story of the night developing comment and in most cases spreading the idea of resistance under the very noses of the airships for a long time bert could not imagine what these callously active offices could be then he detected the noise of the presses and emitted his gaw  beyond these newspaper buildings again and partially hidden by the arches of the old elevated railway of new york long since converted into a monorail there was another cordon of police and a sort of encampment of ambulances and doctors busy with the dead and wounded who had been killed early in the night by the panic upon brooklyn bridge all this he saw in the perspectives of a birdseye view as things happening in a big irregularshaped pit below him between cliffs of high building northward he looked along the steep canon of broadway down whose length at intervals crowds were assembling about excited speakers and when he lifted his eyes he saw the chimneys and cablestacks and roof spaces of new york and everywhere now over these the watching debating people clustered except where the fires raged and the jets of water flew everywhere too were flagstaffs devoid of flags one white sheet drooped and flapped and drooped again over the park row buildings and upon the lurid lights the festering movement and intense shadows of this strange scene there was breaking now the cold impartial dawn  for bert smallways all this was framed in the frame of the open porthole it was a pale dim world outside that dark and tangible rim all night he had clutched at that rim jumped and quivered at explosions and watched phantom events now he had been high and now low now almost beyond hearing now flying close to crashings and shouts and outcries he had seen airships flying low and swift over darkened and groaning streets watched great buildings suddenly redlit amidst the shadows crumple at the smashing impact of bombs witnessed for the first time in his life the grotesque swift onset of insatiable conflagrations from it all he felt detached disembodied the vaterland did not even fling a bomb she watched and ruled then down they had come at last to hover over city hall park and it had crept in upon his mind chillingly terrifyingly that these illuminated black masses were great offices afire and that the going to and fro of minute dim spectres of lanternlit grey and white was a harvesting of the wounded and the dead as the light grew clearer he began to understand more and more what these crumpled black things signified  he had watched hour after hour since first new york had risen out of the blue indistinctness of the landfall with the daylight he experienced an intolerable fatigue  he lifted weary eyes to the pink flush in the sky yawned immensely and crawled back whispering to himself across the cabin to the locker he did not so much lie down upon that as fall upon it and instantly become asleep  there hours after sprawling undignified and sleeping profoundly kurt found him a very image of the democratic mind confronted with the problems of a time too complex for its apprehension his face was pale and indifferent his mouth wide open and he snored he snored disagreeably  kurt regarded him for a moment with a mild distaste then he kicked his ankle  wake up he said to smallways stare and lie down decent  bert sat up and rubbed his eyes  any more fightin yet he asked  no said kurt and sat down a tired man  gott he cried presently rubbing his hands over his face but id like a cold bath ive been looking for stray bullet holes in the airchambers all night until now he yawned i must sleep youd better clear out smallways i cant stand you here this morning youre so infernally ugly and useless have you had your rations no well go in and get em and dont come back stick in the gallery  5  so bert slightly refreshed by coffee and sleep resumed his helpless cooperation in the war in the air he went down into the little gallery as the lieutenant had directed and clung to the rail at the extreme end beyond the lookout man trying to seem as inconspicuous and harmless a fragment of life as possible  a wind was rising rather strongly from the southeast it obliged the vaterland to come about in that direction and made her roll a great deal as she went to and fro over manhattan island away in the northwest clouds gathered the throbthrob of her slow screw working against the breeze was much more perceptible than when she was going full speed ahead and the friction of the wind against the underside of the gaschamber drove a series of shallow ripples along it and made a faint flapping sound like but fainter than the beating of ripples under the stem of a boat she was stationed over the temporary city hall in the park row building and every now and then she would descend to resume communication with the mayor and with washington but the restlessness of the prince would not suffer him to remain for long in any one place now he would circle over the hudson and east river now he would go up high as if to peer away into the blue distances once he ascended so swiftly and so far that mountain sickness overtook him and the crew and forced him down again and bert shared the dizziness and nausea  the swaying view varied with these changes of altitude now they would be low and close and he would distinguish in that steep unusual perspective windows doors street and sky signs people and the minutest details and watch the enigmatical behaviour of crowds and clusters upon the roofs and in the streets then as they soared the details would shrink the sides of streets draw together the view widen the people cease to be significant at the highest the effect was that of a concave relief map bert saw the dark and crowded land everywhere intersected by shining waters saw the hudson river like a spear of silver and lower island sound like a shield even to berts unphilosophical mind the contrast of city below and fleet above pointed an opposition the opposition of the adventurous americans tradition and character with german order and discipline below the immense buildings tremendous and fine as they were seemed like the giant trees of a jungle fighting for life their picturesque magnificence was as planless as the chances of crag and gorge their casualty enhanced by the smoke and confusion of still unsubdued and spreading conflagrations in the sky soared the german airships like beings in a different entirely more orderly world all oriented to the same angle of the horizon uniform in build and appearance moving accurately with one purpose as a pack of wolves will move distributed with the most precise and effectual cooperation  it dawned upon bert that hardly a third of the fleet was visible the others had gone upon errands he could not imagine beyond the compass of that great circle of earth and sky he wondered but there was no one to ask as the day wore on about a dozen reappeared in the east with their stores replenished from the flotilla and towing a number of drachenflieger towards afternoon the weather thickened driving clouds appeared in the southwest and ran together and seemed to engender more clouds and the wind came round into that quarter and blew stronger towards the evening the wind became a gale into which the now tossing airships had to beat  all that day the prince was negotiating with washington while his detached scouts sought far and wide over the eastern states looking for anything resembling an aeronautic park a squadron of twenty airships detached overnight had dropped out of the air upon niagara and was holding the town and power works  meanwhile the insurrectionary movement in the giant city grew uncontrollable in spite of five great fires already involving many acres and spreading steadily new york was still not satisfied that she was beaten  at first the rebellious spirit below found vent only in isolated shouts streetcrowd speeches and newspaper suggestions then it found much more definite expression in the appearance in the morning sunlight of american flags at point after point above the architectural cliffs of the city it is quite possible that in many cases this spirited display of bunting by a city already surrendered was the outcome of the innocent informality of the american mind but it is also undeniable that in many it was a deliberate indication that the people felt wicked  the german sense of correctitude was deeply shocked by this outbreak the graf von winterfeld immediately communicated with the mayor and pointed out the irregularity and the fire lookout stations were instructed in the matter the new york police was speedily hard at work and a foolish contest in full swing between impassioned citizens resolved to keep the flag flying and irritated and worried officers instructed to pull it down  the trouble became acute at last in the streets above columbia university the captain of the airship watching this quarter seems to have stooped to lasso and drag from its staff a flag hoisted upon morgan hall as he did so a volley of rifle and revolver shots was fired from the upper windows of the huge apartment building that stands between the university and riverside drive  most of these were ineffectual but two or three perforated gaschambers and one smashed the hand and arm of a man upon the forward platform the sentinel on the lower gallery immediately replied and the machine gun on the shield of the eagle let fly and promptly stopped any further shots the airship rose and signalled the flagship and city hall police and militiamen were directed at once to the spot and this particular incident closed  but hard upon that came the desperate attempt of a party of young clubmen from new york who inspired by patriotic and adventurous imaginations slipped off in half a dozen motorcars to beacon hill and set to work with remarkable vigour to improvise a fort about the doan swivel gun that had been placed there they found it still in the hands of the disgusted gunners who had been ordered to cease fire at the capitulation and it was easy to infect these men with their own spirit they declared their gun hadnt had half a chance and were burning to show what it could do directed by the newcomers they made a trench and bank about the mounting of the piece and constructed flimsy shelterpits of corrugated iron  they were actually loading the gun when they were observed by the airship preussen and the shell they succeeded in firing before the bombs of the latter smashed them and their crude defences to fragments burst over the middle gaschambers of the bingen and brought her to earth disabled upon staten island she was badly deflated and dropped among trees over which her empty central gasbags spread in canopies and festoons nothing however had caught fire and her men were speedily at work upon her repair they behaved with a confidence that verged upon indiscretion while most of them commenced patching the tears of the membrane half a dozen of them started off for the nearest road in search of a gas main and presently found themselves prisoners in the hands of a hostile crowd close at hand was a number of villa residences whose occupants speedily developed from an unfriendly curiosity to aggression at that time the police control of the large polyglot population of staten island had become very lax and scarcely a household but had its rifle or pistols and ammunition these were presently produced and after two or three misses one of the men at work was hit in the foot thereupon the germans left their sewing and mending took cover among the trees and replied  the crackling of shots speedily brought the preussen and kiel on the scene and with a few hand grenades they made short work of every villa within a mile a number of noncombatant american men women and children were killed and the actual assailants driven off for a time the repairs went on in peace under the immediate protection of these two airships then when they returned to their quarters an intermittent sniping and fighting round the stranded bingen was resumed and went on all the afternoon and merged at last in the general combat of the evening  about eight the bingen was rushed by an armed mob and all its defenders killed after a fierce disorderly struggle  the difficulty of the germans in both these cases came from the impossibility of landing any efficient force or indeed any force at all from the airfleet the airships were quite unequal to the transport of any adequate landing parties their complement of men was just sufficient to manoeuvre and fight them in the air from above they could inflict immense damage they could reduce any organised government to a capitulation in the briefest space but they could not disarm much less could they occupy the surrendered areas below they had to trust to the pressure upon the authorities below of a threat to renew the bombardment it was their sole resource no doubt with a highly organised and undamaged government and a homogeneous and welldisciplined people that would have sufficed to keep the peace but this was not the american case not only was the new york government a weak one and insufficiently provided with police but the destruction of the city halland postoffide and other central ganglia had hopelessly disorganised the cooperation of part with part the street cars and railways had ceased the telephone service was out of gear and only worked intermittently the germans had struck at the head and the head was conquered and stunnedonly to release the body from its rule new york had become a headless monster no longer capable of collective submission everywhere it lifted itself rebelliously everywhere authorities and officials left to their own imitative were joining in the arming and flaghoisting and excitement of that afternoon  6  the disintegrating truce gave place to a definite general breach with the assassination of the wetterhornfor that is the only possible word for the actabove union square and not a mile away from the exemplary ruins of city hall this occurred late in the afternoon between five and six by that time the weather had changed very much for the worse and the operations of the airships were embarrassed by the necessity they were under of keeping head on to the gusts a series of squalls with hail and thunder followed one another from the south by southeast and in order to avoid these as much as possible the airfleet came low over the houses diminishing its range of observation and exposing itself to a rifle attack  overnight there had been a gun placed in union square it had never been mounted much less fired and in the darkness after the surrender it was taken with its supplies and put out of the way under the arches of the great dexter building here late in the morning it was remarked by a number of patriotic spirits they set to work to hoist and mount it inside the upper floors of the place they made in fact a masked battery behind the decorous office blinds and there lay in wait as simply excited as children until at last the stem of the luckless wetterhorn appeared beating and rolling at quarter speed over the recently reconstructed pinnacles of tiffanys promptly that onegun battery unmasked the airships lookout man must have seen the whole of the tenth story of the dexter building crumble out and smash in the street below to discover the black muzzle looking out from the shadows behind then perhaps the shell hit him  the gun fired two shells before the frame of the dexter building collapsed and each shell raked the wetterhorn from stem to stern they smashed her exhaustively she crumpled up like a can that has been kicked by a heavy boot her forepart came down in the square and the rest of her length with a great snapping and twisting of shafts and stays descended collapsing athwart tammany hall and the streets towards second avenue her gas escaped to mix with air and the air of her rent balloonette poured into her deflating gaschambers then with an immense impact she exploded  the vaterland at that time was beating up to the south of city hall from over the ruins of the brooklyn bridge and the reports of the gun followed by the first crashes of the collapsing dexter building brought kurt and smallways to the cabin porthole they were in time to see the flash of the exploding gun and then they were first flattened against the window and then rolled head over heels across the floor of the cabin by the air wave of the explosion the vaterland bounded like a football some one has kicked and when they looked out again union square was small and remote and shattered as though some cosmically vast giant had rolled over it the buildings to the east of it were ablaze at a dozen points under the flaming tatters and warping skeleton of the airship and all the roofs and walls were ridiculously askew and crumbling as one looked gaw said bert whats happened look at the people  but before kurt could produce an explanation the shrill bells of the airship were ringing to quarters and he had to go bert hesitated and stepped thoughtfully into the passage looking back at the window as he did so he was knocked off his feet at once by the prince who was rushing headlong from his cabin to the central magazine  bert had a momentary impression of the great figure of the prince white with rage bristling with gigantic anger his huge fist swinging blut und eisen cried the prince as one who swears oh blut und eisen  some one fell over bertsomething in the manner of falling suggested von winterfeldand some one else paused and kicked him spitefully and hard then he was sitting up in the passage rubbing a freshly bruised cheek and readjusting the bandage he still wore on his head dem that prince said bert indignant beyond measure e asnt the menners of a og  he stood up collected his wits for a minute and then went slowly towards the gangway of the little gallery as he did so he heard noises suggestive of the return of the prince the lot of them were coming back again he shot into his cabin like a rabbit into its burrow just in time to escape that shouting terror  he shut the door waited until the passage was still then went across to the window and looked out a drift of cloud made the prospect of the streets and squares hazy and the rolling of the airship swung the picture up and down a few people were running to and fro but for the most part the aspect of the district was desertion the streets seemed to broaden out they became clearer and the little dots that were people larger as the vaterland came down again presently she was swaying along above the lower end of broadway the dots below bert saw were not running now but standing and looking up then suddenly they were all running again  something had dropped from the aeroplane something that looked small and flimsy it hit the pavement near a big archway just underneath bert a little man was sprinting along the sidewalk within half a dozen yards and two or three others and one woman were bolting across the roadway they were odd little figures so very small were they about the heads so very active about the elbows and legs it was really funny to see their legs going foreshortened humanity has no dignity the little man on the pavement jumped comicallyno doubt with terror as the bomb fell beside him  then blinding flames squirted out in all directions from the point of impact and the little man who had jumped became for an instant a flash of fire and vanishedvanished absolutely the people running out into the road took preposterous clumsy leaps then flopped down and lay still with their torn clothes smouldering into flame then pieces of the archway began to drop and the lower masonry of the building to fall in with the rumbling sound of coals being shot into a cellar a faint screaming reached bert and then a crowd of people ran out into the street one man limping and gesticulating awkwardly he halted and went back towards the building a falling mass of brickwork hit him and sent him sprawling to lie still and crumpled where he fell dust and black smoke came pouring into the street and were presently shot with red flame  in this manner the massacre of new york began she was the first of the great cities of the scientific age to suffer by the enormous powers and grotesque limitations of aerial warfare she was wrecked as in the previous century endless barbaric cities had been bombarded because she was at once too strong to be occupied and too undisciplined and proud to surrender in order to escape destruction given the circumstances the thing had to be done it was impossible for the prince to desist and own himself defeated and it was impossible to subdue the city except by largely destroying it the catastrophe was the logical outcome of the situation created by the application of science to warfare it was unavoidable that great cities should be destroyed in spite of his intense exasperation with his dilemma the prince sought to be moderate even in massacre he tried to give a memorable lesson with the minimum waste of life and the minimum expenditure of explosives for that night he proposed only the wrecking of broadway he directed the airfleet to move in column over the route of this thoroughfare dropping bombs the vaterland leading and so our bert smallways became a participant in one of the most coldblooded slaughters in the worlds history in which men who were neither excited nor except for the remotest chance of a bullet in any danger poured death and destruction upon homes and crowds below  he clung to the frame of the porthole as the airship tossed and swayed and stared down through the light rain that now drove before the wind into the twilight streets watching people running out of the houses watching buildings collapse and fires begin as the airships sailed along they smashed up the city as a child will shatter its cities of brick and card below they left ruins and blazing conflagrations and heaped and scattered dead men women and children mixed together as though they had been no more than moors or zulus or chinese lower new york was soon a furnace of crimson flames from which there was no escape cars railways ferries all had ceased and never a light lit the way of the distracted fugitives in that dusky confusion but the light of burning he had glimpses of what it must mean to be down thereglimpses and it came to him suddenly as an incredible discovery that such disasters were not only possible now in this strange gigantic foreign new york but also in londonin bun hill that the little island in the silver seas was at the end of its immunity that nowhere in the world any more was there a place left where a smallways might lift his head proudly and vote for war and a spirited foreign policy and go secure from such horrible things    chapter vii the vaterland is disabled  1  and then above the flames of manhattan island came a battle the first battle in the air the americans had realised the price their waiting game must cost and struck with all the strength they had if haply they might still save new york from this mad prince of blood and iron and from fire and death  they came down upon the germans on the wings of a great gale in the twilight amidst thunder and rain they came from the yards of washington and philadelphia full tilt in two squadrons and but for one sentinel airship hard by trenton the surprise would have been complete  the germans sick and weary with destruction and half empty of ammunition were facing up into the weather when the news of this onset reached them new york they had left behind to the southeastward a darkened city with one hideous red scar of flames all the airships rolled and staggered bursts of hailstorm bore them down and forced them to fight their way up again the air had become bitterly cold the prince was on the point of issuing orders to drop earthward and trail copper lightning chains when the news of the aeroplane attack came to him he faced his fleet in line abreast south had the drachenflieger manned and held ready to cast loose and ordered a general ascent into the freezing clearness above the wet and darkness  the news of what was imminent came slowly to berts perceptions he was standing in the messroom at the time and the evening rations were being served out he had resumed butteridges coat and gloves and in addition he had wrapped his blanket about him he was dipping his bread into his soup and was biting off big mouthfuls his legs were wide apart and he leant against the partition in order to steady himself amidst the pitching and oscillation of the airship the men about him looked tired and depressed a few talked but most were sullen and thoughtful and one or two were airsick they all seemed to share the peculiarly outcast feeling that had followed the murders of the evening a sense of a land beneath them and an outraged humanity grown more hostile than the sea  then the news hit them a redfaced sturdy man a man with light eyelashes and a scar appeared in the doorway and shouted something in german that manifestly startled every one bert felt the shock of the altered tone though he could not understand a word that was said the announcement was followed by a pause and then a great outcry of questions and suggestions even the airsick men flushed and spoke for some minutes the messroom was bedlam and then as if it were a confirmation of the news came the shrill ringing of the bells that called the men to their posts  bert with pantomime suddenness found himself alone  whats up he said though he partly guessed  he stayed only to gulp down the remainder of his soup and then ran along the swaying passage and clutching tightly down the ladder to the little gallery the weather hit him like cold water squirted from a hose the airship engaged in some new feat of atmospheric jiujitsu he drew his blanket closer about him clutching with one straining hand he found himself tossing in a wet twilight with nothing to be seen but mist pouring past him above him the airship was warm with lights and busy with the movements of men going to their quarters then abruptly the lights went out and the vaterland with bounds and twists and strange writhings was fighting her way up the air  he had a glimpse as the vaterland rolled over of some large buildings burning close below them a quivering acanthus of flames and then he saw indistinctly through the driving weather another airship wallowing along like a porpoise and also working up presently the clouds swallowed her again for a time and then she came back to sight as a dark and whalelike monster amidst streaming weather the air was full of flappings and pipings of void gusty shouts and noises it buffeted him and confused him ever and again his attention became rigida blind and deaf balancing and clutching  wow  something fell past him out of the vast darknesses above and vanished into the tumults below going obliquely downward it was a german drachenflieger the thing was going so fast he had but an instant apprehension of the dark figure of the aeronaut crouched together clutching at his wheel it might be a manoeuvre but it looked like a catastrophe  gaw said bert  puppuppup went a gun somewhere in the mirk ahead and suddenly and quite horribly the vaterland lurched and bert and the sentinel were clinging to the rail for dear life bang came a vast impact out of the zenith followed by another huge roll and all about him the tumbled clouds flashed red and lurid in response to flashes unseen revealing immense gulfs the rail went right overhead and he was hanging loose in the air holding on to it  for a time berts whole mind and being was given to clutching im going into the cabin he said as the airship righted again and brought back the gallery floor to his feet he began to make his way cautiously towards the ladder wheewow he cried as the whole gallery reared itself up forward and then plunged down like a desperate horse  crack bang bang bang and then hard upon this little rattle of shots and bombs came all about him enveloping him engulfing him immense and overwhelming a quivering white blaze of lightning and a thunderclap that was like the bursting of a world  just for the instant before that explosion the universe seemed to be standing still in a shadowless glare  it was then he saw the american aeroplane he saw it in the light of the flash as a thing altogether motionless even its screw appeared still and its men were rigid dolls for it was so near he could see the men upon it quite distinctly its stern was tilting down and the whole machine was heeling over it was of the coltcoburnlangley pattern with double uptilted wings and the screw ahead and the men were in a boatlike body netted over from this very light long body magazine guns projected on either side one thing that was strikingly odd and wonderful in that moment of revelation was that the left upper wing was burning downward with a reddish smoky flame but this was not the most wonderful thing about this apparition the most wonderful thing was that it and a german airship five hundred yards below were threaded as it were on the lightning flash which turned out of its path as if to take them and that out from the corners and projecting points of its huge wings everywhere little branching thorntrees of lightning were streaming  like a picture bert saw these things a picture a little blurred by a thin veil of windtorn mist  the crash of the thunderclap followed the flash and seemed a part of it so that it is hard to say whether bert was the rather deafened or blinded in that instant  and then darkness utter darkness and a heavy report and a thin small sound of voices that went wailing downward into the abyss below  2  there followed upon these things a long deep swaying of the airship and then bert began a struggle to get back to his cabin he was drenched and cold and terrified beyond measure and now more than a little airsick it seemed to him that the strength had gone out of his knees and hands and that his feet had become icily slippery over the metal they trod upon but that was because a thin film of ice had frozen upon the gallery  he never knew how long his ascent of the ladder back into the airship took him but in his dreams afterwards when he recalled it that experience seemed to last for hours below above around him were gulfs monstrous gulfs of howling wind and eddies of dark whirling snowflakes and he was protected from it all by a little metal grating and a rail a grating and rail that seemed madly infuriated with him passionately eager to wrench him off and throw him into the tumult of space  once he had a fancy that a bullet tore by his ear and that the clouds and snowflakes were lit by a flash but he never even turned his head to see what new assailant whirled past them in the void he wanted to get into the passage he wanted to get into the passage he wanted to get into the passage would the arm by which he was clinging hold out or would it give way and snap a handful of hail smacked him in the face so that for a time he was breathless and nearly insensible hold tight bert he renewed his efforts  he found himself with an enormous sense of relief and warmth in the passage the passage was behaving like a dicebox its disposition was evidently to rattle him about and then throw him out again he hung on with the convulsive clutch of instinct until the passage lurched down ahead then he would make a short run cabinward and clutch again as the foreend rose  behold he was in the cabin  he snappedto the door and for a time he was not a human being he was a case of airsickness he wanted to get somewhere that would fix him that he neednt clutch he opened the locker and got inside among the loose articles and sprawled there helplessly with his head sometimes bumping one side and sometimes the other the lid shut upon him with a click he did not care then what was happening any more he did not care who fought who or what bullets were fired or explosions occurred he did not care if presently he was shot or smashed to pieces he was full of feeble inarticulate rage and despair foolery he said his one exhaustive comment on human enterprise adventure war and the chapter of accidents that had entangled him foolery ugh he included the order of the universe in that comprehensive condemnation he wished he was dead  he saw nothing of the stars as presently the vaterland cleared the rush and confusion of the lower weather nor of the duel she fought with two circling aeroplanes how they shot her rearmost chambers through and how she fought them off with explosive bullets and turned to run as she did so  the rush and swoop of these wonderful night birds was all lost upon him their heroic dash and selfsacrifice the vaterland was rammed and for some moments she hung on the verge of destruction and sinking swiftly with the american aeroplane entangled with her smashed propeller and the americans trying to scramble aboard it signified nothing to bert to him it conveyed itself simply as vehement swaying foolery when the american airship dropped off at last with most of its crew shot or fallen bert in his locker appreciated nothing but that the vaterland had taken a hideous upward leap  but then came infinite relief incredibly blissful relief the rolling the pitching the struggle ceased ceased instantly and absolutely the vaterland was no longer fighting the gale her smashed and exploded engines throbbed no more she was disabled and driving before the wind as smoothly as a balloon a huge windspread tattered cloud of aerial wreckage  to bert it was no more than the end of a series of disagreeable sensations he was not curious to know what had happened to the airship nor what had happened to the battle for a long time he lay waiting apprehensively for the pitching and tossing and his qualms to return and so lying boxed up in the locker he presently fell asleep  3  he awoke tranquil but very stuffy and at the same time very cold and quite unable to recollect where he could be his head ached and his breath was suffocated he had been dreaming confusedly of edna and desert dervishes and of riding bicycles in an extremely perilous manner through the upper air amidst a pyrotechnic display of crackers and bengal lightsto the great annoyance of a sort of composite person made up of the prince and mr butteridge then for some reason edna and he had begun to cry pitifully for each other and he woke up with wet eyelashes into this illventilated darkness of the locker he would never see edna any more never see edna any more  he thought he must be back in the bedroom behind the cycle shop at the bottom of bun hill and he was sure the vision he had had of the destruction of a magnificent city a city quite incredibly great and splendid by means of bombs was no more than a particularly vivid dream  grubb he called anxious to tell him  the answering silence and the dull resonance of the locker to his voice supplementing the stifling quality of the air set going a new train of ideas he lifted up his hands and feet and met an inflexible resistance he was in a coffin he thought he had been buried alive he gave way at once to wild panic elp he screamed elp and drummed with his feet and kicked and struggled let me out let me out  for some seconds he struggled with this intolerable horror and then the side of his imagined coffin gave way and he was flying out into daylight then he was rolling about on what seemed to be a padded floor with kurt and being punched and sworn at lustily  he sat up his head bandage had become loose and got over one eye and he whipped the whole thing off kurt was also sitting up a yard away from him pink as ever wrapped in blankets and with an aluminium divers helmet over his knee staring at him with a severe expression and rubbing his downy unshaven chin they were both on a slanting floor of crimson padding and above them was an opening like a long low cellar flap that bert by an effort perceived to be the cabin door in a halfinverted condition the whole cabin had in fact turned on its side  what the deuce do you mean by it smallways said kurt jumping out of that locker when i was certain you had gone overboard with the rest of them where have you been  whats up asked bert  this end of the airship is up most other things are down  was there a battle  there was  who won  i havent seen the papers smallways we left before the finish we got disabled and unmanageable and our colleaguesconsorts i meanwere too busy most of them to trouble about us and the wind blew usheaven knows where the wind is blowing us it blew us right out of action at the rate of eighty miles an hour or so gott what a wind that was what a fight and here we are  where  in the air smallwaysin the air when we get down on the earth again we shant know what to do with our legs  but whats below us  canada to the best of my knowledgeand a jolly bleak empty inhospitable country it looks  but why aint we right ways up  kurt made no answer for a space  last i remember was seeing a sort of flyingmachine in a lightning flash said bert gaw that was orrible guns going off things explodin clouds and ail pitching and tossing i got so scared and desperateand sick you dont know how the fight came off  not a bit of it i was up with my squad in those divers dresses inside the gaschambers with sheets of silk for caulking we couldnt see a thing outside except the lightning flashes i never saw one of those american aeroplanes just saw the shots flicker through the chambers and sent off men for the tears we caught fire a bitnot much you know we were too wet so the fires spluttered out before we banged and then one of their infernal things dropped out of the air on us and rammed didnt you feel it  i felt everything said bert i didnt notice any particular smash  they must have been pretty desperate if they meant it they slashed down on us like a knife simply ripped the after gaschambers like gutting herrings crumpled up the engines and screw most of the engines dropped off as they fell off usor wed have groundedbut the rest is sort of dangling we just turned up our nose to the heavens and stayed there eleven men rolled off us from various points and poor old winterfeld fell through the door of the princes cabin into the chartroom and broke his ankle also we got our electric gear shot or carried awayno one knows how thats the position smallways were driving through the air like a common aerostat at the mercy of the elements almost due northprobably to the north pole we dont know what aeroplanes the americans have or anything at all about it very likely we have finished em up one fouled us one was struck by lightning some of the men saw a third upset apparently just for fun they were going cheap anyhow also weve lost most of our drachenflieger they just skated off into the night no stability in em thats all we dont know if weve won or lost we dont know if were at war with the british empire yet or at peace consequently we darent get down we dont know what we are up to or what we are going to do our napoleon is alone forward and i suppose hes rearranging his plans whether new york was our moscow or not remains to be seen weve had a high old time and murdered no end of people war noble war im sick of it this morning i like sitting in rooms rightway up and not on slippery partitions im a civilised man i keep thinking of old albrecht and the barbarossa i feel i want a wash and kind words and a quiet home when i look at you i know i want a wash gotthe stifled a vehement yawnwhat a cockney tadpole of a ruffian you look  can we get any grub asked bert  heaven knows said kurt  he meditated upon bert for a time so far as i can judge smallways he said the prince will probably want to throw you overboardnext time he thinks of you he certainly will if he sees you after all you know you came als ballast and we shall have to lighten ship extensively pretty soon unless im mistaken the prince will wake up presently and start doing things with tremendous vigour ive taken a fancy to you its the english strain in me youre a rum little chap i shant like seeing you whizz down the air youd better make yourself useful smallways i think i shall requisition you for my squad youll have to work you know and be infernally intelligent and all that and youll have to hang about upside down a bit still its the best chance you have we shant carry passengers much farther this trip i fancy ballast goes overboardif we dont want to ground precious soon and be taken prisoners of war the prince wont do that anyhow hell be game to the last  4  by means of a folding chair which was still in its place behind the door they got to the window and looked out in turn and contemplated a sparsely wooded country below with no railways nor roads and only occasional signs of habitation then a bugle sounded and kurt interpreted it as a summons to food they got through the door and clambered with some difficulty up the nearly vertical passage holding on desperately with toes and fingertips to the ventilating perforations in its floor the mess stewards had found their fireless heating arrangements intact and there was hot cocoa for the officers and hot soup for the men  berts sense of the queerness of this experience was so keen that it blotted out any fear he might have felt indeed he was far more interested now than afraid he seemed to have touched down to the bottom of fear and abandonment overnight he was growing accustomed to the idea that he would probably be killed presently that this strange voyage in the air was in all probability his death journey no human being can keep permanently afraid fear goes at last to the back of ones mind accepted and shelved and done with he squatted over his soup sopping it up with his bread and contemplated his comrades they were all rather yellow and dirty with fourday beards and they grouped themselves in the tired unpremeditated manner of men on a wreck they talked little the situation perplexed them beyond any suggestion of ideas three had been hurt in the pitching up of the ship during the fight and one had a bandaged bullet wound it was incredible that this little band of men had committed murder and massacre on a scale beyond precedent none of them who squatted on the sloping gaspadded partition soup mug in hand seemed really guilty of anything of the sort seemed really capable of hurting a dog wantonly they were all so manifestly built for homely chalets on the solid earth and carefully tilled fields and blond wives and cheery merrymaking the redfaced sturdy man with light eyelashes who had brought the first news of the air battle to the mens mess had finished his soup and with an expression of maternal solicitude was readjusting the bandages of a youngster whose arm had been sprained  bert was crumbling the last of his bread into the last of his soup eking it out as long as possible when suddenly he became aware that every one was looking at a pair of feet that were dangling across the downturned open doorway kurt appeared and squatted across the hinge in some mysterious way he had shaved his face and smoothed down his light golden hair he looked extraordinarily cherubic der prinz he said  a second pair of boots followed making wide and magnificent gestures in their attempts to feel the door frame kurt guided them to a foothold and the prince shaved and brushed and beeswaxed and clean and big and terrible slid down into position astride of the door all the men and bert also stood up and saluted  the prince surveyed them with the gesture of a man who site a steed the head of the kapitan appeared beside him  then bert had a terrible moment the blue blaze of the princes eye fell upon him the great finger pointed a question was asked kurt intervened with explanations  so said the prince and bert was disposed of  then the prince addressed the men in short heroic sentences steadying himself on the hinge with one hand and waving the other in a fine variety of gesture what he said bert could not tell but he perceived that their demeanor changed their backs stiffened they began to punctuate the princes discourse with cries of approval at the end their leader burst into song and all the men with him ein feste burg ist unser gott they chanted in deep strong tones with an immense moral uplifting it was glaringly inappropriate in a damaged halfoverturned and sinking airship which had been disabled and blown out of action after inflicting the cruellest bombardment in the worlds history but it was immensely stirring nevertheless bert was deeply moved he could not sing any of the words of luthers great hymn but he opened his mouth and emitted loud deep and partially harmonious notes  far below this deep chanting struck on the ears of a little camp of christianised halfbreeds who were lumbering they were breakfasting but they rushed out cheerfully quite prepared for the second advent they stared at the shattered and twisted vaterland driving before the gale amazed beyond words in so many respects it was like their idea of the second advent and then again in so many respects it wasnt they stared at its passage awestricken and perplexed beyond their power of words the hymn ceased then after a long interval a voice came out of heaven vat id diss blace here galled itself vat  they made no answer indeed they did not understand though the question repeated itself  and at last the monster drove away northward over a crest of pine woods and was no more seen they fell into a hot and long disputation  the hymn ended the princes legs dangled up the passage again and every one was briskly prepared for heroic exertion and triumphant acts smallways cried kurt come here  5  then bert under kurts direction had his first experience of the work of an airsailor  the immediate task before the captain of the vaterland was a very simple one he had to keep afloat the wind though it had fallen from its earlier violence was still blowing strongly enough to render the grounding of so clumsy a mass extremely dangerous even if it had been desirable for the prince to land in inhabited country and so risk capture it was necessary to keep the airship up until the wind fell and then if possible to descend in some lonely district of the territory where there would be a chance of repair or rescue by some searching consort in order to do this weight had to be dropped and kurt was detailed with a dozen men to climb down among the wreckage of the deflated airchambers and cut the stuff clear portion by portion as the airship sank so bert armed with a sharp cutlass found himself clambering about upon netting four thousand feet up in the air trying to understand kurt when he spoke in english and to divine him when he used german  it was giddy work but not nearly so giddy as a rather overnourished reader sitting in a warm room might imagine bert found it quite possible to look down and contemplate the wild subarctic landscape below now devoid of any sign of habitation a land of rocky cliffs and cascades and broad swirling desolate rivers and of trees and thickets that grew more stunted and scrubby as the day wore on here and there on the hills were patches and pockets of snow and over all this he worked hacking away at the tough and slippery oiled silk and clinging stoutly to the netting presently they cleared and dropped a tangle of bent steel rods and wires from the frame and a big chunk of silk bladder that was trying the airship flew up at once as this loose hamper parted it seemed almost as though they were dropping all canada the stuff spread out in the air and floated down and hit and twisted up in a nasty fashion on the lip of a gorge bert clung like a frozen monkey to his ropes and did not move a muscle for five minutes  but there was something very exhilarating he found in this dangerous work and above every thing else there was the sense of fellowship he was no longer an isolated and distrustful stranger among these others he had now a common object with them he worked with a friendly rivalry to get through with his share before them and he developed a great respect and affection for kurt which had hitherto been only latent in him kurt with a job to direct was altogether admirable he was resourceful helpful considerate swift he seemed to be everywhere one forgot his pinkness his light cheerfulness of manner directly one had trouble he was at hand with sound and confident advice he was like an elder brother to his men  all together they cleared three considerable chunks of wreckage and then bert was glad to clamber up into the cabins again and give place to a second squad he and his companions were given hot coffee and indeed even gloved as they were the job had been a cold one they sat drinking it and regarding each other with satisfaction one man spoke to bert amiably in german and bert nodded and smiled through kurt bert whose ankles were almost frozen succeeded in getting a pair of topboots from one of the disabled men  in the afternoon the wind abated greatly and small infrequent snowflakes came drifting by snow also spread more abundantly below and the only trees were clumps of pine and spruce in the lower valleys kurt went with three men into the still intact gaschambers let out a certain quantity of gas from them and prepared a series of ripping panels for the descent also the residue of the bombs and explosives in the magazine were thrown overboard and fell detonating loudly in the wilderness below and about four oclock in the afternoon upon a wide and rocky plain within sight of snowcrested cliffs the vaterland ripped and grounded  it was necessarily a difficult and violent affair for the vaterland had not been planned for the necessities of a balloon the captain got one panel ripped too soon and the others not soon enough she dropped heavily bounced clumsily and smashed the hanging gallery into the forepart mortally injuring von winterfeld and then came down in a collapsing heap after dragging for some moments the forward shield and its machine gun tumbled in upon the things below two men were hurt badlyone got a broken leg and one was internally injuredby flying rods and wires and bert was pinned for a time under the side when at last he got clear and could take a view of the situation the great black eagle that had started so splendidly from franconia six evenings ago sprawled deflated over the cabins of the airship and the frostbitten rocks of this desolate place and looked a most unfortunate birdas though some one had caught it and wrung its neck and cast it aside several of the crew of the airship were standing about in silence contemplating the wreckage and the empty wilderness into which they had fallen others were busy under the imromptu tent made by the empty gaschambers the prince had gone a little way off and was scrutinising the distant heights through his fieldglass they had the appearance of old sea cliffs here and there were small clumps of conifers and in two places tall cascades the nearer ground was strewn with glaciated boulders and supported nothing but a stunted alpine vegetation of compact clustering stems and stalkless flowers no river was visible but the air was full of the rush and babble of a torrent close at hand a bleak and biting wind was blowing ever and again a snowflake drifted past the springless frozen earth under berts feet felt strangely dead and heavy after the buoyant airship  6  so it came about that that great and powerful prince karl albert was for a time thrust out of the stupendous conflict he chiefly had been instrumental in provoking the chances of battle and the weather conspired to maroon him in labrador and there he raged for six long days while war and wonder swept the world nation rose against nation and airfleet grappled airfleet cities blazed and men died in multitudes but in labrador one might have dreamt that except for a little noise of hammering the world was at peace  there the encampment lay from a distance the cabins covered over with the silk of the balloon part looked like a gipsys tent on a rather exceptional scale and all the available hands were busy in building out of the steel of the framework a mast from which the vaterlands electricians might hang the long conductors of the apparatus for wireless telegraphy that was to link the prince to the world again there were times when it seemed they would never rig that mast from the outset the party suffered hardship they were not too abundantly provisioned and they were put on short rations and for all the thick garments they had they were but illequipped against the piercing wind and inhospitable violence of this wilderness the first night was spent in darkness and without fires the engines that had supplied power were smashed and dropped far away to the south and there was never a match among the company it had been death to carry matches all the explosives had been thrown out of the magazine and it was only towards morning that the birdfaced man whose cabin bert had taken in the beginning confessed to a brace of duelling pistols and cartridges with which a fire could be started afterwards the lockers of the machine gun were found to contain a supply of unused ammunition  the night was a distressing one and seemed almost interminable hardly any one slept there were seven wounded men aboard and von winterfelds head had been injured and he was shivering and in delirium struggling with his attendant and shouting strange things about the burning of new york the men crept together in the messroom in the darkling wrapped in what they could find and drank cocoa from the fireless heaters and listened to his cries in the morning the prince made them a speech about destiny and the god of his fathers and the pleasure and glory of giving ones life for his dynasty and a number of similar considerations that might otherwise have been neglected in that bleak wilderness the men cheered without enthusiasm and far away a wolf howled  then they set to work and for a week they toiled to put up a mast of steel and hang from it a gridiron of copper wires two hundred feet by twelve the theme of all that time was work work continually straining and toilsome work and all the rest was grim hardship and evil chances save for a certain wild splendour in the sunset and sunrise in the torrents and drifting weather in the wilderness about them they built and tended a ring of perpetual fires gangs roamed for brushwood and met with wolves and the wounded men and their beds were brought out from the airship cabins and put in shelters about the fires there old von winterfeld raved and became quiet and presently died and three of the other wounded sickened for want of good food while their fellows mended these things happened as it were in the wings the central facts before berts consciousness were always firstly the perpetual toil the holding and lifting and lugging at heavy and clumsy masses the tedious filing and winding of wires and secondly the prince urgent and threatening whenever a man relaxed he would stand over them and point over their heads southward into the empty sky the world there he said in german is waiting for us fifty centuries come to their consummation bert did not understand the words but he read the gesture several times the prince grew angry once with a man who was working slowly once with a man who stole a comrades ration the first he scolded and set to a more tedious task the second he struck in the face and illused he did no work himself there was a clear space near the fires in which he would walk up and down sometimes for two hours together with arms folded muttering to himself of patience and his destiny at times these mutterings broke out into rhetoric into shouts and gestures that would arrest the workers they would stare at him until they perceived that his blue eyes glared and his waving hand addressed itself always to the southward hills on sunday the work ceased for half an hour and the prince preached on faith and gods friendship for david and afterwards they all sang ein feste burg ist unser gott  in an improvised hovel lay von winterfeld and all one morning he raved of the greatness of germany blut und eisen he shouted and then as if in derision weltpolitikha ha then he would explain complicated questions of polity to imaginary hearers in low wily tones the other sick men kept still listening to him berts distracted attention would be recalled by kurt smallways take that end so  slowly tediously the great mast was rigged and hoisted foot by foot into place the electricians had contrived a catchment pool and a wheel in the torrent close at handfor the little mulhausen dynamo with its turbinal volute used by the telegraphists was quite adaptable to water driving and on the sixth day in the evening the apparatus was in working order and the prince was callingweakly indeed but callingto his airfleet across the empty spaces of the world for a time he called unheeded  the effect of that evening was to linger long in berts memory a red fire spluttered and blazed close by the electricians at their work and red gleams xan up the vertical steel mast and threads of copper wire towards the zenith the prince sat on a rock close by with his chin on his hand waiting beyond and to the northward was the cairn that covered von winterfeld surmounted by a cross of steel and from among the tumbled rocks in the distance the eyes of a wolf gleamed redly on the other hand was the wreckage of the great airship and the men bivouacked about a second ruddy flare they were all keeping very still as if waiting to hear what news might presently be given them far away across many hundreds of miles of desolation other wireless masts would be clicking and snapping and waking into responsive vibration perhaps they were not perhaps those throbs upon the ethers wasted themselves upon a regardless world when the men spoke they spoke in low tones now and then a bird shrieked remotely and once a wolf howled all these things were set in the immense cold spaciousness of the wild  7  bert got the news last and chiefly in broken english from a linguist among his mates it was only far on in the night that the weary telegraphist got an answer to his calls but then the messages came clear and strong and such news it was  i say said bert at his breakfast amidst a great clamour tell us a bit  all de vorlt is at vor said the linguist waving his cocoa in an illustrative manner all de vorlt is at vor  bert stared southward into the dawn it did not seem so  all de vorlt is at vor they haf burn berlin they haf burn london they haf burn hamburg and paris chapan hass burn san francisco we haf mate a camp at niagara dat is whad they are telling us china has cot drachenflieger and luftschiffe beyont counting all de vorlt is at vor  gaw said bert  yess said the linguist drinking his cocoa  burnt up london ave they like we did new york  it wass a bombardment  they dont say anything about a place called clapham or bun hill do they  i haf heard noding said the linguist  that was all bert could get for a time but the excitement of all the men about him was contagious and presently he saw kurt standing alone hands behind him and looking at one of the distant waterfalls very steadfastly he went up and saluted soldierfashion beg pardon lieutenant he said  kurt turned his face it was unusually grave that morning i was just thinking i would like to see that waterfall closer he said it reminds mewhat do you want  i cant make ead or tail of what theyre saying sir would you mind telling me the news  damn the news said kurt youll get news enough before the days out its the end of the world theyre sending the graf zeppelin for us shell be here by the morning and we ought to be at niagaraor eternal smashwithin eight and forty hours i want to look at that waterfall youd better come with me have you had your rations  yessir  very well come  and musing profoundly kurt led the way across the rocks towards the distant waterfall  for a time bert walked behind him in the character of an escort then as they passed out of the atmosphere of the encampment kurt lagged for him to come alongside  we shall be back in it all in two days time he said and its a devil of a war to go back to thats the news the worlds gone mad our fleet beat the americans the night we got disabled thats clear we lost eleveneleven airships certain and all their aeroplanes got smashed god knows how much we smashed or how many we killed but that was only the beginning our starts been like firing a magazine every country was hiding flyingmachines theyre fighting in the air all over europeall over the world the japanese and chinese have joined in thats the great fact thats the supreme fact theyve pounced into our little quarrels the yellow peril was a peril after all theyve got thousands of airships theyre all over the world we bombarded london and paris and now the french and english have smashed up berlin and now asia is at us all and on the top of us all its mania china on the top and they dont know where to stop its limitless its the last confusion theyre bombarding capitals smashing up dockyards and factories mines and fleets  did they do much to london sir asked bert  heaven knows  he said no more for a time  this labrador seems a quiet place he resumed at last im half a mind to stay here cant do that no ive got to see it through ive got to see it through youve got to too every one but why i tell youour worlds gone to pieces theres no way out of it no way back here we are were like mice caught in a house on fire were like cattle overtaken by a flood presently we shall be picked up and back we shall go into the fighting we shall kill and smash againperhaps its a chinojapanese airfleet this time and the odds are against us our turns will come what will happen to you i dont know but for myself i know quite well i shall be killed  youll be all right said bert after a queer pause  no said kurt im going to be killed i didnt know it before but this morning at dawn i knew itas though id been told  ow  i tell you i know  but ow could you know  i know  like being told  like being certain  i know he repeated and for a time they walked in silence towards the waterfall  kurt wrapped in his thoughts walked heedlessly and at last broke out again ive always felt young before smallways but this morning i feel oldold so old nearer to death than old men feel and ive always thought life was a lark it isnt this sort of thing has always been happening i supposethese things wars and earthquakes that sweep across all the decency of life its just as though i had woke up to it all for the first time every night since we were at new york ive dreamt of it and its always been soits the way of life people are torn away from the people they care for homes are smashed creatures full of life and memories and little peculiar gifts are scalded and smashed and torn to pieces and starved and spoilt london berlin san francisco think of all the human histories we ended in new york and the others go on again as though such things werent possible as i went on like animals just like animals  he said nothing for a long time and then he dropped out the prince is a lunatic  they came to a place where they had to climb and then to a long peat level beside a rivulet there a quantity of delicate little pink flowers caught berts eye gaw he said and stooped to pick one in a place like this  kurt stopped and half turned his face winced  i never see such a flower said bert its so delicate  pick some more if you want to said kurt  bert did so while kurt stood and watched him  funny ow one always wants to pick flowers said bert  kurt had nothing to add to that  they went on again without talking for a long time  at last they came to a rocky hummock from which the view of the waterfall opened out there kurt stopped and seated himself on a rock  thats as much as i wanted to see he explained it isnt very like but its like enough  like what  another waterfall i knew  he asked a question abruptly got a girl smallways  funny thing said bert those flowers i supposei was jes thinking of er  so was i  what edna  no i was thinking of my edna weve all got ednas i suppose for our imaginations to play about this was a girl but all thats past for ever its hard to think i cant see her just for a minutejust let her know im thinking of her  very likely said bert youll see er all right  no said kurt with decision i know  i met her he went on in a place like thisin the alpsengstlen alp theres a waterfall rather like this onea broad waterfall down towards innertkirchen thats why i came here this morning we slipped away and had half a day together beside it and we picked flowers just such flowers as you picked the same for all i know and gentian  i know said bert me and ednawe done things like that flowers and all that seems years off now  she was beautiful and daring and shy mein gott i can hardly hold myself for the desire to see her and hear her voice again before i die where is she look here smallways i shall write a sort of letterand theres her portrait he touched his breast pocket  youll see er again all right said bert  no i shall never see her again i dont understand why people should meet just to be torn apart but i know she and i will never meet again that i know as surely as that the sun will rise and that cascade come shining over the rocks after i am dead and done oh its all foolishness and haste and violence and cruel folly stupidity and blundering hate and selfish ambitionall the things that men have doneall the things they will ever do gott smallways what a muddle and confusion life has always beenthe battles and massacres and disasters the hates and harsh acts the murders and sweatings the lynchings and cheatings this morning i am tired of it all as though id just found it out for the first time i have found it out when a man is tired of life i suppose it is time for him to die ive lost heart and death is over me death is close to me and i know i have got to end but think of all the hopes i had only a little time ago the sense of fine beginnings it was all a sham there were no beginnings were just ants in anthill cities in a world that doesnt matter that goes on and rambles into nothingness new yorknew york doesnt even strike me as horrible new york was nothing but an anthill kicked to pieces by a fool  think of it smallways theres war everywhere theyre smashing up their civilisation before they have made it the sort of thing the english did at alexandria the japanese at port arthur the french at casablanca is going on everywhere everywhere down in south america even they are fighting among themselves no place is safeno place is at peace there is no place where a woman and her daughter can hide and be at peace the war comes through the air bombs drop in the night quiet people go out in the morning and see airfleets passing overheaddripping deathdripping death    chapter viii a world at war  1  it was only very slowly that bert got hold of this idea that the whole world was at war that he formed any image at all of the crowded countries south of these arctic solitudes stricken with terror and dismay as these newborn aerial navies swept across their skies he was not used to thinking of the world as a whole but as a limitless hinterland of happenings beyond the range of his immediate vision war in his imagination was something a source of news and emotion that happened in a restricted area called the seat of war but now the whole atmosphere was the seat of war and every land a cockpit so closely had the nations raced along the path of research and invention so secret and yet so parallel had been their plans and acquisitions that it was within a few hours of the launching of the first fleet in franconia that an asiatic armada beat its westward way across high above the marvelling millions in the plain of the ganges but the preparations of the confederation of eastern asia had been on an altogether more colossal scale than the german with this step said tan tingsiang we overtake and pass the west we recover the peace of the world that these barbarians have destroyed  their secrecy and swiftness and inventions had far surpassed those of the germans and where the germans had had a hundred men at work the asiatics had ten thousand there came to their great aeronautic parks at chinsifu and tsingyen by the monorails that now laced the whole surface of china a limitless supply of skilled and able workmen workmen far above the average european in industrial efficiency the news of the german world surprise simply quickened their efforts at the time of the bombardment of new york it is doubtful if the germans had three hundred airships all together in the world the score of asiatic fleets flying east and west and south must have numbered several thousand moreover the asiatics had a real fighting flyingmachine the niais as they were called a light but quite efficient weapon infinitely superior to the german drachenflieger like that it was a oneman machine but it was built very lightly of steel and cane and chemical silk with a transverse engine and a flapping sidewing the aeronaut carried a gun firing explosive bullets loaded with oxygen and in addition and true to the best tradition of japan a sword mostly they were japanese and it is characteristic that from the first it was contemplated that the aeronaut should be a swordsman the wings of these flyers had batlike hooks forward by which they were to cling to their antagonists gaschambers while boarding him these light flyingmachines were carried with the fleets and also sent overland or by sea to the front with the men they were capable of flights of from two to five hundred miles according to the wind  so hard upon the uprush of the first german airfleet these asiatic swarms took to the atmosphere instantly every organised government in the world was frantically and vehemently building airships and whatever approach to a flying machine its inventors had discovered there was no time for diplomacy warnings and ultimatums were telegraphed to and fro and in a few hours all the panicfierce world was openly at war and at war in the most complicated way for britain and france and italy had declared war upon germany and outraged swiss neutrality india at the sight of asiatic airships had broken into a hindoo insurrection in bengal and a mohametan revolt hostile to this in the northwest provincesthe latter spreading like wildfire from gobi to the gold coastand the confederation of eastern asia had seized the oil wells of burmha and was impartially attacking america and germany in a week they were building airships in damascus and cairo and johannesburg australia and new zealand were frantically equipping themselves one unique and terrifying aspect of this development was the swiftness with which these monsters could be produced to build an ironclad took from two to four years an airship could be put together in as many weeks moreover compared with even a torpedo boat the airship was remarkably simple to construct given the airchamber material the engines the gas plant and the design it was really not more complicated and far easier than an ordinary wooden boat had been a hundred years before and now from cape horn to nova zembla and from canton round to canton again there were factories and workshops and industrial resources  and the german airships were barely in sight of the atlantic waters the first asiatic fleet was scarcely reported from upper burmah before the fantastic fabric of credit and finance that had held the world together economically for a hundred years strained and snapped a tornado of realisation swept through every stock exchange in the world banks stopped payment business shrank and ceased factories ran on for a day or so by a sort of inertia completing the orders of bankrupt and extinguished customers then stopped the new york bert smallways saw for all its glare of light and traffic was in the pit of an economic and financial collapse unparalleled in history the flow of the food supply was already a little checked and before the worldwar had lasted two weeksby the time that is that mast was rigged in labradorthere was not a city or town in the world outside china however far from the actual centres of destruction where police and government were not adopting special emergency methods to deal with a want of food and a glut of unemployed people  the special peculiarities of aerial warfare were of such a nature as to trend once it had begun almost inevitably towards social disorganisation the first of these peculiarities was brought home to the germans in their attack upon new york the immense power of destruction an airship has over the thing below and its relative inability to occupy or police or guard or garrison a surrendered position necessarily in the face of urban populations in a state of economic disorganisation and infuriated and starving this led to violent and destructive collisions and even where the airfleet floated inactive above there would be civil conflict and passionate disorder below nothing comparable to this state of affairs had been known in the previous history of warfare unless we take such a case as that of a nineteenth century warship attacking some large savage or barbaric settlement or one of those naval bombardments that disfigure the history of great britain in the late eighteenth century then indeed there had been cruelties and destruction that faintly foreshadowed the horrors of the aerial war moreover before the twentieth century the world had had but one experience and that a comparatively light one in the communist insurrection of paris 1871 of the possibilities of a modern urban population under warlike stresses  a second peculiarity of airship war as it first came to the world that also made for social collapse was the ineffectiveness of the early airships against each other upon anything below they could rain explosives in the most deadly fashion forts and ships and cities lay at their mercy but unless they were prepared for a suicidal grapple they could do remarkably little mischief to each other the armament of the huge german airships big as the biggest mammoth liners afloat was one machine gun that could easily have been packed up on a couple of mules in addition when it became evident that the air must be fought for the airsailors were provided with rifles with explosive bullets of oxygen or inflammable substance but no airship at any time ever carried as much in the way of guns and armour as the smallest gunboat on the navy list had been accustomed to do consequently when these monsters met in battle they manoeuvred for the upper place or grappled and fought like junks throwing grenades fighting hand to hand in an entirely medieval fashion the risks of a collapse and fall on either side came near to balancing in every case the chances of victory as a consequence and after their first experiences of battle one finds a growing tendency on the part of the airfleet admirals to evade joining battle and to seek rather the moral advantage of a destructive counter attack  and if the airships were too ineffective the early drachenflieger were either too unstable like the german or too light like the japanese to produce immediately decisive results later it is true the brazilians launched a flyingmachine of a type and scale that was capable of dealing with an airship but they built only three or four they operated only in south america and they vanished from history untraceably in the time when worldbankruptcy put a stop to all further engineering production on any considerable scale  the third peculiarity of aerial warfare was that it was at once enormously destructive and entirely indecisive it had this unique feature that both sides lay open to punitive attack in all previous forms of war both by land and sea the losing side was speedily unable to raid its antagonists territory and the communications one fought on a front and behind that front the winners supplies and resources his towns and factories and capital the peace of his country were secure if the war was a naval one you destroyed your enemys battle fleet and then blockaded his ports secured his coaling stations and hunted down any stray cruisers that threatened your ports of commerce but to blockade and watch a coastline is one thing to blockade and watch the whole surface of a country is another and cruisers and privateers are things that take long to make that cannot be packed up and hidden and carried unostentatiously from point to point in aerial war the stronger side even supposing it destroyed the main battle fleet of the weaker had then either to patrol and watch or destroy every possible point at which he might produce another and perhaps a novel and more deadly form of flyer it meant darkening his air with airships it meant building them by the thousand and making aeronauts by the hundred thousand a small uninitated airship could be hidden in a railway shed in a village street in a wood a flying machine is even less conspicuous  and in the air are no streets no channels no point where one can say of an antagonist if he wants to reach my capital he must come by here in the air all directions lead everywhere  consequently it was impossible to end a war by any of the established methods a having outnumbered and overwhelmed b hovers a thousand airships strong over his capital threatening to bombard it unless b submits b replies by wireless telegraphy that he is now in the act of bombarding the chief manufacturing city of a by means of three raider airships a denounces bs raiders as pirates and so forth bombards bs capital and sets off to hunt down bs airships while b in a state of passionate emotion and heroic unconquerableness sets to work amidst his ruins making fresh airships and explosives for the benefit of a the war became perforce a universal guerilla war a war inextricably involving civilians and homes and all the apparatus of social life  these aspects of aerial fighting took the world by surprise there had been no foresight to deduce these consequences if there had been the world would have arranged for a universal peace conference in 1900 but mechanical invention had gone faster than intellectual and social organisation and the world with its silly old flags its silly unmeaning tradition of nationality its cheap newspapers and cheaper passions and imperialisms its base commercial motives and habitual insincerities and vulgarities its race lies and conflicts was taken by surprise once the war began there was no stopping it the flimsy fabric of credit that had grown with no man foreseeing and that had held those hundreds of millions in an economic interdependence that no man clearly understood dissolved in panic everywhere went the airships dropping bombs destroying any hope of a rally and everywhere below were economic catastrophe starving workless people rioting and social disorder whatever constructive guiding intelligence there had been among the nations vanished in the passionate stresses of the time such newspapers and documents and histories as survive from this period all tell one universal story of towns and cities with the food supply interrupted and their streets congested with starving unemployed of crises in administration and states of siege of provisional governments and councils of defence and in the cases of india and egypt insurrectionary committees taking charge of the rearming of the population of the making of batteries and gunpits of the vehement manufacture of airships and flyingmachines  one sees these things in glimpses in illuminated moments as if through a driving reek of clouds going on all over the world it was the dissolution of an age it was the collapse of the civilisation that had trusted to machinery and the instruments of its destruction were machines but while the collapse of the previous great civilisation that of rome had been a matter of centuries had been a thing of phase and phase like the ageing and dying of a man this like his killing by railway or motor car was one swift conclusive smashing and an end  2  the early battles of the aerial war were no doubt determined by attempts to realise the old naval maxim to ascertain the position of the enemys fleet and to destroy it there was first the battle of the bernese oberland in which the italian and french navigables in their flank raid upon the franconian park were assailed by the swiss experimental squadron supported as the day wore on by german airships and then the encounter of the british winterhousedunn aeroplanes with three unfortunate germans  then came the battle of north india in which the entire angloindian aeronautic settlement establishment fought for three days against overwhelming odds and was dispersed and destroyed in detail  and simultaneously with the beginning of that commenced the momentous struggle of the germans and asiatics that is usually known as the battle of niagara because of the objective of the asiatic attack but it passed gradually into a sporadic conflict over half a continent such german airships as escaped destruction in battle descended and surrendered to the americans and were remanned and in the end it became a series of pitiless and heroic encounters between the americans savagely resolved to exterminate their enemies and a continually reinforced army of invasion from asia quartered upon the pacific slope and supported by an immense fleet from the first the war in america was fought with implacable bitterness no quarter was asked no prisoners were taken with ferocious and magnificent energy the americans constructed and launched ship after ship to battle and perish against the asiatic multitudes all other affairs were subordinate to this war the whole population was presently living or dying for it presently as i shall tell the white men found in the butteridge machine a weapon that could meet and fight the flyingmachines of the asiatic swordsman  the asiatic invasion of america completely effaced the germanamerican conflict it vanishes from history at first it had seemed to promise quite sufficient tragedy in itselfbeginning as it did in unforgettable massacre after the destruction of central new york all america had risen like one man resolved to die a thousand deaths rather than submit to germany the germans grimly resolved upon beating the americans into submission and following out the plans developed by the prince had seized niagarain order to avail themselves of its enormous powerworks expelled all its inhabitants and made a desert of its environs as far as buffalo they had also directly great britain and france declare war wrecked the country upon the canadian side for nearly ten miles inland they began to bring up men and material from the fleet off the east coast stringing out to and fro like bees getting honey it was then that the asiatic forces appeared and it was in their attack upon this german base at niagara that the airfleets of east and west first met and the greater issue became clear  one conspicuous peculiarity of the early aerial fighting arose from the profound secrecy with which the airships had been prepared each power had had but the dimmest inkling of the schemes of its rivals and even experiments with its own devices were limited by the needs of secrecy none of the designers of airships and aeroplanes had known clearly what their inventions might have to fight many had not imagined they would have to fight anything whatever in the air and had planned them only for the dropping of explosives such had been the german idea the only weapon for fighting another airship with which the franconian fleet had been provided was the machine gun forward only after the fight over new york were the men given short rifles with detonating bullets theoretically the drachenflieger were to have been the fighting weapon they were declared to be aerial torpedoboats and the aeronaut was supposed to swoop close to his antagonist and cast his bombs as he whirled past but indeed these contrivances were hopelessly unstable not onethird in any engagement succeeded in getting back to the mother airship the rest were either smashed up or grounded  the allied chinojapanese fleet made the same distinction as the germans between airships and fighting machines heavier than air but the type in both cases was entirely different from the occidental models andit is eloquent of the vigour with which these great peoples took up and bettered the european methods of scientific research in almost every particular the invention of asiatic engineers chief among these it is worth remarking was mohini k chatterjee a political exile who had formerly served in the britishindian aeronautic park at lahore  the german airship was fishshaped with a blunted head the asiatic airship was also fishshaped but not so much on the lines of a cod or goby as of a ray or sole it had a wide flat underside unbroken by windows or any opening except along the middle line its cabins occupied its axis with a sort of bridge deck above and the gaschambers gave the whole affair the shape of a gipsys hooped tent except that it was much flatter the german airship was essentially a navigable balloon very much lighter than air the asiatic airship was very little lighter than air and skimmed through it with much greater velocity if with considerably less stability they carried fore and aft guns the latter much the larger throwing inflammatory shells and in addition they had nests for riflemen on both the upper and the under side light as this armament was in comparison with the smallest gunboat that ever sailed it was sufficient for them to outfight as well as outfly the german monster airships in action they flew to get behind or over the germans they even dashed underneath avoiding only passing immediately beneath the magazine and then as soon as they had crossed let fly with their rear gun and sent flares or oxygen shells into the antagonists gaschambers  it was not in their airships but as i have said in their flyingmachines proper that the strength of the asiatics lay next only to the butteridge machine these were certainly the most efficient heavierthanair fliers that had ever appeared they were the invention of a japanese artist and they differed in type extremely from the boxkite quality of the german drachenflieger they had curiously curved flexible side wings more like bent butterflys wings than anything else and made of a substance like celluloid and of brightly painted silk and they had a long hummingbird tail at the forward corner of the wings were hooks rather like the claws of a bat by which the machine could catch and hang and tear at the walls of an airships gaschamber the solitary rider sat between the wings above a transverse explosive engine an explosive engine that differed in no essential particular from those in use in the light motor bicycles of the period below was a single large wheel the rider sat astride of a saddle as in the butteridge machine and he carried a large doubleedged twohanded sword in addition to his explosivebullet firing rifle  3  one sets down these particulars and compares the points of the american and german pattern of aeroplane and navigable but none of these facts were clearly known to any of those who fought in this monstrously confused battle above the american great lakes  each side went into action against it knew not what under novel conditions and with apparatus that even without hostile attacks was capable of producing the most disconcerting surprises schemes of action attempts at collective manoeuvring necessarily went to pieces directly the fight began just as they did in almost all the early ironclad battles of the previous century each captain then had to fall back upon individual action and his own devices one would see triumph in what another read as a cue for flight and despair it is as true of the battle of niagara as of the battle of lissa that it was not a battle but a bundle of battlettes  to such a spectator as bert it presented itself as a series of incidents some immense some trivial but collectively incoherent he never had a sense of any plain issue joined of any point struggled for and won or lost he saw tremendous things happen and in the end his world darkened to disaster and ruin  he saw the battle from the ground from prospect park and from goat island whither he fled  but the manner in which he came to be on the ground needs explaining  the prince had resumed command of his fleet through wireless telegraphy long before the zeppelin had located his encampment in labrador by his direction the german airfleet whose advance scouts had been in contact with the japanese over the rocky mountains had concentrated upon niagara and awaited his arrival he had rejoined his command early in the morning of the twelfth and bert had his first prospect of the gorge of niagara while he was doing net drill outside the middle gaschamber at sunrise the zeppelin was flying very high at the time and far below he saw the water in the gorge marbled with froth and then away to the west the great crescent of the canadian fall shining flickering and foaming in the level sunlight and sending up a deep incessant thudding rumble to the sky the airfleet was keeping station in an enormous crescent with its horns pointing southwestward a long array of shining monsters with tails rotating slowly and german ensigns now trailing from their bellies aft of their marconi pendants  niagara city was still largely standing then albeit its streets were empty of all life its bridges were intact its hotels and restaurants still flying flags and inviting sky signs its powerstations running but about it the country on both sides of the gorge might have been swept by a colossal broom everything that could possibly give cover to an attack upon the german position at niagara had been levelled as ruthlessly as machinery and explosives could contrive houses blown up and burnt woods burnt fences and crops destroyed the monorails had been torn up and the roads in particular cleared of all possibility of concealment or shelter seen from above the effect of this wreckage was grotesque young woods had been destroyed wholesale by dragging wires and the spoilt saplings smashed or uprooted lay in swathes like corn after the sickle houses had an appearance of being flattened down by the pressure of a gigantic finger much burning was still going on and large areas had been reduced to patches of smouldering and sometimes still glowing blackness  here and there lay the debris of belated fugitives carts and dead bodies of horses and men and where houses had had watersupplies there were pools of water and running springs from the ruptured pipes in unscorched fields horses and cattle still fed peacefully beyond this desolated area the countryside was still standing but almost all the people had fled buffalo was on fire to an enormous extent and there were no signs of any efforts to grapple with the flames niagara city itself was being rapidly converted to the needs of a military depot a large number of skilled engineers had already been brought from the fleet and were busily at work adapting the exterior industrial apparatus of the place to the purposes of an aeronautic park they had made a gas recharging station at the corner of the american fall above the funicular railway and they were opening up a much larger area to the south for the same purpose over the powerhouses and hotels and suchlike prominent or important points the german flag was flying  the zeppelin circled slowly over this scene twice while the prince surveyed it from the swinging gallery it then rose towards the centre of the crescent and transferred the prince and his suite kurt included to the hohenzollern which had been chosen as the flagship during the impending battle they were swung up on a small cable from the forward gallery and the men of the zeppelin manned the outer netting as the prince and his staff left them the zeppelin then came about circled down and grounded in prospect park in order to land the wounded and take aboard explosives for she had come to labrador with her magazines empty it being uncertain what weight she might need to carry she also replenished the hydrogen in one of her forward chambers which had leaked  bert was detailed as a bearer and helped carry the wounded one by one into the nearest of the large hotels that faced the canadian shore the hotel was quite empty except that there were two trained american nurses and a negro porter and three or four germans awaiting them bert went with the zeppelins doctor into the main street of the place and they broke into a drug shop and obtained various things of which they stood in need as they returned they found an officer and two men making a rough inventory of the available material in the various stores except for them the wide main street of the town was quite deserted the people had been given three hours to clear out and everybody it seemed had done so at one corner a dead man lay against the wallshot two or three dogs were visible up the empty vista but towards its river end the passage of a string of monorail cars broke the stillness and the silence they were loaded with hose and were passing to the trainful of workers who were converting prospect park into an airship dock  bert pushed a case of medicine balanced on a bicycle taken from an adjacent shop to the hotel and then he was sent to load bombs into the zeppelin magazine a duty that called for elaborate care from this job he was presently called off by the captain of the zeppelin who sent him with a note to the officer in charge of the angloamerican power company for the field telephone had still to be adjusted bert received his instructions in german whose meaning he guessed and saluted and took the note not caring to betray his ignorance of the language he started off with a bright air of knowing his way and turned a corner or so and was only beginning to suspect that he did not know where he was going when his attention was recalled to the sky by the report of a gun from the hohenzollern and celestial cheering  he looked up and found the view obstructed by the houses on either side of the street he hesitated and then curiosity took him back towards the bank of the river here his view was inconvenienced by trees and it was with a start that he discovered the zeppelin which he knew had still a quarter of her magazines to fill was rising over goat island she had not waited for her complement of ammunition it occurred to him that he was left behind he ducked back among the trees and bushes until he felt secure from any afterthought on the part of the zeppelins captain then his curiosity to see what the german airfleet faced overcame him and drew him at last halfway across the bridge to goat island  from that point he had nearly a hemisphere of sky and got his first glimpse of the asiatic airships low in the sky above the glittering tumults of the upper rapids  they were far less impressive than the german ships he could not judge the distance and they flew edgeways to him so as to conceal the broader aspect of their bulk  bert stood there in the middle of the bridge in a place that most people who knew it remembered as a place populous with sightseers and excursionists and he was the only human being in sight there above him very high in the heavens the contending airfleets manoeuvred below him the river seethed like a sluice towards the american fall he was curiously dressed his cheap blue serge trousers were thrust into german airship rubber boots and on his head he wore an aeronauts white cap that was a trifle too large for him he thrust that back to reveal his staring little cockney face still scarred upon the brow gaw he whispered  he stared he gesticulated once or twice he shouted and applauded  then at a certain point terror seized him and he took to his heels in the direction of goat island  4  for a time after they were in sight of each other neither fleet attempted to engage the germans numbered sixtyseven great airships and they maintained the crescent formation at a height of nearly four thousand feet they kept a distance of about one and a half lengths so that the horns of the crescent were nearly thirty miles apart closely in tow of the airships of the extreme squadrons on either wing were about thirty drachenflieger ready manned but these were too small and distant for bert to distinguish  at first only what was called the southern fleet of the asiatics was visible to him it consisted of forty airships carrying all together nearly four hundred oneman flyingmachines upon their flanks and for some time it flew slowly and at a minimum distance of perhaps a dozen miles from the germans eastward across their front at first bert could distinguish only the greater bulks then he perceived the oneman machines as a multitude of very small objects drifting like motes in the sunshine about and beneath the larger shapes  bert saw nothing then of the second fleet of the asiatics though probably that was coming into sight of the germans at the time in the northwest  the air was very still the sky almost without a cloud and the german fleet had risen to an immense height so that the airships seemed no longer of any considerable size both ends of their crescent showed plainly as they beat southward they passed slowly between bert and the sunlight and became black outlines of themselves the drachenflieger appeared as little flecks of black on either wing of this aerial armada  the two fleets seemed in no hurry to engage the asiatics went far away into the east quickening their pace and rising as they did so and then tailed out into a long column and came flying back rising towards the german left the squadrons of the latter came about facing this oblique advance and suddenly little flickerings and a faint crepitating sound told that they had opened fire for a time no effect was visible to the watcher on the bridge then like a handful of snowflakes the drachenflieger swooped to the attack and a multitude of red specks whirled up to meet them it was to berts sense not only enormously remote but singularly inhuman not four hours since he had been on one of those very airships and yet they seemed to him now not gasbags carrying men but strange sentient creatures that moved about and did things with a purpose of their own the flight of the asiatic and german flyingmachines joined and dropped earthward became like a handful of white and red rose petals flung from a distant window grew larger until bert could see the overturned ones spinning through the air and were hidden by great volumes of dark smoke that were rising in the direction of buffalo for a time they all were hidden then two or three white and a number of red ones rose again into the sky like a swarm of big butterflies and circled fighting and drove away out of sight again towards the east  a heavy report recalled berts eyes to the zenith and behold the great crescent had lost its dressing and burst into a disorderly long cloud of airships one had dropped halfway down the sky it was flaming fore and aft and even as bert looked it turned over and fell spinning over and over itself and vanished into the smoke of buffalo  berts mouth opened and shut and he clutched tighter on the rail of the bridge for some momentsthey seemed long momentsthe two fleets remained without any further change flying obliquely towards each other and making what came to berts ears as a midget uproar then suddenly from either side airships began dropping out of alignment smitten by missiles he could neither see nor trace the string of asiatic ships swung round and either charged into or over it was difficult to say from below the shattered line of the germans who seemed to open out to give way to them some sort of manoeuvring began but bert could not grasp its import the left of the battle became a confused dance of airships for some minutes up there the two crossing lines of ships looked so close it seemed like a handtohand scuffle in the sky then they broke up into groups and duels the descent of german airships towards the lower sky increased one of them flared down and vanished far away in the north two dropped with something twisted and crippled in their movements then a group of antagonists came down from the zenith in an eddying conflict two asiatics against one german and were presently joined by another and drove away eastward all together with others dropping out of the german line to join them  one asiatic either rammed or collided with a still more gigantic german and the two went spinning to destruction together the northern squadron of asiatics came into the battle unnoted by bert except that the multitude of ships above seemed presently increased in a little while the fight was utter confusion drifting on the whole to the southwest against the wind it became more and more a series of group encounters here a huge german airship flamed earthward with a dozen flat asiatic craft about her crushing her every attempt to recover here another hung with its screw fighting off the swordsman from a swarm of flyingmachines here again an asiatic aflame at either end swooped out of the battle his attention went from incident to incident in the vast clearness overhead these conspicuous cases of destruction caught and held his mind it was only very slowly that any sort of scheme manifested itself between those nearer more striking episodes  the mass of the airships that eddied remotely above was however neither destroying nor destroyed the majority of them seemed to be going at full speed and circling upward for position exchanging ineffectual shots as they did so very little ramming was essayed after the first tragic downfall of rammer and rammed and what ever attempts at boarding were made were invisible to bert there seemed however a steady attempt to isolate antagonists to cut them off from their fellows and bear them down causing a perpetual sailing back and interlacing of these shoaling bulks the greater numbers of the asiatics and their swifter heeling movements gave them the effect of persistently attacking the germans overhead and evidently endeavouring to keep itself in touch with the works of niagara a body of german airships drew itself together into a compact phalanx and the asiatics became more and more intent upon breaking this up he was grotesquely reminded of fish in a fishpond struggling for crumbs he could see puny puffs of smoke and the flash of bombs but never a sound came down to him  a flapping shadow passed for a moment between bert and the sun and was followed by another a whirring of engines click clock clitter clock smote upon his ears instantly he forgot the zenith  perhaps a hundred yards above the water out of the south riding like valkyries swiftly through the air on the strange steeds the engineering of europe had begotten upon the artistic inspiration of japan came a long string of asiatic swordsman the wings flapped jerkily click block clitter clock and the machines drove up they spread and ceased and the apparatus came soaring through the air so they rose and fell and rose again they passed so closely overhead that bert could hear their voices calling to one another they swooped towards niagara city and landed one after another in a long line in a clear space before the hotel but he did not stay to watch them land one yellow face had craned over and looked at him and for one enigmatical instant met his eyes  it was then the idea came to bert that he was altogether too conspicuous in the middle of the bridge and that he took to his heels towards goat island thence dodging about among the trees with perhaps an excessive selfconsciousness he watched the rest of the struggle  5  when berts sense of security was sufficiently restored for him to watch the battle again he perceived that a brisk little fight was in progress between the asiatic aeronauts and the german engineers for the possession of niagara city it was the first time in the whole course of the war that he had seen anything resembling fighting as he had studied it in the illustrated papers of his youth it seemed to him almost as though things were coming right he saw men carrying rifles and taking cover and running briskly from point to point in a loose attacking formation the first batch of aeronauts had probably been under the impression that the city was deserted they had grounded in the open near prospect park and approached the houses towards the powerworks before they were disillusioned by a sudden fire they had scattered back to the cover of a bank near the waterit was too far for them to reach their machines again they were lying and firing at the men in the hotels and framehouses about the powerworks  then to their support came a second string of red flyingmachines driving up from the east they rose up out of the haze above the houses and came round in a long curve as if surveying the position below the fire of the germans rose to a roar and one of those soaring shapes gave an abrupt jerk backward and fell among the houses the others swooped down exactly like great birds upon the roof of the powerhouse they caught upon it and from each sprang a nimble little figure and ran towards the parapet  other flapping birdshapes came into this affair but bert had not seen their coming a staccato of shots came over to him reminding him of army manoeuvres of newspaper descriptions of fights of all that was entirely correct in his conception of warfare he saw quite a number of germans running from the outlying houses towards the powerhouse two fell one lay still but the other wriggled and made efforts for a time the hotel that was used as a hospital and to which he had helped carry the wounded men from the zeppelin earlier in the day suddenly ran up the geneva flag the town that had seemed so quiet had evidently been concealing a considerable number of germans and they were now concentrating to hold the central powerhouse he wondered what ammunition they might have more and more of the asiatic flyingmachines came into the conflict they had disposed of the unfortunate german drachenflieger and were now aiming at the incipient aeronautic parkthe electric gas generators and repair stations which formed the german base some landed and their aeronauts took cover and became energetic infantry soldiers others hovered above the fight their men ever and again firing shots down at some chance exposure below the firing came in paroxysms now there would be a watchful lull and now a rapid tattoo of shots rising to a roar once or twice flying machines as they circled warily came right overhead and for a time bert gave himself body and soul to cowering  ever and again a larger thunder mingled with the rattle and reminded him of the grapple of airships far above but the nearer fight held his attention  abruptly something dropped from the zenith something like a barrel or a huge football  crash it smashed with an immense report it had fallen among the grounded asiatic aeroplanes that lay among the turf and flowerbeds near the river they flew in scraps and fragments turf trees and gravel leapt and fell the aeronauts still lying along the canal bank were thrown about like sacks catspaws flew across the foaming water all the windows of the hotel hospital that had been shiningly reflecting blue sky and airships the moment before became vast black stars banga second followed bert looked up and was filled with a sense of a number of monstrous bodies swooping down coming down on the whole affair like a flight of bellying blankets like a string of vast dishcovers the central tangle of the battle above was circling down as if to come into touch with the powerhouse fight he got a new effect of airships altogether as vast things coming down upon him growing swiftly larger and larger and more overwhelming until the houses over the way seemed small the american rapids narrow the bridge flimsy the combatants infinitesimal as they came down they became audible as a complex of shootings and vast creakings and groanings and beatings and throbbings and shouts and shots the foreshortened black eagles at the foreends of the germans had an effect of actual combat of flying feathers  some of these fighting airships came within five hundred feet of the ground bert could see men on the lower galleries of the germans firing rifles could see asiatics clinging to the ropes saw one man in aluminium divers gear fall flashing headlong into the waters above goat island for the first time he saw the asiatic airships closely from this aspect they reminded him more than anything else of colossal snowshoes they had a curious patterning in black and white in forms that reminded him of the engineturned cover of a watch they had no hanging galleries but from little openings on the middle line peeped out men and the muzzles of guns so driving in long descending and ascending curves these monsters wrestled and fought it was like clouds fighting like puddings trying to assassinate each other they whirled and circled about each other and for a time threw goat island and niagara into a smoky twilight through which the sunlight smote in shafts and beams they spread and closed and spread and grappled and drove round over the rapids and two miles away or more into canada and back over the falls again a german caught fire and the whole crowd broke away from her flare and rose about her dispersing leaving her to drop towards canada and blow up as she dropped then with renewed uproar the others closed again once from the men in niagara city came a sound like an anthill cheering another german burnt and one badly deflated by the prow of an antagonist flopped out of action southward  it became more and more evident that the germans were getting the worst of the unequal fight more and more obviously were they being persecuted less and less did they seem to fight with any object other than escape the asiatics swept by them and above them ripped their bladders set them alight picked off their dimly seen men in diving clothes who struggled against fire and tear with fire extinguishers and silk ribbons in the inner netting they answered only with ineffectual shots thence the battle circled back over niagara and then suddenly the germans as if at a preconcerted signal broke and dispersed going east west north and south in open and confused flight the asiatics as they realised this rose to fly above them and after them only one little knot of four germans and perhaps a dozen asiatics remained fighting about the hohenzollern and the prince as he circled in a last attempt to save niagara  round they swooped once again over the canadian fall over the waste of waters eastward until they were distant and small and then round and back hurrying bounding swooping towards the one gaping spectator  the whole struggling mass approached very swiftly growing rapidly larger and coming out black and featureless against the afternoon sun and above the blinding welter of the upper rapids it grew like a storm cloud until once more it darkened the sky the flat asiatic airships kept high above the germans and behind them and fired unanswered bullets into their gaschambers and upon their flanksthe oneman flyingmachines hovered and alighted like a swarm of attacking bees nearer they came and nearer filling the lower heaven two of the germans swooped and rose again but the hohenzollern had suffered too much for that she lifted weakly turned sharply as if to get out of the battle burst into flames fore and aft swept down to the water splashed into it obliquely and rolled over and over and came down stream rolling and smashing and writhing like a thing alive halting and then coming on again with her torn and bent propeller still beating the air the bursting flames spluttered out again in clouds of steam it was a disaster gigantic in its dimensions she lay across the rapids like an island like tall cliffs tall cliffs that came rolling smoking and crumpling and collapsing advancing with a sort of fluctuating rapidity upon bert one asiatic airshipit looked to bert from below like three hundred yards of pavementwhirled back and circled two or three times over that great overthrow and half a dozen crimson flyingmachines danced for a moment like great midges in the sunlight before they swept on after their fellows the rest of the fight had already gone over the island a wild crescendo of shots and yells and smashing uproar it was hidden from bert now by the trees of the island and forgotten by him in the nearer spectacle of the huge advance of the defeated german airship something fell with a mighty smashing and splintering of boughs unheeded behind him  it seemed for a time that the hohenzollern must needs break her back upon the parting of the waters and then for a time her propeller flopped and frothed in the river and thrust the mass of buckling crumpled wreckage towards the american shore then the sweep of the torrent that foamed down to the american fall caught her and in another minute the immense mass of deflating wreckage with flames spurting out in three new places had crashed against the bridge that joined goat island and niagara city and forced a long arm as it were in a heaving tangle under the central span then the middle chambers blew up with a loud report and in another moment the bridge had given way and the main bulk of the airship like some grotesque cripple in rags staggered flapping and waving flambeaux to the crest of the fall and hesitated there and vanished in a desperate suicidal leap  its detached foreend remained jammed against that little island green island it used to be called which forms the steppingstone between the mainland and goat islands patch of trees  bert followed this disaster from the parting of the waters to the bridge head then regardless of cover regardless of the asiatic airship hovering like a huge house roof without walls above the suspension bridge he sprinted along towards the north and came out for the first time upon that rocky point by luna island that looks sheer down upon the american fall there he stood breathless amidst that eternal rush of sound breathless and staring  far below and travelling rapidly down the gorge whirled something like a huge empty sack for him it meantwhat did it not meanthe german airfleet kurt the prince europe all things stable and familiar the forces that had brought him the forces that had seemed indisputably victorious and it went down the rapids like an empty sack and left the visible world to asia to yellow people beyond christendom to all that was terrible and strange  remote over canada receded the rest of that conflict and vanished beyond the range of his vision    chapter ix on goat island  1  the whack of a bullet on the rocks beside him reminded him that he was a visible object and wearing at least portions of a german uniform it drove him into the trees again and for a time he dodged and dropped and sought cover like a chick hiding among reeds from imaginary hawks  beaten he whispered beaten and done for chinese yellow chaps chasing em  at last he came to rest in a clump of bushes near a lockedup and deserted refreshment shed within view of the american side they made a sort of hole and harbour for him they met completely overhead he looked across the rapids but the firing had ceased now altogether and everything seemed quiet the asiatic aeroplane had moved from its former position above the suspension bridge was motionless now above niagara city shadowing all that district about the powerhouse which had been the scene of the land fight the monster had an air of quiet and assured predominance and from its stern it trailed serene and ornamental a long streaming flag the red black and yellow of the great alliance the sunrise and the dragon beyond to the east at a much higher level hung a second consort and bert presently gathering courage wriggled out and craned his neck to find another still airship against the sunset in the south  gaw he said beaten and chased my gawd  the fighting it seemed at first was quite over in niagara city though a german flag was still flying from one shattered house a white sheet was hoisted above the powerhouse and this remained flying all through the events that followed but presently came a sound of shots and then german soldiers running they disappeared among the houses and then came two engineers in blue shirts and trousers hotly pursued by three japanese swordsman the foremost of the two fugitives was a shapely man and ran lightly and well the second was a sturdy little man and rather fat he ran comically in leaps and bounds with his plump arms bent up by his side and his head thrown back the pursuers ran with uniforms and dark thin metal and leather headdresses the little man stumbled and bert gasped realising a new horror in war  the foremost swordsman won three strides on him and was near enough to slash at him and miss as he spurted  a dozen yards they ran and then the swordsman slashed again and bert could hear across the waters a little sound like the moo of an elfin cow as the fat little man fell forward slash went the swordsman and slash at something on the ground that tried to save itself with ineffectual hands oh i carnt cried bert near blubbering and staring with starting eyes  the swordsman slashed a fourth time and went on as his fellows came up after the better runner the hindmost swordsman stopped and turned back he had perceived some movement perhaps but at any rate he stood and ever and again slashed at the fallen body  oooo groaned bert at every slash and shrank closer into the bushes and became very still presently came a sound of shots from the town and then everything was quiet everything even the hospital  he saw presently little figures sheathing swords come out from the houses and walk to the debris of the flyingmachines the bomb had destroyed others appeared wheeling undamaged aeroplanes upon their wheels as men might wheel bicycles and sprang into the saddles and flapped into the air a string of three airships appeared far away in the east and flew towards the zenith the one that hung low above niagara city came still lower and dropped a rope ladder to pick up men from the powerhouse  for a long time he watched the further happenings in niagara city as a rabbit might watch a meet he saw men going from building to building to set fire to them as he presently realised and he heard a series of dull detonations from the wheel pit of the powerhouse some similar business went on among the works on the canadian side meanwhile more and more airships appeared and many more flyingmachines until at last it seemed to him nearly a third of the asiatic fleet had reassembled he watched them from his bush cramped but immovable watched them gather and range themselves and signal and pick up men until at last they sailed away towards the glowing sunset going to the great asiatic rendezvous above the oil wells of cleveland they dwindled and passed away leaving him alone so far as he could tell the only living man in a world of ruin and strange loneliness almost beyond describing he watched them recede and vanish he stood gaping after them  gaw he said at last like one who rouses himself from a trance  it was far more than any personal desolation extremity that flooded his soul it seemed to him indeed that this must be the sunset of his race  2  he did not at first envisage his own plight in definite and comprehensible terms things happened to him so much of late his own efforts had counted for so little that he had become passive and planless his last scheme had been to go round the coast of england as a desert dervish giving refined entertainment to his fellowcreatures fate had quashed that fate had seen fit to direct him to other destinies had hurried him from point to point and dropped him at last upon this little wedge of rock between the cataracts it did not instantly occur to him that now it was his turn to play he had a singular feeling that all must end as a dream ends that presently surely he would be back in the world of grubb and edna and bun hill that this roar this glittering presence of incessant water would be drawn aside as a curtain is drawn aside after a holiday lantern show and old familiar customary things reassume their sway it would be interesting to tell people how he had seen niagara and then kurts words came into his head people torn away from the people they care for homes smashed creatures full of life and memories and peculiar little giftstorn to pieces starved and spoilt  he wondered half incredulous if that was in deed true it was so hard to realise it out beyond there was it possible that tom and jessica were also in some dire extremity that the little greengrocers shop was no longer standing open with jessica serving respectfully warming toms ear in sharp asides or punctually sending out the goods  he tried to think what day of the week it was and found he had lost his reckoning perhaps it was sunday if so were they going to church or were they hiding perhaps in bushes what had happened to the landlord the butcher and to butteridge and all those people on dymchurch beach something he knew had happened to londona bombardment but who had bombarded were tom and jessica too being chased by strange brown men with long bare swords and evil eyes he thought of various possible aspects of affliction but presently one phase ousted all the others were they getting much to eat the question haunted him obsessed him  if one was very hungry would one eat rats  it dawned upon him that a peculiar misery that oppressed him was not so much anxiety and patriotic sorrow as hunger of course he was hungry  he reflected and turned his steps towards the little refreshment shed that stood near the end of the ruined bridge ought to be somethin  he strolled round it once or twice and then attacked the shutters with his pocketknife reinforced presently by a wooden stake he found conveniently near at last he got a shutter to give and tore it back and stuck in his head  grub he remarked anyhow leastways  he got at the inside fastening of the shutter and had presently this establishment open for his exploration he found several sealed bottles of sterilized milk much mineral water two tins of biscuits and a crock of very stale cakes cigarettes in great quantity but very dry some rather dry oranges nuts some tins of canned meat and fruit and plates and knives and forks and glasses sufficient for several score of people there was also a zinc locker but he was unable to negotiate the padlock of this  shant starve said bert for a bit anyhow he sat on the vendors seat and regaled himself with biscuits and milk and felt for a moment quite contented  quite restful he muttered munching and glancing about him restlessly after what i been through  crikey wot a day oh wot a day  wonder took possession of him gaw he cried wot a fight its been smashing up the poor fellers eadlong the airshipsthe fliers and all i wonder what happened to the zeppelin and that chap kurti wonder what happened to im e was a good sort of chap was kurt  some phantom of imperial solicitude floated through his mind injia he said  a more practical interest arose  i wonder if theres anything to open one of these tins of corned beef  3  after he had feasted bert lit a cigarette and sat meditative for a time wonder where grubb is he said i do wonder that wonder if any of em wonder about me  he reverted to his own circumstances dessay i shall ave to stop on this island for some time  he tried to feel at his ease and secure but presently the indefinable restlessness of the social animal in solitude distressed him he began to want to look over his shoulder and as a corrective roused himself to explore the rest of the island  it was only very slowly that he began to realise the peculiarities of his position to perceive that the breaking down of the arch between green island and the mainland had cut him off completely from the world indeed it was only when he came back to where the foreend of the hohenzollern lay like a stranded ship and was contemplating the shattered bridge that this dawned upon him even then it came with no sort of shock to his mind a fact among a number of other extraordinary and unmanageable facts he stared at the shattered cabins of the hohenzollern and its widows garment of dishevelled silk for a time but without any idea of its containing any living thing it was all so twisted and smashed and entirely upside down then for a while he gazed at the evening sky a cloud haze was now appearing and not an airship was in sight a swallow flew by and snapped some invisible victim like a dream he repeated  then for a time the rapids held his mind roaring it keeps on roaring and splashin always and always keeps on  at last his interests became personal wonder what i ought to do now  he reflected not an idee he said  he was chiefly conscious that a fortnight ago he had been in bun hill with no idea of travel in his mind and that now he was between the falls of niagara amidst the devastation and ruins of the greatest air fight in the world and that in the interval he had been across france belgium germany england ireland and a number of other countries it was an interesting thought and suitable for conversation but of no great practical utility wonder ow i can get orf this he said wonder if there is a way out if not rummy  further reflection decided i believe i got myself in a bit of a ole coming over that bridge  anyowgot me out of the way of them japanesy chaps wouldnt ave taken em long to cut my froat no still  he resolved to return to the point of luna island for a long time he stood without stirring scrutinising the canadian shore and the wreckage of hotels and houses and the fallen trees of the victoria park pink now in the light of sundown not a human being was perceptible in that scene of headlong destruction then he came back to the american side of the island crossed close to the crumpled aluminium wreckage of the hohenzollern to green islet and scrutinised the hopeless breach in the further bridge and the water that boiled beneath it towards buffalo there was still much smoke and near the position of the niagara railway station the houses were burning vigorously everything was deserted now everything was still one little abandoned thing lay on a transverse path between town and road a crumpled heap of clothes with sprawling limbs  ave a look round said bert and taking a path that ran through the middle of the island he presently discovered the wreckage of the two asiatic aeroplanes that had fallen out of the struggle that ended the hohenzollern  with the first he found the wreckage of an aeronaut too  the machine had evidently dropped vertically and was badly knocked about amidst a lot of smashed branches in a clump of trees its bent and broken wings and shattered stays sprawled amidst new splintered wood and its forepeak stuck into the ground the aeronaut dangled weirdly head downward among the leaves and branches some yards away and bert only discovered him as he turned from the aeroplane in the dusky evening light and stillnessfor the sun had gone now and the wind had altogether fallenthis inverted yellow face was anything but a tranquilising object to discover suddenly a couple of yards away a broken branch had run clean through the mans thorax and he hung so stabbed looking limp and absurd in his hand he still clutched with the grip of death a short light rifle  for some time bert stood very still inspecting this thing  then he began to walk away from it looking constantly back at it  presently in an open glade he came to a stop  gaw he whispered i don like dead bodies someow id almost rather that chap was alive  he would not go along the path athwart which the chinaman hung he felt he would rather not have trees round him any more and that it would be more comfortable to be quite close to the sociable splash and uproar of the rapids  he came upon the second aeroplane in a clear grassy space by the side of the streaming water and it seemed scarcely damaged at all it looked as though it had floated down into a position of rest it lay on its side with one wing in the air there was no aeronaut near it dead or alive there it lay abandoned with the water lapping about its long tail  bert remained a little aloof from it for a long time looking into the gathering shadows among the trees in the expectation of another chinaman alive or dead then very cautiously he approached the machine and stood regarding its widespread vans its big steering wheel and empty saddle he did not venture to touch it  i wish that other chap wasnt there he said i do wish e wasnt there  he saw a few yards away something bobbing about in an eddy that spun within a projecting head of rock as it went round it seemed to draw him unwillingly towards it  what could it be  blow said bert its another of em  it held him he told himself that it was the other aeronaut that had been shot in the fight and fallen out of the saddle as he strove to land he tried to go away and then it occurred to him that he might get a branch or something and push this rotating object out into the stream that would leave him with only one dead body to worry about perhaps he might get along with one he hesitated and then with a certain emotion forced himself to do this he went towards the bushes and cut himself a wand and returned to the rocks and clambered out to a corner between the eddy and the stream by that time the sunset was over and the bats were abroadand he was wet with perspiration  he prodded the floating blueclad thing with his wand failed tried again successfully as it came round and as it went out into the stream it turned over the light gleamed on golden hair andit was kurt  it was kurt white and dead and very calm there was no mistaking him there was still plenty of light for that the stream took him and he seemed to compose himself in its swift grip as one who stretches himself to rest whitefaced he was now and all the colour gone out of him  a feeling of infinite distress swept over bert as the body swept out of sight towards the fall kurt he cried kurt i didnt mean to kurt don leave me ere don leave me  loneliness and desolation overwhelmed him he gave way he stood on the rock in the evening light weeping and wailing passionately like a child it was as though some link that had held him to all these things had broken and gone he was afraid like a child in a lonely room shamelessly afraid  the twilight was closing about him the trees were full now of strange shadows all the things about him became strange and unfamiliar with that subtle queerness one feels oftenest in dreams o god i carn stand this he said and crept back from the rocks to the grass and crouched down and suddenly wild sorrow for the death of kurt kurt the brave kurt the kindly came to his help and he broke from whimpering to weeping he ceased to crouch he sprawled upon the grass and clenched an impotent fist  this war he cried this blarsted foolery of a war  o kurt lieutenant kurt  i done he said i done ive ad all i want and more than i want the worlds all rot and there aint no sense in it the nights coming if e comes after mee cant come after mee cant  if e comes after me ill fro myself into the water  presently he was talking again in a low undertone  there aint nothing to be afraid of reely its jest imagination poor old kurthe thought it would happen prevision like e never gave me that letter or tole me who the lady was its like what e saidpeople tore away from everything they belonged toeverywhere exactly like what e said ere i am cast awaythousands of miles from edna or grubb or any of my lotlike a plant tore up by the roots and every wars been like this only i adnt the sense to understand it always all sorts of oles and corners chaps ave died in and people adnt the sense to understand adnt the sense to feel it and stop it thought war was fine my gawd  dear old edna she was a fair bit of all rightshe was that time we ad a boat at kingston  i betill see er again yet wont be my fault if i dont  4  suddenly on the very verge of this heroic resolution bert became rigid with terror something was creeping towards him through the grass something was creeping and halting and creeping again towards him through the dim dark grass the night was electrical with horror for a time everything was still bert ceased to breathe it could not be no it was too small  it advanced suddenly upon him with a rush with a little meawling cry and tail erect it rubbed its head against him and purred it was a tiny skinny little kitten  gaw pussy ow you frightened me said bert with drops of perspiration on his brow  5  he sat with his back to a tree stump all that night holding the kitten in his arms his mind was tired and he talked or thought coherently no longer towards dawn he dozed  when he awoke he was stiff but in better heart and the kitten slept warmly and reassuringly inside his jacket and fear he found had gone from amidst the trees  he stroked the kitten and the little creature woke up to excessive fondness and purring you want some milk said bert thats what you want and i could do with a bit of brekker too  he yawned and stood up with the kitten on his shoulder and stared about him recalling the circumstances of the previous day the grey immense happenings  mus do something he said  he turned towards the trees and was presently contemplating the dead aeronaut again the kitten he held companionably against his neck the body was horrible but not nearly so horrible as it had been at twilight and now the limbs were limper and the gun had slipped to the ground and lay half hidden in the grass  i suppose we ought to bury im kitty said bert and looked helplessly at the rocky soil about him we got to stay on the island with im  it was some time before he could turn away and go on towards that provision shed brekker first he said anyhow stroking the kitten on his shoulder she rubbed his cheek affectionately with her furry little face and presently nibbled at his ear wan some milk eh he said and turned his back on the dead man as though he mattered nothing  he was puzzled to find the door of the shed open though he had closed and latched it very carefully overnight and he found also some dirty plates he had not noticed before on the bench he discovered that the hinges of the tin locker were unscrewed and that it could be opened he had not observed this overnight  silly of me said bert ere i was puzzlin and whackin away at the padlock never noticing it had been used apparently as an icechest but it contained nothing now but the remains of halfdozen boiled chickens some ambiguous substance that might once have been butter and a singularly unappetising smell he closed the lid again carefully  he gave the kitten some milk in a dirty plate and sat watching its busy little tongue for a time then he was moved to make an inventory of the provisions there were six bottles of milk unopened and one opened sixty bottles of mineral water and a large stock of syrups about two thousand cigarettes and upwards of a hundred cigars nine oranges two unopened tins of corned beef and one opened and five large tins california peaches he jotted it down on a piece of paper aint much solid food he said stilla fortnight say  anything might happen in a fortnight  he gave the kitten a small second helping and a scrap of beef and then went down with the little creature running after him tail erect and in high spirits to look at the remains of the hohenzollern  it had shifted in the night and seemed on the whole more firmly grounded on green island than before from it his eye went to the shattered bridge and then across to the still desolation of niagara city nothing moved over there but a number of crows they were busy with the engineer he had seen cut down on the previous day he saw no dogs but he heard one howling  we got to get out of this someow kitty he said that milk wont last forevernot at the rate you lap it  he regarded the sluicelike flood before him  plenty of water he said wont be drink we shall want  he decided to make a careful exploration of the island presently he came to a locked gate labelled biddle stairs and clambered over to discover a steep old wooden staircase leading down the face of the cliff amidst a vast and increasing uproar of waters he left the kitten above and descended these and discovered with a thrill of hope a path leading among the rocks at the foot of the roaring downrush of the centre fall perhaps this was a sort of way  it led him only to the choking and deafening experience of the cave of the winds and after he had spent a quarter of an hour in a partially stupefied condition flattened between solid rock and nearly as solid waterfall he decided that this was after all no practicable route to canada and retraced his steps as he reascended the biddle stairs he heard what he decided at last must be a sort of echo a sound of some one walking about on the gravel paths above when he got to the top the place was as solitary as before  thence he made his way with the kitten skirmishing along beside him in the grass to a staircase that led to a lump of projecting rock that enfiladed the huge green majesty of the horseshoe fall he stood there for some time in silence  you wouldnt think he said at last there was so much water this roarin and splashin it gets on ones nerves at last sounds like people talking sounds like people going about sounds like anything you fancy  he retired up the staircase again i spose i shall keep on goin round this blessed island he said drearily round and round and round  he found himself presently beside the less damaged asiatic aeroplane again he stared at it and the kitten smelt it broke he said  he looked up with a convulsive start  advancing slowly towards him out from among the trees were two tall gaunt figures they were blackened and tattered and bandaged the hindmost one limped and had his head swathed in white but the foremost one still carried himself as a prince should do for all that his left arm was in a sling and one side of his face scalded a livid crimson he was the prince karl albert the war lord the german alexander and the man behind him was the birdfaced man whose cabin had once been taken from him and given to bert  6  with that apparition began a new phase of goat island in berts experience he ceased to be a solitary representative of humanity in a vast and violent and incomprehensible universe and became once more a social creature a man in a world of other men for an instant these two were terrible then they seemed sweet and desirable as brothers they too were in this scrape with him marooned and puzzled he wanted extremely to hear exactly what had happened to them what mattered it if one was a prince and both were foreign soldiers if neither perhaps had adequate english his native cockney freedom flowed too generously for him to think of that and surely the asiatic fleets had purged all such trivial differences ullo he said ow did you get ere  it is the englishman who brought us the butteridge machine said the birdfaced officer in german and then in a tone of horror as bert advanced salute and again louder salute  gaw said bert and stopped with a second comment under his breath he stared and saluted awkwardly and became at once a masked defensive thing with whom cooperation was impossible  for a time these two perfected modern aristocrats stood regarding the difficult problem of the anglosaxon citizen that ambiguous citizen who obeying some mysterious law in his blood would neither drill nor be a democrat bert was by no means a beautiful object but in some inexplicable way he looked resistant he wore his cheap suit of serge now showing many signs of wear and its loose fit made him seem sturdier than he was above his disengaging face was a white german cap that was altogether too big for him and his trousers were crumpled up his legs and their ends tucked into the rubber highlows of a deceased german aeronaut he looked an inferior though by no means an easy inferior and instinctively they hated him  the prince pointed to the flyingmachine and said something in broken english that bert took for german and failed to understand he intimated as much  dummer kerl said the birdfaced officer from among his bandages  the prince pointed again with his undamaged hand you verstehen dis drachenflieger  bert began to comprehend the situation he regarded the asiatic machine the habits of bun hill returned to him its a foreign make he said ambiguously  the two germans consulted you are an expert said the prince  we reckon to repair said bert in the exact manner of grubb  the prince sought in his vocabulary is dat he said goot to fly  bert reflected and scratched his cheek slowly i got to look at it he replied its ad rough usage  he made a sound with his teeth he had also acquired from grubb put his hands in his trouser pockets and strolled back to the machine typically grubb chewed something but bert could chew only imaginatively three days work in this he said teething for the first time it dawned on him that there were possibilities in this machine it was evident that the wing that lay on the ground was badly damaged the three stays that held it rigid had snapped across a ridge of rock and there was also a strong possibility of the engine being badly damaged the wing hook on that side was also askew but probably that would not affect the flight beyond that there probably wasnt much the matter bert scratched his cheek again and contemplated the broad sunlit waste of the upper rapids we might make a job of this you leave it to me  he surveyed it intently again and the prince and his officer watched him in bun hill bert and grubb had developed to a very high pitch among the hiring stock a method of repair by substituting they substituted bits of other machines a machine that was too utterly and obviously done for even to proffer for hire had nevertheless still capital value it became a sort of quarry for nuts and screws and wheels bars and spokes chainlinks and the like a mine of illfitting parts to replace the defects of machines still current and back among the trees was a second asiatic aeroplane  the kitten caressed berts airship boots unheeded  mend dat drachenflieger said the prince  if i do mend it said bert struck by a new thought none of us aint to be trusted to fly it  i vill fly it said the prince  very likely break your neck said bert after a pause  the prince did not understand him and disregarded what he said he pointed his gloved finger to the machine and turned to the birdfaced officer with some remark in german the officer answered and the prince responded with a sweeping gesture towards the sky then he spokeit seemed eloquently bert watched him and guessed his meaning much more likely to break your neck he said owever ere goes  he began to pry about the saddle and engine of the drachenflieger in search for tools also he wanted some black oily stuff for his hands and face for the first rule in the art of repairing as it was known to the firm of grubb and smallways was to get your hands and face thoroughly and conclusively blackened also he took off his jacket and waistcoat and put his cap carefully to the back of his head in order to facilitate scratching  the prince and the officer seemed disposed to watch him but he succeeded in making it clear to them that this would inconvenience him and that he had to puzzle out a bit before he could get to work they thought him over but his shop experience had given him something of the authoritative way of the expert with common men and at last they went away thereupon he went straight to the second aeroplane got the aeronauts gun and ammunition and hid them in a clump of nettles close at hand thats all right said bert and then proceeded to a careful inspection of the debris of the wings in the trees then he went back to the first aeroplane to compare the two the bun hill method was quite possibly practicable if there was nothing hopeless or incomprehensible in the engine  the germans returned presently to find him already generously smutty and touching and testing knobs and screws and levers with an expression of profound sagacity when the birdfaced officer addressed a remark to him he waved him aside with nong comprong shut it its no good  then he had an idea dead chap back there wants burying he said jerking a thumb over his shoulder  7  with the appearance of these two men berts whole universe had changed again a curtain fell before the immense and terrible desolation that had overwhelmed him he was in a world of three people a minute human world that nevertheless filled his brain with eager speculations and schemes and cunning ideas what were they thinking of what did they think of him what did they mean to do a hundred busy threads interlaced in his mind as he pottered studiously over the asiatic aeroplane new ideas came up like bubbles in soda water  gaw he said suddenly he had just appreciated as a special aspect of this irrational injustice of fate that these two men were alive and that kurt was dead all the crew of the hohenzollern were shot or burnt or smashed or drowned and these two lurking in the padded forward cabin had escaped  i suppose e thinks its is bloomin star he muttered and found himself uncontrollably exasperated  he stood up facing round to the two men they were standing side by side regarding him  its no good he said starin at me you only put me out and then seeing they did not understand he advanced towards them wrench in hand it occurred to him as he did so that the prince was really a very big and powerful and serenelooking person but he said nevertheless pointing through the trees dead man  the birdfaced man intervened with a reply in german  dead man said bert to him there  he had great difficulty in inducing them to inspect the dead chinaman and at last led them to him then they made it evident that they proposed that he as a common person below the rank of officer should have the sole and undivided privilege of disposing of the body by dragging it to the waters edge there was some heated gesticulation and at last the birdfaced officer abased himself to help together they dragged the limp and now swollen asiatic through the trees and after a rest or sofor he trailed very heavilydumped him into the westward rapid bert returned to his expert investigation of the flyingmachine at last with aching arms and in a state of gloomy rebellion brasted cheek he said oned think i was one of is beastly german slaves  prancing beggar  and then he fell speculating what would happen when the flyingmachine was repairedif it could be repaired  the two germans went away again and after some reflection bert removed several nuts resumed his jacket and vest pocketed those nuts and his tools and hid the set of tools from the second aeroplane in the fork of a tree right o he said as he jumped down after the last of these precautions the prince and his companion reappeared as he returned to the machine by the waters edge the prince surveyed his progress for a time and then went towards the parting of the waters and stood with folded arms gazing upstream in profound thought the birdfaced officer came up to bert heavy with a sentence in english  go he said with a helping gesture und eat  when bert got to the refreshment shed he found all the food had vanished except one measured ration of corned beef and three biscuits  he regarded this with open eyes and mouth  the kitten appeared from under the vendors seat with an ingratiating purr of course said bert why wheres your milk  he accumulated wrath for a moment or so then seized the plate in one hand and the biscuits in another and went in search of the prince breathing vile words anent grub and his intimate interior he approached without saluting  ere he said fiercely whad the devils this  an entirely unsatisfactory altercation followed bert expounded the bun hill theory of the relations of grub to efficiency in english the birdfaced man replied with points about nations and discipline in german the prince having made an estimate of berts quality and physique suddenly hectored he gripped bert by the shoulder and shook him making his pockets rattle shouted something to him and flung him struggling back he hit him as though he was a german private bert went back white and scared but resolved by all his cockney standards upon one thing he was bound in honour to go for the prince gaw he gasped buttoning his jacket  now cried the prince vil you go and then catching the heroic gleam in berts eye drew his sword  the birdfaced officer intervened saying something in german and pointing skyward  far away in the southwest appeared a japanese airship coming fast toward them their conflict ended at that the prince was first to grasp the situation and lead the retreat all three scuttled like rabbits for the trees and ran to and for cover until they found a hollow in which the grass grew rank there they all squatted within six yards of one another they sat in this place for a long time up to their necks in the grass and watching through the branches for the airship bert had dropped some of his corned beef but he found the biscuits in his hand and ate them quietly the monster came nearly overhead and then went away to niagara and dropped beyond the powerworks when it was near they all kept silence and then presently they fell into an argument that was robbed perhaps of immediate explosive effect only by their failure to understand one another  it was bert began the talking and he talked on regardless of what they understood or failed to understand but his voice must have conveyed his cantankerous intentions  you want that machine done he said first you better keep your ands off me  they disregarded that and he repeated it  then he expanded his idea and the spirit of speech took hold of him you think you got old of a chap you can kick and it like you do your private soldiersyoure jolly well mistaken see ive ad about enough of you and your antics i been thinking you over you and your war and your empire and all the rot of it rot it is its you germans made all the trouble in europe first and last and all for nothin jest silly prancing jest because youve got the uniforms and flags ere i wasi didnt want to ave anything to do with you i jest didnt care a eng at all about you then you get old of mesteal me practicallyand ere i am thousands of miles away from ome and everything and all your silly fleet smashed up to rags and you want to go on prancin now not if i know it  look at the mischief you done look at the way you smashed up new yorkthe people you killed the stuff you wasted cant you learn  dummer kerl said the birdfaced man suddenly in a tone of concentrated malignancy glaring under his bandages esel  thats german for silly assi know but whos the silly assim or me when i was a kid i used to read penny dreadfuls about avin adventures and bein a great cmander and all that rot i stowed it but whats e got in is head rot about napoleon rot about alexander rot about is blessed family and im and gord and david and all that any one who wasnt a dressedup silly fool of a prince could ave told all this was goin to appen there was us in europe all at sixes and sevens with our silly flags and our silly newspapers raggin us up against each other and keepin us apart and there was china solid as a cheese with millions and millions of men only wantin a bit of science and a bit of enterprise to be as good as all of us you thought they couldnt get at you and then they got flyingmachines and bifere we are why when they didnt go on making guns and armies in china we went and poked em up until they did they ad to give us this lickin theyve give us we wouldnt be happy until they did and as i say ere we are  the birdfaced officer shouted to him to be quiet and then began a conversation with the prince  british citizen said bert you aint obliged to listen but i aint obliged to shut up  and for some time he continued his dissertation upon imperialism militarism and international politics but their talking put him out and for a time he was certainly merely repeating abusive terms prancin nincompoops and the like old terms and new then suddenly he remembered his essential grievance owever look ereerethe thing i started this talk about is wheres that food there was in that shed thats what i want to know where you put it  he paused they went on talking in german he repeated his question they disregarded him he asked a third time in a manner insupportably aggressive  there fell a tense silence for some seconds the three regarded one another the prince eyed bert steadfastly and bert quailed under his eye slowly the prince rose to his feet and the birdfaced officer jerked up beside him bert remained squatting  be quaiat said the prince  bert perceived this was no moment for eloquence  the two germans regarded him as he crouched there death for a moment seemed near  then the prince turned away and the two of them went towards the flyingmachine  gaw whispered bert and then uttered under his breath one single word of abuse he sat crouched together for perhaps three minutes then he sprang to his feet and went off towards the chinese aeronauts gun hidden among the weeds  8  there was no pretence after that moment that bert was under the orders of the prince or that he was going on with the repairing of the flyingmachine the two germans took possession of that and set to work upon it bert with his new weapon went off to the neighbourhood of terrapin rock and there sat down to examine it it was a short rifle with a big cartridge and a nearly full magazine he took out the cartridges carefully and then tried the trigger and fittings until he felt sure he had the use of it he reloaded carefully then he remembered he was hungry and went off gun under his arm to hunt in and about the refreshment shed he had the sense to perceive that he must not show himself with the gun to the prince and his companion so long as they thought him unarmed they would leave him alone but there was no knowing what the napoleonic person might do if he saw berts weapon also he did not go near them because he knew that within himself boiled a reservoir of rage and fear that he wanted to shoot these two men he wanted to shoot them and he thought that to shoot them would be a quite horrible thing to do the two sides of his inconsistent civilisation warred within him  near the shed the kitten turned up again obviously keen for milk this greatly enhanced his own angry sense of hunger he began to talk as he hunted about and presently stood still shouting insults he talked of war and pride and imperialism any other prince but you would have died with his men and his ship he cried  the two germans at the machine heard his voice going ever and again amidst the clamour of the waters their eyes met and they smiled slightly  he was disposed for a time to sit in the refreshment shed waiting for them but then it occurred to him that so he might get them both at close quarters he strolled off presently to the point of luna island to think the situation out  it had seemed a comparatively simple one at first but as he turned it over in his mind its possibilities increased and multiplied both these men had swordshad either a revolver  also if he shot them both he might never find the food  so far he had been going about with this gun under his arm and a sense of lordly security in his mind but what if they saw the gun and decided to ambush him goat island is nearly all cover trees rocks thickets and irregularities  why not go and murder them both now  i carnt said bert dismissing that i got to be worked up  but it was a mistake to get right away from them that suddenly became clear he ought to keep them under observation ought to scout them then he would be able to see what they were doing whether either of them had a revolver where they had hidden the food he would be better able to determine what they meant to do to him if he didnt scout them presently they would begin to scout him this seemed so eminently reasonable that he acted upon it forthwith he thought over his costume and threw his collar and the telltale aeronauts white cap into the water far below he turned his coat collar up to hide any gleam of his dirty shirt the tools and nuts in his pockets were disposed to clank but he rearranged them and wrapped some letters and his pockethandkerchief about them he started off circumspectly and noiselessly listening and peering at every step as he drew near his antagonists much grunting and creaking served to locate them he discovered them engaged in what looked like a wrestling match with the asiatic flyingmachine their coats were off their swords laid aside they were working magnificently apparently they were turning it round and were having a good deal of difficulty with the long tail among the trees he dropped flat at the sight of them and wriggled into a little hollow and so lay watching their exertions ever and again to pass the time he would cover one or other of them with his gun  he found them quite interesting to watch so interesting that at times he came near shouting to advise them he perceived that when they had the machine turned round they would then be in immediate want of the nuts and tools he carried then they would come after him they would certainly conclude he had them or had hidden them should he hide his gun and do a deal for food with these tools he felt he would not be able to part with the gun again now he had once felt its reassuring company the kitten turned up again and made a great fuss with him and licked and bit his ear  the sun clambered to midday and once that morning he saw though the germans did not an asiatic airship very far to the south going swiftly eastward  at last the flyingmachine was turned and stood poised on its wheel with its hooks pointing up the rapids the two officers wiped their faces resumed jackets and swords spoke and bore themselves like men who congratulated themselves on a good laborious morning then they went off briskly towards the refreshment shed the prince leading bert became active in pursuit but he found it impossible to stalk them quickly enough and silently enough to discover the hidingplace of the food he found them when he came into sight of them again seated with their backs against the shed plates on knee and a tin of corned beef and a plateful of biscuits between them they seemed in fairly good spirits and once the prince laughed at this vision of eating berts plans gave way fierce hunger carried him he appeared before them suddenly at a distance of perhaps twenty yards gun in hand  ands up he said in a hard ferocious voice  the prince hesitated and then up went two pairs of hands the gun had surprised them both completely  stand up said bert drop that fork  they obeyed again  what nex said bert to himself orf stage i suppose that way he said go  the prince obeyed with remarkable alacrity when he reached the head of the clearing he said something quickly to the birdfaced man and they both with an entire lack of dignity ran  bert was struck with an exasperating afterthought  gord he cried with infinite vexation why i ought to ave took their swords ere  but the germans were already out of sight and no doubt taking cover among the trees bert fell back upon imprecations then he went up to the shed cursorily examined the possibility of a flank attack put his gun handy and set to work with a convulsive listening pause before each mouthful on the princes plate of corned beef he had finished that up and handed its gleanings to the kitten and he was fallingto on the second plateful when the plate broke in his hand he stared with the fact slowly creeping upon him that an instant before he had heard a crack among the thickets then he sprang to his feet snatched up his gun in one hand and the tin of corned beef in the other and fled round the shed to the other side of the clearing as he did so came a second crack from the thickets and something went phwit by his ear  he didnt stop running until he was in what seemed to him a strongly defensible position near luna island then he took cover panting and crouched expectant  they got a revolver after all he panted  wonder if they got two if they avegord im done  wheres the kitten finishin up that corned beef i suppose little beggar  9  so it was that war began upon goat island it lasted a day and a night the longest day and the longest night in berts life he had to lie close and listen and watch also he had to scheme what he should do it was clear now that he had to kill these two men if he could and that if they could they would kill him the prize was first food and then the flyingmachine and the doubtful privilege of trying to ride it if one failed one would certainly be killed if one succeeded one would get away somewhere over there for a time bert tried to imagine what it was like over there his mind ran over possibilities deserts angry americans japanese chineseperhaps red indians were there still red indians  got to take what comes said bert no way out of it that i can see  was that voices he realised that his attention was wandering for a time all his senses were very alert the uproar of the falls was very confusing and it mixed in all sorts of sounds like feet walking like voices talking like shouts and cries  silly great catarac said bert there aint no sense in it fallin and fallin  never mind that now what were the germans doing  would they go back to the flyingmachine they couldnt do anything with it because he had those nuts and screws and the wrench and other tools but suppose they found the second set of tools he had hidden in a tree he had hidden the things well of course but they might find them one wasnt sure of courseone wasnt sure he tried to remember just exactly how he had hidden those tools he tried to persuade himself they were certainly and surely hidden but his memory began to play antics had he really left the handle of the wrench sticking out shining out at the fork of the branch  ssh what was that some one stirring in those bushes up went an expectant muzzle no where was the kitten no it was just imagination not even the kitten  the germans would certainly miss and hunt about for the tools and nuts and screws he carried in his pockets that was clear then they would decide he had them and come for him he had only to remain still under cover therefore and he would get them was there any flaw in that would they take off more removable parts of the flyingmachine and then lie up for him no they wouldnt do that because they were two to one they would have no apprehension of his getting off in the flyingmachine and no sound reason for supposing he would approach it and so they would do nothing to damage or disable it that he decided was clear but suppose they lay up for him by the food well that they wouldnt do because they would know he had this corned beef there was enough in this can to last with moderation several days of course they might try to tire him out instead of attacking him  he roused himself with a start he had just grasped the real weakness of his position he might go to sleep  it needed but ten minutes under the suggestion of that idea before he realised that he was going to sleep  he rubbed his eyes and handled his gun he had never before realised the intensely soporific effect of the american sun of the american air the drowsy sleepcompelling uproar of niagara hitherto these things had on the whole seemed stimulating  if he had not eaten so much and eaten it so fast he would not be so heavy are vegetarians always bright  he roused himself with a jerk again  if he didnt do something he would fall asleep and if he fell asleep it was ten to one they would find him snoring and finish him forthwith if he sat motionless and noiseless he would inevitably sleep it was better he told himself to take even the risks of attacking than that this sleep trouble he felt was going to beat him must beat him in the end they were all right one could sleep and the other could watch that come to think of it was what they would always do one would do anything they wanted done the other would lie under cover near at hand ready to shoot they might even trap him like that one might act as a decoy  that set him thinking of decoys what a fool he had been to throw his cap away it would have been invaluable on a stickespecially at night  he found himself wishing for a drink he settled that for a time by putting a pebble in his mouth and then the sleep craving returned  it became clear to him he must attack like many great generals before him he found his baggage that is to say his tin of corned beef a serious impediment to mobility at last he decided to put the beef loose in his pocket and abandon the tin it was not perhaps an ideal arrangement but one must make sacrifices when one is campaigning he crawled perhaps ten yards and then for a time the possibilities of the situation paralysed him  the afternoon was still the roar of the cataract simply threw up that immense stillness in relief he was doing his best to contrive the death of two better men than himself also they were doing their best to contrive his what behind this silence were they doing  suppose he came upon them suddenly and fired and missed  10  he crawled and halted listening and crawled again until nightfall and no doubt the german alexander and his lieutenant did the same a large scale map of goat island marked with red and blue lines to show these strategic movements would no doubt have displayed much interlacing but as a matter of fact neither side saw anything of the other throughout that agelong day of tedious alertness bert never knew how near he got to them nor how far he kept from them night found him no longer sleepy but athirst and near the american fall he was inspired by the idea that his antagonists might be in the wreckage of the hohenzollern cabins that was jammed against green island he became enterprising broke from any attempt to conceal himself and went across the little bridge at the double he found nobody it was his first visit to these huge fragments of airships and for a time he explored them curiously in the dim light he discovered the forward cabin was nearly intact with its door slanting downward and a corner under water he crept in drank and then was struck by the brilliant idea of shutting the door and sleeping on it  but now he could not sleep at all  he nodded towards morning and woke up to find it fully day he breakfasted on corned beef and water and sat for a long time appreciative of the security of his position at last he became enterprising and bold he would he decided settle this business forthwith one way or the other he was tired of all this crawling he set out in the morning sunshine gun in hand scarcely troubling to walk softly he went round the refreshment shed without finding any one and then through the trees towards the flyingmachine he came upon the birdfaced man sitting on the ground with his back against a tree bent up over his folded arms sleeping his bandage very much over one eye  bert stopped abruptly and stood perhaps fifteen yards away gun in hand ready where was the prince then sticking out at the side of the tree beyond he saw a shoulder bert took five deliberate paces to the left the great man became visible leaning up against the trunk pistol in one hand and sword in the other and yawningyawning you cant shoot a yawning man bert found he advanced upon his antagonist with his gun levelled some foolish fancy of hands up in his mind the prince became aware of him the yawning mouth shut like a trap and he stood stiffly up bert stopped silent for a moment the two regarded one another  had the prince been a wise man he would i suppose have dodged behind the tree instead he gave vent to a shout and raised pistol and sword at that like an automaton bert pulled his trigger  it was his first experience of an oxygencontaining bullet a great flame spurted from the middle of the prince a blinding flare and there came a thud like the firing of a gun something hot and wet struck berts face then through a whirl of blinding smoke and steam he saw limbs and a collapsing burst body fling themselves to earth  bert was so astonished that he stood agape and the birdfaced officer might have cut him to the earth without a struggle but instead the birdfaced officer was running away through the undergrowth dodging as he went bert roused himself to a brief ineffectual pursuit but he had no stomach for further killing he returned to the mangled scattered thing that had so recently been the great prince karl albert he surveyed the scorched and splashed vegetation about it he made some speculative identifications he advanced gingerly and picked up the hot revolver to find all its chambers strained and burst he became aware of a cheerful and friendly presence he was greatly shocked that one so young should see so frightful a scene  ere kitty he said this aint no place for you  he made three strides across the devastated area captured the kitten neatly and went his way towards the shed with her purring loudly on his shoulder  you dont seem to mind he said  for a time he fussed about the shed and at last discovered the rest of the provisions hidden in the roof seems ard he said as he administered a saucerful of milk when you get three men in a ole like this they cant work together but im and is princing was jest a bit too thick  gaw he reflected sitting on the counter and eating what a thing life is ere am i i seen is picture eard is name since i was a kid in frocks prince karl albert and if any one ad tole me i was going to blow im to smithereensthere i shouldnt ave believed it kitty  that chap at margit ought to ave tole me about it all e tole me was that i got a weak chess  that other chap e aint going to do much wonder what i ought to do about im  he surveyed the trees with a keen blue eye and fingered the gun on his knee i dont like this killing kitty he said its like kurt said about being blooded seems to me you got to be blooded young if that prince ad come up to me and said shake ands id ave shook ands now eres that other chap dodging about es got is ead urt already and theres something wrong with his leg and burns golly it isnt three weeks ago i first set eyes on im and then e was smart and set upands full of airbrushes and things and swearin at me a regular gentleman now es arfway to a wild man what am i to do with im what the ell am i to do with im i cant leave im ave that flyingmachine thats a bit too good and if i dont kill im ell jest ang about this island and starve  es got a sword of course  he resumed his philosophising after he had lit a cigarette  wars a silly gaim kitty its a silly gaim we common peoplewe were fools we thought those big people knew what they were up toand they didnt look at that chap e ad all germany beind im and what as e made of it smeshin and blunderin and destroyin and there e is jest a mess of blood and boots and things jest an orrid splash prince karl albert and all the men e led and the ships e ad the airships and the dragonfliersall scattered like a paperchase between this ole and germany and fightin going on and burnin and killin that e started war without end all over the world  i suppose i shall ave to kill that other chap i suppose i must but it aint at all the sort of job i fancy kitty  for a time he hunted about the island amidst the uproar of the waterfall looking for the wounded officer and at last he started him out of some bushes near the head of biddle stairs but as he saw the bent and bandaged figure in limping flight before him he found his cockney softness too much for him again he could neither shoot nor pursue i carnt he said thats flat i avent the guts for it ell ave to go  he turned his steps towards the flyingmachine  he never saw the birdfaced officer again nor any further evidence of his presence towards evening he grew fearful of ambushes and hunted vigorously for an hour or so but in vain he slept in a good defensible position at the extremity of the rocky point that runs out to the canadian fall and in the night he woke in panic terror and fired his gun but it was nothing he slept no more that night in the morning he became curiously concerned for the vanished man and hunted for him as one might for an erring brother  if i knew some german he said id oller its jest not knowing german does it you cant explain  he discovered later traces of an attempt to cross the gap in the broken bridge a rope with a bolt attached had been flung across and had caught in a fenestration of a projecting fragment of railing the end of the rope trailed in the seething water towards the fall  but the birdfaced officer was already rubbing shoulders with certain inert matter that had once been lieutenant kurt and the chinese aeronaut and a dead cow and much other uncongenial company in the huge circle of the whirlpool two and a quarter miles away never had that great gathering place that incessant aimless unprogressive hurry of waste and battered things been so crowded with strange and melancholy derelicts round they went and round and every day brought its new contributions luckless brutes shattered fragments of boat and flyingmachine endless citizens from the cities upon the shores of the great lakes above much came from cleveland it all gathered here and whirled about indefinitely and over it all gathered daily a greater abundance of birds    chapter x the world under the war  1  bert spent two more days upon goat island and finished all his provisions except the cigarettes and mineral water before he brought himself to try the asiatic flyingmachine  even at last he did not so much go off upon it as get carried off it had taken only an hour or so to substitute wing stays from the second flyingmachine and to replace the nuts he had himself removed the engine was in working order and differed only very simply and obviously from that of a contemporary motorbicycle the rest of the time was taken up by a vast musing and delaying and hesitation chiefly he saw himself splashing into the rapids and whirling down them to the fall clutching and drowning but also he had a vision of being hopelessly in the air going fast and unable to ground his mind was too concentrated upon the business of flying for him to think very much of what might happen to an indefinitespirited cockney without credential who arrived on an asiatic flyingmachine amidst the warinfuriated population beyond  he still had a lingering solicitude for the birdfaced officer he had a haunting fancy he might be lying disabled or badly smashed in some way in some nook or cranny of the island and it was only after a most exhaustive search that he abandoned that distressing idea if i found im he reasoned the while what could i do wiv im you cant blow a chaps brains out when es down and i don see ow else i can elp im  then the kitten bothered his highly developed sense of social responsibility if i leave er shell starve ought to catch mice for erself are there mice birds shes too young shes like me shes a bit too civilised  finally he stuck her in his side pocket and she became greatly interested in the memories of corned beef she found there with her in his pocket he seated himself in the saddle of the flyingmachine big clumsy thing it wasand not a bit like a bicycle still the working of it was fairly plain you set the engine goingso kicked yourself up until the wheel was vertical so engaged the gyroscope so and thenthenyou just pulled up this lever  rather stiff it was but suddenly it came over  the big curved wings on either side flapped disconcertingly flapped again click clock click clock clitterclock  stop the thing was heading for the water its wheel was in the water bert groaned from his heart and struggled to restore the lever to its first position click clock clitterclock he was rising the machine was lifting its dripping wheel out of the eddies and he was going up there was no stopping now no good in stopping now in another moment bert clutching and convulsive and rigid with staring eyes and a face pale as death was flapping up above the rapids jerking to every jerk of the wings and rising rising  there was no comparison in dignity and comfort between a flyingmachine and a balloon except in its moments of descent the balloon was a vehicle of faultless urbanity this was a buckjumping mule a mule that jumped up and never came down again click clock click clock with each beat of the strangely shaped wings it jumped bert upward and caught him neatly again half a second later on the saddle and while in ballooning there is no wind since the balloon is a part of the wind flying is a wild perpetual creation of and plunging into wind it was a wind that above all things sought to blind him to force him to close his eyes it occurred to him presently to twist his knees and legs inward and grip with them or surely he would have been bumped into two clumsy halves and he was going up a hundred yards high two hundred three hundred over the streaming frothing wilderness of water belowup up up that was all right but how presently would one go horizontally he tried to think if these things did go horizontally no they flapped up and then they soared down for a time he would keep on flapping up tears streamed from his eyes he wiped them with one temerariously disengaged hand  was it better to risk a fall over land or over watersuch water  he was flapping up above the upper rapids towards buffalo it was at any rate a comfort that the falls and the wild swirl of waters below them were behind him he was flying up straight that he could see how did one turn  he was presently almost cool and his eyes got more used to the rush of air but he was getting very high very high he tilted his head forwards and surveyed the country blinking he could see all over buffalo a place with three great blackened scars of ruin and hills and stretches beyond he wondered if he was half a mile high or more there were some people among some houses near a railway station between niagara and buffalo and then more people they went like ants busily in and out of the houses he saw two motor cars gliding along the road towards niagara city then far away in the south he saw a great asiatic airship going eastward oh gord he said and became earnest in his ineffectual attempts to alter his direction but that airship took no notice of him and he continued to ascend convulsively the world got more and more extensive and maplike click clock clitterclock above him and very near to him now was a hazy stratum of cloud  he determined to disengage the wing clutch he did so the lever resisted his strength for a time then over it came and instantly the tail of the machine cocked up and the wings became rigidly spread instantly everything was swift and smooth and silent he was gliding rapidly down the air against a wild gale of wind his eyes threequarters shut  a little lever that had hitherto been obdurate now confessed itself mobile he turned it over gently to the right and whiroothe left wing had in some mysterious way given at its edge and he was sweeping round and downward in an immense righthanded spiral for some moments he experienced all the helpless sensations of catastrophe he restored the lever to its middle position with some difficulty and the wings were equalised again  he turned it to the left and had a sensation of being spun round backwards too much he gasped  he discovered that he was rushing down at a headlong pace towards a railway line and some factory buildings they appeared to be tearing up to him to devour him he must have dropped all that height for a moment he had the ineffectual sensations of one whose bicycle bolts downhill the ground had almost taken him by surprise ere he cried and then with a violent effort of all his being he got the beating engine at work again and set the wings flapping he swooped down and up and resumed his quivering and pulsating ascent of the air  he went high again until he had a wide view of the pleasant upland country of western new york state and then made a long coast down and so up again and then a coast then as he came swooping a quarter of a mile above a village he saw people running about running awayevidently in relation to his hawklike passage he got an idea that he had been shot at  up he said and attacked that lever again it came over with remarkable docility and suddenly the wings seemed to give way in the middle but the engine was still it had stopped he flung the lever back rather by instinct than design what to do  much happened in a few seconds but also his mind was quick he thought very quickly he couldnt get up again he was gliding down the air he would have to hit something  he was travelling at the rate of perhaps thirty miles an hour down down  that plantation of larches looked the softest thingmossy almost  could he get it he gave himself to the steering round to the rightleft  swirroo crackle he was gliding over the tops of the trees ploughing through them tumbling into a cloud of green sharp leaves and black twigs there was a sudden snapping and he fell off the saddle forward a thud and a crashing of branches some twigs hit him smartly in the face  he was between a treestem and the saddle with his leg over the steering lever and so far as he could realise not hurt he tried to alter his position and free his leg and found himself slipping and dropping through branches with everything giving way beneath him he clutched and found himself in the lower branches of a tree beneath the flyingmachine the air was full of a pleasant resinous smell he stared for a moment motionless and then very carefully clambered down branch by branch to the soft needlecovered ground below  good business he said looking up at the bent and tilted kitewings above  i dropped soft  he rubbed his chin with his hand and meditated blowed if i dont think im a rather lucky fellow he said surveying the pleasant sunbespattered ground under the trees then he became aware of a violent tumult at his side lord he said you must be arf smothered and extracted the kitten from his pockethandkerchief and pocket she was twisted and crumpled and extremely glad to see the light again her little tongue peeped between her teeth he put her down and she ran a dozen paces and shook herself and stretched and sat up and began to wash  nex he said looking about him and then with a gesture of vexation desh it i ought to ave brought that gun  he had rested it against a tree when he had seated himself in the flyingmachine saddle  he was puzzled for a time by the immense peacefulness in the quality of the world and then he perceived that the roar of the cataract was no longer in his ears  2  he had no very clear idea of what sort of people he might come upon in this country it was he knew america americans he had always understood were the citizens of a great and powerful nation dry and humorous in their manner addicted to the use of the bowieknife and revolver and in the habit of talking through the nose like norfolkshire and saying allow and reckon and calculate after the manner of the people who live on the new forest side of hampshire also they were very rich had rockingchairs and put their feet at unusual altitudes and they chewed tobacco gum and other substances with untiring industry commingled with them were cowboys red indians and comic respectful niggers this he had learnt from the fiction in his public library beyond that he had learnt very little he was not surprised therefore when he met armed men  he decided to abandon the shattered flyingmachine he wandered through the trees for some time and then struck a road that seemed to his urban english eyes to be remarkably wide but not properly made neither hedge nor ditch nor curbed distinctive footpath separated it from the woods and it went in that long easy curve which distinguishes the tracks of an open continent ahead he saw a man carrying a gun under his arm a man in a soft black hat a blue blouse and black trousers and with a broad roundfat face quite innocent of goatee this person regarded him askance and heard him speak with a start  can you tell me whereabouts i am at all asked bert  the man regarded him and more particularly his rubber boots with sinister suspicion then he replied in a strange outlandish tongue that was as a matter of fact czech he ended suddenly at the sight of berts blank face with dont spik english  oh said bert he reflected gravely for a moment and then went his way  thenks he said as an afterthought the man regarded his back for a moment was struck with an idea began an abortive gesture sighed gave it up and went on also with a depressed countenance  presently bert came to a big wooden house standing casually among the trees it looked a bleak bare box of a house to him no creeper grew on it no hedge nor wall nor fence parted it off from the woods about it he stopped before the steps that led up to the door perhaps thirty yards away the place seemed deserted he would have gone up to the door and rapped but suddenly a big black dog appeared at the side and regarded him it was a huge heavyjawed dog of some unfamiliar breed and it wore a spikestudded collar it did not bark nor approach him it just bristled quietly and emitted a single sound like a short deep cough  bert hesitated and went on  he stopped thirty paces away and stood peering about him among the trees if i avent been and lef that kitten he said  acute sorrow wrenched him for a time the black dog came through the trees to get a better look at him and coughed that wellbred cough again bert resumed the road  shell do all right he said shell catch things  shell do all right he said presently without conviction but if it had not been for the black dog he would have gone back  when he was out of sight of the house and the black dog he went into the woods on the other side of the way and emerged after an interval trimming a very tolerable cudgel with his pocketknife presently he saw an attractivelooking rock by the track and picked it up and put it in his pocket then he came to three or four houses wooden like the last each with an illpainted white verandah that was his name for it and all standing in the same casual way upon the ground behind through the woods he saw pigstys and a rooting black sow leading a brisk adventurous family a wildlooking woman with sloeblack eyes and dishevelled black hair sat upon the steps of one of the houses nursing a baby but at the sight of bert she got up and went inside and he heard her bolting the door then a boy appeared among the pigstys but he would not understand berts hail  i suppose it is america said bert  the houses became more frequent down the road and he passed two other extremely wild and dirtylooking men without addressing them one carried a gun and the other a hatchet and they scrutinised him and his cudgel scornfully then he struck a crossroad with a monorail at its side and there was a notice board at the corner with wait here for the cars thats all right anyow said bert wonder ow long i should ave to wait it occurred to him that in the present disturbed state of the country the service might be interrupted and as there seemed more houses to the right than the left he turned to the right he passed an old negro ullo said bert goo morning  good day sah said the old negro in a voice of almost incredible richness  whats the name of this place asked bert  tanooda sah said the negro  thenks said bert  thank you sah said the negro overwhelmingly  bert came to houses of the same detached unwalled wooden type but adorned now with enamelled advertisements partly in english and partly in esperanto then he came to what he concluded was a grocers shop it was the first house that professed the hospitality of an open door and from within came a strangely familiar sound gaw he said searching in his pockets why i avent wanted money for free weeks i wonder if igrubb ad most of it ah he produced a handful of coins and regarded it three pennies sixpence and a shilling thats all right he said forgetting a very obvious consideration  he approached the door and as he did so a compactly built greyfaced man in shirt sleeves appeared in it and scrutinised him and his cudgel mornin said bert can i get anything to eat r drink in this shop  the man in the door replied thank heaven in clear good american this sir is not a shop it is a store  oh said bert and then well can i get anything to eat  you can said the american in a tone of confident encouragement and led the way inside  the shop seemed to him by his bun hill standards extremely roomy well lit and unencumbered there was a long counter to the left of him with drawers and miscellaneous commodities ranged behind it a number of chairs several tables and two spittoons to the right various barrels cheeses and bacon up the vista and beyond a large archway leading to more space a little group of men was assembled round one of the tables and a woman of perhaps fiveandthirty leant with her elbows on the counter all the men were armed with rifles and the barrel of a gun peeped above the counter they were all listening idly inattentively to a cheap metallictoned gramophone that occupied a table near at hand from its brazen throat came words that gave bert a qualm of homesickness that brought back in his memory a sunlit beach a group of children redpainted bicycles grubb and an approaching balloon  tingalingatingalingatinga lingatang what price hairpins now  a heavynecked man in a straw hat who was chewing something stopped the machine with a touch and they all turned their eyes on bert and all their eyes were tired eyes  can we give this gentleman anything to eat mother or can we not said the proprietor  he kin have what he likes said the woman at the counter without moving right up from a cracker to a square meal she struggled with a yawn after the manner of one who has been up all night  i want a meal said bert but i avent very much money i don want to give morn a shillin  morn a what said the proprietor sharply  morn a shillin said bert with a sudden disagreeable realisation coming into his mind  yes said the proprietor startled for a moment from his courtly bearing but what in hell is a shilling  he means a quarter said a wiselooking lank young man in riding gaiters  bert trying to conceal his consternation produced a coin thats a shilling he said  he calls a store a shop said the proprietor and he wants a meal for a shilling may i ask you sir what part of america you hail from  bert replaced the shilling in his pocket as he spoke niagara he said  and when did you leave niagara  bout an hour ago  well said the proprietor and turned with a puzzled smile to the others well  they asked various questions simultaneously  bert selected one or two for reply you see he said i been with the german airfleet i got caught up by them sort of by accident and brought over here  from england  yesfrom england way of germany i was in a great battle with them asiatics and i got lef on a little island between the falls  goat island  i don know what it was called but anyow i found a flyingmachine and made a sort of fly with it and got here  two men stood up with incredulous eyes on him wheres the flyingmachine they asked outside  its back in the woods herebout arf a mile away  is it good said a thicklipped man with a scar  i come down rather a smash  everybody got up and stood about him and talked confusingly they wanted him to take them to the flyingmachine at once  look ere said bert ill show youonly i avent ad anything to eat since yestidayexcept mineral water  a gaunt soldierlylooking young man with long lean legs in riding gaiters and a bandolier who had hitherto not spoken intervened now on his behalf in a note of confident authority thats aw right he said give him a feed mr loganfrom me i want to hear more of that story of his well see his machine afterwards if you ask me i should say its a remarkably interesting accident had dropped this gentleman here i guess we requisition that flyingmachineif we find itfor local defence  3  so bert fell on his feet again and sat eating cold meat and good bread and mustard and drinking very good beer and telling in the roughest outline and with the omissions and inaccuracies of statement natural to his type of mind the simple story of his adventures he told how he and a gentleman friend had been visiting the seaside for their health how a chep came along in a balloon and fell out as he fell in how he had drifted to franconia how the germans had seemed to mistake him for some one and had took him prisoner and brought him to new york how he had been to labrador and back how he had got to goat island and found himself there alone he omitted the matter of the prince and the butteridge aspect of the affair not out of any deep deceitfulness but because he felt the inadequacy of his narrative powers he wanted everything to seem easy and natural and correct to present himself as a trustworthy and understandable englishman in a sound mediocre position to whom refreshment and accommodation might be given with freedom and confidence when his fragmentary story came to new york and the battle of niagara they suddenly produced newspapers which had been lying about on the table and began to check him and question him by these vehement accounts it became evident to him that his descent had revived and roused to flames again a discussion a topic that had been burning continuously that had smouldered only through sheer exhaustion of material during the temporary diversion of the gramophone a discussion that had drawn these men together rifle in hand the one supreme topic of the whole world the war and the methods of the war he found any question of his personality and his personal adventures falling into the background found himself taken for granted and no more than a source of information the ordinary affairs of life the buying and selling of everyday necessities the cultivation of the ground the tending of beasts was going on as it were by force of routine as the common duties of life go on in a house whose master lies under the knife of some supreme operation the overruling interest was furnished by those great asiatic airships that went upon incalculable missions across the sky the crimsonclad swordsmen who might come fluttering down demanding petrol or food or news these men were asking all the continent was asking what are we to do what can we try how can we get at them bert fell into his place as an item ceased even in his own thoughts to be a central and independent thing  after he had eaten and drunken his fill and sighed and stretched and told them how good the food seemed to him he lit a cigarette they gave him and led the way with some doubts and trouble to the flyingmachine amidst the larches it became manifest that the gaunt young man whose name it seemed was laurier was a leader both by position and natural aptitude he knew the names and characters and capabilities of all the men who were with him and he set them to work at once with vigour and effect to secure this precious instrument of war they got the thing down to the ground deliberately and carefully felling a couple of trees in the process and they built a wide flat roof of timbers and tree boughs to guard their precious find against its chance discovery by any passing asiatics long before evening they had an engineer from the next township at work upon it and they were casting lots among the seventeen picked men who wanted to take it for its first flight and bert found his kitten and carried it back to logans store and handed it with earnest admonition to mrs logan and it was reassuringly clear to him that in mrs logan both he and the kitten had found a congenial soul  laurier was not only a masterful person and a wealthy property owner and employerhe was president bert learnt with awe of the tanooda canning corporationbut he was popular and skilful in the arts of popularity in the evening quite a crowd of men gathered in the store and talked of the flyingmachine and of the war that was tearing the world to pieces and presently came a man on a bicycle with an illprinted newspaper of a single sheet which acted like fuel in a blazing furnace of talk it was nearly all american news the oldfashioned cables had fallen into disuse for some years and the marconi stations across the ocean and along the atlantic coastline seemed to have furnished particularly tempting points of attack  but such news it was  bert sat in the backgroundfor by this time they had gauged his personal quality pretty completelylistening before his staggering mind passed strange vast images as they talked of great issues at a crisis of nations in tumultuous march of continents overthrown of famine and destruction beyond measure ever and again in spite of his efforts to suppress them certain personal impressions would scamper across the weltering confusion the horrible mess of the exploded prince the chinese aeronaut upside down the limping and bandaged birdfaced officer blundering along in miserable and hopeless flight  they spoke of fire and massacre of cruelties and counter cruelties of things that had been done to harmless asiatics by racemad men of the wholesale burning and smashing up of towns railway junctions bridges of whole populations in hiding and exodus every ship theyve got is in the pacific he heard one man exclaim since the fighting began they cant have landed on the pacific slope less than a million men theyve come to stay in these states and they willliving or dead  slowly broadly invincibly there grew upon berts mind realisation of the immense tragedy of humanity into which his life was flowing the appalling and universal nature of the epoch that had arrived the conception of an end to security and order and habit the whole world was at war and it could not get back to peace it might never recover peace  he had thought the things he had seen had been exceptional conclusive things that the besieging of new york and the battle of the atlantic were epochmaking events between long years of security and they had been but the first warning impacts of universal cataclysm each day destruction and hate and disaster grew the fissures widened between man and man new regions of the fabric of civilisation crumbled and gave way below the armies grew and the people perished above the airships and aeroplanes fought and fled raining destruction  it is difficult perhaps for the broadminded and longperspectived reader to understand how incredible the breaking down of the scientific civilisation seemed to those who actually lived at this time who in their own persons went down in that debacle progress had marched as it seemed invincible about the earth never now to rest again for three hundred years and more the long steadily accelerated diastole of europeanised civilisation had been in progress towns had been multiplying populations increasing values rising new countries developing thought literature knowledge unfolding and spreading it seemed but a part of the process that every year the instruments of war were vaster and more powerful and that armies and explosives outgrew all other growing things  three hundred years of diastole and then came the swift and unexpected systole like the closing of a fist they could not understand it was systole  they could not think of it as anything but a jolt a hitch a mere oscillatory indication of the swiftness of their progress collapse though it happened all about them remained incredible presently some falling mass smote them down or the ground opened beneath their feet they died incredulous  these men in the store made a minute remote group under this immense canopy of disaster they turned from one little aspect to another what chiefly concerned them was defence against asiatic raiders swooping for petrol or to destroy weapons or communications everywhere levies were being formed at that time to defend the plant of the railroads day and night in the hope that communication would speedily be restored the land war was still far away a man with a flat voice distinguished himself by a display of knowledge and cunning he told them all with confidence just what had been wrong with the german drachenflieger and the american aeroplanes just what advantage the japanese flyers possessed he launched out into a romantic description of the butteridge machine and riveted berts attention i see that said bert and was smitten silent by a thought the man with the flat voice talked on without heeding him of the strange irony of butteridges death at that bert had a little twinge of reliefhe would never meet butteridge again it appeared butteridge had died suddenly very suddenly  and his secret sir perished with him when they came to look for the partsnone could find them he had hidden them all too well  but couldnt he tell asked the man in the straw hat did he die so suddenly as that  struck down sir rage and apoplexy at a place called dymchurch in england  thats right said laurier i remember a page about it in the sunday american at the time they said it was a german spy had stolen his balloon  well sir said the flatvoiced man that fit of apoplexy at dyrnchurch was the worst thingabsolutely the worst thing that ever happened to the world for if it had not been for the death of mr butteridge  no one knows his secret  not a soul its gone his balloon it appears was lost at sea with all the plans down it went and they went with it  pause  with machines such as he made we could fight these asiatic fliers on more than equal terms we could outfly and beat down those scarlet hummingbirds wherever they appeared but its gone its gone and theres no time to reinvent it now we got to fight with what we gotand the odds are against us that wont stop us fightin no but just think of it  bert was trembling violently he cleared his throat hoarsely  i say he said look here i  nobody regarded him the man with the flat voice was opening a new branch of the subject  i allow he began  bert became violently excited he stood up  he made clawing motions with his hands i say he exclaimed mr laurier look erei wantabout that butteridge machine  mr laurier sitting on an adjacent table with a magnificent gesture arrested the discourse of the flatvoiced man whats he saying said he  then the whole company realised that something was happening to bert either he was suffocating or going mad he was spluttering  look ere i say old on a bit and trembling and eagerly unbuttoning himself  he tore open his collar and opened vest and shirt he plunged into his interior and for an instant it seemed he was plucking forth his liver then as he struggled with buttons on his shoulder they perceived this flattened horror was in fact a terribly dirty flannel chestprotector in an other moment bert in a state of irregular decolletage was standing over the table displaying a sheaf of papers  these he gasped these are the plans you know mr butteridgehis machine what died i was the chap that went off in that balloon  for some seconds every one was silent they stared from these papers to berts white face and blazing eyes and back to the papers on the table nobody moved then the man with the flat voice spoke  irony he said with a note of satisfaction real rightdown irony when its too late to think of making em any more  4  they would all no doubt have been eager to hear berts story over again but it was it this point that laurier showed his quality no sir he said and slid from off his table  he impounded the dispersing butteridge plans with one comprehensive sweep of his arm rescuing them even from the expository fingermarks of the man with the flat voice and handed them to bert put those back he said where you had em we have a journey before us  bert took them  whar said the man in the straw hat  why sir we are going to find the president of these states and give these plans over to him i decline to believe sir we are too late  where is the president asked bert weakly in that pause that followed  logan said laurier disregarding that feeble inquiry you must help us in this  it seemed only a matter of a few minutes before bert and laurier and the storekeeper were examining a number of bicycles that were stowed in the hinder room of the store bert didnt like any of them very much they had wood rims and an experience of wood rims in the english climate had taught him to hate them that however and one or two other objections to an immediate start were overruled by laurier but where is the president bert repeated as they stood behind logan while he pumped up a deflated tyre  laurier looked down on him he is reported in the neighbourhood of albanyout towards the berkshire hills he is moving from place to place and as far as he can organising the defence by telegraph and telephones the asiatic airfleet is trying to locate him when they think they have located the seat of government they throw bombs this inconveniences him but so far they have not come within ten miles of him the asiatic airfleet is at present scattered all over the eastern states seeking out and destroying gasworks and whatever seems conducive to the building of airships or the transport of troops our retaliatory measures are slight in the extreme but with these machinessir this ride of ours will count among the historical rides of the world  he came near to striking an attitude we shant get to him tonight asked bert  no sir said laurier we shall have to ride some days sure  and suppose we cant get a lift on a trainor anything  no sir theres been no transit by tanooda for three days it is no good waiting we shall have to get on as well as we can  startin now  starting now  but ow aboutwe shant be able to do much tonight  may as well ride till were fagged and sleep then so much clear gain our road is eastward  of course began bert with memories of the dawn upon goat island and left his sentence unfinished  he gave his attention to the more scientific packing of the chestprotector for several of the plans flapped beyond his vest  5  for a week bert led a life of mixed sensations amidst these fatigue in the legs predominated mostly he rode rode with lauriers back inexorably ahead through a land like a larger england with bigger hills and wider valleys larger fields wider roads fewer hedges and wooden houses with commodious piazzas he rode laurier made inquiries laurier chose the turnings laurier doubted laurier decided now it seemed they were in telephonic touch with the president now something had happened and he was lost again but always they had to go on and always bert rode a tyre was deflated still he rode he grew saddle sore laurier declared that unimportant asiatic flying ships passed overhead the two cyclists made a dash for cover until the sky was clear once a red asiatic flyingmachine came fluttering after them so low they could distinguish the aeronauts head he followed them for a mile now they came to regions of panic now to regions of destruction here people were fighting for food here they seemed hardly stirred from the countryside routine they spent a day in a deserted and damaged albany the asiatics had descended and cut every wire and made a cinderheap of the junction and our travellers pushed on eastward they passed a hundred halfheeded incidents and always bert was toiling after lauriers indefatigable back  things struck upon berts attention and perplexed him and then he passed on with unanswered questionings fading from his mind  he saw a large house on fire on a hillside to the right and no man heeding it  they came to a narrow railroad bridge and presently to a monorail train standing in the track on its safety feet it was a remarkably sumptuous train the last word transcontinental express and the passengers were all playing cards or sleeping or preparing a picnic meal on a grassy slope near at hand they had been there six days  at one point ten darkcomplexioned men were hanging in a string from the trees along the roadside bert wondered why  at one peacefullooking village where they stopped off to get berts tyre mended and found beer and biscuits they were approached by an extremely dirty little boy without boots who spoke as follows  deyse been hanging a chink in dose woods  hanging a chinaman said laurier  sure der sleuths got him rubberin der railroad sheds  oh  dose guys done wase cartridges deyse hung him and dey pulled his legs deyse doin all der chinks dey can fine dat weh dey aint takin no risks all der chinks dey can fine  neither bert nor laurier made any reply and presently after a little skilful expectoration the young gentleman was attracted by the appearance of two of his friends down the road and shuffled off whooping weirdly  that afternoon they almost ran over a man shot through the body and partly decomposed lying near the middle of the road just outside albany he must have been lying there for some days  beyond albany they came upon a motor car with a tyre burst and a young woman sitting absolutely passive beside the drivers seat an old man was under the car trying to effect some impossible repairs beyond sitting with a rifle across his knees with his back to the car and staring into the woods was a young man  the old man crawled out at their approach and still on allfours accosted bert and laurier the car had broken down overnight the old man said he could not understand what was wrong but he was trying to puzzle it out neither he nor his soninlaw had any mechanical aptitude they had been assured this was a foolproof car it was dangerous to have to stop in this place the party had been attacked by tramps and had had to fight it was known they had provisions he mentioned a great name in the world of finance would laurier and bert stop and help him he proposed it first hopefully then urgently at last in tears and terror  no said laurier inexorable we must go on we have something more than a woman to save we have to save america  the girl never stirred  and once they passed a madman singing  and at last they found the president hiding in a small saloon upon the outskirts of a place called pinkerville on the hudson and gave the plans of the butteridge machine into his hands    chapter xi the great collapse  1  and now the whole fabric of civilisation was bending and giving and dropping to pieces and melting in the furnace of the war  the stages of the swift and universal collapse of the financial and scientific civilisation with which the twentieth century opened followed each other very swiftly so swiftly that upon the foreshortened page of historythey seem altogether to overlap to begin with one sees the world nearly at a maximum wealth and prosperity to its inhabitants indeed it seemed also at a maximum of security when now in retrospect the thoughtful observer surveys the intellectual history of this time when one reads its surviving fragments of literature its scraps of political oratory the few small voices that chance has selected out of a thousand million utterances to speak to later days the most striking thing of all this web of wisdom and error is surely that hallucination of security to men living in our present world state orderly scientific and secured nothing seems so precarious so giddily dangerous as the fabric of the social order with which the men of the opening of the twentieth century were content to us it seems that every institution and relationship was the fruit of haphazard and tradition and the manifest sport of chance their laws each made for some separate occasion and having no relation to any future needs their customs illogical their education aimless and wasteful their method of economic exploitation indeed impresses a trained and informed mind as the most frantic and destructive scramble it is possible to conceive their credit and monetary system resting on an unsubstantial tradition of the worthiness of gold seems a thing almost fantastically unstable and they lived in planless cities for the most part dangerously congested their rails and roads and population were distributed over the earth in the wanton confusion ten thousand irrevelant considerations had made  yet they thought confidently that this was a secure and permanent progressive system and on the strength of some three hundred years of change and irregular improvement answered the doubter with things always have gone well well worry through  but when we contrast the state of man in the opening of the twentieth century with the condition of any previous period in his history then perhaps we may begin to understand something of that blind confidence it was not so much a reasoned confidence as the inevitable consequence of sustained good fortune by such standards as they possessed things had gone amazingly well for them it is scarcely an exaggeration to say that for the first time in history whole populations found themselves regularly supplied with more than enough to eat and the vital statistics of the time witness to an amelioration of hygienic conditions rapid beyond all precedent and to a vast development of intelligence and ability in all the arts that make life wholesome the level and quality of the average education had risen tremendously and at the dawn of the twentieth century comparatively few people in western europe or america were unable to read or write never before had there been such reading masses there was wide social security a common man might travel safely over threequarters of the habitable globe could go round the earth at a cost of less than the annual earnings of a skilled artisan compared with the liberality and comfort of the ordinary life of the time the order of the roman empire under the antonines was local and limited and every year every month came some new increment to human achievement a new country opened up new mines new scientific discoveries a new machine  for those three hundred years indeed the movement of the world seemed wholly beneficial to mankind men said indeed that moral organisation was not keeping pace with physical progress but few attached any meaning to these phrases the understanding of which lies at the basis of our present safety sustaining and constructive forces did indeed for a time more than balance the malign drift of chance and the natural ignorance prejudice blind passion and wasteful selfseeking of mankind  the accidental balance on the side of progress was far slighter and infinitely more complex and delicate in its adjustments than the people of that time suspected but that did not alter the fact that it was an effective balance they did not realise that this age of relative good fortune was an age of immense but temporary opportunity for their kind they complacently assumed a necessary progress towards which they had no moral responsibility they did not realise that this security of progress was a thing still to be wonor lost and that the time to win it was a time that passed they went about their affairs energetically enough and yet with a curious idleness towards those threatening things no one troubled over the real dangers of mankind they saw their armies and navies grow larger and more portentous some of their ironclads at the last cost as much as the whole annual expenditure upon advanced education they accumulated explosives and the machinery of destruction they allowed their national traditions and jealousies to accumulate they contemplated a steady enhancement of race hostility as the races drew closer without concern or understanding and they permitted the growth in their midst of an evilspirited press mercenary and unscrupulous incapable of good and powerful for evil the state had practically no control over the press at all quite heedlessly they allowed this torchpaper to lie at the door of their war magazine for any spark to fire the precedents of history were all one tale of the collapse of civilisations the dangers of the time were manifest one is incredulous now to believe they could not see  could mankind have prevented this disaster of the war in the air  an idle question that as idle as to ask could mankind have prevented the decay that turned assyria and babylon to empty deserts or the slow decline and fall the gradual social disorganisation phase by phase that closed the chapter of the empire of the west they could not because they did not they had not the will to arrest it what mankind could achieve with a different will is a speculation as idle as it is magnificent and this was no slow decadence that came to the europeanised world those other civilisations rotted and crumbled down the europeanised civilisation was as it were blown up within the space of five years it was altogether disintegrated and destroyed up to the very eve of the war in the air one sees a spacious spectacle of incessant advance a worldwide security enormous areas with highly organised industry and settled populations gigantic cities spreading gigantically the seas and oceans dotted with shipping the land netted with rails and open ways then suddenly the german airfleets sweep across the scene and we are in the beginning of the end  2  this story has already told of the swift rush upon new york of the first german airfleet and of the wild inevitable orgy of inconclusive destruction that ensued behind it a second airfleet was already swelling at its gasometers when england and france and spain and italy showed their hands none of these countries had prepared for aeronautic warfare on the magnificent scale of the germans but each guarded secrets each in a measure was making ready and a common dread of german vigour and that aggressive spirit prince karl albert embodied had long been drawing these powers together in secret anticipation of some such attack this rendered their prompt cooperation possible and they certainly cooperated promptly the second aerial power in europe at this time was france the british nervous for their asiatic empire and sensible of the immense moral effect of the airship upon halfeducated populations had placed their aeronautic parks in north india and were able to play but a subordinate part in the european conflict still even in england they had nine or ten big navigables twenty or thirty smaller ones and a variety of experimental aeroplanes before the fleet of prince karl albert had crossed england while bert was still surveying manchester in birdseye view the diplomatic exchanges were going on that led to an attack upon germany a heterogeneous collection of navigable balloons of all sizes and types gathered over the bernese oberland crushed and burnt the twentyfive swiss airships that unexpectedly resisted this concentration in the battle of the alps and then leaving the alpine glaciers and valleys strewn with strange wreckage divided into two fleets and set itself to terrorise berlin and destroy the franconian park seeking to do this before the second airfleet could be inflated  both over berlin and franconia the assailants with their modern explosives effected great damage before they were driven off in franconia twelve fully distended and five partially filled and manned giants were able to make head against and at last with the help of a squadron of drachenflieger from hamburg defeat and pursue the attack and to relieve berlin and the germans were straining every nerve to get an overwhelming fleet in the air and were already raiding london and paris when the advance fleets from the asiatic airparks the first intimation of a new factor in the conflict were reported from burmah and armenia  already the whole financial fabric of the world was staggering when that occurred with the destruction of the american fleet in the north atlantic and the smashing conflict that ended the naval existence of germany in the north sea with the burning and wrecking of billions of pounds worth of property in the four cardinal cities of the world the fact of the hopeless costliness of war came home for the first time came like a blow in the face to the consciousness of mankind credit went down in a wild whirl of selling everywhere appeared a phenomenon that had already in a mild degree manifested itself in preceding periods of panic a desire to secure and hoard gold before prices reached bottom but now it spread like wildfire it became universal above was visible conflict and destruction below something was happening far more deadly and incurable to the flimsy fabric of finance and commercialism in which men had so blindly put their trust as the airships fought above the visible gold supply of the world vanished below an epidemic of private cornering and universal distrust swept the world in a few weeks money except for depreciated paper vanished into vaults into holes into the walls of houses into ten million hidingplaces money vanished and at its disappearance trade and industry came to an end the economic world staggered and fell dead it was like the stroke of some disease it was like the water vanishing out of the blood of a living creature it was a sudden universal coagulation of intercourse  and as the credit system that had been the living fortress of the scientific civilisation reeled and fell upon the millions it had held together in economic relationship as these people perplexed and helpless faced this marvel of credit utterly destroyed the airships of asia countless and relentless poured across the heavens swooped eastward to america and westward to europe the page of history becomes a long crescendo of battle the main body of the britishindian airfleet perished upon a pyre of blazing antagonists in burmah the germans were scattered in the great battle of the carpathians the vast peninsula of india burst into insurrection and civil war from end to end and from gobi to morocco rose the standards of the jehad for some weeks of warfare and destruction it seemed as though the confederation of eastern asia must needs conquer the world and then the jerrybuilt modern civilisation of china too gave way under the strain the teeming and peaceful population of china had been westernised during the opening years of the twentieth century with the deepest resentment and reluctance they had been dragooned and disciplined under japanese and europeaninfluence into an acquiescence with sanitary methods police controls military service and wholesale process of exploitation against which their whole tradition rebelled under the stresses of the war their endurance reached the breaking point the whole of china rose in incoherent revolt and the practical destruction of the central government at pekin by a handful of british and german airships that had escaped from the main battles rendered that revolt invincible in yokohama appeared barricades the black flag and the social revolution with that the whole world became a welter of conflict  so that a universal social collapse followed as it were a logical consequence upon worldwide war wherever there were great populations great masses of people found themselves without work without money and unable to get food famine was in every workingclass quarter in the world within three weeks of the beginning of the war within a month there was not a city anywhere in which the ordinary law and social procedure had not been replaced by some form of emergency control in which firearms and military executions were not being used to keep order and prevent violence and still in the poorer quarters and in the populous districts and even here and there already among those who had been wealthy famine spread  3  so what historians have come to call the phase of the emergency committees sprang from the opening phase and from the phase of social collapse then followed a period of vehement and passionate conflict against disintegration everywhere the struggle to keep order and to keep fighting went on and at the same time the character of the war altered through the replacement of the huge gasfilled airships by flyingmachines as the instruments of war so soon as the big fleet engagements were over the asiatics endeavoured to establish in close proximity to the more vulnerable points of the countries against which they were acting fortified centres from which flyingmachine raids could be made for a time they had everything their own way in this and then as this story has told the lost secret of the butteridge machine came to light and the conflict became equalized and less conclusive than ever for these small flyingmachines ineffectual for any large expedition or conclusive attack were horribly convenient for guerilla warfare rapidly and cheaply made easily used easily hidden the design of them was hastily copied and printed in pinkerville and scattered broadcast over the united states and copies were sent to europe and there reproduced every man every town every parish that could was exhorted to make and use them in a little while they were being constructed not only by governments and local authorities but by robber bands by insurgent committees by every type of private person the peculiar social destructiveness of the butteridge machine lay in its complete simplicity it was nearly as simple as a motorbicycle the broad outlines of the earlier stages of the war disappeared under its influence the spacious antagonism of nations and empires and races vanished in a seething mass of detailed conflict the world passed at a stride from a unity and simplicity broader than that of the roman empire at its best to as social fragmentation as complete as the robberbaron period of the middle ages but this time for a long descent down gradual slopes of disintegration comes a fall like a fall over a cliff everywhere were men and women perceiving this and struggling desperately to keep as it were a hold upon the edge of the cliff  a fourth phase follows through the struggle against chaos in the wake of the famine came now another old enemy of humanitythe pestilence the purple death but the war does not pause the flags still fly fresh airfleets rise new forms of airship and beneath their swooping struggles the world darkensscarcely heeded by history  it is not within the design of this book to tell what further story to tell how the war in the air kept on through the sheer inability of any authorities to meet and agree and end it until every organised government in the world was as shattered and broken as a heap of china beaten with a stick with every week of those terrible years history becomes more detailed and confused more crowded and uncertain not without great and heroic resistance was civilisation borne down out of the bitter social conflict below rose patriotic associations brotherhoods of order city mayors princes provisional committees trying to establish an order below and to keep the sky above the double effort destroyed them and as the exhaustion of the mechanical resources of civilisation clears the heavens of airships at last altogether anarchy famine and pestilence are discovered triumphant below the great nations and empires have become but names in the mouths of men everywhere there are ruins and unburied dead and shrunken yellowfaced survivors in a mortal apathy here there are robbers here vigilance committees and here guerilla bands ruling patches of exhausted territory strange federations and brotherhoods form and dissolve and religious fanaticisms begotten of despair gleam in faminebright eyes it is a universal dissolution the fine order and welfare of the earth have crumpled like an exploded bladder in five short years the world and the scope of human life have undergone a retrogressive change as great as that between the age of the antonines and the europe of the ninth century  4  across this sombre spectacle of disaster goes a minute and insignificant person for whom perhaps the readers of this story have now some slight solicitude of him there remains to be told just one single and miraculous thing through a world darkened and lost through a civilisation in its death agony our little cockney errant went and found his edna he found his edna  he got back across the atlantic partly by means of an order from the president and partly through his own good luck he contrived to get himself aboard a british brig in the timber trade that put out from boston without cargo chiefly it would seem because its captain had a vague idea of getting home to south shields bert was able to ship himself upon her mainly because of the seamanlike appearance of his rubber boots they had a long eventful voyage they were chased or imagined themselves to be chased for some hours by an asiatic ironclad which was presently engaged by a british cruiser the two ships fought for three hours circling and driving southward as they fought until the twilight and the clouddrift of a rising gale swallowed them up a few days later berts ship lost her rudder and mainmast in a gale the crew ran out of food and subsisted on fish they saw strange airships going eastward near the azores and landed to get provisions and repair the rudder at teneriffe there they found the town destroyed and two big liners with dead still aboard sunken in the harbour from there they got canned food and material for repairs but their operations were greatly impeded by the hostility of a band of men amidst the ruins of the town who sniped them and tried to drive them away  at mogador they stayed and sent a boat ashore for water and were nearly captured by an arab ruse here too they got the purple death aboard and sailed with it incubating in their blood the cook sickened first and then the mate and presently every one was down and three in the forecastle were dead it chanced to be calm weather and they drifted helplessly and indeed careless of their fate backwards towards the equator the captain doctored them all with rum nine died all together and of the four survivors none understood navigation when at last they took heart again and could handle a sail they made a course by the stars roughly northward and were already short of food once more when they fell in with a petroldriven ship from rio to cardiff shorthanded by reason of the purple death and glad to take them aboard so at last after a year of wandering bert reached england he landed in bright june weather and found the purple death was there just beginning its ravages  the people were in a state of panic in cardiff and many had fled to the hills and directly the steamer came to the harbour she was boarded and her residue of food impounded by some unauthenticated provisional committee bert tramped through a country disorganised by pestilence foodless and shaken to the very base of its immemorial order he came near death and starvation many times and once he was drawn into scenes of violence that might have ended his career but the bert smallways who tramped from cardiff to london vaguely going home vaguely seeking something of his own that had no tangible form but edna was a very different person from the desert dervish who was swept out of england in mr butteridges balloon a year before he was brown and lean and enduring steadyeyed and pestilencesalted and his mouth which had once hung open shut now like a steel trap across his brow ran a white scar that he had got in a fight on the brig in cardiff he had felt the need of new clothes and a weapon and had by means that would have shocked him a year ago secured a flannel shirt a corduroy suit and a revolver and fifty cartridges from an abandoned pawnbrokers he also got some soap and had his first real wash for thirteen months in a stream outside the town the vigilance bands that had at first shot plunderers very freely were now either entirely dispersed by the plague or busy between town and cemetery in a vain attempt to keep pace with it he prowled on the outskirts of the town for three or four days starving and then went back to join the hospital corps for a week and so fortified himself with a few square meals before he started eastward  the welsh and english countryside at that time presented the strangest mingling of the assurance and wealth of the opening twentieth century with a sort of dureresque medievalism all the gear the houses and monorails the farm hedges and power cables the roads and pavements the signposts and advertisements of the former order were still for the most part intact bankruptcy social collapse famine and pestilence had done nothing to damage these and it was only to the great capitals and ganglionic centres as it were of this state that positive destruction had come any one dropped suddenly into the country would have noticed very little difference he would have remarked first perhaps that all the hedges needed clipping that the roadside grass grew rank that the roadtracks were unusually rainworn and that the cottages by the wayside seemed in many cases shut up that a telephone wire had dropped here and that a cart stood abandoned by the wayside but he would still find his hunger whetted by the bright assurance that wilders canned peaches were excellent or that there was nothing so good for the breakfast table as gobbles sausages and then suddenly would come the dureresque element the skeleton of a horse or some crumpled mass of rags in the ditch with gaunt extended feet and a yellow purpleblotched skin and face or what had been a face gaunt and glaring and devastated then here would be a field that had been ploughed and not sown and here a field of corn carelessly trampled by beasts and here a hoarding torn down across the road to make a fire  then presently he would meet a man or a woman yellowfaced and probably negligently dressed and armedprowling for food these people would have the complexions and eyes and expressions of tramps or criminals and often the clothing of prosperous middleclass or upperclass people many of these would be eager for news and willing to give help and even scraps of queer meat or crusts of grey and doughy bread in return for it they would listen to berts story with avidity and attempt to keep him with them for a day or so the virtual cessation of postal distribution and the collapse of all newspaper enterprise had left an immense and aching gap in the mental life of this time men had suddenly lost sight of the ends of the earth and had still to recover the rumourspreading habits of the middle ages in their eyes in their bearing in their talk was the quality of lost and deoriented souls  as bert travelled from parish to parish and from district to district avoiding as far as possible those festering centres of violence and despair the larger towns he found the condition of affairs varying widely in one parish he would find the large house burnt the vicarage wrecked evidently in violent conflict for some suspected and perhaps imaginary store of food unburied dead everywhere and the whole mechanism of the community at a standstill in another he would find organising forces stoutly at work newlypainted notice boards warning off vagrants the roads and still cultivated fields policed by armed men the pestilence under control even nursing going on a store of food husbanded the cattle and sheep well guarded and a group of two or three justices the village doctor or a farmer dominating the whole place a reversion in fact to the autonomous community of the fifteenth century but at any time such a village would be liable to a raid of asiatics or africans or suchlike airpirates demanding petrol and alcohol or provisions the price of its order was an almost intolerable watchfulness and tension  then the approach to the confused problems of some larger centre of population and the presence of a more intricate conflict would be marked by roughly smeared notices of quarantine or strangers shot or by a string of decaying plunderers dangling from the telephone poles at the roadside about oxford big boards were put on the roofs warning all air wanderers off with the single word guns  taking their risks amidst these things cyclists still kept abroad and once or twice during berts long tramp powerful motor cars containing masked and goggled figures went tearing past him there were few police in evidence but ever and again squads of gaunt and tattered soldiercyclists would come drifting along and such encounters became more frequent as he got out of wales into england amidst all this wreckage they were still campaigning he had had some idea of resorting to the workhouses for the night if hunger pressed him too closely but some of these were closed and others converted into temporary hospitals and one he came up to at twilight near a village in gloucestershire stood with all its doors and windows open silent as the grave and as he found to his horror by stumbling along evilsmelling corridors full of unburied dead  from gloucestershire bert went northward to the british aeronautic park outside birmingham in the hope that he might be taken on and given food for there the government or at any rate the war office still existed as an energetic fact concentrated amidst collapse and social disaster upon the effort to keep the british flag still flying in the air and trying to brisk up mayor and mayor and magistrate and magistrate in a new effort of organisation they had brought together all the best of the surviving artisans from that region they had provisioned the park for a siege and they were urgently building a larger type of butteridge machine bert could get no footing at this work he was not sufficiently skilled and he had drifted to oxford when the great fight occurred in which these works were finally wrecked he saw something but not very much of the battle from a place called boar hill he saw the asiatic squadron coming up across the hills to the southwest and he saw one of their airships circling southward again chased by two aeroplanes the one that was ultimately overtaken wrecked and burnt at edge hill but he never learnt the issue of the combat as a whole  he crossed the thames from eton to windsor and made his way round the south of london to bun hill and there he found his brother tom looking like some dark defensive animal in the old shop just recovering from the purple death and jessica upstairs delirious and as it seemed to him dying grimly she raved of sending out orders to customers and scolded tom perpetually lest he should be late with mrs thompsons potatoes and mrs hopkins cauliflower though all business had long since ceased and tom had developed a quite uncanny skill in the snaring of rats and sparrows and the concealment of certain stores of cereals and biscuits from plundered grocers shops tom received his brother with a sort of guarded warmth  lor he said its bert i thought youd be coming back some day and im glad to see you but i carnt arst you to eat anything because i avent got anything to eat where you been bert all this time  bert reassured his brother by a glimpse of a partly eaten swede and was still telling his story in fragments and parentheses when he discovered behind the counter a yellow and forgotten note addressed to himself whats this he said and found it was a yearold note from edna she came ere said tom like one who recalls a trivial thing arstin for you and arstin us to take er in that was after the battle and settin clapham rise afire i was for takin er in but jessica wouldnt ave itand so she borrowed five shillings of me quiet like and went on i dessay shes tole you  she had bert found she had gone on she said in her note to an aunt and uncle who had a brickfield near horsham and there at last after another fortnight of adventurous journeying bert found her  5  when bert and edna set eyes on one another they stared and laughed foolishly so changed they were and so ragged and surprised and then they both fell weeping  oh bertie boy she cried youve comeyouve come and put out her arms and staggered i told im he said hed kill me if i didnt marry him  but edna was not married and when presently bert could get talk from her she explained the task before him that little patch of lonely agricultural country had fallen under the power of a band of bullies led by a chief called bill gore who had begun life as a butcher boy and developed into a prizefighter and a professional sport they had been organised by a local nobleman of former eminence upon the turf but after a time he had disappeared no one quite knew how and bill had succeeded to the leadership of the countryside and had developed his teachers methods with considerable vigour there had been a strain of advanced philosophy about the local nobleman and his mind ran to improving the race and producing the overman which in practice took the form of himself especially and his little band in moderation marrying with some frequency bill followed up the idea with an enthusiasm that even trenched upon his popularity with his followers one day he had happened upon edna tending her pigs and had at once fallen awooing with great urgency among the troughs of slush edna had made a gallant resistance but he was still vigorously about and extraordinarily impatient he might she said come at any time and she looked bert in the eyes they were back already in the barbaric stage when a man must fight for his love  and here one deplores the conflicts of truth with the chivalrous tradition one would like to tell of bert sallying forth to challenge his rival of a ring formed and a spirited encounter and bert by some miracle of pluck and love and good fortune winning but indeed nothing of the sort occurred instead he reloaded his revolver very carefully and then sat in the best room of the cottage by the derelict brickfield looking anxious and perplexed and listening to talk about bill and his ways and thinking thinking then suddenly ednas aunt with a thrill in her voice announced the appearance of that individual he was coming with two others of his gang through the garden gate bert got up put the woman aside and looked out they presented remarkable figures they wore a sort of uniform of red golfing jackets and white sweaters football singlet and stockings and boots and each had let his fancy play about his headdress bill had a womans hat full of cocks feathers and all had wild slouching cowboy brims  bert sighed and stood up deeply thoughtful and edna watched him marvelling the women stood quite still he left the window and went out into the passage rather slowly and with the careworn expression of a man who gives his mind to a complex and uncertain business edna he called and when she came he opened the front door  he asked very simply and pointing to the foremost of the three that im sure and being told that it was shot his rival instantly and very accurately through the chest he then shot bills best man much less tidily in the head and then shot at and winged the third man as he fled the third gentleman yelped and continued running with a comical endon twist  then bert stood still meditating with the pistol in his hand and quite regardless of the women behind him  so far things had gone well  it became evident to him that if he did not go into politics at once he would be hanged as an assassin and accordingly and without a word to the women he went down to the village publichouse he had passed an hour before on his way to edna entered it from the rear and confronted the little band of ambiguous roughs who were drinking in the taproom and discussing matrimony and bills affection in a facetious but envious manner with a casually held but carefully reloaded revolver and an invitation to join what he called i regret to say a vigilance committee under his direction its wanted about ere and some of us are gettin it up he presented himself as one having friends outside though indeed he had no friends at all in the world but edna and her aunt and two female cousins  there was a quick but entirely respectful discussion of the situation they thought him a lunatic who had tramped into this neighbourhood ignorant of bill they desired to temporise until their leader came bill would settle him some one spoke of bill  bills dead i jest shot im said bert we dont need reckon with im es shot and a redaired chap with a squint es shot weve settled up all that there aint going to be no more bill ever ed got wrong ideas about marriage and things its is sort of chap were after  that carried the meeting  bill was perfunctorily buried and berts vigilance committee for so it continued to be called reigned in his stead  that is the end of this story so far as bert smallways is concerned we leave him with his edna to become squatters among the clay and oak thickets of the weald far away from the stream of events from that time forth life became a succession of peasant encounters an affair of pigs and hens and small needs and little economies and children until clapham and bun hill and all the life of the scientific age became to bert no more than the fading memory of a dream he never knew how the war in the air went on nor whether it still went on there were rumours of airships going and coming and of happenings londonward once or twice their shadows fell on him as he worked but whence they came or whither they went he could not tell even his desire to tell died out for want of food at times came robbers and thieves at times came diseases among the beasts and shortness of food once the country was worried by a pack of boarhounds he helped to kill he went through many inconsecutive irrelevant adventures he survived them all  accident and death came near them both ever and again and passed them by and they loved and suffered and were happy and she bore him many childreneleven childrenone after the other of whom only four succumbed to the necessary hardships of their simple life they lived and did well as well was understood in those days they went the way of all flesh year by year     the epilogue  it happened that one bright summers morning exactly thirty years after the launching of the first german airfleet an old man took a small boy to look for a missing hen through the ruins of bun hill and out towards the splintered pinnacles of the crystal palace he was not a very old man he was as a matter of fact still within a few weeks of sixtythree but constant stooping over spades and forks and the carrying of roots and manure and exposure to the damps of life in the openair without a change of clothing had bent him into the form of a sickle moreover he had lost most of his teeth and that had affected his digestion and through that his skin and temper in face and expression he was curiously like that old thomas smallways who had once been coachman to sir peter bone and this was just as it should be for he was tom smallways the son who formerly kept the little greengrocers shop under the straddle of the monorail viaduct in the high street of bun hill but now there were no greengrocers shops and tom was living in one of the derelict villas hard by that unoccupied building site that had been and was still the scene of his daily horticulture he and his wife lived upstairs and in the drawing and dining rooms which had each french windows opening on the lawn and all about the ground floor generally jessica who was now a lean and lined and baldish but still very efficient and energetic old woman kept her three cows and a multitude of gawky hens these two were part of a little community of stragglers and returned fugitives perhaps a hundred and fifty souls of them all together that had settled down to the new conditions of things after the panic and famine and pestilence that followed in the wake of the war they had come back from strange refuges and hidingplaces and had squatted down among the familiar houses and begun that hard struggle against nature for food which was now the chief interest of their lives they were by sheer preoccupation with that a peaceful people more particularly after wilkes the house agent driven by some obsolete dream of acquisition had been drowned in the pool by the ruined gasworks for making inquiries into title and displaying a litigious turn of mind he had not been murdered you understand but the people had carried an exemplary ducking ten minutes or so beyond its healthy limits  this little community had returned from its original habits of suburban parasitism to what no doubt had been the normal life of humanity for nearly immemorial years a life of homely economies in the most intimate contact with cows and hens and patches of ground a life that breathes and exhales the scent of cows and finds the need for stimulants satisfied by the activity of the bacteria and vermin it engenders such had been the life of the european peasant from the dawn of history to the beginning of the scientific era so it was the large majority of the people of asia and africa had always been wont to live for a time it had seemed that by virtue of machines and scientific civilisation europe was to be lifted out of this perpetual round of animal drudgery and that america was to evade it very largely from the outset and with the smash of the high and dangerous and splendid edifice of mechanical civilisation that had arisen so marvellously back to the land came the common man back to the manure  the little communities still haunted by ten thousand memories of a greater state gathered and developed almost tacitly a customary law and fell under the guidance of a medicine man or a priest the world rediscovered religion and the need of something to hold its communities together at bun hill this function was entrusted to an old baptist minister he taught a simple but adequate faith in his teaching a good principle called the word fought perpetually against a diabolical female influence called the scarlet woman and an evil being called alcohol this alcohol had long since become a purely spiritualised conception deprived of any element of material application it had no relation to the occasional finds of whiskey and wine in londoners cellars that gave bun hill its only holidays he taught this doctrine on sundays and on weekdays he was an amiable and kindly old man distinguished by his quaint disposition to wash his hands and if possible his face daily and with a wonderful genius for cutting up pigs he held his sunday services in the old church in the beckenham road and then the countryside came out in a curious reminiscence of the urban dress of edwardian times all the men without exception wore frock coats top hats and white shirts though many had no boots tom was particularly distinguished on these occasions because he wore a top hat with gold lace about it and a green coat and trousers that he had found upon a skeleton in the basement of the urban and district bank the women even jessica came in jackets and immense hats extravagantly trimmed with artificial flowers and exotic birds feathersof which there were abundant supplies in the shops to the northand the children there were not many children because a large proportion of the babies born in bun hill died in a few days time of inexplicable maladies had similar clothes cut down to accommodate them even stringers little grandson of four wore a large top hat  that was the sunday costume of the bun hill district a curious and interesting survival of the genteel traditions of the scientific age on a weekday the folk were dingily and curiously hung about with dirty rags of housecloth and scarlet flannel sacking curtain serge and patches of old carpet and went either barefooted or on rude wooden sandals these people the reader must understand were an urban population sunken back to the state of a barbaric peasantry and so without any of the simple arts a barbaric peasantry would possess in many ways they were curiously degenerate and incompetent they had lost any idea of making textiles they could hardly make up clothes when they had material and they were forced to plunder the continually dwindling supplies of the ruins about them for cover  all the simple arts they had ever known they had lost and with the breakdown of modern drainage modern water supply shopping and the like their civilised methods were useless their cooking was worse than primitive it was a feeble muddling with food over wood fires in rusty drawingroom fireplaces for the kitcheners burnt too much among them all no sense of baking or brewing or metalworking was to be found  their employment of sacking and suchlike coarse material for workaday clothing and their habit of tying it on with string and of thrusting wadding and straw inside it for warmth gave these people an odd packed appearance and as it was a weekday when tom took his little nephew for the henseeking excursion so it was they were attired  so youve really got to bun hill at last teddy said old tom beginning to talk and slackening his pace so soon as they were out of range of old jessica youre the last of berts boys for me to see wat ive seen young bert ive seen sissie and matt tom whats called after me and peter the traveller people brought you along all right eh  i managed said teddy who was a dry little boy  didnt want to eat you on the way  they was all right said teddy and on the way near leatherhead we saw a man riding on a bicycle  my word said tom there aint many of those about nowadays where was he going  said e was going to dorking if the high road was good enough but i doubt if he got there all about burford it was flooded we came over the hill unclewhat they call the roman road thats high and safe  dont know it said old tom but a bicycle youre sure it was a bicycle had two wheels  it was a bicycle right enough  why i remember a time teddy where there was bicycles no end when you could stand just herethe road was as smooth as a board thenand see twenty or thirty coming and going at the same time bicycles and motybicycles moty cars all sorts of whirly things  no said teddy  i do theyd keep on going by all dayundreds and undreds  but where was they all going asked teddy  tearin off to brightonyou never seen brighton i expectits down by the sea used to be a moce mazing placeand coming and going from london  why  they did  but why  lord knows why teddy they did then you see that great thing there like a great big rusty nail sticking up higher than all the houses and that one yonder and that and how somethings fell in between em among the houses they was parts of the monorail they went down to brighton too and all day and night there was people going great cars as big as ouses full of people  the little boy regarded the rusty evidences acrosss the narrow muddy ditch of cowdroppings that had once been a high street he was clearly disposed to be sceptical and yet there the ruins were he grappled with ideas beyond the strength of his imagination  what did they go for he asked all of em  they ad to everything was on the go those dayseverything  yes but where did they come from  all round ere teddy there was people living in those ouses and up the road more ouses and more people youd ardly believe me teddy but its bible truth you can go on that way for ever and ever and keep on coming on ouses more ouses and more theres no end to em no end they get bigger and bigger his voice dropped as though he named strange names  its london he said  and its all empty now and left alone all day its left alone you dont find ardly a man you wont find nothing but dogs and cats after the rats until you get round by bromley and beckenham and there you find the kentish men herding swine nice rough lot they are too i tell you that so long as the sun is up its as still as the grave i been about by dayorfen and orfen he paused  and all those ouses and streets and ways used to be full of people before the war in the air and the famine and the purple death they used to be full of people teddy and then came a time when they was full of corpses when you couldnt go a mile that way before the stink of em drove you back it was the purple death ad killed em every one the cats and dogs and ens and vermin caught it everything and every one ad it jest a few of us appened to live i pulled through and your aunt though it made er lose er air why you find the skeletons in the ouses now this way we been into all the ouses and took what we wanted and buried moce of the people but up that way norwood way theres ouses with the glass in the windows still and the furniture not touchedall dusty and falling to piecesand the bones of the people lying some in bed some about the ouse jest as the purple death left em fiveandtwenty years ago i went into oneme and old higgins las yearand there was a room with books teddyyou know what i mean by books teddy  i seen em i seen em with pictures  well books all round teddy undreds of books beyondrhyme or reason as the saying

takes one out and opens it  i looked and there teddy was a cullud picture oh so lovely it was a picture of women and serpents in a garden i never see anything like it  this suits me said old higgins to rights  and then kind of friendly he gave the book a pat  old tom smallways paused impressively  and then said teddy  it all fell to dus white dus he became still more impressive we didnt touch no more of them books that day not after that  for a long time both were silent then tom playing with a subject that attracted him with a fatal fascination repeated all day long they liestill as the grave  teddy took the point at last dont they lie o nights he asked  old tom shook his head nobody knows boy nobody knows  but what could they do  nobody knows nobody aint seen to tell not nobody  nobody  they tell tales said old tom they tell tales but there aint no believing em i gets ome about sundown and keeps indoors so i cant say nothing can i but theres them that thinks some things and them as thinks others ive eard its unlucky to take cloes off of em unless they got white bones theres stories  the boy watched his uncle sharply wot stories he said  stories of moonlight nights and things walking about but i take no stock in em i keeps in bed if you listen to storieslord youll get afraid of yourself in a field at midday  the little boy looked round and ceased his questions for a space  they say theres a og man in becknam what was lost in london three days and three nights e went up after whiskey to cheapside and lorst is way among the ruins and wandered three days and three nights e wandered about and the streets kep changing sos he couldnt get ome if e adnt remembered some words out of the bible e might ave been there now all day e went and all nightand all day long it was still it was as still as death all day long until the sunset came and the twilight thickened and then it began to rustle and whisper and go pitapat with a sound like urrying feet  he paused  yes said the little boy breathlessly go on what then  a sound of carts and orses there was and a sound of cabs and omnibuses and then a lot of whistling shrill whistles whistles that froze is marrer and directly the whistles began things begun to show people in the streets urrying people in the ouses and shops busying themselves moty cars in the streets a sort of moonlight in all the lamps and winders people i say teddy but they wasnt people they was the ghosts of them that was overtook the ghosts of them that used to crowd those streets and they went past im and through im and never eeded im went by like fogs and vapours teddy and sometimes they was cheerful and sometimes they was orrible orrible beyond words and once e come to a place called piccadilly teddy and there was lights blazing like daylight and ladies and gentlemen in splendid cloes crowding the pavement and taxicabs follering along the road and as e looked they all went evilevil in the face teddy and it seemed to im suddenly they saw im and the women began to look at im and say things to imorriblewicked things one come very near im teddy right up to im and looked into is faceclose and she adnt got a face to look with only a painted skull and then e see they was all painted skulls and one after another they crowded on im saying orrible things and catchin at im and threatenin and coaxing im so that is eart near left is body for fear  yes gasped teddy in an unendurable pause  then it was he remembered the words of scripture and saved himself alive the lord is my elper e says therefore i will fear nothing and straightaway there came a cockcrowing and the street was empty from end to end and after that the lord was good to im and guided im ome  teddy stared and caught at another question but who was the people he asked who lived in all these ouses what was they  gentmen in business people with moneyleastways we thought it was money till everything smashed up and then seemingly it was jes paperall sorts why there was undreds of thousands of them there was millions ive seen that i street there regular sos you couldnt walk along the pavements shoppin time with women and people shoppin  but whered they get their food and things  bort em in shops like i used to ave ill show you the place teddy if we go back people nowadays avent no idee of a shopno idee plateglass windersits all greek to them why ive ad as much as a ton and a arf of petaties to andle all at one time youd open your eyes till they dropped out to see jes what i used to ave in my shop baskets of pears eaped up marrers apples

going by kerridges people organgrinders german bands always something going pastalways if it wasnt for those empty ouses id think it all a dream  but what killed all the people uncle asked teddy  it was a smashup said old tom everything was going right until they started that war everything was going like clockwork everybody was busy and everybody was appy and everybody got a good square meal every day  he met incredulous eyes everybody he said firmly if you couldnt get it anywhere else you could get it in the workhuss a nice ot bowl of soup called skilly and bread bettern any one knows ow to make now reglar white bread govment bread  teddy marvelled but said nothing it made him feel deep longings that he found it wisest to fight down  for a time the old man resigned himself to the pleasures of gustatory reminiscence his lips moved pickled sammin he whispered an vinegar dutch cheese beer a pipe of terbakker  but ow did the people get killed asked teddy presently  there was the war the war was the beginning of it the war banged and flummocked about but it didnt really kill many people but it upset things they came and set fire to london and burnt and sank all the ships there used to be in the thameswe could see the smoke and steam for weeksand they threw a bomb into the crystal palace and made a bustup and broke down the rail lines and things like that but as for killin people it was just accidental if they did they killed each other more there was a great fight all hereabout one day teddyup in the air great things bigger than fifty ouses bigger than the crystal palacebigger bigger than anything flying about up in the air and whacking at each other and dead men fallin off em triffic but it wasnt so much the people they killed as the business they stopped there wasnt any business doin teddy there wasnt any money about and nothin to buy if you ad it  but ow did the people get killed said the little boy in the pause  im tellin you teddy said the old man it was the stoppin of business come next suddenly there didnt seem to be any money there was chequesthey was a bit of paper written on and they was jes as good as moneyjes as good if they come from customers you knew then all of a sudden they wasnt i was left with three of em and two id given change then it got about that fivepun notes were no good and then the silver sort of went off gold you couldnt get for love oranything the banks in london ad got it and the banks was all smashed up everybody went bankrup everybody was thrown out of work everybody  he paused and scrutinised his hearer the small boys intelligent face expressed hopeless perplexity  thats ow it appened said old tom he sought for some means of expression it was like stoppin a clock he said things were quiet for a bit deadly quiet except for the airships fighting about in the sky and then people begun to get excited i remember my lars customer the very lars customer that ever i ad he was a mr moses gluckstein a city gent and very pleasant and fond of sparrowgrass and chokes and e cut inthere adnt been no customers for daysand began to talk very fast offerin me for anything i ad anything petaties or anything its weight in gold e said it was a little speculation e wanted to try e said it was a sort of bet reely and very likely ed lose but never mind that e wanted to try e always ad been a gambler e said e said id only got to weigh it out and ed give me is cheque right away well that led to a bit of a argument perfect respectful it was but a argument about whether a cheque was still good and while e was explaining there come by a lot of these here unemployed with a great banner they ad for every one to readevery one could read those dayswe want food three or four of em suddenly turns and comes into my shop  got any food says one  no i says not to sell i wish i ad but if i ad im afraid i couldnt let you have it this gent es been offerin me  mr gluckstein e tried to stop me but it was too late  whats e been offerin you says a great big chap with a atchet whats e been offerin you i ad to tell  boys e said eres another feenancier and they took im out there and then and ung im on a lampose down the street e never lifted a finger to resist after i tole on im e never said a word  tom meditated for a space first chap i ever sin ung he said  ow old was you asked teddy  bout thirty said old tom  why i saw free pigstealers ung before i was six said teddy father took me because of my birfday being near said i ought to be blooded  well you never saw noone killed by a moty car anyow said old tom after a moment of chagrin and you never saw no dead men carried into a chemis shop  teddys momentary triumph faded no he said i avent  nor wont nor wont youll never see the things ive seen never not if you live to be a undred well as i was saying thats how the famine and riotin began then there was strikes and socialism things i never did old with worse and worse there was fightin and shootin down and burnin and plundering they broke up the banks up in london and got the gold but they couldnt make food out of gold ow did we get on well we kep quiet we didnt interfere with noone and noone didnt interfere with us we ad some old tatoes about but mocely we lived on rats ours was a old ouse full of rats and the famine never seemed to bother em orfen we got a rat orfen but moce of the people who lived hereabouts was too tender stummicked for rats didnt seem to fancy em theyd been used to all sorts of fallals and they didnt take to onest feeding not till it was too late died rather  it was the famine began to kill people even before the purple death came along they was dying like flies at the end of the summer ow i remember it all i was one of the first to ave it i was out seein if i mightnt get old of a cat or somethin and then i went round to my bit of ground to see whether i couldnt get up some young turnips id forgot and i was took something awful youve no idee the pain teddyit doubled me up pretty near i jes lay down by at there corner and your aunt come along to look for me and dragged me ome like a sack  id never ave got better if it adnt been for your aunt tom she says to me you got to get well and i ad to then she sickened she sickened but there aint much dyin about your aunt lor she says as if id leave you to go muddlin along alone thats what she says shes got a tongue as your aunt but it took er air offand arst though i might shes never cared for the wig i got erorf the old lady what was in the vicarage garden  well this ere purple deathit jes wiped people out teddy you couldnt bury em and it took the dogs and the cats too and the rats and orses at last every house and garden was full of dead bodies london way you couldnt go for the smell of there and we ad to move out of the i street into that villa we got and all the water run short that way the drains and underground tunnels took it gor knows where the purple death come from some say one thing and some another some said it come from eatin rats and some from eatin nothin some say the asiatics brought it from some i place thibet i think where it never did nobody much arm all i know is it come after the famine and the famine come after the penic and the penic come after the war  teddy thought what made the purple death he asked  avent i tole you  but why did they ave a penic  they ad it  but why did they start the war  they couldnt stop theirselves aving them airships made em  and ow did the war end  lord knows if its ended boy said old tom lord knows if its ended theres been travellers through erethere was a chap only two summers agosay its goin on still they say theres bands of people up north who keep on with it and people in germany and china and merica and places e said they still got flyingmachines and gas and things but we avent seen nothin in the air now for seven years and nobody asnt come nigh of us last we saw was a crumpled sort of airship going awayover there it was a littleishsized thing and lopsided as though it ad something the matter with it  he pointed and came to a stop at a gap in the fence the vestiges of the old fence from which in the company of his neighbour mr stringer the milkman he had once watched the south of england aero clubs saturday afternoon ascents dim memories it may be of that particular afternoon returned to him  there down there where all that rus looks so red and bright thats the gasworks  whats gas asked the little boy  oh a hairy sort of nothin what you put in balloons to make em go up and you used to burn it till the lectricity come  the little boy tried vainly to imagine gas on the basis of these particulars then his thoughts reverted to a previous topic  but why didnt they end the war  obstinacy everybody was getting urt but everybody was urtin and everybody was ighspirited and patriotic and so they smeshed up things instead they jes went on smeshin and afterwards they jes got desprite and savige  it ought to ave ended said the little boy  it didnt ought to ave begun said old tom but people was proud people was ladydaish and uppish and proud too much meat and drink they ad give innot them and after a bit nobody arst em to give in nobody arst em  he sucked his old gums thoughtfully and his gaze strayed away across the valley to where the shattered glass of the crystal palace glittered in the sun a dim large sense of waste and irrevocable lost opportunities pervaded his mind he repeated his ultimate judgment upon all these things obstinately slowly and conclusively his final saying upon the matter  you can say what you like he said it didnt ought ever to ave begun  he said it simplysomebody somewhere ought to have stopped something but who or how or why were all beyond his ken
