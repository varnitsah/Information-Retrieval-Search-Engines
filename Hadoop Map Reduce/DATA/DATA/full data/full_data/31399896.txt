31399896	black ivory by rm ballantyne    although the books title black ivory denotes dealing in the slave trade it is not our heroes who are doing it  at the very first chapter there is a shipwreck which leaves the son of the charterer of the sinking ship and a seaman friend of his alone on the east coast of africa where arab and portuguese slave traders were still carrying out their evil trade despite the great efforts of patrolling british warships to limit it and free the unfortunates whom they found being carried away in the arab dhows  our heroes encountered a slave trader almost at the very spot where they come ashore and thereby managed to get to zanzibar in a british warship that had captured the traders dhow in which our friends had hitched a lift  at zanzibar they pick up some funds and set forth on a journey into the interior  here again they encounter the vile trade but most of the story deals with other encounters of a more acceptable nature  this book will open your eyes to what really went on  at the time of writing slavedealing on the west coast of africa was due to the efforts of the british almost extinct but this was not the case on the east coast  your reviewer found it very moving  makes a good audiobook of about ten and a half hours duration    black ivory by rm ballantyne  in writing this book my aim has been to give a true picture in outline of the slave trade as it exists at the present time on the east coast of africa  in order to do this i have selected from the most trustworthy sources what i believe to be the most telling points of the trade and have woven these together into a tale the warp of which is composed of thick cords of fact the woof of slight lines of fiction just sufficient to hold the fabric together  exaggeration has easily been avoided becauseas dr livingstone says in regard to the slavetradeexaggeration is impossible  if the readers taste should be offended by finding the tragic and comic elements in too close proximity i trust that he will bear in remembrance that such is life and that the writer who would be true to life must follow not lead nature  i have to acknowledge myself indebted to dr ryan late bishop of mauritius to the rev  charles new interpreter to the livingstone search expedition to edward hutchinson esquire lay secretary to the church missionary society and others for kindly furnishing me with information in connexion with the slave trade  besides examining the parliamentary bluebooks which treat of this subject i have read or consulted among others the various authoritative works to which reference is made in the footnotes sprinkled throughout this bookall of which works bear the strongest possible testimony to the fact that the horrible traffic in human beings is in all respects as bad at the present time on the east coast of africa as it ever was on the west coast in the days of wilberforce  i began my tale in the hope that i might produce something to interest the young perchance also the old in a most momentous causethe total abolition of the african slavetrade  i close it with the prayer that god may make it a tooth in the file which shall eventually cut the chains of slavery and set the black man free  rm ballantyne  1873    chapter one  shows that a good beginning may sometimes be followed by a bad ending  six feet water in the hold sir  that would not have been a pleasant announcement to the captain of the aurora at any time but its unpleasantness was vastly increased by the fact that it greeted him near the termination of what had been up to that point of time an exceedingly prosperous voyage  are you sure davis asked the captain try again  he gave the order under the influence of that feeling which is styled hoping against hope and himself accompanied the ships carpenter to see it obeyed  six feet two inches was the result of this investigation  the vessel a large english brig had sprung a leak and was rolling heavily in a somewhat rough sea off the east coast of africa  it was no consolation to her captain that the shores of the great continent were visible on his lee because a tremendous surf roared along the whole line of coast threatening destruction to any vessel that should venture to approach and there was no harbour of refuge nigh  shes sinking fast mr seadrift said the captain to a stout franklooking youth of about twenty summers who leant against the bulwarks and gazed wistfully at the land the carpenter cannot find the leak and the rate at which the water is rising shows that she cannot float long  what then do you propose to do inquired young seadrift with a troubled expression of countenance  abandon her replied the captain  well you may do so captain but i shall not forsake my fathers ship as long as she can float  why not beach her somewhere on the coast  by so doing we might save part of the cargo and at all events shall have done the utmost that lay in our power  look at the coast returned the captain where would you beach her no doubt there is smooth water inside the reef but the channels through it if there be any here are so narrow that it would be almost certain death to make the attempt  the youth turned away without replying  he was sorely perplexed  just before leaving england his father had said to him harold my boy heres your chance for paying a visit to the land youve read and talked so much about and wished so often to travel through  i have chartered a brig and shall send her out to zanzibar with a cargo of beads cotton cloth brass wire and such like what say you to go as supercargo  of course you wont be able to follow in the steps of livingstone or mungo park but while the brig is at zanzibar you will have an opportunity of running across the channel the island being only a few miles from the main and having a short run upcountry to see the niggers and perchance have a slap at a hippopotamus  ill line your pockets so that you wont lack the sinews of war without which travel either at home or abroad is but sorry work and i shall only expect you to give a good account of ship and cargo on your returncome is it fixed  need we say that harold leaped joyfully at the proposal  and now here he was called on to abandon the aurora to her fate as we have said near the end of a prosperous voyage  no wonder that he was perplexed  the crew were fully aware of the state of matters  by the captains orders they stood ready to lower the two largest boats into which they had put much of their worldly goods and provisions as they could hold with safety  port port your helm said the captain to the man at the wheel  port it is sir replied the man at the wheel who was one of those broadshouldered bigchested loosegarmented widetrousered barenecked freeandeasy offhand jovial tars who have done so much in years gone by to increase the wealth and prosperity of the british empire and who although confessedly scarce are considerately allowed to perish in hundreds annually on our shores for want of a little reasonable legislation  but cheer up ye jolly tars  there is a glimmer of sunrise on your political horizon  it really does seem as if in regard to you there were at last a good time coming  port port repeated the captain with a glance at the compass and the sky  port it is sir again replied the jovial one  steady  lower away the boat ladsnow mr seadrift said the captain turning with an air of decision to the young supercargo the time has come for you to make up your mind  the water is rising in the hold and the ship is as you see settling fast down  i need not say to you that it is with the utmost regret i find it necessary to abandon her but selfpreservation and the duty i owe to my men render the step absolutely necessary  do you intend to go with us  no captain i dont replied harold seadrift firmly  i do not blame you for consulting your own safety and doing what you believe to be your duty but i have already said that i shall stick by the ship as long as she can float  well sir i regret it but you must do as you think best replied the captain turning awaynow lads jump in  the men obeyed but several of those who were last to quit the ship looked back and called to the freeandeasy man who still stood at the wheelcome along disco well have to shove off directly  shove off wen you please replied the man at the wheel in a deep rich voice whose tones were indicative of a sort of goodhumoured contempt wot i means for to do is to stop where i am  itll never be said of disco lillihammer that he forsook the owners son in distress  but youll go to the bottom man if you dont come  well wot if i do  id raither go to the bottom with a brave man than remain at the top with a set o fine fellers like you  some of the men received this reply with a laugh others frowned and a few swore while some of them looked regretfully at their selfwilled shipmate for it must not be supposed that all the tars who float upon the sea are of the bold candid openhanded type though we really believe that a large proportion of them are so  be this as it may the boats left the brig and were soon far astern  thank you lillihammer said harold going up and grasping the horny hand of the selfsacrificing seadog  this is very kind of you though i fear it may cost you your life  but it is too late to talk of that we must fix on some plan and act at once  the werry thing sir said disco quietly that wos runnin in my own mind cos its werry clear that we haint got too many minits to spare in confabilation  well what do you suggest  arter you sir said disco pulling his forelock you are capting now an ought to give orders  then i think the best thing we can do rejoined harold is to make straight for the shore search for an opening in the reef run through and beach the vessel on the sand  what say you  as theres nothin else left for us to do replied disco thats zactly wot i think too an the sooner we does it the better  down with the helm then cried harold springing forward and ill ease off the sheets  in a few minutes the aurora was surging before a stiff breeze towards the line of foam which indicated the outlying reef and inside of which all was comparatively calm  if we only manage to get inside said harold we shall do well  disco made no reply  his whole attention was given to steering the brig and running his eyes anxiously along the breakers the sound of which increased to a thunderous roar as they drew near  there seems something like a channel yonder said harold pointing anxiously to a particular spot in the reef  i see it sir was the curt reply  a few minutes more of suspense and the brig drove into the supposed channel and struck with such violence that the foremast snapped off near the deck and went over the side  god help us were lost exclaimed harold as a towering wave lifted the vessel up and hurled her like a plaything on the rocks  stand by to jump sir cried disco  another breaker came roaring in at the moment overwhelmed the brig rolled her over on her beamends and swept the two men out of her  they struggled gallantly to free themselves from the wreck and succeeding with difficulty swam across the sheltered water to the shore on which they finally landed  harolds first exclamation was one of thankfulness for their deliverance to which disco replied with a hearty amen and then turning round and surveying the coast while he slowly thrust his hands into his wet trouserpockets wondered whereabouts in the world they had got to  to the east coast of africa to be sure observed the young supercargo with a slight smile as he wrung the water out of the foot of his trousers the place we were bound for you know  werry good so here we arecome to an anchor  well i only wish he added sitting down on a piece of driftwood and rummaging in the pockets before referred to as if in search of somethingi only wish id kep on my weskit cause all my baccys there and it would be a rael comfort to have a quid in the circumstances  it was fortunate for the wrecked voyagers that the set of the current had carried portions of their vessel to the shore at a considerable distance from the spot where they had landed because a band of natives armed with spears and bows and arrows had watched the wreck from the neighbouring heights and had hastened to that part of the coast on which they knew from experience the cargo would be likely to drift  the heads of the swimmers being but small specks in the distance had escaped observation  thus they had landed unseen  the spot was near the entrance to a small river or creek which was partially concealed by the formation of the land and by mangrove trees  harold was the first to observe that they had not been cast on an uninhabited shore  while gazing round him and casting about in his mind what was best to be done he heard shouts and hastening to a rocky point that hid part of the coast from his view looked cautiously over it and saw the natives  he beckoned to disco who joined him  they havent a friendly look about em observed the seaman and theyre summat scant in the matter of clothin  appearances are often deceptive returned his companion but i so far agree with you that i think our wisest course will be to retire into the woods and there consult as to our future proceedings for it is quite certain that as we cannot live on sand and salt water neither can we safely sleep in wet clothes or on the bare ground in a climate like this  hastening towards the entrance to the creek the unfortunate pair entered the bushes through which they pushed with some difficulty until they gained a spot sufficiently secluded for their purpose when they observed that they had passed through a belt of underwood beyond which there appeared to be an open space  a few steps further and they came out on a sort of natural basin formed by the creek in which floated a large boat of a peculiar construction with very piraticallooking lateen sails  their astonishment at this unexpected sight was increased by the fact that on the opposite bank of the creek there stood several men armed with muskets which latter were immediately pointed at their breasts  the first impulse of the shipwrecked friends was to spring back into the bushesthe second to advance and hold up their empty hands to show that they were unarmed  hold on exclaimed disco in a free and easy confidential tone were friends we are shipwrecked mariners we is so ground arms my lads an make your minds easy  one of the men made some remark to another who from his oriental dress was easily recognised by harold as one of the arab traders of the coast  his men appeared to be halfcastes  the arab nodded gravely and said something which induced his men to lower their muskets  then with a wave of his hand he invited the strangers to come over the creek to him  this was rendered possible by the breadth of the boat already mentioned being so great that while one side touched the right bank of the creek the other was within four or five feet of the left  without hesitation harold seadrift bounded lightly from the bank to the halfdeck of the boat and stepping ashore walked up to the arab closely followed by his companion  do you speak english asked harold  the arab shook his head and said arabic portuguese  harold therefore shook his headthen with a hopeful look said french interrogatively  the arab repeated the shake of his head but after a moments thought said i know littil engleesh speak where comes you  we have been wrecked began harold the arab glanced gravely at his dripping clothes as if to say i had guessed as much and this man and i are the only survivors of the crew of our shipat least the only two who swam on shore the others went off in a boat  come you from manofwar asked the arab with a keen glance at the candid countenance of the youth  no our vessel was a trader bound for zanzibar  she now lies in fragments on the shore and we have escaped with nothing but the clothes on our backs  can you tell us whether there is a town or a village in the neighbourhood for as you see we stand sadly in need of clothing food and shelter  we have no money but we have good muscles and stout hearts and could work our way well enough i doubt not  young seadrift said this modestly but the remark was unnecessary for it would have been quite obvious to a man of much less intelligence than the arab that a youth who although just entering on the age of manhood was six feet high deepchested broadshouldered and as lithe as a kitten could not find any difficulty in working his way while his companion though a little older was evidently quite as capable  there be no town no village for fifty miles from where you stand replied the arab  indeed exclaimed harold in surprise for he had always supposed the east african coast to be rather populous  thats a blue lookout anyhow observed disco for it necessitates starvation unless this good gentleman will hire us to work his craft it aint very shipshape to be sure but anything of a seagoin craft comes more or less handy to an old salt  the trader listened with the politeness and profound gravity that seems to be characteristic of orientals but by no sign or expression showed whether he understood what was said  i go to zanzibar said he turning to harold and will take you so you wish  there was something sinister in the mans manner which harold did not like but as he was destitute besides being in the arabs power and utterly ignorant of the country he thought it best to put a good face on matters and therefore thanked him for his kind offer and assured him that on reaching zanzibar he would be in a position to pay for his passage as well as that of his friend  may i ask continued harold what your occupation is  i am trader  harold thought he would venture another question  in what sort of goods do you trade  ivory  some be white an some be what your contrymans do call black  black exclaimed harold in surprise  yees black replied the trader  white ivory do come from the elephanthims tusk black ivory do comehe smiled slightly at this pointfrom the land everywheres  it bees our chef artikil of trade  indeed  i never heard of it before  no replied the trader you shall see it much here  but i go talk with my mans  wait  saying this in a tone which savoured somewhat unpleasantly of command the arab went towards a small hut near to which his men were standing and entered into conversation with them  it was evident that they were ill pleased with what he said at first for there was a good deal of remonstrance in their tones while they pointed frequently in a certain direction which seemed to indicate the coastline but by degrees their tones changed and they laughed and chuckled a good deal as if greatly tickled by the speech of the arab who however maintained a look of dignified gravity all the time  i dont like the looks o them fellers remarked disco after observing them in silence for some time  theyre a cutthroat set im quite sure an if youll take my advice mister seadrift well give em the slip an try to hunt up one o the native villages  i shouldnt wonder now if that chap was a slavetrader  the same idea has occurred to myself disco replied harold and i would willingly leave him if i thought there was a town or village within twenty miles of us but we are ignorant on that point and i have heard enough of the african climate to believe that it might cost us our lives if we were obliged to spend a night in the jungle without fire food or covering and with nothing on but a wet flannel shirt and pair of canvas breeches  no no lad we must not risk it  besides although some arabs are slavetraders it does not follow that all are this fellow may turn out better than he looks  disco lillihammer experienced some sensations of surprise on hearing his young friends remarks on the climate for he knew nothing whatever about that of africa having sailed chiefly in the arctic seas as a whalerand laboured under the delusion that no climate under the sun could in any degree affect his hardy and wellseasoned frame  he was too respectful however to let his thoughts be known  meanwhile the arab returned  i sail this night he said when moon go down  that not far before midnight  you mus keep by boat hereclose  if you go this way or that the niggers kill you  they not come here they know i is here  i go look after my goods and chattelsmy black ivory  maynt we go with ee misterwhats your name  my nameyoosoof replied the arab in a tone and with a look which were meant to command respect  well mister yoosoof continued disco if we may make bold to ax leave for to go with ee we could lend ee a helpin hand dye see to carry yer goods an chattels down to the boat  there is no need said yoosoof waving his hand and pointing to the hut before mentioned  go you can rest till we sail  sleep you will need it  there is littil rice in huteat that and make fire dry youselfs  so saying the arab left them by a path leading into the woods along which his men who were portuguese halfcastes had preceded him  make fire indeed exclaimed disco as he walked with his companion to the hut one would think from the freeandeasy way in which he tells us to make it that hes in the habit himself of striking it out o the point o his own nose or some such convenient fashion  more likely to flash it out of his eyes i should think said harold but see here the fellow knew what he was talking about  there is fire among these embers on the hearth  thats true replied disco going down on his knees and blowing them carefully  in a few minutes a spark leaped into a flame wood was heaped on and the flame speedily became a rousing fire before which they dried their garments while a pot of rice was put on to boil  scarcely had they proceeded thus far in their preparations when two men armed with muskets were seen to approach leading a negro girl between them  as they drew nearer it was observable that the girl had a brass ring round her neck to which a rope was attached  a slave exclaimed disco vehemently while the blood rushed to his face lets set her free  the indignant seaman had half sprung to his legs before harold seized and pulled him forcibly back  be quiet man said harold quickly  if we could free her by fighting i would help you but we cant  evidently we have got into a nest of slavers  rashness will only bring about our own death  be wise bide your time and we may live to do some good yet  he stopped abruptly for the new comers had reached the top of the winding path that led to the hut  a look of intense surprise overspread the faces of the two men when they entered and saw the englishmen sitting comfortably by the fire and both as if by instinct threw forward the muzzles of their muskets  oh come in come in make your minds easy cried disco in a halfsavage tone despite the warning he had received were all friends hereleastwise we cant help ourselves  fortunately for our mariner the men did not understand him and before they could make up their minds what to think of it or how to act harold rose and with a polite bow invited them to enter  do you understand english he asked  a frown and a decided shake of the head from both men was the reply the poor negro girl cowered behind her keepers as if she feared that violence were about to ensue  having tried french with a like result harold uttered the name yoosoof and pointed in the direction in which the trader had entered the woods  the men looked intelligently at each other and nodded  then harold said zanzibar and pointed in the direction in which he supposed that island lay  again the men glanced at each other and nodded  harold next said boatdhow and pointed towards the creek which remark and sign were received as before  good he continued slapping himself on the chest and pointing to his companion i go to zanzibar he goes she goes pointing to the girl you go and yoosoof goesall in the dhow together to zanzibartonightwhen moon goes down  dee understand  now then come along and have some rice  he finished up by slapping one of the men on the shoulder and lifting the kettle off the fire for the rice had already been cooked and only wanted warming  the men looked once again at each other nodded laughed and sat down on a log beside the fire opposite to the englishmen  they were evidently much perplexed by the situation and not knowing what to make of it were disposed in the meantime to be friendly  while they were busy with the rice disco gazed in silent wonder and with intense pity at the slavegirl who sat a little to one side of her guardians on a mat her small hands folded together resting on one knee her head drooping and her eyes cast down  the enthusiastic tar found it very difficult to restrain his feelings  he had heard of course more or less about african slavery from shipmates but he had never read about it and had never seriously given his thoughts to it although his native sense of freedom justice and fairplay had roused a feeling of indignation in his breast whenever the subject chanced to be discussed by him and his mates  but now for the first time in his life suddenly and unexpectedly he was brought face to face with slavery  no wonder that he was deeply moved  why mister seadrift he said in the confidential tone of one who imparts a new discovery i do honestly confess to ee that i think thats a pretty girl  i quite agree with you replied harold smiling  ay but i mean really pretty you know  ive always thought that all niggers had ugly flat noses an thick blubber lips  but look at that one her lips are scarce a bit thicker than those of many a goodlooking lass in england and they dont stick out at all and her nose aint flat a bit  its quite as good as my nancys nose an thats sayin a good deal i tell ee  moreover she aint blackshes brown  it is but justice to disco to say that he was right in his observations and to explain that the various negro tribes in africa differ very materially from each other some of them as we are told by dr livingstone possessing little of what in our eyes seems the characteristic ugliness of the negrosuch as thick lips flat noses protruding heels etceterabut being in every sense handsome races of humanity  the slavegirl whom disco admired and pitied so much belonged to one of these tribes and as was afterwards ascertained had been brought from the far interior  she appeared to be very young nevertheless there was a settled expression of meek sorrow and suffering on her face and though handsomely formed she was extremely thin no doubt from prolonged hardships on the journey down to the coast  here have somethin to eat exclaimed disco suddenly filling a tin plate with rice and carrying it to the girl who however shook her head without raising her eyes  youre not hungry poor thing said the seaman in a disappointed tone you look as if you should be  come try it he added stooping and patting her head  the poor child looked up as if frightened and shrank from the seamans touch but on glancing a second time in his honest face she appeared to feel confidence in him  nevertheless she would not touch the rice until her guardians said something to her sternly when she began to eat with an appetite that was eloquent  come now tell us what your name is lass said disco when she had finished the rice  of course the girl shook her head but appeared to wish to understand the question while the portuguese laughed and seemed amused with the englishmans eccentricities  look here now resumed the tar slapping his own chest vigorously disco disco disco thats medisco  and this man patting his companion on the breast is harold harold thats himharold  now then he added pointing straight at the girl youwhats you name eh  a gleam of intelligence shot from the girls expressive eyes and she displayed a double row of beautiful teeth as in a low soft voice she saidazinte  azinte come thats not a bad name why its a capital one  just suited to ee  well azinte my poor girl said disco with a fresh outburst of feeling as he clenched his horny right hand and dashed it into the palm of his left if i only knew how to set you free just now my dear id do itay if i was to be roasted alive for so doin  i would  youll never set anybody free in this world said harold seadrift with some severity if you go on talking and acting as you have done today  if these men had not by good fortune been ignorant of our language its my opinion that they would have blown our brains out before this time  you should restrain yourself man he continued gradually dropping into a remonstrative and then into an earnestly confidential tone we are utterly helpless just now  if you did succeed in freeing that girl at this moment it would only be to let her fall into the hands of some other slaveowner  besides that would not set free all the other slaves male and female who are being dragged from the interior of africa  you and i may perhaps do some small matter in the way of helping to free slaves if we keep quiet and watch our opportunity but we shall accomplish nothing if you give way to useless bursts of anger  poor lillihammer was subdued  youre right mister seadrift youre right sir and im a ass  i never could keep my feelings down  its all along of my havin bin made too much of by my mother dear old woman wen i was a boy  but ill make a effort sir ill clap a stopper on embottle em up and screw em down tight werry tight indeed  disco again sent his right fist into the palm of his left hand with something like the sound of a pistolshot to the no small surprise and alarm of the portuguese and rising went out to cool his heated brow in the open air    chapter two  yoosoofs black ivory  when yoosoof entered the woods as before stated for the purpose of looking after his property he followed a narrow footpath for about half a mile which led him to another part of the same creek at the entrance of which we introduced him to the reader  here under the deep shadow of umbrageous trees floated five large arab boats or dhows similar to the one which has been already referred to  they were quite empty and apparently unguarded for when yoosoof went down the bank and stood on a projecting rock which overlooked them no one replied to his lowtoned hail  repeating it once and still receiving no answer he sat quietly down on the rocks lighted a small pipe and waited patiently  the boats as we have said were empty but there were some curious appliances in them having the appearance of chains and wristlets and bars of iron running along and fixed to their decks or rather to the flooring of their holds  their long yards and sails were cleared and ready for hoisting  after the lapse of ten or fifteen minutes yoosoof raised his headfor he had been meditating deeply if one might judge from his attitudeand glanced in the direction of an opening in the bushes whence issued a silent and singular train of human beings  they were negroes secured by the necks or wristsmen women and childrenand guarded by armed halfcaste portuguese  when a certain number of them about a hundred or so had issued from the wood and crowded the banks of the creek they were ordered to stand still and the leader of the band advanced towards his master  these were some of yoosoofs goods and chattels his cattle his black ivory  you have been long in coming moosa said the arab trader as the man approached  i have replied moosa somewhat gruffly but the road was rough and long and the cattle were illconditioned as you see  the two men spoke in the portuguese tongue but as the natives and settlers on that coast speak a variety of languages and dialects we have no alternative good reader but to render all into english  make the more haste now said yoosoof get them shipped at once for we sail when the moon goes down  pick out the weakest among the lot those most likely to die and put them by themselves in the small dhow if we must sacrifice some of our wares to these meddling dogs the english we may as well give them the refuse  without remark moosa turned on his heel and proceeded to obey orders  truly to one unaccustomed to such scenes it would have appeared that all the negroes on the spot were most likely to die for a more wretched starved set of human beings could scarcely be imagined  they had just terminated a journey on foot of several hundreds of miles with insufficient food and under severe hardships  nearly all of them were lean to a degreemany so reduced that they resembled nothing but skeletons with a covering of black leather  some of the children were very young many of them mere infants clinging to the backs of the poor mothers who had carried them over mountain and plain through swamp and jungle in blistering sunshine and pelting rain for many weary days but prolonged suffering had changed the nature of these little ones they were as silent and almost as intelligently anxious as their seniors  there were no old pieces of merchandise there  most were youthful or in the prime of life a few were middleaged  difficult though the task appeared to be moosa soon selected about fifty men and women and a few children who were so fearfully emaciated that their chance of surviving appeared but small  these were cast loose and placed in a sitting posture in the hold of the smallest dhow as close together as they could be packed  their removal from the bank made room for more to issue from the wood which they did in a continuous stream  batch after batch was cast loose and stowed away in the manner already described until the holds of two of the large boats were filled each being capable of containing about two hundred souls  this was so far satisfactory to yoosoof who had expended a good deal of money on the venturesatisfactory even although he had lost a large proportion of the goodsfourfifths at least if not more by death and otherwise on the way down to the coast but that was a matter of little consequence  the price of black ivory was up in the market just at that time and the worthy merchant could stand a good deal of loss  the embarkation was effected with wonderful celerity and in comparative silence  only the stern voices of the halfcaste portuguese were heard as they ordered the slaves to move mingled with the occasional clank of a chain but no sounds proceeded from the thoroughly subdued and wornout slaves louder than a sigh or a halfsuppressed wail with now and then a shriek of pain when some of the weaker among them were quickened into activity by the lash  when all had been embarked two of the five boats still remained empty but yoosoof had a pretty good idea of the particular points along the coast where more cattle of a similar kind could be purchased therefore after stationing some of his men armed with muskets to guard the boats he returned with the remainder of them to the hut in which the englishmen had been left  there he found azinte and her guardians  he seemed angry with the latter at first but after a few minutes thought appeared to recover his equanimity and ordered the men to remove the ropes with which the girl was tethered then bidding her follow him he left the hut without taking any notice of the englishmen further than to say he would be back shortly before the time of sailing  yoosoofs motions were usually slow and his mien somewhat dignified but when occasion required he could throw off his oriental dignity and step out with the activity of a monkey  it was so on this occasion insomuch that azinte was obliged occasionally to run in order to keep up with him  proceeding about two miles in the woods along the shore without halt he came out at length on the margin of a bay at the head of which lay a small town  it was a sorrylooking place composed of wretchedly built houses most of which were thatched with the leaves of the cocoanut palm  nevertheless such as it was it possessed a mud fort an army of about thirty soldiers composed of portuguese convicts who had been sent there as a punishment for many crimes a governor who was understood to be honourable having been placed there by his excellency the governorgeneral at mozambique who had been himself appointed by his most faithful majesty the king of portugal  it was in quest of this governor that yoosoof bent his rapid steps besides all the advantages above enumerated the town drove a small trade in ivory ebony indigo orchella weed gum copal cocoanut oil and other articles of native produce and a very large though secret trade in human bodies andwe had almost writtensouls but the worthy people who dwelt there could not fetter souls although they could and very often did set them free  senhor francisco alfonso toledo bignoso letotti the governor was seated at the open window of his parlour just before yoosoof made his appearance conversing lightly with his only daughter the senhorina maraquita a beautiful brunette of about eighteen summers who had been brought up and educated in portugal  the governors wife had died a year before this time in madrid and the senhorina had gone to live with her father on the east coast of africa at which place she had arrived just six weeks previous to the date of the opening of our tale  among the various boats and vessels at anchor in the bay were seen the tapering masts of a british warsteamer  the senhorina and her sire were engaged in a gossiping criticism of the officers of this vessel when yoosoof was announced  audience was immediately granted  entering the room with azinte close behind him the arab stopped abruptly on beholding maraquita and bowed gravely  leave us my child said the governor in portuguese i have business to transact with this man  and why may not i stay to assist you father in this wonderful manmystery of transacting business asked maraquita with an arch smile  whenever you men want to get rid of women you frighten them away with business  if you wish not to explain something to us you shake your wise heads and call it business  is it not socome arab she added turning with a sprightly air to yoosoof you are a trader i suppose all arabs are i am told  well what sort of wares have you got to sell  yoosoof smiled slightly as he stepped aside and pointed to azinte  the speaking countenance of the portuguese girl changed as if by magic she had seen little and thought little about slavery during the brief period of her residence on the coast and had scarcely realised the fact that sambo with the thick lipsher fathers gardeneror the black cook and housemaids were slaves  it was the first entrance of a new idea with something like power into her mind when she saw a delicate mildlooking and pretty negro girl actually offered for sale  before she could bethink herself of any remark the door opened and in walked unannounced a man on whose somewhat handsome countenance villainy was clearly stamped  ha  marizano exclaimed senhor letotti rising you have thought better of it i presume  i have and i agree to your arrangement replied marizano in an offhand surly tone  there is nothing like necessity returned the governor with a laugh twere better to enjoy a roving life for a short time with a lightish purse in ones pocket than to attempt to keep a heavy purse with the addition of several ounces of lead in ones breast  how say you  marizano smiled and shrugged his broad shoulders but made no reply for just then his attention had been attracted to the slavegirl  for sale he inquired of the arab carelessly  yoosoof bowed his head slightly  how much  come come gentlemen interposed the governor with a laugh and a glance at his daughter you can settle this matter elsewhere  yoosoof has come here to talk with me on other mattersnow maraquita dear you had better retire for a short time  when the senhorina had somewhat unwillingly obeyed the governor turned to yoosoof i presume you have no objection to marizanos presence during our interview seeing that he is almost as well acquainted with your affairs as yourself  as yoosoof expressed no objection the three drew their chairs together and sat down to a prolonged private and very interesting palaver  we do not mean to try the readers patience by dragging him through the whole of it nevertheless a small portion of what was said is essential to the development of our tale  well then be it as you wish yoosoof said the governor folding up a fresh cigarette you are one of the most active traders on the coast and never fail to keep correct accounts with your governor  you deserve encouragement but i fear that you run considerable risk  i know that but those who make much must risk much  bravo exclaimed marizano with hearty approval nevertheless those who risk most do not always make most  contrast yourself with me now you risk your boats and cattle and become rich  i risk my life and behold  i am fleeced  i have little or nothing left barely enough to buy yonder girl from youthough i think i have enough for that  he pointed as he spoke to azinte who still stood on the spot where she had been left near the door  tell me resumed senhor letotti how do you propose to elude the english cruiser for i know that her captain has got wind of your whereabouts and is determined to watch the coast closelyand let me tell you he is a vigorous intelligent man  you tell me he has a number of captured slaves already in his ship said yoosoof  yes some hundreds i believe  he must go somewhere to land these i presume rejoined the arab  yoosoof referred here to the fact that when a british cruiser engaged in the suppression of the slavetrade on the east coast of africa has captured a number of slaves she is under the necessity of running to the seychelles islands aden or some other british port of discharge to land them there as free men because were she to set them free on any part of the coast of africa belonging either to portugal or the sultan of zanzibar they would certainly be recaptured and again enslaved  when therefore the cruisers are absentit may be two or three weeks on this duty the traders in human flesh of course make the most of their opportunity to run cargoes of slaves to those ports in arabia and persia where they always find a ready market  on the present occasion yoosoof conceived that the captain of the firefly might be obliged to take this course to get rid of the negroes already on board who were of course consuming his provisions besides being an extremely disagreeable cargo many of them being diseased and covered with sores owing to their cruel treatment on board the slavedhows  he wont go however till he has hunted the coast north and south for you so he assures me said the governor with a laugh  well i must start tonight therefore i shall give him a small pill to swallow which will take him out of the way said yoosoof rising to leave the room  i wish you both success said the governor as marizano also rose to depart but i fear that you will find the englishman very troublesomeadieu  the arab and the halfcaste went out talking earnestly together and followed by azinte and immediately afterwards the senhorina maraquita entered hurriedly  father you must buy that slavegirl for me  i want a pretty slave all to myself she said with unwonted vehemence  impossible my child replied the governor kindly for he was very fond as well as proud of his daughter  why impossible  have you not enough of money  oh yes plenty of that but i fear she is already bespoken and i should not like to interfere  bespoken do you mean sold cried maraquita seizing her fathers hands not sold to that man marizano  i think she must be by this time for hes a prompt man of business and not easily thwarted when he sets his mind to a thing  the senhorina clasped her hands before her eyes and stood for a moment motionless then rushing wildly from the room she passed into another apartment the windows of which commanded a view of a considerable part of the road which led from the house along the shore  there she saw the arab and his friend walking leisurely along as if in earnest converse while azinte followed meekly behind  the senhorina stood gazing at them with clenched hands in an agony of uncertainty as to what course she ought to pursue and so wrapt up in her thoughts that she failed to observe a strapping young lieutenant of hms steamer firefly who had entered the room and stood close to her side  now this same lieutenant happened to be wildly in love with senhorina maraquita  he had met her frequently at her fathers table where in company with his captain he was entertained with great hospitality and on which occasions the captain was assisted by the governor in his investigations into the slavetrade  lieutenant lindsay had taken the romantic plunge with all the charming enthusiasm of inexperienced youth and entertained the firm conviction that if senhorina maraquita did not become his life would thenceforth be altogether unworthy of consideration happiness would be a thing of the past with which he should have nothing more to do and death at the cannons mouth or otherwise would be the only remaining gleam of comfort in his dingy future  something distresses you i fear began the lieutenant not a little perplexed to find the young lady in such a peculiar mood  maraquita started glanced at him a moment and then with flashing eyes and heightened colour pointed at the three figures on the road  yes senhor she said i am distresseddeeply so  look do you see yonder two men and the girl walking behind them  i do  quick fly after them and bring them hitherthe arab and the girl i meannot the other man  oh be quick else they will be out of sight and then she will be lost quick if youifif you really mean what you have so often told me  poor lindsay  it was rather a sudden and severe test of fidelity to be sent forth to lay violent hands on a man and woman and bring them forcibly to the governors house without any better reason than that a selfwilled girl ordered him so to do at the same time he perceived that if he did not act promptly the retreating figures would soon turn into the town and be hopelessly beyond his power of recognition  butbut he stammered if they wont come  they must come  threaten my fathers high displeasurequick senhor cried the young lady in a commanding tone  lindsay flung open the casement and leapt through it as being the shortest way out of the house rushed with undignified speed along the road and overtook the arab and his friend as they were about to turn into one of the narrow lanes of the town  pardon me said the lieutenant laying his hand on yoosoofs shoulder in his anxiety to make sure of him will you be so good as to return with me to the governors residence  by whose orders demanded yoosoof with a look of surprise  the orders of the senhorina maraquita  the arab hesitated looked somewhat perplexed and said something in portuguese to marizano who pointed to the slavegirl and spoke with considerable vehemence  lindsay did not understand what was said but conjecturing that the halfcaste was proposing that azinte should remain with him he saidthe girl must return with youif you would not incur the governors displeasure  marizano on having this explained to him looked with much ferocity at the lieutenant and spoke to yoosoof in wrathful tones but the latter shook his head and the former who disliked marizanos appearance excessively took not the least notice of him  i do go said yoosoof turning back  motioning to azinte to follow he retraced his steps with the lieutenant and the slavewhile marizano strode into the town in a towering rage  we need scarcely say that maraquita having got possession of azinte did not find it impossible to persuade her father to purchase her and that yoosoof although sorry to disappoint marizano who was an important ally and assistant in the slavetrade did not see his way to thwart the wishes of the governor whose power to interfere with his trade was very great indeed and to whom he was under the necessity of paying headmoney for every slave that was exported by him from that part of the coast  soon after azinte had been thus happily rescued from the clutches of two of the greatest villains on the east african coastwhere villains of the deepest dye are by no means uncommonlindsay met captain romer of the firefly on the beach with his first lieutenant mr small who by the way happened to be one of the largest men in his ship  the three officers had been invited to dine that day with the governor and as there seemed no particular occasion for their putting to sea that night and a fresh supply of water had to be taken on board the invitation had been accepted all the more readily too that captain romer thought it afforded an opportunity for obtaining further information as to the movements of certain notorious slavers who were said to be thereabouts at that time  lieutenant lindsay had been sent ashore at an earlier part of the day accompanied by one of the sailors who understood portuguese and who being a remarkably intelligent man might it was thought acquire some useful information from some of the people of the town  well mr lindsay has jackson been of any use to you inquired the captain  not yet replied the lieutenant at least i know not what he may have done not having met him since we parted on landing but i have myself been so fortunate as to rescue a slavegirl under somewhat peculiar circumstances  truly a most romantic and gallant affair said the captain laughing when lindsay had related the incident and worthy of being mentioned in despatches but i suspect considering the part that the senhorina maraquita played in it and the fact that you only rescued the girl from one slaveholder in order to hand her over to another the less that is said about the subject the betterbut here comes jackson  perhaps he may have learned something about the scoundrels we are in search of  the seaman referred to approached and touched his cap  what news demanded the captain who knew by the twinkle in jacks eye that he had something interesting to report  ive diskivered all about it sir replied the man with an illsuppressed chuckle  indeed come this way  now lets hear what you have to tell said the captain when at a sufficient distance from his boat to render the conversation quite private  well sir began jackson wen i got up into the town arter leavin mr lindsay who should i meet but a man as had bin a messmate o mine aboard of that there portuguese ship were i picked up a smatterin o the lingo  of course we hailed each other and hoveto for a spell and then we made sail for a grogshop where we spliced the mainbrace after a deal o tackin and beatin about which enabled me to find out that hed left the sea an taken to business on his own account which in them parts seems to mean loafin about doin little or nothin i went slap into the subject that was uppermost in my mind and says i to him says i they does a deal o slavin on this here coast it appearsblack ivory is a profitable trade aint it  wy sir you should have seen the way he grinned and winked and opened out on emblack ivory says he wy jackson theres more slaves exported from these here parts annooally than would fill a goodsized city  i could tell youbut says he pullin up sudden you wont split on me messmate  honour bright says i if ye dont call tellin my captain splittin  oh no says he with a laugh its little i care what he knows or does to the piratesfor thats their true name and murderers to bootbut dont let it come to the governors ears else im a ruined man  i says i wouldnt and then he goes on to tell me all sorts of hanecdots about their doinsthat they does it with the full consent of the governor who gets headmoney for every slave exported that nearly all the governors on the coast are birds of the same feather and that the governorgeneral himself see consul mcleods travels in eastern africa volume one page 306 at mozambique winks at it and makes the subordinate governors pay him tribute  then he goes on to tell me more about the governor of this here town an says that though a kindhearted man in the main and very good to his domestic slaves he encourages the export trade because it brings him in a splendid revenue which he has much need of poor man for like most if not all of the governors on the coast he do receive nothin like a respectible salary from the portuguese government at home and has to make it up by slavetradin  see mcleods travels volume one page 293  it must be explained here that british cruisers were and still are kept on the east coast of africa for the purpose of crushing only the export slavetrade  they claim no right to interfere with domestic slavery an institution which is still legal in the dominions of the sultan of zanzibar and in the socalled colonies of portugal on that coast  but that is not the best of it sir continued jackson with a respectful smile after wed had our jaw out i goes off along the road by the beach to think a bit what id best do an have a smokefor thats wot usually sets my brain to work fullswing  bein hot i lay down in the lee of a bush to excogitate  you see sir my old messmate told me that there are two men here the worst characters he ever knowdashore or afloat  one they calls yoosoofan arab he is the other marizanohes a slavecatcher and an outlaw just now havin taken up arms and rebelled against the portuguese authorities nevertheless these two men are secretly hand and glove with the governor here and at this moment there are said to be a lot o slaves ready for shipment and only waitin till the firefly is out of the way  more than this my friend could not tell so thats wy i went to excogitatei beg parding sir for being so long wi my yarn but i aint got the knack o cuttin it short sir thats were it is  never mind lad go on to the end of it replied the captain  did you excogitate anything more  i cant say as i did sir but it was cooriously enough excogitated for me  wen i was lying there looking through the bush at the bay i sees two men comin along arm in arm  one of em was an arab  wen they was near i saw the arab start i thought hed seen me and didnt like me  no more did i like him or his comrade  however i was wrong for after whisperin somethin very earnestlike to his friend who laughed very much but said nothin they came and sat down not far from the bush where i lay  now thinks i it aint pleasant to be an eavesdropper but as im here to find out the secrets of villains and as these two look uncommon like villains ill wait a bit if they broach business as dont consarn me or her majesty the queen ill sneeze an let em know im here before theyre properly under weigh but if they speaks of wot i wants to know ill keep quiet  well sir to my surprise the arabhe speaks in bad english whereby i came to suppose the other was an englishman but if he is the climate must have spoiled him badly for i never did see such a ruffian to look at but he only laughed and didnt speak so i couldnt be sure  well to come to the pint sir the arab said hed got hold of two shipwrecked englishmen whom he meant to put on board of his dhow at that time lyin up a river not three miles off and full of slaves take em off the coast seize em when asleep and heave em overboard the reason bein that he was afraid if they was left ashore here theyd discover the town which they are ignorant of at present and give the alarm to our ship sir an so prevent him gettin clear off which he means to attempt about midnight just after the moon goes down  this unexpected information was very gratifying to captain romer who immediately gave orders to get steam up and have everything in readiness to start the moment he should make his appearance on board at the same time enjoining absolute silence on his lieutenants and jackson who all returned to the firefly chuckling inwardly  if they had known that the arabs information though partly true was a ruse that jackson had indeed been observed by the keeneyed oriental who had thereupon sat down purposely within earshot and after a whispered hint to his companion gave forth such information as would be likely to lead the british cruiser into his snaresspeaking in bad english under the natural impression that the sailor did not understand portuguese to the immense amusement of marizano who understood the ruse though he did not understand a single word of what his companion saidhad they known all this we say it is probable that they would have chuckled less andbut why indulge in probabilities when facts are before us  the sequel will show that the bestlaid plans may fail    chapter three  relates the further adventures of harold and disco and lifts the curtain a little higher in regard to the slavetrade  so captain romer and his lieutenants went to dine with the worthy governor senhor francisco alfonso toledo bignoso letotti while yoosoof returned to the creek to carry out his deeplaid plans  in regard to the dinner let it suffice to observe that it was good and that the governor was urbane hospitable communicative and every way agreeable  it is probable that if he had been trained in another sphere and in different circumstances he might have been a better man  as things stood he was unquestionably a pleasant one and captain romer found it hard to believe that he was an underhand schemer  nothing could exceed the open way in which senhor letotti condemned the slavetrade praised the english for their zeal in attempting to suppress it explained that the king of portugal and the sultan of zanzibar were equally anxious for its total extinction and assured his guests that he would do everything that lay in his power to further their efforts to capture the guilty kidnappers and to free the poor slaves  but my dear sir said he at the conclusion of an emphatic declaration of sympathy the thing is exceedingly difficult  you are aware that arab traders swarm upon the coast that they are reckless men who possess boats and money in abundance that the trade is very profitable and that being to some extent real traders in ivory palmoil indigo and other kinds of native produce these men have many ruses and methodswhat you english call dodgeswhereby they can deceive even the most sharpsighted and energetic  the arabs are smart smugglers of negroesvery much as your people who live in the scottish land are smart smugglers of the dew of the mountainwhat your great poet burns speaks much ofi forget its nameit is not easy to put them down  after dinner senhor letotti led the officers into his garden and showed them his fruittrees and offices also his domestic slaves who looked healthy well cared for and really in some degree happy  he did not however tell his guests that being naturally a humane man his slaves were better treated than any other slaves in the town  he did not remind them that being slaves they were his property his goods and chattels and that he possessed the right and the power to flay them alive if so disposed  he did not explain that many in the town were so disposed that cruelty grows and feeds upon itself that there were ladies and gentlemen there who flogged their slavesmen women and childrennearly to the death that one gentleman of an irascible disposition when irritated by some slight oversight on the part of the unfortunate boy who acted as his valet could find no relief to his feelings until he had welted him first into a condition of unutterable terror and then into a state of insensibility  neither did he inform them that a certain lady in the town who seemed at most times to be possessed of a reasonably quiet spirit was roused once to such a degree by a female slave that she caused her to be forcibly held thrust a boiling hot egg into her mouth skewered her lips together with a sailneedle and then striking her cheeks burst the egg and let the scalding contents run down her throat  see consul mcleods travels volume two page 32  no nothing of all this did the amiable governor letotti so much as hint at  he would not for the world have shocked the sensibilities of his guests by the recital of such cruelties  to say truth the worthy man himself did not like to speak or think of them  in this respect he resembled a certain class among ourselves who rather than submit to a little probing of their feelings for a few minutes would prefer to miss the chance of making an intelligently indignant protest against slavery and would allow the bodies and souls of their fellowmen to continue writhing in agony through all time  it was much more gratifying to the feelings of senhor letotti to convey his guests to the drawingroom and there gratify their palates with excellent coffee while the graceful and now clothed azinte brought a spanish guitar to the senhorina maraquita whose sweet voice soon charmed away all thoughts of the cruel side of slavery  but duty ere long stepped in to call the guests to other scenes  what a sweet girl the senhorina is remarked captain romer while on his way to the beach  ay and what a pretty girl azinte is black though she be observed lieutenant small  call her not black she is browna brunette said the captain  i wonder how we should feel said lindsay if the tables were turned and our women and children with our stoutest young men were forcibly taken from us by thousands every year and imported into africa to grind the corn and hoe the fields of the black man  poor azinte  do you know anything of her history inquired mr small  a little  i had some conversation in french with the senhorina just before we left  yes i observed that interrupted the captain with a quiet smile  and continued lindsay she told me that she had discovered through an interpreter that the poor girl is married and that her home is far away in the interior  she was caught with many others while out working in the fields one day several months ago by a party of slavetraders under an arab named yoosoof and carried off  her husband was absent at the time her infant boy was with its grandmother in their village and she thinks may have escaped into the woods but she has not seen any of them again since the day of her capture  it is a sad case said the captain and yet bad though it be it might be far worse for azintes master and mistress are very kind which is more than can be said of most slaveowners in this region  in a few minutes the captains gig was alongside the firefly and soon afterwards that vessel quietly put to sea  of course it was impossible that she should depart unobserved but her commander took the precaution to run due south at first exactly opposite to the direction of his true course intending to make a wide sweep out to sea and thus get unobserved to the northward of the place where the slavers dhow was supposed to be lying in time to intercept it  yoosoof from a neighbouring height watched the manoeuvre and thoroughly understood it  when the vessel had disappeared into the shades of night that brooded over the sea he smiled calmly and in a placid frame of mind betook himself to his lair in the creek beside the mangrove trees  he found harold seadrift and disco lillihammer in the hut somewhat impatient of his prolonged absence and a dozen of his men looking rather suspiciously at the strangers  is all ready moosa he inquired of a powerful man halfportuguese halfnegro in appearance who met him outside the door of the hut  all ready replied the halfcaste in a gruff tone of voice but what are you going to do with these english brutes  take them with us of course replied yoosoof  for what end  for our own safety  why dont you see moosa that if we had set them free they might have discovered the town and given information to the cruiser about us which would have been awkward  we might now indeed set them free for the cruiser is gone but i still have good reason for wishing to take them with me  they think that we have but one boat in this creek and i should like to make use of them for the purpose of propagating that false idea  i have had the good luck while in the town to find an opportunity of giving one of the sailors of the cruiser a little information as to my movementssome of it true some of it falsewhich will perhaps do us a service  the arab smiled slightly as he said this  do these men know our trade asked moosa  i think they suspect it answered yoosoof  and what if they be not willing to go with us demanded moosa  can twelve men not manage two asked the arab  dark though the night had become by that time there was sufficient light to gleam on the teeth that moosa exposed on receiving this reply  now moosa we must be prompt continued yoosoof let some of you get round behind the englishmen and have the slavechains handy  keep your eye on me while i talk with them if they are refractory a nod shall be the signal  entering the hut yoosoof informed harold that it was now time to set sail  good we are ready said harold rising but tell me one thing before my comrade and i agree to go with youtell us honestly if you are engaged in the slavetrade  a slight smile curled the arabs thin lip as he repliedif i be a slavetrader i cannot speak honestly so you engleesh think  but i do tell youyes i am  then i tell you honestly said harold that i wont go with you ill have nothing to do with slavers  thems my sentiments to a tee said disco with emphasis thumping his left palm as usual with his right fist by way of sheating his remark hometo use his own words  but you will both perish on this uninhabited coast said yoosoof  so be it replied harold i had rather run the risk of starving than travel in company with slavetraders  besides i doubt the truth of what you say  there must be several villages not very far off if my information in regard to the coast be not altogether wrong  yoosoof waited for no more  he nodded to moosa who instantly threw a noose round harolds arms and drew it tight  the same operation was performed for disco by a stout fellow who stood behind him and almost before they realised what had occurred they were seized by a number of men  it must not be supposed that two ablebodied englishmen quietly submitted at once to this sort of treatment  on the contrary a struggle ensued that shook the walls of the little hut so violently as almost to bring it down upon the heads of the combatants  the instant that harold felt the rough clasp of moosas arms he bent himself forward with such force as to fling that worthy completely over his head and lay him flat on the floor but two of the other slavers seized harolds arms a third grasped him round the waist and a fourth rapidly secured the ropes that had been thrown around him  discos mode of action although somewhat different was quite as vigorous  on being grasped he uttered a deep roar of surprise and rage and raising his foot struck out therewith at a man who advanced to seize him in front the kick not only tumbled the man over a low bench and drove his head against the wall but it caused the kicker himself to recoil on his foes behind with such force that they all fell on the floor together when by their united weight the slavers managed to crush the unfortunate disco not indeed into submission but into inaction  his tongue however not being tied continued to pour forth somewhat powerful epithets until harold very strongly advised him to cease  if you want to retain a whole skin he said you had better keep a quiet tongue  praps youre right sir said disco after a moments consideration but it aint easy to shut up in the succumstances  after they had thoroughly secured the englishmen the traders led them down the bank of the creek to the spot where the dhow was moored  in the dark it appeared to harold and his companion to be the same dhow but this was not so  the boat by which they had crossed the creek had been removed up the water and its place was now occupied by the dhow into which had been put the maimed and wornout slaves of the band whose arrival we have described  the hold of the little vessel was very dark nevertheless there was light enough to enable the englishmen to guess that the rows of black objects just perceptible within it were slaves if they had entertained any uncertainty on this point the odour that saluted them as they passed to the stern would have quickly dispelled their doubts  it was evident from the manner of the slavers that they did not now fear discovery because they talked loudly as they pushed off and rowed away soon they were out of the creek and the roar of breakers was heard much caution was displayed in guiding the dhow through these for the channel was narrow and darkness rendered its position almost indiscernible  at last the sail was hoisted the boat bent over to a smart breeze and held away in a northeasterly direction  as the night wore on this breeze became lighter and most of the crew being asleep deep silence prevailed on board the slavedhow save that ever and anon a pitiful wail as of a sick child or a convulsive sob issued from the hold  harold and disco sat beside each other in the stern with an armed halfcaste on each side and yoosoof in front  their thoughts were busy enough at first but neither spoke to the other  as the night advanced both fell into an uneasy slumber  when harold awoke the grey dawn was beginning to break in the east and there was sufficient light to render objects dimly visible  at first he scarcely recollected where he was but the pain caused by the ropes that bound him soon refreshed his memory  casting his eyes quickly towards the hold his heart sank within him at the sight he there beheld yoosoofs black ivory was not of the best quality but there was a good deal of it which rendered judicious packing necessary  so many of his gang had become worthless as an article of trade through suffering on the way down to the coast that the boat could scarce contain them all they were packed sitting on their haunches in rows each with his knees close to his chin and all jammed so tightly together that none could rise up or lie down  men women and little children sat in this position with an expression of indescribable hopelessness and apathy on their faces  the infants of which there were several lay motionless on their mothers shrunken breasts  god help them they were indeed utterly worthless as pieces of merchandise  the long journey and hard treatment had worn all of them to mere skin and bone and many were suffering from bad sores caused by the slaveirons and the unmerciful application of the lash  no one knew better than yoosoof that this was his damaged stockhopelessly damaged and he meant to make the best use he could of it  the sun arose in all its splendour and revealed more clearly to the horrified englishmen all the wretchedness of the hold but for a considerable time they did not speak  the circumstances in which they found themselves seemed to have bereft them of the faculty of speech the morning advanced and yoosoof with his men took a frugal breakfast but they did not offer any to harold or disco  as these unfortunates had however supped heartily they did not mind that  so much could not have been said for the slaves  they had received their last meal of uncooked rice and water a very insufficient one about thirtysix hours before and as they watched the traders at breakfast their glaring eyes told eloquently of their sufferings  had these been yoosoofs valuable stock his undamaged goods he would have given them a sufficiency of food to have kept them up to condition as long as he possessed them but being what they were a very little drop of water and a few grains of raw rice at noon was deemed sufficient to prevent absolute starvation  how can you have the heart said harold at last turning to yoosoof to treat these poor creatures so cruelly  yoosoof shrugged his shoulders  my fader treat them so i follow my faders footsteps  but have you no pity for them  dont you think they have hearts and feelings like ourselves returned harold earnestly  no replied the arab coldly  they have no feelings  hard as the stone  they care not for mother or child or husband  only brutes cattle  harold was so disgusted with this reply that he relapsed into silence  towards the afternoon while the dhow was running close inshore a vessel hove in sight on the horizon  a few minutes sufficed to show that it was a steamer  it was of course observed and closely watched by the slavedealers as well as by harold seadrift and disco lillihammer who became sanguinely hopeful that it might turn out to be a british manofwar  had they known that yoosoof was equally anxious and hopeful on that point they would have been much surprised but the wily arab pretended to be greatly alarmed and when the union jack became clearly visible his excitement increased  he gave some hurried orders to his men who laughed sarcastically as they obeyed them  yoosoof said harold with a slight feeling of exultation your plans seem about to miscarry  no they not miscarry yet replied the arab with a grim smile  tell me yoosoof resumed harold prompted by strong curiosity why have you carried us off bound in this fashion  another smile more grim than the former crossed the arabs visage as he repliedme carry you off cause that sheep pointing to the steamer lie not two mile off near to town of governor letotti when i first met you  we not want you to let thems know bout us so i carry you off and i bind you cause you strong  ha thats plain and reasonable returned harold scarce able to restrain a laugh at the mans cool impudence  but it would appear that some one else has carried the news so you see you have been outwitted after all  perhaps  we shall see replied the arab with something approaching to a chuckle  altering the course of the boat yoosoof now ran her somewhat off the shore as if with a view to get round a headland that lay to the northward  this evidently drew the attention of the steamerwhich was none other than the fireflyfor she at once altered her course and ran inshore so as to intercept the dhow  seeing this yoosoof turned back and made for the land at a place where there was a long line of breakers close to the shore  to run amongst these seemed to be equivalent to running on certain destruction nevertheless the arab held on with compressed lips and a frowning brow  yoosoof looked quite like a man who would rather throw away his life than gratify his enemy and the englishmen who were fully alive to their danger began to feel rather uneasywhich was a very pardonable sensation when it is remembered that their arms being fast bound rendered them utterly unable to help themselves in case of the boat capsizing  the firefly was by this time near enough to hold converse with the dhow through the medium of artillery  soon a puff of white smoke burst from her bow and a roundshot dropped a few yards astern of the boat  thats a broad hint my lad so youd better give in said lillihammer scarce able to suppress a look of triumph  yoosoof paid not the slightest attention to the remark but held on his course  surely you dont intend to risk the lives of these poor creatures in such a surf said harold anxiously weak and worn as they are their doom is sealed if we capsize  still the arab paid no attention but continued to gaze steadily at the breakers  harold turning his eyes in the same direction observed something like a narrow channel running through them  he was enough of a seaman to understand that only one who was skilled in such navigation could pass in safety  theyre lowering a boat said disco whose attention was engrossed by the manoeuvres of the firefly  soon the boat left the side of the vessel which was compelled to check her speed for fear of running on the reef  another gun was fired as she came round and the shot dropped right in front of the dhow sending a column of water high into the air  still yoosoof held on until close to the breakers when to the surprise of the englishmen he suddenly threw the boats head into the wind  you can steer he said sternly to disco  come take the helm an go to your ship or if you choose go on the breakers  he laughed fiercely as he said this and next moment plunged into the sea followed by his crew  disco speechless with amazement rose up and sprang to the helm  of course he could not use his bound hands but one of his legs answered almost as well  he allowed the boat to come round until the sail filled on the other tack and then looking back saw the heads of the arabs as they swam through the channel and made for the shore  in a few minutes they gained it and after uttering a shout of defiance ran up into the bushes and disappeared  meanwhile the fireflys boat made straight for the dhow and was soon near enough to hail  heaveto cried an interpreter in arabic  speak your own mother tongue and ill answer ye replied disco  heaveto or ill sink you shouted mr small who was in charge  im just agoin to do it sir replied disco running the dhow into the wind until the sail shook  another moment and the boat was alongside  jump aboard and handle the sail lads i cant help ee no further said disco  the invitation was unnecessary  the moment the two boats touched the bluejackets swarmed on board cutlass in hand and took possession  why whatwhere did you come from asked the lieutenant looking in profound astonishment at harold and his companion  we are englishmen as you see replied harold unable to restrain a smile we have been wrecked and caught by the villains who have just escaped you  i seewell no time for talking just now cut them loose jackson make fast the sheetnow then  in a few minutes the dhow ranged up alongside the firefly and our heroes with the poor slaves were quickly transferred to the manofwars deck where harold told his tale to captain romer  as we have already stated there were a number of slaves on board the firefly which had been rescued from various arab dhows  the gang now received on board made their numbers so great that it became absolutely necessary to run to the nearest port to discharge them  we have already remarked on the necessity that lies on our cruisers when overladen with rescued slaves to run to a distant port of discharge to land them and on the readiness of the slavetraders to take advantage of their opportunity and run north with full cargoes with impunity when some of the cruisers are absent for it is not possible for a small fleet to guard upwards of a thousand miles of coast effectually or even in any degree usefully  if we possessed a port of dischargea british station and settlementon the mainland of the east coast of africa this difficulty would not exist  as it is although we place several menofwar on a station the evil will not be cured for just in proportion as these are successful in making captures will arise the necessity of their leaving the station for weeks at a time unguarded  thus it fell out on the occasion of which we write  the presence of the large slavefreight on board the manofwar was intolerable  captain romer was compelled to hurry off to the seychelles islands  he sailed with the monsoon but had to steam back against it  during this period another vessel similarly freighted had to run to discharge at aden the seas were thus comparatively clear of cruisers  the arabs seized their opportunity and a stream of dhows and larger vessels swept out from the various creeks and ports all along the east african coast filled to overflowing with slaves  among these were the four large dhows of our friend yoosoof  having as we have seen made a slight sacrifice of damaged and unsaleable goods and chattels in order to clear the way he proceeded north touching at various ports where he filled up his living cargo and finally got clear off not with goods damaged beyond repair but with thousands of the sons and daughters of africa in their youthful prime  in the interior each man cost him about four yards of cotton cloth worth a few pence each woman three yards and each child two yards and of course in cases where he stole them they cost him nothing  on the coast these would sell at from 8 pounds to 12 pounds each and in arabia at from 20 pounds to 40 pounds  we mention this to show what strong inducement there was for yoosoof to run a good deal of risk in carrying on this profitable and accursed traffic  but you must not fancy good reader that what we have described is given as a specimen of the extent to which the slavetrade on that coast is carried  it is but as a specimen of the manner thereof  it is certainly within the mark to say that at least thirty thousand natives are annually carried away as slaves from the east coast of africa  sir bartle frere in addressing a meeting of the chief native inhabitants of bombay in april 1873 saidlet me assure you in conclusion that what you have heard of the horrors of the slavetrade is in no way exaggerated  we have seen so much of the horrors which were going on that we can have no doubt that what you read in books which are so often spoken of as containing exaggerations is exaggerated in no respect  the evil is much greater than anything you can conceive among the poorer class of africans there is nothing like security from fathers and mothers being put to death in order that their children may be capturedand referring to the east coast alone he says thatthirty thousand or more human beings are exported every year from africa  dr livingstone tells us that on the average about one out of every five captured human beings reaches the coast alive  the other four perish or are murdered on the way so that the thirty thousand annually exported as stated by sir bartle frere represents a loss of 150000 human beings annually from the east coast alone altogether irrespective of the enormous and constant flow of slaves to the north by way of the white nile and egypt  yoosoofs venture was therefore but a drop in the vast river of blood which is drained annually from poor africas veinsblood which flows at the present time as copiously and constantly as it ever did in the days of oldblood which cries aloud to god for vengeance and for the flow of which we as a nation are far from blameless    chapter four  in which our heroes see strange sights at zanzibar and resolve upon taking a bold step  before proceeding to the seychelles the firefly touched at the island of zanzibar and there landed our hero harold seadrift and his comrade in misfortune disco lillihammer  here one brilliant afternoon the two friends sat down under a palmtree to hold what disco called a palaver  the spot commanded a fine view of the town and harbour of zanzibar  we repeat that the afternoon was brilliant but it is right to add that it required an african body and mind fully to appreciate the pleasures of it  the suns rays were blistering the heat was intense and the air was stifling  harold lay down and gasped disco followed his example and sighed  after a few minutes spent in a species of imbecile contemplation of things in general the latter raised himself to a sitting posture and proceeded slowly to fill and light his pipe harold was no smoker but he derived a certain dreamy enjoyment from gazing at disco and wondering how he could smoke in such hot weather  well get used to it i spose like the eels observed disco when the pipe was in full blast  of course we shall replied harold and now that we have come to an anchor let me explain the project which has been for some days maturing in my mind  all right fire away sir said the sailor blowing a long thin cloud from his lips  you are aware said harold that i came out here as supercargo of my fathers vessel disco nodded but you are not aware that my chief object in coming was to see a little of the world in general and of the african part of it in particular  since my arrival you and i have seen a few things which have opened up my mind in regard to slavery we have now been a fortnight in this town and my fathers agent has enlightened me still further on the subject insomuch that i now feel within me an intense desire to make an excursion into the interior of africa indeed i have resolved to do so for the purpose of seeing its capabilities in a commercial point of view of observing how the slavetrade is conducted at its fountainhead and of enjoying a little of the scenery and the sport peculiar to this land of ham  wy you speaks like a book sir said disco emitting a prolonged puff an it aint for the likes me to give an opinion on that there but if i may make bold to ax sir how do you mean to travelon the back of a elephant or a rynocerisfor it seems to me that there aint much in the shape o locomotives or busses hereaboutsnot even cabs  i shall go in a canoe replied harold but my reason for broaching the subject just now is that i may ask if you are willing to go with me  theres no occasion to ax that sir im your mannorth or south east or west its all the same to me  ive bin born to roll about the world and it matters little whether i rolls ashore or afloatthough i prefers the latter  well then thats settled said harold with a look of satisfaction i have already arranged with our agent here to advance me what i require in the way of funds and shall hire men and canoes when we get down to the zambesi  the zamwot sir  the zambesi did you never hear of it before  never nor dont know wot it is sir  it is a river one of the largest on the east coast which has been well described by dr livingstone that greatest of travellers whose chief object in travelling is as he himself says to raise the negroes out of their present degraded condition and free them from the curse of slavery  thats the man to my mind said disco emphatically good luck to himbut wen dyou mean to start for the zambizzy sir  in a few days  it will take that time to get everything ready and our money packed  our money packed echoed the sailor with a look of surprise wy wot dye mean  just what i say  the money current in the interior of africa is rather cumbrous being neither more nor less than goods  youll never guess what sorttry  rum said disco  no  pipes and baccy  harold shook his head  never could guess nothin said disco replacing the pipe which he had removed for a few moments from his lips i gives it up  what would you say to cotton cloth and thick brass wire and glass beads being the chief currency in central africa said harold  you dont mean it sir  indeed i do and as these articles must be carried in large quantities if we mean to travel far into the land there will be more bales and coils than you and i could well carry in our waistcoat pockets  thats true sir replied disco looking earnestly at a couple of negro slaves who chanced to pass along the neighbouring footpath at that moment singing carelessly  them poor critters dont seem to be so miserable after all  that is because the nigger is naturally a jolly lighthearted fellow said harold and when his immediate and more pressing troubles are removed he accommodates himself to circumstances and sings as you hear  if these fellows were to annoy their masters and get a thrashing youd hear them sing in another key  the evils of most things dont show on the surface  you must get behind the scenes to understand them you and i have already had one or two peeps behind the scenes  we have indeed sir replied disco frowning and closing his fists involuntarily as he thought of yoosoof and the dhow  now then said harold rising as disco shook the ashes out of his little black pipe and placed that beloved implement in the pocket of his coat let us return to the harbour and see what chance there is of getting a passage to the zambesi in an honest trading dhowif there is such a thing in zanzibar  on their way to the harbour they had to pass through the slavemarket this was not the first time they had visited the scene of this iniquitous traffic but neither harold nor disco could accustom themselves to it  every time they entered the market their feelings of indignation became so intense that it was with the utmost difficulty they could control them  when disco saw handsome negro men and goodlooking girls put up for public saletheir mouths rudely opened and their teeth examined by cool calculating arabs just as if they had been domestic cattlehis spirit boiled within him his fingers tingled and he felt a terrible inclination to make a wild attack singlehanded on the entire population of zanzibar though he might perish in the execution of vengeance and the relief of his feelings  we need scarcely add that his discretion saved him  they soon reached the small square in which the market was held  here they saw a finelooking young woman sold to a grave elderly arab for a sum equal to about eight pounds sterling  passing hastily on they observed another lot a tall stalwart man having his various points examined and stopped to see the result  his owner thinking perhaps that he seemed a little sluggish in his movements raised his whip and caused it to fall upon his flank with such vigour that the poor fellow taken by surprise leaped high into the air and uttered a yell of pain  the strength and activity of the man were unquestionable and he soon found a purchaser  but all the slaves were not finelooking or stalwart like the two just referred to  many of them were most miserable objects  some stood others were seated as if incapable of standing so emaciated were they not a few were mere skeletons with life and skin  near the middle of the square groups of children were arrangedsome standing up to be inspected others sitting down  these ranged from five years and upwards but there was not one that betrayed the slightest tendency to mirth and disco came to the conclusion that negro children do not play but afterwards discovered his mistake finding that their exuberant jollity at home was not less than that of the children of other lands these little slaves had long ago been terrified and beaten and starved into listless apathetic and silent creatures  further on a row of young women attracted their attention  they were ranged in a semicircle all nearly in a state of nudity waiting to be sold  a group of arabs stood in front of them conversing  one of these women looked such a picture of woe that disco felt irresistibly impelled to stop  there were no tears in her eyes the fountain appeared to have been dried up but apparently without abating the grief which was stamped in deep lines on her young countenance and which burst frequently from her breast in convulsive sobs  our englishmen were not only shocked but surprised at this womans aspect for their experience had hitherto gone to show that the slaves usually became callous under their sufferings  whatever of humanity might have originally belonged to them seemed to have been entirely driven out of them by the cruelties and indignities they had so long suffered at the hands of their captors  see captain sulivans dhowchasing in zanzibar waters page 252  wots the matter with her poor thing asked disco of a halfcaste portuguese dressed in something like the garb of a sailor  oh notting answered the man in broken english with a look of indifference she have lose her chile dat all  lost her child howwot dee mean  dey hab sole de chile replied the man was good fat boy bout twoyer ole  spose she hab carry him for months troo de woods an over de hills down to coast an tink she keep him altogether  but she mistake  one trader come here bout one hour past  he want boynot want modder so he buy de chile  modder fight a littil at first but de owner soon make her quiet  oh it notting at all  she cry a littil soon forget her chile an get all right  come i cant stand this exclaimed harold hastening away  disco said nothing but to the amazement of the halfcaste he grasped him by the collar and hurled him aside with a degree of force that caused him to stagger and fall with stunning violence to the ground disco then strode away after his friend his face and eyes blazing with various emotions among which towering indignation predominated  in a few minutes they reached the harbour and while making inquiries as to the starting of trading dhows for the south they succeeded in calming their feelings down to something like their ordinary condition  the harbour was crowded with dhows of all shapes and sizes most of them laden with slaves some discharging cargoes for the zanzibar market others preparing to sail under protection of a pass from the sultan for lamoo which is the northern limit of the zanzibar dominions and therefore of the socalled domestic slavetrade  there would be something particularly humorous in the barefacedness of this august sultan of zanzibar if it were connected with anything less horrible than slavery  for instance there is something almost amusing in the fact that dhows were sailing every day for lamoo with hundreds of slaves although that small town was known to be very much overstocked at the time  it was also quite entertaining to know that the commanders of the french and english warvessels lying in the harbour at the time were aware of this and that the sultan knew it and that in short everybody knew it but that nobody appeared to have the power to prevent it  even the sultan who granted the permits or passes to the owners of the dhows although he professed to wish to check the slavetrade could not prevent it  wasnt that strangewasnt it curious  the sultan derived by far the largest portion of his revenue from the tax levied on the export of slavesamounting to somewhere about 10000 pounds a yearbut that had nothing to do with it of course not oh dear no  then there was another very ludicrous phase of this oriental not to say transcendental potentates barefacedness  he knew and probably admitted that about 2000 some say 4000 slaves a year were sufficient to meet the homeconsumption of that commodity and he also knew but probably did not admit that not fewer than 30000 slaves were annually exported from zanzibar to meet this requirement of 4000  these are very curious specimens of miscalculation which this barefaced sultan seems to have fallen into  perhaps he was a bad arithmetician  see captain sulivans dhowchasing in zanzibar water page 111 we have said that this state of things was so at the time of our story but we may now add that it still is so in this year of grace 1873  whether it shall continue to be so remains to be seen  having spent some time in fruitless inquiry harold and disco at last to their satisfaction discovered an arab dhow of known good character which was on the point of starting for the zambesi in the course of a few days for the purpose of legitimate traffic  it therefore became necessary that our hero should make his purchases and preparations with all possible speed  in this he was entirely guided by his fathers agent a merchant of the town who understood thoroughly what was necessary for the intended journey  it is not needful here to enter into full details suffice it to say that among the things purchased by harold and packed up in portable form were a number of bales of common unbleached cotton which is esteemed above everything by the natives of africa as an article of dressif we may dignify by the name of dress the little piece about the size of a moderate petticoat which is the only clothing of some or the small scrap round the loins which is the sole covering of other natives of the interior  there were also several coils of thick brass wire which is much esteemed by them for making bracelets and anklets and a large quantity of beads of various colours shapes and sizes  of beads we are told between five and six hundred tons are annually manufactured in great britain for export to africa  thus supplied our two friends embarked in the dhow and set sail  wind and weather were propitious  in few days they reached the mouths of the great river zambesi and landed at the port of quillimane  only once on the voyage did they fall in with a british cruiser which ordered them to layto and overhauled them but on the papers and everything being found correct they were permitted to pursue their voyage  the mouths of the river zambesi are numerous extending over more than ninety miles of the coast  on the banks of the northern mouth stands it would be more appropriate to say festersthe dirty little portuguese town of quillimane  its site is low muddy feverhaunted and swarming with mosquitoes  no man in his senses would have built a village thereon were it not for the facilities afforded for slaving  at spring or flood tides the bar may be safely crossed by sailing vessels but being far from land it is always dangerous for boats  here then harold and disco landed and remained for some time for the purpose of engaging men  appearing in the character of independent travellers they were received with some degree of hospitality by the principal inhabitants  had they gone there as simple and legitimate traders every possible difficulty would have been thrown in their way because the worthy people from the governor downwards flourishedor festeredby means of the slavetrade and legitimate commerce is everywhere found to be destructive to the slavetrade  dr livingstone and others tell us that thousands upon thousands of negroes have of late years gone out from quillimane into slavery under the convenient title of free emigrants their freedom being not quite equal to that of a carters horse for while that animal although enslaved is usually well fed the human animal is kept on rather low diet lest his spirit should rouse him to deeds of desperate violence against his masters  all agricultural enterprise is also effectually discouraged here  when a man wants to visit his country farm he has to purchase a permit from the governor  if he wishes to go up the river to the portuguese towns of senna or tette a pass must be purchased from the governor  in fact it would weary the reader were we to enumerate the various modes in which every effort of man to act naturally legitimately or progressively is hampered unless his business be the buying and selling of human beings  at first harold experienced great difficulty in procuring men  the master of the trading dhow in which he sailed from zanzibar intended to remain as short a time as possible at quillimane purposing to visit ports further south and as harold had made up his mind not to enter the zambesi by the quillimane mouth but to proceed in the dhow to one of the southern mouths he felt tempted to give up the idea of procuring men until he had gone further south  you see disco said he in a somewhat disconsolate tone it wont do to let this dhow start without us because i want to get down to the east luavo mouth of this river that being the mouth which was lately discovered and entered by dr livingstone but im not sure that we can procure men or canoes there and our arab skipper either cant or wont enlighten me  ah observed disco with a knowing look he wontthats where it is sir  ive not a spark o belief in that man or in any arab on the coast  hes a slaver in disguise he is an sos every mothers son of em  well continued harold if we must start without them and take our chance we must there is no escaping from the inevitable nevertheless we must exert ourselves today because the dhow does not sail till tomorrow evening and there is no saying what luck may attend our efforts before that time  perseverance you know is the only sure method of conquering difficulties  thats so said disco thems my sentiments xactly  never say die stick at nothingnail yer colours to the mast thems the mottoes that i goes in foralways sposin that youre in the right  but what if youre in the wrong and the colours are nailed asked harold with a smile  wy then sir of course id have to tear em down  so that perhaps it would be better not to nail them at all unless youre very sureeh  oh of course sir replied disco with solemn emphasis  you dont suppose sir that i would nail em to the mast except i was sure wery sure that i wos right  but as you wos a sayin sir about the gittin of them ere men  disco had an easy way of changing a subject when he felt that he was getting out of his depth  well to return to that  the fact is i would not mind the men for its likely that men of some sort will turn up somewhere but i am very anxious about an interpreter  without an interpreter we shall get on badly i fear for i can only speak french besides a very little latin and greek none of which languages will avail much among niggers  disco assumed a severely thoughtful expression of countenance  thats true he said placing his right fist argumentatively in his left palm and im afeard i cant help you there sir  if it wos to steer a ship or pull a oar or man the foretopsl yard in a gale o wind or anything else in the seafarin line disco lillihammers your man but i couldnt come a furrin lingo at no price  i knows nothin but my mother tonguenevertheless though i says it that shouldnt i does profess to be somewhat of a dab at that  once upon a time i spent six weeks in dublin an havin a quick ear for moosic i soon managed to get up a strong dash o the brogue but praps that wouldnt go far with the niggers  about two hours after the above conversation while harold seadrift was walking on the beach he observed his faithful ally in the distance grasping a short thickset man by the arm and endeavouring to induce him to accompany him with a degree of energy that fell little short of main force  the man was evidently unwilling  as the pair drew nearer harold overheard discos persuasive voicecome now antonio dont be a fool its the best service you could enter  good pay and hard work and all the grub thats goin what could a man want more  its true theres no grog but we dont need that in a climate where youve only got to go out in the sun without yer hat an youll be as good as drunk in ten minutes any day  no no not possibil remonstrated the man whose swarthy visage betrayed a mixture of cunning fun and annoyance  he was obviously a halfcaste of the lowest type but with more pretensions to wealth than many of his fellows inasmuch as he wore besides his loincloth a white cotton shootingcoat very much soiled beneath the tails of which his thin black legs protruded ridiculously  here you are sir cried disco as he came up heres the man for lingo knows the native talkee as well as portuguese english arabic and anything else you like as far as i know  antonios his name come sir try him with greek or somethin o that sort  harold had much ado to restrain a smile but assuming a grave aspect he addressed the man in french while disco listened with a look of profound respect and admiration  wy wots wrong with ee man exclaimed disco on observing the blank look of antonios countenance dont ee savay that  i thought you understood portuguese said harold in english  so me do replied antonio quickly but dat no portigeesedat spanaish me spose  what can you speak then demanded harold sternly  portigeese arbik fengleesh an two tree four nigger lungwiches  it was very obvious that whatever antonio spoke he spoke nothing correctly but that was of no importance so long as the man could make himself understood  harold therefore asked if he would join his party as interpreter but antonio shook his head  why not manwhy not asked harold impatiently for he became anxious to secure him just in proportion as he evinced disinclination to engage  speak up antonio dont be ashamed youve no need to said disco the fact is sir antonio tells me that he has just bin married an he dont want to leave his wife  very natural observed harold  how long is it since you were married  von veek since i did bought her  bought her exclaimed disco with a broad grin may i ax wot ye paid for her  paid exclaimed the man starting and opening his eyes very wide as if the contemplation of the vast sum were too much for him lat me zeeme pay me vifes pairyints sixteen yard ob cottin clothe an for mes hut four yard morer  ye dont say that exclaimed disco with an extended grin  is she young an goodlookin  yonge replied antonio yis ver yonge not mush more dan baby an exiquitely bootiful  then my good feller said disco with a laugh the sooner you leave her the better  a week is a long time an absence you know as the old song says makes the heart grow fonder besides mr seadrift will give you enough to buy a dozen wives if ee want em  yes ill pay you well said harold that is if you prove to be a good interpreter  antonio pricked up his ears at this  how mush vill oo gif he asked  well let me think i shall probably be away three or four months what would you say antonio to twenty yards of cotton cloth a month and a gun into the bargain at the end if you do your work well  the pleased expression of antonios face could not have been greater had he been offered twenty pounds sterling a month  the reader may estimate the value of this magnificent offer when we say that a yard of cotton cloth was at that time sevenpencehalfpenny so that antonios valuable services were obtained for about 12 shillings 6 pence a month and a gun which cost harold less than twenty shillings in zanzibar  we may remark here that antonio afterwards proved to be a stout able willing man and a faithful servant although a most arrant coward  from this time harolds difficulties in regard to men vanished  with antonios able assistance nine were procured stout young ablebodied fellows they were and all more or less naked  two of these were halfcaste brothers named respectively jose and oliveira two were halfwild negroes of the somali tribe named nakoda and conda three were negroes of the makololo tribe who had accompanied dr livingstone on his journey from the far interior of africa to the east coast and were named respectively jumbo zombo and masiko and finally two named songolo and mabruki were free negroes of quillimane  thus the whole band including disco and the leader formed a goodly company of twelve stout men  of course harold armed them all with guns and knives  himself and disco carried enfield rifles besides which harold took with him a spare rifle of heavy calibre carrying large balls mingled with tin to harden them  this latter was intended for large game  landing near the east luavo mouth of the zambesi our hero was fortunate enough to procure two serviceable canoes into which he transferred himself his men and his goods and bidding adieu to the arab skipper of the dhow commenced his journey into the interior of africa    chapter five  in which the travellers enjoy themselves extremely and disco lillihammer sees several astonishing sights  behold our travellers then fairly embarked on the waters of the great african river zambesi in two canoes one of which is commanded by harold seadrift the other by disco lillihammer  of course these enterprising chiefs were modest enough at first to allow two of the makololo men jumbo and zombo to wield the steeringoars but after a few days practice they became sufficiently expert as disco said to take the helm except when strong currents rendered the navigation difficult or when the weather became so piping hot that none but men clad in black skins could work  we must however guard the reader here from supposing that it is always piping hot in africa  there are occasional days when the air may be styled lukewarm when the sky is serene and when all nature seems joyful and enjoyabledays in which a man opens his mouth wide and swallows down the atmosphere when he feels his health and strength and rejoices in them and when if he be not an infidel he also feels a sensation of gratitude to the giver of all good  on such a day soon after entering the east luavo mouth of the zambesi the explorers for such we may almost venture to style them ascended the smooth stream close to the left bank harold leading disco following closely in his wake  the men rowed gently as if they enjoyed the sweet calm of early morning and were unwilling to disturb the innumerable flocks of wildfowl that chuckled among the reeds and sedges everywhere  harold sat in the stern leaning back and only dipping the steeringoar lazily now and then to keep the canoe from running on the bank or plunging into a forest of gigantic rushes  disco having resolved to solace himself with a whiff of his darling pipe had resigned the helm to jumbo and laid himself in a position of comfort which admitted of his resting his head on the gunwale in such a manner that out of the corners of his eyes he could gaze down into the water  the part of the river they had reached was so perfectly still that every cloud in the sky every mangrove root and spray and every bending bulrush was perfectly reproduced in the reflected world below plaintive cries of wildfowl formed appropriate melody to which chattering groups of monkeys and croaking bullfrogs contributed a fine tenor and bass  hallo disco exclaimed harold in a subdued key looking over his shoulder  ay ay sir sighed the seaman without moving his position  range up alongside i want to speak to you  ay ay sirjumbo you blackfaced villain dee hear that give way and go longside  goodhumoured jumbo spoke very little english but had come to understand a good deal during his travels with dr livingstone  he wrinkled his visage and showed his brilliant teeth on receiving the order  muttering a word to the men and giving a vigorous stroke he shot up alongside of the leaders canoe  you seem comfortable said harold with a laugh as discos vast visage appeared at his elbow  i is  isnt this jolly continued harold  no sir taint  why what dyou mean  i means that jolly aint the word by a long way for to express the natur o my feelins  there aint no word as i knows on as ud come up to it  if i wor a fylosipher now id coin a word for the occasion praps continued disco drawing an unusually long whiff from his pipe praps not bein a fylosipher i might nevertheless try to coin one wots the latin now for heaven  caelum replied harold  sailum eh  an wots the arth  terra  terra well now wot rediklous names to give to em said disco shaking his head gravely i cant see why the ancients couldnt ha bin satisfied with the names that wed given em  howsever thats neither here nor there  my notion o the state o things that weve got into here as they now stand is that they are sailumterracious which means heavenuponearth dee see  as disco pronounced the word with a powerful emphasis on the um part of it the sound was rather effective and seemed to please him  right youre right or nearly so replied harold but dont you think the word savours too much of perfection seeing that breakfast would add to the pleasure of the present delightful state of things and make them even more sailumterracious than they are  no sir no the word aint too parfect replied disco with a look of critical severity part of it is arth and arth is imparfect bein susceptible of a many improvements among which undoubtedly is breakfast likewise dinner an supper to say nothin of lunch an tea which is suitable only for babbies an wimen so i agrees with you sir that the state o things will be sailumterraciouser if we goes ashore an has breakfast  he tapped the head of his very black little pipe on the edge of the canoe and heaved a sigh of contentment as he watched the ashball that floated away on the stream then rousing himself he seized the steeringoar and followed harold into a small creek which was pleasantly overshadowed by the rich tropical foliage of that region  while breakfast was being prepared by antonio whose talents as chefdecuisine were of the highest order harold took his rifle and rambled into the bush in search of gameany kind of game for at that time he had had no experience whatever of the sport afforded by the woods of tropical africa and having gathered only a few vague ideas from books he went forth with all the pleasurable excitement and expectation that we may suppose peculiar to discoverers  disco lillihammer having only consumed his first pipe of tobacco and holding it to be a duty which he owed to himself to consume two before breakfast remained at the campfire to smoke and chaff antonio whose goodnature was only equalled by his activity  wot have ee got there inquired disco as antonio poured a quantity of seed into a large pot  dis vy hims be mapira replied the interpreter with a benignant smile  hims de cheef food ob dis konterie  it must be remarked here that antonios english having been acquired from all sorts of persons in nearly every tropical part of the globe was somewhat of a jumble being a compound of the broken english spoken by individuals among the germans french portuguese arabs and negroes with whom he had at various times associated modified by his own ignorance and seasoned with a dash of his own inventive fancy  is it good asked disco  goot exclaimed antonio  being unable to find words to express himself the enthusiastic cook placed his hand on the region which was destined ere long to become a receptacle for the mapira and rolled his eyes upwards in rapture  hah oo sall see behind long  before long you mean observed the seaman  dat all same ting slongs you onerstand him replied antonio complacentlybring vatter now jumbo  put him in careful  not spill on de firezogoot  jumbo filled up the kettle carefully and a broad grin overspread his black visage partly because he was easily tickled into a condition of risibility by the cool offhand remarks of disco lillihammer and partly because having acquired his own small smattering of english from dr livingstone he was intelligent enough to perceive that in regard to antonios language there was something peculiar  now go fitch noder kittlequeek  yis sarzogoot replied jumbo mimicking the interpreter and going off with a vociferous laugh at his little joke in which he was joined by his sable clansmen masiko and zombo  hims got nuff of impoodidence said the interpreter as he bustled about his avocations  hes not the only one thats got more than enough impoodidence said disco pushing a fine straw down the stem of his cutty to make it draw better  i say tony our regardless seaman had already thus mutilated his name you seem to have plenty live stock in them parts  plenty vat inquired the interpreter with a perplexed expression  why plenty birds and beastslive stock we calls it meanin thereby livin creeturs  he pointed towards an opening in the mangroves through which were visible the neighbouring mud and sand flats swarming with wildfowl and conspicuous among which were large flocks of pelicans who seemed to be gorging themselves comfortably from an apparently inexhaustible supply of fish in the pools left by the receding tide  ho yis me perceive yis plenty bird and beastfishes too and crawbslook dare  he pointed to a part of the sands nearest to their encampment which appeared to be alive with some small creatures  thats coorious said disco removing his pipe and regarding the phenomenon with some interest  no taint koorous its crawbs replied antonio  crabs is it said disco rising and sauntering down to the sands for he possessed an inquiring mind with a special tendency to investigate the habits pranks as he called them of the lower animals which in other circumstances might have made him a naturalist  muttering to himselfhe was fond of muttering to himself it felt companionablecoorious very coorious quite stroanary he crept stealthily to the edge of the mangroves and there discovered that the sands were literally alive with myriads of minute crabs which were actively engagedit was supposed by those who ought to know bestin gathering their food  the moment the tide ebbed from any part of the sands out came these crablets in swarms and set to work busy as bees ploughing up the sand and sifting it apparently for food until the whole flat was rendered rough by their incessant labours  approaching cautiously disco observed that each crab as he went along sidewise gathered a round bit of moist sand at his mouth which was quickly brushed away by one of his claws and replaced by another and another as fast as they could be brushed aside  eatin sand they are muttered disco in surprise but presently the improbability of sand being very nutritious food even for crabs forced itself on him and he muttered his conviction that they was scrapin for wittles  having watched the crabs a considerable time and observed that they frequently interrupted their labours to dart suddenly into their holes and out againfor the purpose he conjectured of havin a drop o summat to wet their whistlesdisco thrust the cutty into his vest pocket and walked a little further out on the flat in the hope of discovering some new objects of interest  nor was he disappointed besides finding that the pools left by the tide swarmed with varieties of little fishmany of them being coorioushe was fortunate enough to witness a most surprising combat  it happened thusperceiving a little to his right some small creature hopping about on the sand near to a little pool he turned aside to observe it more closely  on his drawing near the creature jumped into the pool  disco advanced to the edge gazed intently into the water and saw nothing except his own reflected image at the bottom presently the creature reappeared  it was a small fisha familiar fish toowhich he had known in the pools of his native land by the name of blenny  as the blenny appeared to wish to approach the edge of the pool disco retired and placing a hand on each knee stooped in order to make himself as small as possible  he failed the diminution in his height being fully counterbalanced by the latitudinal extension of his elbows  presently the blenny put its head out of the water and looked about we speak advisedly  the blenny is altogether a singular an exceptional fish  it can and does look sidewise upwards and downwards with its protruding eyes as knowingly and with as much vivacity as if it were a human being  this power in a fish has something of the same awesome effect on an observer that might possibly result were a horse to raise its head and smile at him  seeing that the coast was clear for disco stood as motionless as a mangrove tree blenny hopped upon the dry land  the african blenny is a sort of amphibious animal living nearly as much out of the water as in it  indeed its busiest time we are told see dr livingstones zambesi and its tributaries page 843 is at low water when by means of its pectoral fins it crawls out on the sand and raises itself into something of a standing attitude with its bright eyes keeping a sharp lookout for the lightcoloured flies on which it feeds  for several seconds disco gazed at the fish and the fish gazed around even turning its head a little as well as its eyes on this side and on that  presently a small fly with that giddy heedlessness which characterises the race alighted about two inches in front of blennys nose  instantly the fish leaped that vast space alighted with its underset mouth just over the fly which immediately rose into it and was entombed  brayvo passed through discos brain but no sound issued from his lips  presently another of the giddy ones alighted in front of blenny about a foot distant  this appeared to be much beyond his leaping powers for with a slow stealthy motion like a cat he began deliberately to stalk his victim  the victim appeared to be blind for it took no notice of the approaching monster  blenny displayed marvellous powers of selfcontrol for he moved on steadily without accelerating his speed until within about two inches of his preythen he leapt as before and another fly was entombed  well done exclaimed disco mentally but still his lips and body were motionless as before  at this point an enemy in the shape of another blenny appeared on the scene  it came up out of a small pool close at hand and seemed to covet the first blennys pool and to set about taking possession of it as naturally as if it had been a human being for observing no doubt that its neighbour was busily engaged it moved quietly in the direction of the coveted pool  being a very little fish it was not observed by disco but it was instantly noticed by the first blenny which being rather the smaller of the two we shall style the little one  suddenly big blenny threw off all disguise bounded towards the pool which was about a foot square and plunged in  no mortal blenny could witness this unwarrantable invasion of its hearth and home without being stirred to indignant wrath  with eyes that seemed to flash fire and dorsal fin bristling up with rage little blenny made five tremendous leaps of full three inches each and disappeared  another moment and a miniature storm ruffled the pool for a few seconds the heavings of the deep were awful then out jumped big blenny and tried to flee but out jumped little blenny and caught him by the tail round turned the big one and caught the other by the jaw  hallo disco breakfasts readywhere are you shouted harold from the woods  disco replied not  it is a question whether he heard the hail at all so engrossed was he in this remarkable fight  brayvo he exclaimed aloud when little blenny shook his big enemy off and rolled over him  cleverly done he shouted when big blenny with a dart took refuge in the pool  i knowed it he cried approvingly when little blenny forced him a second time to evacuate the premises go in an win little un thought disco  thus the battle raged furiously now in the water now on the sand while the excited seaman danced round the combatantsboth of whom appeared to have become deaf and blind with rageand gave them strong encouragement mingled with appropriate advice and applause  in fact discos delight would have been perfect had the size of the belligerents admitted of his patting the little blenny on the back but this of course was out of the question  at last having struck worried bitten and chased each other by land and sea for several minutes these pugnacious creatures seized each other by their respective throats like two bulldogs and fell exhausted on the sand  its a draw exclaimed disco rather disappointed  no taint he said as little blenny reviving rose up and renewed the combat more furiously than ever but it was soon ended for big blenny suddenly turned and fled to his own pool  little blenny did not crow he did not even appear to be elated  he evidently felt that he had been called on to perform a disagreeable but unavoidable duty and deemed it quite unnecessary to wave banners fire guns or ring bells in celebration of his victory as he dived back into his pool amid the ringing cheers of disco lillihammer  upon my word if you have not gone stark mad you must have had a sunstroke said harold coming forward whats the matter  too late too late cried disco in a mingled tone of amusement and regret  dye think it is  are you incurable already asked his friend  too late to see the most astonishin scrimmage i ever did behold in my life said disco  the description of this scrimmage gave the worthy seaman a subject for conversation and food for meditation during the greater part of the time spent over the morning meal and there is no saying how long he would have kept referring to and chuckling over itto the great admiration and sympathy of the black fellows who are as a race excessively fond of jocularity and funhad not another of the denizens of the mangrove jungle diverted his attention and thoughts rather suddenly  this was a small monkey which seated on a branch overhead peered at the breakfastparty from among the leaves with an expression of inquiry and of boundless astonishment that it is quite impossible to describe surprise of the most sprightly nature if we may say so sat enthroned on that small monkeys countenance an expression which was enhanced by the creatures motions for not satisfied with taking a steady look at the intruders from the right side of a leaf it thrust forward its little black head on the left side of it and then under it by way of variety but no additional light seemed to result from these changes in the point of observation for the surprise did not diminish  in one of its intent stares it caught the eye of disco  the seamans jaws stopped as if suddenly locked and his eyes opened to their widest  the monkey seemed to feel uneasily that it had attracted attention for it showed the smallest possible glimpse of its teeth  the action coupled with the leafy shadows which fell on its countenance had the effect of a smile which caused disco to burst into a loud laugh and point upwards  to bound from its position to a safer retreat and thence stare at disco with deep indignation and a threatening display of all its teeth and gums in addition to its looks of surprise was the work of a moment on the part of the small monkey whereat disco burst into a renewed roar of laughter in which he was joined by the whole party  are there many o them fellows hereabouts inquired the seaman of antonio  ho yis lots ob em  tousands ebery whars see dare am morer  he pointed to another part of the umbrageous canopy overhead where the face of a still smaller monkey was visible engaged like the previous one in an earnest scrutiny of the party but with a melancholy rather than a surprised expression of visage  wot a miserable brokenhearted thing said disco grinning in which act he was immediately copied by the melancholy monkey though from different motives  disco was very fond of monkeys  all his life he had felt a desire to pat and fondle those shivering creatures which he had been accustomed to see on barrelorgans in his native land and the same strong impulse came over him now  wot a pity the creeturs smell so bad and aint cleanly he remarked gazing affectionately up among the leaves theyd make such capital pets why theres another  this remark had reference to a third monkey of large dimensions and fierce countenance which at that moment rudely thrust the melancholy monkey aside and took its place  the latter with a humble air and action took up a new position somewhat nearer to the fire where its sad countenance was more distinctly seen  well it does seem a particularly sorrowful monkey that said harold laughing as he helped himself to another canful of tea  the most miserable objic i ever did see observed disco  the negroes looked at each other and laughed  they were accustomed to monkeys and took little notice of them but they were mightily tickled by discos amusement for he had laid down his knife and fork and shook a good deal with internal chuckling as he gazed upwards  one would suppose now he said softly that it had recently seen its father and mother and all its brothers and sisters removed by a violent death or sold into slavery  ha they never see that said harold the brutes may fight and kill but they never enslave each other  it is the proud prerogative of man to do that  thats true sir worse luck as paddy says rejoined disco  but look there wots them coorious things round the creeturs waista pair o the werry smallest handsand hallo a face no bigger than a button i do believe that its  disco did not finish the sentence but he was right  the small melancholy monkey was a mother  probably that was the cause of its sorrow  it is a touching thought that anxiety for its tiny offspring perhaps had furrowed that monkeys visage with the wrinkles of premature old age  that danger threatened it on every side was obvious for no sooner had it taken up its new position after its unceremonious ejection by the fierce monkey than the sprightly monkey before referred to conceived a plot which it immediately proceeded to carry into execution  observing that the tail of the sad one hung down in a clear space below the branch on which it sat the sprightly fellow quickly but with intense caution and silence crept towards it and when within a yard or so sprang into the air and caught the tail  a wild shriek and what disco styled a scrimmage ensued during which the mother monkey gave chase to him of the lively visage using her arms legs and tail promiscuously to grasp and hold on to branches and leaving her extremely little one to look out for itself  this it seemed quite capable of doing for no limpet ever stuck to a solid rock with greater tenacity than did that infant to the maternal waist throughout the chase  the hubbub appeared to startle the whole monkey race revealing the fact that troops of other monkeys had unobserved been gazing at the strangers in silent wonder since the time of their landing  pleasant however though this state of things undeniably was it could not be expected to last  breakfast being concluded it became necessary that disco should tear himself from the spot which having first solaced himself with a pipe he did with a good grace remarking as he reembarked and took the helm of his canoe that he had got more powerful surprises that morning than he had ever before experienced in any previous twelvemonth of his life  before long he received many more surprises especially one of a very different and much less pleasant nature an account of which will be found in the next chapter    chapter six  describes several new and surprising incidents which must be read to be fully appreciated  to travel with ones mouth and eyes opened to nearly their utmost width in a state of surprised stupefaction may be unavoidable but it cannot be said to be either becoming or convenient  attention in such a case is apt to be diverted from the business in hand and flies have a tendency to immolate themselves in the throat  nevertheless inconvenient though the condition was our friend disco lillihammer was so afflicted with astonishment at what he heard and saw in this new land that he was constantly engaged in swallowing flies and running his canoe among shallows and rushes insomuch that he at last resigned the steeringoar until familiarity with present circumstances should tone him down to a safe condition of equanimity  and no wonder that disco was surprised no wonder that his friend harold seadrift shared in his astonishment and delight for they were at once and for the first time in their lives plunged into the very heart of jungle life in equatorial africa  those who have never wandered far from the comparatively tame regions of our temperate zone can form but a faint conception of what it is to ramble in the tropics and therefore can scarcely be expected to sympathise fully with the mental condition of our heroes as they ascended the zambesi  everything was so thoroughly strange sights and sounds so vastly different from what they had been accustomed to see and hear that it seemed as though they had landed on another planet  trees shrubs flowers birds beasts insects and reptiles all were unfamiliar except indeed one or two of the more conspicuous trees and animals which had been so imprinted on their minds by means of nursery picturebooks that on first beholding them disco unconsciously paid these books the compliment of saying that the animals wos uncommon like the picturs  discos mental condition may be said for the first two or three days to have been one of gentle everflowing surprise studded thickly with little bursts of keen astonishment  the first part of the river ran between mangrove jungle in regard to which he remarked that them there trees had legs like crabs in which observation he was not far wrong for when the tide was out the roots of the mangroves rose high out of the mud forming supports as it were for the trees to stand on  but it was the luxuriance of the vegetation that made the most powerful impression on the travellers  it seemed as if the various groups and families of the vegetable kingdom had been warmed by the sun into a state of unwonted affection for everything appeared to entertain the desire to twine round and embrace everything else  one magnificent screwpalm in particular was so overwhelmed by affectionate parasites that his natural shape was almost entirely concealed  others of the trees were decked with orchilla weed  there were ferns so gigantic as to be almost worthy of being styled trees and palmbushes so sprawling as to suggest the idea of huge vegetable spiders  bright yellow fruit gleamed among the graceful green leaves of the mangroves wild datepalms gave variety to the scene if that had been needed which it was not and masses of umbrageous plants with large yellow flowers grew along the banks while down among the underwood giant roots rose in fantastic convolutions above ground as if the earth were already too full and there wasnt room for the whole of them  there was an antediluvian magnificence a prehistoric snakiness a sort of primeval runningtoseedness which filled harold and disco with feelings of awe and induced a strange almost unnatural tendency to regard adam and eve as their contemporaries  animal life was not wanting in this paradise  frequently did our seaman give vent to hallo  there they go  look out for the little un wi the long tail and similar expressions referring of course to his favourite monkeys which ever and anon peered out upon the strangers with looks of intensity for whatever their expression might be sadness grief interrogation wrath surpriseit was always in the superlative degree  there were birds also innumerable  one styled the kinghunter sang wild exultant airs as if it found kinghunting to be an extremely exhilarating occupation though what sort of kings it hunted we cannot tell  perhaps it was the king of beasts perhaps the kingfisher a bright specimen of which was frequently seen to dart out from the banks but we profess ignorance on this point  there were fishhawks also magnificent fellows which sat in regal dignity on the tops of the mangrove trees and the glossy ibis with others of the feathered tribe too numerous to mention  large animals also were there in abundance though not so frequently seen as those which have been already mentioned  disco occasionally made known the fact that such or something unusual had transpired by the sudden and violent exclamation of whats that in a voice so loud that that whatever it might be sometimes bolted or took to flight before any one else caught sight of it  hallo he exclaimed on one such occasion as the canoes turned a bend of the river  what now demanded harold looking at his companion to observe the direction of his eyes  im a dutchman exclaimed disco in a hoarse whisper that might have been heard half a mile off if its not a zebra  so it is my riflelook sharp said harold eagerly  the weapon was handed to him but before it could be brought to bear the beautiful striped creature had tossed its head snorted whisked its tail kicked up its heels and dashed into the jungle  give way lads lets after him shouted disco turning the canoes bow to shore  hold on cried harold you might as well go after a needle in a haystack or a locomotive  so i might admitted disco with a mortified air resuming his course but it aint in reason to expect a feller to keep quiet wen he sees one o the very picturs of his childood so to speak come alive an kick up its heels like that  buffaloes were also seen in the grassy glades but it proved difficult to come within range of them also warthogs and three different kinds of antelope  of these last harold shot several and they were found to be excellent food  human beings were also observed but those first encountered fled at the sight of the white men as if they had met with their worst foes and such was in very truth the caseif we may regard the portuguese halfcastes of that coast as white menfor these negroes were runaway slaves who stood the chance of being shot or drowned or whipped to death if recaptured  other animals they sawsome queer some terrible nearly all strange and last though not least the hippopotamus  when disco first saw this ungainly monster he was bereft of speech for some minutes  the usual hallo stuck in his throat and wellnigh choked him  he could only gasp and point  ay there goes a hippopotamus said harold with the easy nonchalance of a man who had been to the zoological gardens and knew all about it nevertheless it was quite plain that harold was much excited for he almost dropped his oar overboard in making a hasty grasp at his rifle before he could fire the creature gaped wide as if in laughter and dived  unfortunate said harold in a philosophically careless tone never mind we shall see lots more of them  ugliness embodied said disco heaving a deep sigh  but hims goot for eat said antonio smacking his lips  is he demanded disco of jumbo whose enjoyment of the sailors expressive looks was so great that whenever the latter opened his lips the former looked back over his shoulder with a broad grin of expectation  ho yis de hiputmus am fustrate grub for dis yer boy replied the negro rolling his red tongue inside his mouth suggestively  he never eats man does he inquired disco  nevair replied antonio  he looks as if he might returned the seaman anyhow hes got a mouth big enough to do it  youre quite sure he dont i spose  kite sure an sartin but me hab seen him tak mans said antonio  tak mans wot dee mean by that  tak him repeated antonio  go at hims canoe or boatbump with hims headdash in de timberscapsize sos man hab to swim shoreall as got clear ob de crokidils  while disco was meditating on this unpleasant trait of character in the hippopotamus the specimen which they had just seen or some other member of his family having compassion no doubt on the seamans ignorance proceeded to illustrate its method of attack then and there by rising suddenly under the canoe with such force that its head and shoulders shot high out of the water into which it fell with a heavy splash  harolds rifle being ready he fired just as it was disappearing  whether he hit or not is uncertain but next moment the enraged animal rose again under discos canoe which it nearly lifted out of the water in its efforts to seize it in its mouth  fortunately the canoe was too flat for its jaws to grip the monsters blunt teeth were felt as well as heard to grind across the planks and disco being in the stern which was raised highest was almost thrown overboard by the jerk  rising about two yards off the hippopotamus looked savagely at the canoe and was about to dive again when harold gave it a second shot the large gun being fortunately ready had been handed to him by one of the makololo men  the heavy ball took effect behind the eye and killed the animal almost instantaneously  the hippopotamus usually sinks when shot dead but in this case they were so near that before it had time to sink zombo assisted by his friend jumbo made a line fast to it and it was finally dragged to the shore  the landing however was much retarded by the crocodiles which now showed themselves for the first time and kept tugging and worrying the carcase much as a puppy tugs and worries a ladies muff affording disco and his friend strong reason to congratulate themselves that the canoe had not been overturned  the afternoon was pretty well advanced when the landing was accomplished on a small sandy island and as the spot was suitable for encamping they determined to remain there for the night and feast  there are many points of resemblance between savage and civilised festivities  whether the performers be the black sons of africa or the white fathers of europe there is the same powerful tendency to eat too much and the same display of goodfellowship for it is an indisputable fact that feeding man is amiable unless indeed he be dyspeptic there are also however various points of difference  the savage owing to the amount of fresh air and exercise which he is compelled to take usually eats with greater appetite and knows nothing of equine dreams or sleepless nights  on the whole we incline to the belief that despite his lack of refinement and ceremony the savage has the best of it in this matter  disco lillihammers visage during the progress of that feast formed a study worthy of a physiognomist  every new achievement whether trifling or important performed by the makololo triad jumbo zombo and masikoevery fresh hippopotamus steak skewered and set up to roast by the halfcaste brothers jose and oliveiraevery lick bestowed on their greasy fingers by the somali negroes nakoda and conda and every sigh of intense satisfaction heaved by the socalled freemen of quillimane songolo and mabruki was watched commented on and if we may say so reflected in the animated countenance of the stout seaman with such variety of expression and such an interesting compound of grin and wrinkle that poor jumbo who gazed at him over hippopotamus ribs and steaks and tried hard not to laugh was at last compelled to turn away his eyes in order that his mouth might have fairplay  but wonderful sumptuous and every way satisfactory though that feast was it bore no comparison whatever to another feast carried on at the same time by another party about fifty yards off where the carcase of the hippopotamus had been left half in and half out of the waterfor of course being fully more than a ton in weight only a small portion of the creature was appropriated by the canoemen  the negroes paid no attention whatever to this other festive party but in a short time disco turned his head to one side and saidwy wots that splashin i hears goin on over there  i suspect it must be some beast or other that has got hold of the carcase replied harold who was himself busy with a portion of the same  yis dat am krokidils got im said antonio with his mouth fullvery full  you dont say so said disco washing down the steak with a brimming cup of tea  no one appeared to think it worth while to asseverate the fact for it was selfevident  several crocodiles were supping and in doing so they tore away at the carcase with such violence and lashed the water so frequently with their powerful tails as to render it clear that their feast necessitated laborious effort and seemed less a recreation than a duty  moreover they sat at their meat like insatiable gourmands so long into the night that supper became transmuted into breakfast and harolds rest was greatly disturbed thereby  he was too sleepy and lazy however to rise and drive them away  next morning the travellers started early being anxious to pass as quietly as possible a small portuguese town near to which it was said a party of runaway slaves and rebels against the government were engaged in making depredations  when grey dawn was beginning to rise above the treetops they left their encampment in profound silence and rowed up stream as swiftly as possible  they had not advanced far when on turning a point covered with tall reeds zombo who was bowman in the leading canoe suddenly made a sign to the men to cease rowing  whats the matter whispered harold  the negro pointed through the reeds and whispered the single word canoe  by this time the other canoe had ranged up alongside and after a brief consultation between harold and disco it was decided that they should push gently into the reeds and wait till the strange canoe should pass but a few seconds sufficed to show that the two men who paddled it did not intend to pass down the river for they pushed straight out towards the deepest part of the stream  they were however carried down so swiftly by the current that they were brought quite near to the point of rushes where our travellers lay concealedso near that their voices could be distinctly heard  they talked in portuguese  antonio muttered a few words and harold observed that there was a good deal of excitement in the looks of his men  whats the matter he asked anxiously  antonio shook his head  dat nigger goin to be drownded he said bad niggerobstropolous nigger suppose  wot exclaimed disco in a whisper goin to be drownded wot dee mean  antonio proceeded to explain that it was a custom amongst the portuguese slaveowners there when they found any of their slaves intractable or refractory to hire some individuals who for a small sum would bind and carry off the incorrigible for the purpose of making away with him one method of effecting this was to tie him in a sack and throw him into the river the crocodiles making quite sure that the unfortunate being should never again be seen either alive or dead  but before antonio had finished his brief explanation he was interrupted by an exclamation from the horrified englishmen as they beheld the two men in the canoe raise something between them which for a moment appeared to struggle violently  shove off give way shouted harold and disco in the same breath each thrusting with his paddle so vigorously that the two canoes shot out like arrows into the stream  at the same instant there was a heavy plunge in the water beside the strange canoe and the victim sank  next moment one end of the sack rose to the surface  both harold and disco made straight towards it but it sank again and the two murderers paddled to the shore on which they drew up their canoe intending to take to the bush if necessary for safety  once again the sack rose not more than three yards from discos canoe the bold seaman knew that if it disappeared a third time there would be little chance of its rising again  he was prompt in action and daring to recklessness  in one moment he had leaped overboard dived caught the sack in his powerful grasp and bore it to the surface  the canoe had been steered for him  the instant he appeared strong and ready hands laid hold of him and his burden and dragged them both inboard  cut the lashins and give him air cried disco endeavouring to find his claspknife but one of the men quickly obeyed the order and opened the sack  a groan of horror and pity burst from the seaman when he beheld the almost insensible form of a powerful negro whose back was lacerated with innumerable ragged cuts and covered with clotted blood  where are the  he stopped short on looking round and observing that the two men were standing on the shore seized a doublebarrelled gun  the stream had carried the canoe a considerable distance below the spot where the murder had been attempted but they were still within range  without a moments hesitation disco took deliberate aim at them and fired  fortunately for him and his party disco was a bad shotnevertheless the bullet struck so close to the feet of the two men that it drove the sand and pebbles into their faces  they turned at once and fled but before they reached the cover of the bushes the second barrel was fired and the bullet whistled close enough over their heads greatly to accelerate their flight  the negroes opened their great round eyes and appeared awestruck at this prompt display of a thirst for vengeance on the part of one who had hitherto shown no other disposition than hilarity fun and goodhumour  harold was greatly relieved to observe discos failure for if he had hit either of the fugitives the consequences might have been very disastrous to their expedition  on being partially revived and questioned it turned out that the poor fellow had been whipped almost to death for refusing to be the executioner in whipping his own mother  this was a refinement in cruelty on the part of these professedly christian portuguese which our travellers afterwards learned was by no means uncommon  we are told by those who know that region well and whose veracity is unquestionable that the portuguese on the east coast of africa live in constant dread of their slaves rising against them  no wonder considering the fiendish cruelties to which they subject them  in order to keep them in subjection they underfeed them and if any of them venture to steal cocoanuts from the trees the owners thereof are at liberty to shoot them and throw them into the sea  slaves being cheap there and plentiful are easily replaced hence a cruel owner never hesitates  if a slave is refractory and flogging only makes him worse his master bids the overseer flog him until he will require no more still further to keep them in subjection the portuguese then endeavour to eradicate from them all sympathy with each other and all natural affection by the following means  if a woman requires to be flogged her brother or son is selected to do it  fathers are made to flog their daughters husbands their wives and if two young negroes of different sexes are observed to show any symptoms of growing attachment for each other these two are chosen for each others executioners  see travels in eastern africa by lyons mcleod esquire frgs and late her britannic majestys consul at mozambique volume one pages 274 to 277 and volume two page 27  the poor wretch whom we have just described as having been saved from death to which he had been doomed for refusing to become the executioner of his own mother was placed as tenderly and comfortably as circumstances would admit of in the bottom of the canoe and then our travellers pushed on with all hasteanxious to pass the town before the two fugitives could give the alarm  they were successful in this probably because the two men may have hid themselves for some time in the jungle under the impression that the exasperated englishmen might be searching for them on shore  giving themselves time only to take a hurried meal in the middle of the day our travellers rowed continuously till sunset when deeming it probable that pursuit if undertaken at all must have been abandoned they put ashore on the right bank of the river and encamped  when the sufferer had been made as comfortable as circumstances would allowfor he was much weakened by loss of blood as well as agonised with painand after he had been refreshed with food and some warm tea harold questioned him through the interpreter as to his previous history  at first the man was brusque in his manner and inclined to be sulky for a long course of cruelty had filled him with an intense hatred of white men  indeed an embittered and desperate spirit had begun to induce callous indifference to all men whether white or black  but kind treatment to which he was evidently unaccustomed and generous diet which was obviously new to him had a softening influence and when harold poured a small glass of rum into his tea and antonio added a lump of sugar and disco pressed him tenderly to drink it offwhich he didthe effect was very decided the settled scowl on his face became unsettled and gradually melting away was replaced by a milder and more manly look  by degrees he became communicative and bit by bit his story was drawn from him  it was brief but very sorrowful  his name he said was chimbolo  he belonged to a tribe which lived far inland beyond the manganja country which latter was a country of hills  he was not a manganja man but he had married a manganja woman one night he with his wife and mother was paying a visit to the village of his wifes relations when a band of slavehunters suddenly attacked the village  they were armed with guns and at once began to murder the old people and capture the young  resistance was useless his relatives were armed only with bows and spears  being taken by surprise they all fled in terror but were pursued and few escaped his wife he saidand a scowl of terrible ferocity crossed chimbolos face as he said itwas about to become a mother at the time  he seized her in his arms on the first alarm and fled with her into the bush where he concealed her and then hurried back to aid his relations but met themold and young strong and feebleflying for their lives  it was not possible to rally them he therefore joined in the flight while running a bullet grazed his head and stunned him  presently he recovered and rose but in a few minutes was overtaken and captured  a slavestick was put on his neck and along with a number of manganja men women and children he was driven down to the coast and sold with a number of other men and women among whom was his own mother to a portuguese merchant on the coast near the east luavo mouth of the zambesi  there he was found to be of a rebellious spirit and at last on positively refusing to lash his mother his master ordered him to be whipped to death but changing his mind before the order had been quite carried out he ordered him to be bound hand and foot and taken away in a sack  as to his wife he had never heard of her since that night which was about two years past  he knew that she had not been found because he had not seen her amongst the other captives  if they had found her they would have been sure to carry her off becausehere chimbolos visage again grew diabolicalshe was young he said and beautiful  when all this had been translated into bad english by antonio harold asked if chimbolo thought it probable that his wife was still alive in the manganja highlands  to this the former said that he thought it likely  wy then said disco giving his right thigh a powerful slap which was his favourite method of emphasising a remark wot dye say sir to lay our course for these same highlands and try for to find out this poor critter  just what was running in my own mind disco said harold musing over his supper  it does not make much difference what part of this country we go to being all new to us and as antonio tells me the manganja highlands are up the shire river which was explored by dr livingstone not long ago and is not distant many days journey from this i think we cant do better than go there  we shall have a good as well as a definite object in view  wery good sir im agreeable returned disco reaching forth his pewter plate another hunk o that pottimus jumbo its better than saltjunk any day and i say jumbo dont grin so much else yell enlarge yer pretty little mouth which ud be a pity  yis saar replied jumbo becoming very grave all of a sudden but on receiving a nod and an expressive wink from the seaman he exploded again and rolled backward on the grass in the performance of which act he capsized zombos can of tea whereupon zombo leaped upon him in wrath and masiko as in duty bound came to the rescue  clap a stopper on yer noise will ee cried disco sternly else youll be bringin all the wild beasts in these parts down on us to see wot its all about  that reminds me said harold when quiet was restored that we must now organise ourselves into something of a fighting banda company as it were of soldiersand take our regular spell of watching by night for from all that i hear of the disturbed state of the country just now with these runaway slaves and rebels it will be necessary to be on our guard  of course he added smiling i suppose i must be captain of the company and you disco shall be lieutenant  not at all replied the seaman shaking his head and frowning at jumbo whose brilliant teeth at once responded to the glance not at all none of your sodgerin for me  i never could abide the lobsters fustmate sir thats wot i am if im to be expected to do my dooty  well then firstmate be it rejoined harold and antonio shall be serjeantmajor  bosnbosn suggested disco keep up appearances wotiver ye do an dont let the memory of salt water go down  very good said harold laughing then you shall be boatswain antonio as well as cook and i will instruct you in the first part of your duty which will be to keep watch for an hour while the rest of us sleep  my firstmate will teach you the whistling part of a boatswains duty if that should be required  ah and the roar interrupted disco a bosn would be nothin without his roar  at that moment the woods around them were filled with a tremendous and very unexpected roar which caused the whole party to spring up and induced the new bosn to utter a yell of terror that would have done credit to the whistle of the most violent bosn on the sea  next moment the travellers were surrounded by a large and excited band of armed negroes    chapter seven  enemies are changed into friendsour travellers penetrate into the interior of the land  to possess the power of looking perfectly calm and unconcerned when you are in reality considerably agitated and rather anxious is extremely useful in any circumstances but especially so when one happens to be in the midst of grinning gesticulating naked savages  our hero harold seadrift possessed that power in an eminent degree and his firstmate disco lillihammer was not a whit behind him  although both had started abruptly to their legs at the first alarm and drawn their respective revolvers they no sooner found themselves surrounded by overwhelming numbers than they lowered their weapons and turning back to back faced the intruders with calm countenances  sit down men every one of you except antonio said harold in a quiet but clear and decided voice  his men who having left their guns in the canoe were utterly helpless quietly obeyed  who are you and what do you want demanded antonio by harolds order  to this a tall negro who was obviously the leader of the band replied in the native tongueit matters little who we are you are in our power  not quite said harold slightly moving his revolver  tell him that he may overcome us but before he does so my friend and i carry the lives of twelve of his men in our pistols  the negro chief who quite understood the powers of a revolver repliedtell your master that before he could fire two shots he and his friend would have each twelve bullets in his body  but i have not time to palaver here  who are you and where are you going  we are englishmen travelling to see the country replied harold  the chief looked doubtfully at him and seemed to waver then suddenly making up his mind he frowned and said sternlyno that is a lie you are portuguese scoundrels  you shall all die  you have robbed us of our liberty our wives our children our homes you have chained and tortured and flogged ushe gnashed his teeth at this point and his followers grew excited  now we have got free and you are caught we will let you know what it is to be slaves  as the negro chief stirred up his wrath by thus recounting his wrongs and advanced a step harold begged disco in a low urgent voice not to raise his pistol  then looking the savage full in the face without showing a trace of anxiety he saidyou are wrong  we are indeed englishmen and you know that the english detest slavery and would if they could put a stop to it altogether  yes i know that said the chief  we have seen one englishman here and he has made us to know that not all men with white faces are devilslike the portuguese and arabs  but how am i to know you are english  again the chief wavered a little as if halfinclined to believe harolds statement  here is proof for you said harold pointing to chimbolo who being scarcely able to move had remained all this time beside the fire leaning on his elbow and listening intently to the conversation  see he continued that is a slave  look at him  as he said this harold stepped quickly forward and removed the blanket with which he had covered his lacerated back after dressing it  a howl of execration burst from the band of negroes who pointed their spears and guns at the travellers breasts and would have made a speedy end of the whole party if antonio had not exclaimed speak chimbolo speak  the slave looked up with animation and told the rebels how his portuguese owner had ordered him to be flogged to death but changed his mind and doomed him to be drownedhow that in the nick of time these white men had rescued him and had afterwards treated him with the greatest kindness  chimbolo did not say much but what he did say was uttered with emphasis and feeling  this was enough  those who would have been enemies were suddenly converted into warm friends and the desperadoes who would have torn their former masters or any of their race limb from limb if they could have got hold of them left our adventurers undisturbed in their bivouac after wishing them a prosperous journey  it was nevertheless deemed advisable to keep watch during the night this was done faithfully and conscientiously as far as it went  harold took the first hour by way of example  he sat over the fire alternately gazing into its embers while he meditated of home and round upon the dark forest while he thought of africa  true to time he called disco who equally true to his sense of duty turned out at once with a deep ay ay sir  the selfstyled firstmate placed his back against a tree and endeavouring to believe it to be a capstan or binnacle or any other object appertaining to the sea stared at the ghostly stems of the foresttrees until they began to dance hornpipes for his special gratification or glowered at the shadows until they became instinct with life and all but induced him to rouse the camp twenty times in the course of his hours vigil  true to time also like his predecessor disco roused antonio and immediately turned in  the vivacious chef de cuisine started up at once took up his position at the foot of the tree which disco had just left leaned his back against it and straightway went to sleep in which condition he remained till morning leaving the camp in unprotected felicity and blissful ignorance  fortunately for all parties disco awoke in time to catch him napping and resolved to punish him  he crept stealthily round to the back of the tree against which the faithless man leaned and reached gently round until his mouth was close to antonios cheek then collecting all the air that his vast lungs were capable of containing he poured into antonios ear a cumulative roar that threw the camp and the denizens of the wilderness far and near into confusion and almost drove the whole marrow in antonios body out at his heels  the stricken man sprang up as if earth had shot him forth uttered a yell of terror such as seldom greets the ear and rushed blindly forward  repeating the roar disco plunged after him  antonio tumbled over the fire recovered himself dashed on and would certainly have plunged into the river if not into the jaws of a crocodile had not jumbo caught him in his arms in the midst of a chorus of laughter from the other men  how dare ee go to sleep on dooty demanded disco seizing the culprit by the collar eh we might have bin all murdered by rebels or eaten by lions or had our eyes picked out by gorillas for all that you would have done to prevent iteh giving him a shake  oh pardon forgif  nevair doot more again exclaimed the breathless and trembling antonio  youd better not said disco giving him another shake and releasing him  having done so he turned on his heel and bestowed a quiet look in passing on jumbo which of course threw that unfortunate man into convulsions  after this little incident a hasty breakfast was taken the canoes were launched and the voyage was continued  it is not necessary to trace the course of our explorers day by day as they ascended the zambesi or to recount all the adventures or misadventures that befell them on their journey into the interior  it is sufficient for the continuity of our tale to say that many days after leaving the coast they turned into the shire river which flows into the zambesi about 150 miles from the coast  there are many fountainheads of slavery in africa  the region of the interior which gives birth to the headwaters of the shire river is one of the chief of these  here lies the great lake nyassa which was discovered and partly explored by dr livingstone and hence flows a perennial stream of traffic to kilwa on the coastwhich traffic at the present time consists almost exclusively of the two kinds of ivory white and black the former elephants tusks being carried by the latter slaves by which means the slavetrade is rendered more profitable  towards this populous and fertile region then our adventurers directed their course when they turned out of the great river zambesi and began to ascend the shire  and here at the very outset of this part of the journey they met with a portuguese settler who did more to open their eyes to the blighting and withering influence of slavery on the land and on its people than anything they had yet seen  towards the afternoon of the first day on the shire they landed near the encampment of the settler referred to who turned out to be a gentleman of a portuguese town on the zambesi  harold found to his delight that he could speak english fluently and was moreover an exceedingly agreeable and wellinformed man  he was out at the time on a hunting expedition attended by a party of slaves  harold spent the evening in very pleasant intercourse with senhor gamba and at a later hour than usual returned to his camp where he entertained disco with an account of his new acquaintance  while thus engaged he was startled by the most appalling shrieks which proceeded from the neighbouring encampment  under the impression that something was wrong both he and disco leaped up and ran towards it there to his amazement and horror harold beheld his agreeable friend senhor gamba thrashing a young slave unmercifully with a whip of the most formidable character  only a few lashes from it had been given when harold ran up but these were so powerful that the unhappy victim dropped down in a state of insensibility just as he reached the spot  the portuguese gentleman turned away from the prostrate slave with a scowl but betrayed a slight touch of confusion on meeting the gaze of harold seadrift  senhor exclaimed the latter sternly with mingled remonstrance and rebuke in his tone how can you be so cruel  what has the boy done to merit such inhuman chastisement  he has neglected my orders answered the portuguese as though he resented the tone in which harold spoke  but surely surely said harold the punishment is far beyond the offence  i can scarcely believe the evidence of my own eyes and ears when they tell me that you have been guilty of this  come returned senhor gamba softening into a smile you english cannot understand our case in this land  because you do not keep slaves you take the philanthropic the religious view of the question we who do keep slaves have a totally different experience  you cannot understand you cannot sympathise with us  no truly we can not understand you said harold earnestly and god forbid that we should ever sympathise with you in this matter  we detest the gross injustice of slavery and we abhor the fearful cruelties connected with it  that is because as i said you are not in our position rejoined the senhor with a shrug of his shoulders  it is easy for you to take the philanthropic view which however i admit to be the best for in the eyes of god all men are equal and though the african be a degraded man i know enough of him to be sure that he can be raised by kindness and religion into a position not very inferior to our own but we who keep slaves cannot help ourselves we must act as we do  why sois cruelty a necessity asked harold  yes it is replied the senhor decidedly  then the abolition of slavery is a needcessity too growled disco who had hitherto looked on and listened in silent wonder debating with himself as to the propriety of giving senhor gamba then and there a sound thrashing with his own whip  you see continued the portuguese paying no attention to discos growlyou see in order to live out here i must have slaves and in order to keep slaves i must have a whip  my whip is no worse than any other whip that i know of  i dont justify it as right i simply defend it as necessary  wherever slavery exists discipline must of necessity be brutal  if you keep slaves and mean that they shall give you the labour of their bodies and of their minds also in so far as you permit them to have minds you must degrade them by the whip and by all other means at your disposal until like dogs they become the unhesitating servants of your will no matter what that will may be and live for your pleasure only  it will never pay me to adopt your philanthropic your religious views  i am here  i must be here  what am i to do starve  no not if i can help it  i do as others dokeep slaves and act as the master of slaves  i must use the whip  perhaps you wont believe me continued senhor gamba with a sad smile but i speak truth when i say that i was tenderhearted when i first came to this country for i had been well nurtured in lisbon but that soon passed awayit could not last  i was the laughingstock of my companions just to explain my position i will tell you a circumstance which happened soon after i came here  the governor invited me to a party of pleasure  the party consisted of himself his daughters some officers and others  we were to go in boats to a favourite island resort several miles off  i took one of my slaves with me a lad that i kept about my person  as we were going along this lad fell into the river he could not swim and the tide was carrying him fast away to death dressed as i was in full uniform i plunged in after him and saved him the wish alone to save the boys life prompted me to risk my own  and for this i became the jest of the party even the ladies tittered at my folly  next evening the governor had a large dinnerparty  i was there  having caught cold i coughed slightly this drew attention to me  remarks were made and the governor alluded in scoffing terms to my exploit which created much mirth  were you drunk said one  had you lost your senses to risk your life for a brute of a negro said another  rather than spoil my uniform i would have knocked him on the head with a pole said a third and it was a long time before what they termed my folly was forgotten or forgiven  you think i am worse than others  i am not but i do not condescend to their hypocrisy  what i am now i have been made by this country and its associates  these words are not fictitious  the remarks of senhor gamba were actually spoken by a portuguese slaveowner and will be found in the story of the universities mission to central africa pages 6456  senhor gamba said this with the air of one who thinks that he has nearly if not quite justified himself  i am no worse than others is an excuse for evil conduct not altogether unknown in more highly favoured lands and is often followed by the illogical conclusion therefore i am not to blame but although harold felt pity for his agreeable chance acquaintance he could not admit that this explanation excused him nor could he get over the shock which his feelings had sustained it was therefore with comparatively little regret that he bade him adieu on the following morning and pursued his onward way  everywhere along the shire they met with a more or less hospitable reception from the natives who regarded them with great favour in consequence of their belonging to the same nation which had sent forth men to explore their country defend them from the slavedealer and teach them about the true god  these men of whom mention is made in another chapter had some time before this been sent by the church of england to the manganja highlands at the suggestion of dr livingstone and laid we believe the foundationstone of christian civilisation in the interior of africa though god saw fit to arrest them in the raising of the superstructure  among other pieces of useful knowledge conveyed by them to the negroes of the shire was the fact that englishmen are not cannibals and that they have no special longings after black man steaks  it may perchance surprise some readers to learn that black men ever entertain such a preposterous notion  nevertheless it is literally true  the slaversarabs and portuguesefind it in their interest to instil this falsehood into the minds of the ignorant tribes of the interior from whom the slaves are gathered in order that their captives may entertain a salutary horror of englishmen so that if their dhows should be chased by our cruisers while creeping northward along the coast and run the risk of being taken the slaves may willingly aid their captors in trying to escape  that the lesson has been well learnt and thoroughly believed is proved by the fact that when a dhow is obliged to run ashore to avoid capture the slaves invariably take to the woods on the wings of terror preferring no doubt to be reenslaved rather than to be roasted and eaten by white fiends  indeed so thoroughly has this been engrained into the native mind that mothers frequently endeavour to overawe their refractory offspring by threatening to hand them over to the dreadful white monster who will eat them up if they dont behave    chapter eight  relates adventures in the shire valley and touches on one or two phases of slavery  everything depends upon taste as the monkey remarked when it took to nibbling the end of its own tail  if you like a thing you take one view of it if you dont like it you take another view  either view if detailed would be totally irreconcilable with the other  the lower part of the river shire into which our travellers had now entered is a vast swamp  there are at least two opinions in regard to that region  to do justice to those with whom we dont sympathise we give our opponents view first  our opponent observe is an honest and competent man he speaks truly he only looks at it in another light from harold seadrift and disco lillihammer  he says of the river shire it drains a low and exceedingly fertile valley of from fifteen to twenty miles in breadth  ranges of wooded hills bound this valley on both sides  after the first twenty miles you come to mount morambala which rises with steep sides to 4000 feet in height  it is wooded to the top and very beautiful  a small village peeps out about halfway up the mountain  it has a pure bracing atmosphere and is perched above mosquito range  the people on the summit have a very different climate and vegetation from those on the plains and they live amidst luxuriant vegetation  there are many species of ferns some so large as to deserve the name of trees  there are also lemon and orange trees growing wild and birds and animals of all kinds  thus far we agree with our opponent but listen to him as he goes on  the view from morambala is extensive but cheerless past description swamp swampreeking festering rotting malariapregnant swamp where poisonous vapours for several months in the year are ever bulging up and out into the airlies before you as far as the eye can reach and farther  if you enter the river at the worst seasons of the year the chances are you will take the worst type of fever  if on the other hand you enter it during the best season when the swamps are fairly dried up you have everything in your favour  now our opponent gives a true statement of facts undoubtedly but his view of them is not cheering  contrast them with the view of disco lillihammer  that sagacious seaman had entered the shire neither in the best nor the worst of the season  he had chanced upon it somewhere between the two  git up your steam an go longside he said to jumbo one afternoon as the two canoes were proceeding quietly among magnificent giantreeds sedges and bulrushes which towered high above themin some places overhung them  i say mister harold aint it splendid  magnificent replied harold with a look of quiet enthusiasm  i does enjoy a swamp continued the seaman allowing a thin cloud to trickle from his lips  so do i disco  theres such a many outs and ins an roundabouts in it  and such powerful reflections o them reeds in the quiet water  wy sir i do declare wen i looks through em in a dreamy sort of way for a long time i get to fancy theyre palmtrees an that were sailin through a forest without no end to it an when i looks over the side an sees every reed standin on its other self so to speak an follers the under one down till my eyes git lost in the blue sky an clouds below us i do sometimes feel as if wed got into the middle of fairyland was fairly afloat on the air an off on a voyage through the univarse but its them reflections as i like most  every leaf an stalk an flag is just as good an real in the water as out of it  an just look at that there frog sir that one on the big leaf which has swelled hisself up as if he wanted to bust with his head looking up hopefully to theah hes down with a plop like lead but he wos sittin on his own image which wos as clear as his own self  then theres so much variety sirthats where it is  you never know wot youre comin to in them swamps  it may be a openin like a pretty lake with islands of reeds everywhere or it may be a narrow bit like a canal or a river or a bit so close that you go scrapin the gunles on both sides  an the life too is most amazin  never saw nothin like it nowhere  all kinds big an little plain an pritty queer an orrible swarms here to sitch an extent that ive got it into my head that this shire valley must be the great original nursery of animated nature  it looks like it disco  the last idea appeared to furnish food for reflection as the two friends here relapsed into silence  although discos description was quaint it could scarcely be styled exaggerated for the swamp was absolutely alive with animal life  the principal occupant of these marshes is the elephant and hundreds of these monster animals may be seen in one herd feeding like cattle in a meadow  owing to the almost impenetrable nature of the reedy jungle however it is impossible to follow them and anxious though disco was to kill one he failed to obtain a single shot  buffaloes and other large game were also numerous in this region and in the water crocodiles and hippopotami sported about everywhere while aquatic birds of every shape and size rendered the air vocal with their cries sometimes these feathered denizens of the swamp arose when startled in a dense cloud so vast that the mighty rush of their wings was almost thunderous in character  the crocodiles were not only numerous but dangerous because of their audacity  they used to watch at the places where native women were in the habit of going down to the river for water and not unfrequently succeeded in seizing a victim  this however only happened at those periods when the shire was in flood when fish were driven from their wonted haunts and the crocodiles were reduced to a state of starvation and consequent ferocity  one evening while our travellers were proceeding slowly up stream they observed the corpse of a negro boy floating past the canoe just then a monstrous crocodile rushed at it with the speed of a greyhound caught it and shook it as a terrier does a rat  others dashed at the prey each with his powerful tail causing the water to churn and froth as he tore off a piece  in a few seconds all was gone  livingstones zambesi and its tributaries page 452 that same evening zombo had a narrow escape  after dusk he ran down to the river to drink  he chanced to go to a spot where a crocodile was watching  it lay settled down in the mud with its head on a level with the water so that in the feeble light it could not be seen  while zombo was busy laving the water into his mouth it suddenly rushed at him and caught him by the hand  the limb of a bush was fortunately within reach and he laid hold of it  there was a brief struggle  the crocodile tugged hard but the man tugged harder at the same time he uttered a yell which brought jumbo to his side with an oar a blow from which drove the hideous reptile away  poor zombo was too glad to have escaped with his life to care much about the torn hand which rendered him hors de combat for some time after that  although disco failed to get a shot at an elephant his hopeful spirit was gratified by the catching of a baby elephant alive  it happened thus  one morning not very long after zombos tussle with the crocodile discos canoe which chanced to be in advance suddenly ran almost into the midst of a herd of elephants which were busy feeding on palmnuts of which they are very fond  instantly the whole troop scattered and fled  disco taken completely by surprise omitted his wonted hallo as he made an awkward plunge at his rifle but before he could bring it to bear the animals were over the bank of the river and lost in the dense jungle  but a fine little elephant at that period of life which in human beings might be styled the toddling age was observed to stumble while attempting to follow its mother up the bank  it fell and rolled backwards  give way for your lives roared disco  the boat shot its bow on the bank and the seaman flew rather than leaped upon the baby elephant  the instant it was laid hold of it began to scream with incessant and piercing energy after the fashion of a pig  queek come in canoe  modder come back for im cried jumbo in some anxiety  disco at once appreciated the danger of the enraged mother returning to the rescue but resolved not to resign his advantage he seized the vicious little creature by the proboscis and dragged it by main force to the canoe into which he tumbled hauled the proboscis inboard as though it had been the bite of a cable and held on  shove off shove off and give way lads  look alive  the order was promptly obeyed and in a few minutes the baby was dragged into the boat and secured  this prize however was found to be more of a nuisance than an amusement and it was soon decided that it must be disposed of accordingly that very night much to the regret of the men who wanted to make a meal of it disco led his baby squealing into the jungle and set it free with a hearty slap on the flank and an earnest recommendation to make all sail after its venerable mother which it did forthwith cocking its ears and tail and shrieking as it went  two days after this event they made a brief halt at a poor village where they were hospitably received by the chief who was much gratified by the liberal quantity of calico with which the travellers paid for their entertainment  here they met with a portuguese halfcaste who was reputed one of the greatest monsters of cruelty in that part of the country  he was however not much more villainous in aspect than many other halfcastes whom they saw  he was on his way to the coast in a canoe manned by slaves  if harold and disco had known that this was his last journey to the coast they would have regarded him with greater interest  as it was having learned his history from the chief through their interpreter they turned from him with loathing  as this halfcastes career illustrates the depths to which humanity may fall in the hotbed of slavery as well as to some extent the state of things existing under portuguese rule on the east coast of africa we give the particulars briefly  instead of the whip this man used the gun which he facetiously styled his minister of justice and in mere wantonness he was known to have committed murder again and again yet no steps were taken by the authorities to restrain much less to punish him  men heard of his murders but they shrugged their shoulders and did nothing  it was only a wild beast of a negro that was killed they said and what was that they seemed to think less of it than if he had shot a hippopotamus  one of his murders was painfully notorious even to its minutest particulars  over the female slaves employed in a house and adjacent lands there is usually placed a headwoman a slave also chosen for such an office for her blind fidelity to her master  this man had one such woman one who had ever been faithful to him and his interests who had never provoked him by disobedience or illconduct and against whom therefore he could have no cause of complaint  one day when half drunk he was lying on a couch in his house his forewoman entered and made herself busy with some domestic work  as her master lay watching her his savage disposition found vent in a characteristic joke woman said he i think i will shoot you  the woman turned round and said master i am your slave you can do what you will with me  you can kill me if you like i can do nothing  but dont kill me master for if you do who is there to look after your other women they will all run away from you  she did not mean to irritate her master but instantly the mans brutal egotism was aroused  the savage jest became a fearful reality and he shouted with rage  say you that say you that fetch me my gun  i will see if my women will run away after i have killed you  trained to implicit obedience the poor woman did as she was bid  she brought the gun and handed him powder and ball  at his command she knelt down before him and the wretch fired at her breast  in his drunken rage he missed his markthe ball went through her shoulder she besought him to spare her  deaf to her entreaties he ordered her to fetch more powder and ball  though wounded and in agony she obeyed him  again the gun was loaded again levelled and fired and the woman fell dead at his feet  the above narrative is quoted almost verbatim from the story of the universities mission to central africa pages 78 and 79 the author of which vouches for its accuracy  the facts of this case were known far and wide  the portuguese governor was acquainted with them as well as the ministers of justice but no one put forth a hand to punish the monster or to protect his slaves  but vengeance overtook him at last  on his way down the zambesi he shot one of his men  the others roused to irresistible fury sprang upon him and strangled him  then indeed the governor and magistrates were roused to administer justice  they had allowed this fiend to murder slaves at his will but no sooner had the slaves turned on and killed their master than ceaseless energy and resolution were displayed in punishing those who slew him  soldiers were sent out in all directions some of the canoemen were shot down like wild beasts the rest were recaptured and publicly whipped to death  reader this is domestic slavery  this is what portugal and zanzibar claim the right to practise  this is what great britain has for many years declined to interfere with  this is the curse with which africa is blighted at the present day in some of her fairest lands and this is what portugal has decreed shall not terminate in what she calls her african dominions for some years to come  in other words it has been coolly decreed by that weakest of all the european nations that slavery murder injustice and every other conceivable and unmentionable vice and villainy shall still for some considerable time continue to be practised on the men women and children of africa  higher up the shire river the travellers saw symptoms of recent distress among the people which caused them much concern  chimbolo in particular was rendered very anxious by the account given of the famine which prevailed still farther up the river and the numerous deaths that had taken place in consequence  the cause of the distress was a common one and easily explained slavedealers had induced the ajawa a warlike tribe to declare war against the people of the manganja highlands  the ajawa had done this before and were but too ready to do it again  they invaded the land captured many of the young people and slew the aged  those who escaped to the jungle found on their return that their crops were destroyed little seed remained in their possession and before that was planted and grown famine began to reduce the ranks already thinned by war  indications of this sad state of things became more numerous as the travellers advanced  few natives appeared to greet them on the banks of the river as they went along and these few resembled living skeletons in many places they found dead bodies lying on the ground in various stages of decomposition and everywhere they beheld an aspect of settled unutterable despair on the faces of the scattered remnant of the bereaved and starving people  it was impossible in the circumstances for harold seadrift to give these wretched people more than very slight relief  he gave them as much of his stock of provisions as he could spare and was glad when the necessity of continuing the journey on foot relieved him from such mournful scenes by taking him away from the rivers bank  hiring a party of the strongest men that he could find among them he at length left his canoes made up his goods food and campequipage into bundles of a shape and size suitable to being carried on the heads of men and started on foot for the manganja highlands  seems to me sir observed disco as they plodded along together on the first morning of the land journeyseems to me sir that chimbolo dont stand much chance of findin his wife alive  poor fellow replied harold glancing back at the object of their remarks i fear not  chimbolo had by that time recovered much of his natural vigour and although not yet able to carry a mans load was nevertheless quite capable of following the party  he walked in silence with his eyes on the ground a few paces behind antonio who was a step or two in rear of his leader and who in virtue of his position as bosn to the party was privileged to walk hampered by no greater burden than his gun  we must keep up his sperrits tho poor chap said disco in the hoarse whisper with which he was wont to convey secret remarks and which was much more fitted to attract attention than his ordinary voice it ud never do to let his sperrits down cause wy hes weak an if he knowd that his wife was dead or took off as a slave hed never be able to go along with us and we couldnt leave him to starve here you know  certainly not disco returned harold  besides his wife may be alive for all we know to the contraryhow far did he say the village was from where we landed antonio  bout two tree days answered the bosn  that night the party encamped beside the ruins of a small hamlet where charred sticks and fragments of an african households goods and chattels lay scattered on the ground  chimbolo sat down here on the ground and resting his chin on his knees gazed in silence at the ruin around him  come cheer up old fellow cried disco with rather an awkward effort at heartiness as he slapped the negro gently on the shoulder tell him antonio not to let his heart go down  didnt he say that whatdeecalltheplacehis villagewas a strong place and could be easily held by a few brave men  true replied chimbolo through the interpreter but the manganja men are not very brave  well well never mind rejoined the sympathetic tar repeating his pat on the back theres no sayin  praps they got courage wen it came to the scratch  praps it never came to the scratch at all up there  mayhap youll find em all right after all  come never say die slong as theres a shot in the locker  thats a good motto for ee chimbolo and ought to keep up your heart even tho ye are a nigger cause it wos inwented by the great nelson and shouted by him or his bosn just before he got knocked over at the glorious battle of trafalgar  tell him that antonio  whether antonio told him all that is extremely doubtful although he complied at once with the order for antonio never by any chance declined at least to attempt the duties of his station but the only effect of his speech was that chimbolo shook his head and continued to stare at the ruins  next morning they started early and towards evening drew near to zomba  the country through which during the previous two days they had travelled was very beautiful and as wild as even disco could desire and by the way it was no small degree of wildness that could slake the thirst for the marvellous which had been awakened in the breast of our tar by his recent experiences in africa  it was he saidand said trulya real outandout wilderness  there were villages everywhere no doubt but these were so thickly concealed by trees and jungle that they were not easily seen and most of them were at that time almost depopulated  the grass was higher than the heads of the travellers and the vegetation everywhere was rankly luxuriant  here and there open glades allowed the eye to penetrate into otherwise impenetrable bush elsewhere large trees abounded in the midst of overwhelmingly affectionate parasites whose gnarled lower limbs and twining tendrils and pendant foliage gave a softness to the landscape which contrasted well with the wild passes and rugged rocks of the middle distance and the towering mountains which rose range beyond range in the far distance  but as the party approached the neighbourhood of zomba mountains few of them were disposed to give much heed to the beauties of nature  all being interested in chimbolo they became more or less anxious as to news that awaited him  on turning a spur of one of the mountains which had hitherto barred their vision they found themselves suddenly face to face with a small band of manganja men whose woebegone countenances told too eloquently that the hand of the destroyer had been heavy upon them  of course they were questioned by chimbolo and the replies they gave him were such as to confirm the fears he had previously entertained  the ajawa they said had just the day before burnt their villages stolen or destroyed their property killed many of their kinsmen and carried off their wives and children for slaves  they themselves had escaped and were now on their way to visit their chief who was at that time on the banks of the zambesi to beg of him to return in order that he might bewitch the guns of the ajawa and so render them harmless  has a woman of your tribe named marunga been slain or captured asked chimbolo eagerly  to this the men replied that they could not tell  marunga they said was known well to them by name and sight  they did not think she was among the captives but could not tell what had become of her as the village where she and her little boy lived had been burnt and all who had not been killed or captured had taken to the bush  marungas husband they added was a man named chimbolonot a manganja man but a friend of the tribewho had been taken by the slavers under command of a portuguese halfcaste named marizano about two years before that time  chimbolo winced as though he had been stung when marizanos name was mentioned and a dark frown contracted his brows when he told the manganja men that he was chimbolo and that he was even then in search of marunga and her little boy  when all this had been explained to harold seadrift he told the men that it was a pity to waste time in travelling such a long way to see their chief who could not even if he wished bewitch the guns of the ajawa and advised them to turn back and guide him and his men to the place where the attack had been made on the manganja so that a search might be made in the bush for those of the people who had escaped  this was agreed to and the whole party proceeded on their way with increased speed chimbolo and harold hoping they might yet find that marunga had escaped and disco earnestly desiring that they might only fall in with the ajawa and have a brush with them in which case he assured the negroes he would show them a way of bewitching their guns that would beat their chiefs bewitchment all to sticks and stivers  the village in which marunga had dwelt was soon reached  it was as they had been told by their new friends a heap of still smouldering ashes but it was not altogether destitute of signs of life  a dog was observed to slink away into the bush as they approached  the moment chimbolo observed it he darted into the bush after it  hallo exclaimed disco in surprise that nigger seems to have took a sudden fancy to the cureh antonio wots the reason of that think ee  dunno spose where dog be mans be  ah or womans suggested disco  or womans assented antonio  just then they heard chimbolos shout which was instantly followed by a succession of female shrieks  these latter were repeated several times and sounded as though the fugitives were scattering  hims find a nest of womins exclaimed jumbo throwing down his load and dashing away into the bush  every individual of the party followed his example not excepting harold and disco the latter of whom was caught by the leg the moment he left the track by a waitabit thornmost appropriately socalled because its powerful spikes are always ready to seize and detain the unwary passerby  in the present instance it checked the seamans career for a few seconds and rent his nether garments sadly while harold profiting by his friends misfortune leaped over the bush and passed on  disco quickly extricated himself and followed  they were not left far behind and overtook their comrades just as they emerged on an open space or glade at the extremity of which a sight met their eyes that filled them with astonishment for there a troop of women and one or two boys were seen walking towards them with chimbolo in front having a child on his left shoulder and performing a sort of insane wardance round one of the women  hes catched her exclaimed disco with excited looks just as if chimbolo had been angling unsuccessfully for a considerable time and had hooked a stupendous fish at last  and disco was right  a few of the poor creatures who were so recently burnt out of their homes and had lost most of those dearest to them had ventured as if drawn by an irresistible spell to return with timid steps to the scene of their former happiness but only to have their worst fears confirmed  their homes their protectors their children their hopes all were gone at one fell swoop  only one among themone who having managed to save her only child had none to mourn over and no one to hope to meet withonly one returned to a joyful meeting  we need scarcely say that this was marunga  the fact was instantly made plain to the travellers by the wild manner in which chimbolo shouted her name pointed to her and danced round her while he showed all his glistening teeth and as much of the whites of his eyes as was consistent with these members remaining in their orbits  really it was quite touching in spite of its being ludicrous the way in which the poor fellow poured forth his joy like a very childwhich he was in everything except years and harold could not help remembering and recalling to discos memory yoosoofs observations touching the hardness of negroes hearts and their want of natural affection on the morning when his dhow was captured by the boat of the firefly  the way in which ever and anon chimbolo kissed his poor but now happy wife was wondrously similar to the mode in which white men perform that little operation except that there was more of an unrefined smack in it  the tears which would hop over his sable cheeks now and then sparkled to the full as brightly as european tears and were perhaps somewhat bigger and the pride with which he regarded his little son holding him in both hands out at armslength was only excelled by the joy and the tremendous laugh with which he received a kick on the nose from that undutiful sons black little toes  but yoosoof never chanced to be present when such exhibitions of negro feeling and susceptibility took place  how could he seeing that men and women and childrenif blackfled from him and such as he in abject terror  neither did yoosoof ever chance to be present when women sat down beside their blackened hearths as they did that night and quietly wept as though their hearts would burst at the memory of little voices and manly tonesnot silent in death but worse than thatgone gone for ever  doubtless they felt though they never heard of and could not in words express the sentiment    oh for the touch of a vanished hand   and the sound of a voice that is still  yoosoof knew not of and cared nothing for such feelings as these  we ask again how could he  his only experience of the negro was when cowering before him as a slave or when yelling in agony under his terrible lash or when brutalised and rendered utterly apathetic by inhuman cruelty  harold learned that night on further conversation with the manganja men that a raid had recently been made into those regions by more than one band of slavers sent out to capture men and women by the portuguese halfcastes of the towns of senna and tette on the zambesi and that they had been carrying the inhabitants out of the country at the rate of about two hundred a week  this however was but a small speck so to speak of the mighty work of kidnapping human beings that was going onthat is still going on in those regions  yoosoof would have smiledhe never laughedif you had mentioned such a number as being large  but in truth he cared nothing about such facts except in so far as they represented a large amount of profit accrueing to himself  the result of harold seadrifts cogitations on these matters was that he resolved to pass through as much of the land as he could within a reasonable time and agreed to accompany chimbolo on a visit to his tribe which dwelt at some distance to the north of the manganja highlands    chapter nine  in which a savage chief astonishes a savage animal  there is something exceedingly pleasant in the act of watching ourselves unseenthe proceedings of some one whose aims and ends appear to be very mysterious  there is such a wide field of speculation opened up in which to expatiate such a vast amount of curious we had almost said romantic expectation created all the more if the individual whom we observe be a savage clothed in an unfamiliar and very scanty garb and surrounded by scenery and circumstances which albeit strange to us are evidently by no means new to him  let usyou and me readerquitting for a time the sad subject of slavery and leaping as we are privileged to do far ahead of our explorers harold seadrift and his company into the region of central africa let you and me take up a position in a clump of trees by the banks of yonder stream and watch the proceedings of that negronegro chief let me say for he looks like onewho is engaged in some mysterious enterprise under the shade of a huge baobab tree  the chief is a fine stately welldeveloped specimen of african manhood  he is clothed in black tights manufactured in natures loom in addition to which he wears round his loins a small scrap of artificial cotton cloth  if an enthusiastic member of the royal academy were in search of a model which should combine the strength of hercules with the grace of apollo he could not find a better than the man before us for you will observe the more objectionable points about our ideal of the negro are not very prominent in him  his lips are not thicker than the lips of many a roastbeefloving john bull  his nose is not flat and his heels do not protrude unnecessarily  true his hair is woolly but that is scarcely a blemish  it might almost be regarded as the crisp and curly hair that surrounds a manly skull  his skin is blackno doubt about that but then it is intensely black and glossy suggestive of black satin and having no savour of that dirtiness which is inseparably connected with whiteybrown  tribes in africa differ materially in many respects physically and mentally just as do the various tribes of europe  this chief as we have hinted is a savage that is to say he differs in many habits and points from civilised people  among other peculiarities he clothes himself and his family in the fashion that is best suited to the warm climate in which he dwells  this display of wisdom is as you know somewhat rare among civilised people as any one may perceive who observes how these overclothe the upper parts of their children and leave their tender little lower limbs exposed to the rigours of northern latitudes while as if to make up for this inconsistency by an inconsistent counterpoise they swathe their own tough and mature limbs in thick flannel from head to foot  it is however simple justice to civilised people to add here that a few of them such as a portion of the scottish highlanders are consistent inasmuch as the men clothe themselves similarly to the children  moreover our chief being a savage takes daily a sufficient amount of fresh air and exercise which ninetenths of civilised men refrain from doing on the economic and wise principle apparently that engrossing and unnatural devotion to the acquisition of wealth fame or knowledge will enable them at last to spend a few paralytic years in the enjoyment of their gains  no doubt civilised people have the trifling little drawback of innumerable ills to which they say erroneously we think that flesh is heir and for the cure of which much of their wealth is spent in supporting an army of doctors  savages know nothing of indigestion and in central africa they have no medical men  there is yet another difference which we may point out savages have no literature  they cannot read or write therefore and have no permanent records of the deeds of their forefathers  neither have they any religion worthy of the name  this is indeed a serious evil one which civilised people of course deplore yet strange to say one which consistency prevents some civilised people from remedying in the case of african savages for it would be absurdly inconsistent in arab mohammedans to teach the negroes letters and the doctrines of their faith with one hand while with the other they lashed them to death or dragged them into perpetual slavery and it would be equally inconsistent in portuguese christians to teach the negroes to read whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you do ye even so to them while domestic slavery is in their socalled african territories claimed as a right and the traffic connected with it sanctioned  yes there are many points of difference between civilised people and savages and we think it right to point this out very clearly good reader because the man at whom you and i are looking just now is a savage  of course being capable of reading this book you are too old to require to be told that there is nothing of our nursery savage about him  that peculiar abortion was born and bred in the nursery and dwells only there and was never heard of beyond civilised lands although something not unlike him alas may be seen here and there among the lanes and purlieus where our drunkards and profligates resort no our savage chief does not roar or glare or chatter or devour his food in its blood like the giant of the famous jack  he carries himself like a man and a remarkably handsome man too with his body firm and upright and his head bent a little forward with his eyes fixed on the ground as if in meditation while he walks along  but a truce to digressive explanation  let us follow him  reaching the banks of the river he stops and standing in an attitude worthy of apollo though he is not aware that we are looking at him gazes first up the stream and then down  this done he looks across after which he tries to penetrate the depths of the water with his eye  as no visible result follows he wisely gives up staring and wishing and apparently resolves to attain his ends by action  felling a small tree about as thick as his thigh with an iron hatchet he cuts off it a length of about six feet  into one end of this he drives a sharppointed hardwood spike several inches long and to the other end attaches a stout rope made of the fibrous husk of the cocoanut  the point of the spike he appears to anointprobably a charm of some kindand then suspends the curious instrument over a forked stick at a considerable height from the ground to which he fastens the other end of the rope  this done he walks quietly away with an air of as much selfsatisfaction as if he had just performed a generous deed  well is that all  nay if that were all we should owe you a humble apology  our chief savage though he be is not insane  he has an object in viewwhich is more than can be said of everybody  he has not been long gone an hour or two when the smooth surface of the river is broken in several places and out burst two or three heads of hippopotami  although according to disco lillihammer the personification of ugliness these creatures do not the less enjoy their existence  they roll about in the stream like puncheons dive under one another playfully sending huge waves to the banks on either side  they gape hideously with their tremendous jaws which look as though they had been split much too far back in the head by a rude hatchetthe tops of all the teeth having apparently been lopped off by the same clumsy blow they laugh too with a demoniacal ha ha ha as if they rejoiced in their excessive plainness and knew that weyou and i readerare regarding them with disgust not unmingled with awe  presently one of the herd betakes himself to the land  he is tired of play and means to feed  grass appears to be his only food and to procure this he must needs go back from the river a short way his enormous lips like an animated mowingmachine cutting a track of short cropped grass as he waddles along  the form of that part of the bank is such that he is at least inclined if not constrained to pass directly under the suspended beam  ha we understand the matter now  most people do understand when a thing becomes obviously plain  the hippopotamus wants grass for supper the savage chief wants hippopotamus  both set about arranging their plans for their respective ends  the hippopotamus passes close to the forked stick and touches the cord which sustains it in air like the sword of damocles  down comes the beam driving the spike deep into his back  a cry follows something between a grunt a squeak and a yell and the wounded animal falls rolls over jumps up with unexpected agility for such a sluggish unwieldy creature and rumbles rushes rolls and stumbles back into the river where his relatives take to flight in mortal terror  the unfortunate beast might perhaps recover from the wound were it not that the spike has been tipped with poison  the result is that he dies in about an hour  not long afterwards the chief returns with a band of his followers who being experts in the use of the knife and hatchet soon make mincemeat of their gameladen with which they return in triumph to their homes  let us follow them thither    chapter ten  describes african domesticity and many other things relative thereto besides showing that alarms and flights surprises and feasts are not confined to particular places  when our negro chiefwhose name by the way was kambiraleft the banks of the river followed by his men bearing the hippopotamusflesh he set off at a swinging pace like to a man who has a considerable walk before him  the country through which they passed was not only well wooded but well watered by numerous rivulets  their path for some distance tended upwards towards the hills now crossing over mounds anon skirting the base of precipitous rocks and elsewhere dipping down into hollows but although thus serpentine in its course its upward tendency never varied until it led them to the highest parts of a ridge from which a magnificent prospect was had of hill and dale lake rivulet and river extending so far that the distant scenery at the horizon appeared of a thin pearlygrey colour and of the same consistency as the clouds with which it mingled  passing over this ridge and descending into a wide valley which was fertilised and beautified by a moderatelysized rivulet kambira led his followers towards a hamlet which lay close to the stream nestled in a woody hollow and like all other manganja villages was surrounded by an impenetrable hedge of poisonous euphorbiaa tree which casts a deep shade and renders it difficult for bowmen to aim at the people inside  in the immediate vicinity of the village the land was laid out in little gardens and fields and in these the peoplemen women and children were busily engaged in hoeing the ground weeding planting or gathering the fruits of their labour  these same fruits were plentiful and the people sang with joy as they worked  there were large crops of maize millet beans and groundnuts also patches of yams rice pumpkins cucumbers cassava sweet potatoes tobacco cotton and hemp which last is also called bang and is smoked by the natives as a species of tobacco  it was a pleasant sight for kambira and his men to look upon as they rested for a few minutes on the brow of a knoll near a thicket of bramble bushes and gazed down upon their home  doubtless they thought so for their eyes glistened so also did their teeth when they smilingly commented on the scene before them  they did not indeed become enthusiastic about scenery nor did they refer to the picturesque grouping of huts and trees or make any allusion whatever to light and shade no their thoughts were centred on far higher objects than these they talked of wives and children and hippopotamusflesh and their countenances glowedalthough they were not whiteand their strong hearts beat hard against their ribsalthough they were not clothed and their souls for we repudiate yoosoofs opinion that they had none their souls appeared to take quiet but powerful interest in their belongings  it was pleasant also for kambira and his men to listen to the sounds that floated up from the valleysweeter far than the sweetest strains of mozart or mendelssohnthe singing of the workers in the fields and gardens mellowed by distance into a soft humming tone and the hearty laughter that burst occasionally from men seated at work on bows arrows fishingnets and suchlike gear on a flat green spot under the shade of a huge banyantree which besides being the village workshop was the village receptionhall where strangers were entertained on arrivingalso the village green where the people assembled to dance and sing and smoke bang to which last they were much addicted and to drink beer made by themselves of which they were remarkably fond and by means of which they sometimes got drunkin all which matters the intelligent reader will not fail to observe that they bore a marked resemblance to many of the civilised european nations except perhaps in their greater freedom of action lightness of costume and colour of skin  the merry voices of children too were heard and their active little black bodies were seen while they engaged in the play of savages though not necessarily in savage play  some romped ran after each other caught each other tickled each other occasionally whacked each otherjust as our own little ones do  others played at games of which the skippingrope was a decided favourite among the girls but the play of most of the older children consisted in imitating the serious work of their parents  the girls built little huts hoed little gardens made small pots of clay pounded imaginary corn in miniature mortars cooked it over ideal fires and crammed it down the throats of imitation babies while the boys performed deeds of chivalric daring with reed spears small shields and tiny bows and arrows or amused themselves in making cattlepens and in sculpturing cows and crocodiles  human nature in short was powerfully developed without anything particular to suggest the idea of savage life or to justify the opinion of arabs and halfcaste portuguese that black men are all cattle  the scene wanted only the spire of a village church and the tinkle of a sabbath bell to make it perfect  but there was a tinkle among the other sounds not unlike a bell which would have sounded marvellously familiar to english ears had they been listening  this was the ringing of the anvil of the village blacksmith yes savage though they were these natives had a blacksmith who wrought in iron almost as deftly and to the full as vigorously as any british son of vulcan  the manganja people are an industrious race besides cultivating the soil extensively they dig ironore out of the hills and each village has its smeltinghouse its charcoalburners its forge with a pair of goatskin bellows and its blacksmithwe might appropriately say its very blacksmith  whether the latter would of necessity and as a matter of course sing bass in church if the land were civilised enough to possess a church remains to be seen  at the time we write of he merely hummed to the sound of the hammer and forged hoes axes spears needles arrowheads bracelets armlets necklets and anklets with surprising dexterity  pity that he could not forge a chain which would for ever restrain the murderous hands of the arabs and halfcaste portuguese who for ages have blighted his land with their pestilential presence  after contemplating the picture for a time kambira descended the winding path that led to the village  he had not proceeded far when one of the smallest of the childrena creature so rotund that his body and limbs were a series of circles and ovals and so black that it seemed an absurdity even to think of casting a shadow on himespied the advancing party uttered a shrill cry of delight and ran towards them  his example was followed by a dozen others who being larger outran him and performing a wardance round the men possessed themselves by amicable theft of pieces of raw meat with which they hastened back to the village  the original discoverer of the party however had other ends in view  he toddled straight up to kambira with the outstretched arms of a child who knows he will be welcomed  kambira was not demonstrative but he was hearty  taking the little ball of black butter by the arms he whirled him over his head and placed him on his broad shoulders with a fat leg on each side of his neck and left him there to look after himself  this the youngster did by locking his feet together under the mans chin and fastening his fat fingers in his woolly hair in which position he bore some resemblance to an enormous chignon  thus was he borne crowing to the chiefs hut from the door of which a very stout elderly woman came out to receive them  there was no one else in the hut to welcome them but yohama as the chief styled her was sufficient she was what some people call good company  she bustled about making preparations for a feast with a degree of activity that was quite surprising in one so fatso very fatasking questions the while with much volubility making remarks to the child criticising the hippopotamusmeat or commenting on things in general  meanwhile kambira seated himself in a corner and prepared to refresh himself with a pipe of bang in the most natural and civilised fashion imaginable and young obofor so yohama called himentered upon a series of gymnastic exercises with his fatherfor such kambira was which partook of the playfulness of the kitten mingled with the eccentricity and mischief of the monkey  it would have done you good reader if you possess a spark of sympathy to have watched these two as they played together  the way in which obo assaulted his father on whose visage mild benignity was enthroned would have surprised you  kambira was a remarkably grave quiet and reserved man but that was a matter of no moment to obo who threatened him in front skirmished in his rear charged him on the right flank with a reed spear shelled him on the left with sweet potatoes and otherwise harassed him with amazing perseverance and ingenuity  to this the enemy paid no further attention than lay in thrusting out an elbow and raising a knee to check an unusually fierce attack or in giving obo a pat on the back when he came within reach or sending a puff of smoke in his face as if to taunt and encourage him to attempt further deeds of daring  while this was going on in the chiefs hut active culinary preparations were progressing all over the villagethe women forsook their hoes and grindingmortars and the looms on which they had been weaving cotton cloth the men laid down various implements of industry and long ere the sun began to descend in the west the entire tribe was feasting with all the gusto and twenty times the appetite of aldermen  during the progress of the feast a remarkably small wiry old negro entertained the chief and his party with a song accompanying himself the while on a violinnot a european fiddle by any means but a native productionwith something like a small keg covered with goatskin for a body a longish handle and one string which was played with a bow by the spider  never having heard his name we give him one in accordance with his aspect  talk of european fiddlers  no paganini or any other nini that ever astonished the goths and vandals of the north could hold a candlewe had almost said a fiddleto this sable descendant of ham who squatted on his hams in the midst of an admiring circle drew forth sounds from his solitary string that were more than exquisitethey were excruciating  the song appeared to be improvised for it referred to objects around as well as to things past present and to come among others to the fact that slave parties attacked villages and carried off the inhabitants  at such points the minstrels voice became low and thrilling while his audience grew suddenly earnest opened their eyes frowned and showed their teeth but as soon as the subject was changed the feeling seemed to die away  it was only old memories that had been awakened for no slavers had passed through their country for some time past though rumours of an attack on a not very distant tribe had recently reached and greatly alarmed them  thus they passed the afternoon and when the cool of the evening drew on a dance was proposed seconded and carried unanimously  they were about to begin when a man was seen running down the path leading to the village at a speed which proved him to be the bearer of tidings  in a few minutes he burst into the midst of them with glaring eyeballs and labouring chestfor he had run fast though not far and told his news in rapid short sentencesto the effect that a band of slavers led by portuguese were on their way to the valley within a mile or so of it even while he spoke that he thought the leader was marizano and that they were armed with the loudsounding guns  the consternation consequent on this news was universal and there was good ground for it because marizano was a wellknown monster of cruelty and his guns had rendered him invincible hitherto wherever he went the native spear and bow being utterly useless in the hands of men who however courageous were shot down before they could come within arrowrange of their enemies  it is the custom of the slavedealers on going into the interior for the purpose of procuring slaves to offer to buy them from such tribes as are disposed to sell  this most of the tribes are willing to do fathers do not indeed sell their own children or husbands their wives from preference but chiefs and headmen are by no means loath to get rid of their criminals in this waytheir bad stock as it were of black ivory  they also sell orphans and other defenceless ones of their tribes the usual rate of charge being about two or three yards of calico for a man woman or child  but the arab slavedealer sometimes finds it difficult to procure enough of cattle in this way to make up a band sufficiently large to start with for the coast because he is certain to lose four out of every five at the lowest estimate on his journey down  the drove therefore must be large  in order to provide it he sends out parties to buy where they can and to steal when they have the chance  meanwhile he takes up his quarters near some tribe and sets about deliberately to produce war  he rubs up old sores foments existing quarrels lends guns and ammunition suggests causes of dispute and finally gets two tribes to fight  of course many are slaughtered fearful barbarities and excesses are committed fields are laid waste and villages are burnt but this is a matter of no consequence to our arab  prisoners are sure to be taken and he buys the prisoners for the restthere are plenty of natives in africa  when all else fails not being very particular he sends off a party under some thoroughgoing scoundrel wellarmed and with instructions to attack and capture wherever they go  no wonder then that the rumoured approach of marizano and his men caused the utmost alarm in kambiras village and that the women and children were ordered to fly to the bush without delay  this they required no second bidding to do but oh it was a sad sight to see them do it  the younger women ran actively carrying the infants and leading the smaller children by the hands and soon disappeared but it was otherwise with the old people  these men and women bowed with age and tottering as much from terror as decrepitude hobbled along panting as they went and stumbling over every trifling obstruction in their path being sometimes obliged to stop and rest though death might be the consequence and among these there were a few stray little creatures barely able to toddle who had probably been forgotten or forsaken by their mothers in the panic yet were of sufficient age to be aware in their own feeble way that danger of some sort was behind them and that safety lay before  by degrees allyoung and old strong and feeblegained the shelter of the bush and kambira was left with a handful of resolute warriors to check the invaders and defend his home  well was it at that time for kambira and his men that the approaching band was not marizano and his robbers  when the head of the supposed enemys column appeared on the brow of the adjacent hill the manganja chief fitted an arrow to his bow and retiring behind a hut as also did his followers resolved that marizano should forfeit his life even though his own should be the penalty  very bitter were his thoughts for his tribe had suffered from that villain at a former period and he longed to rid the land of him  as he thought thus he looked at his followers with an expression of doubt for he knew too well that the manganja were not a warlike tribe and feared that the few who remained with him might forsake him in the hour of need  indeed much of his own wellknown courage was to be attributed to the fact that his mother had belonged to a family more or less nearly connected with the ajawa who are very warliketoo much so in truth for it is they who to a large extent are made use of by the slavedealers to carry on war with the neighbouring tribes  kambiras men however looked resolute though very grave  while he was thus meditating vengeance he observed that one of the approaching band advanced alone without arms and making signs of peace this surprised him a little but dreading treachery he kept under the shelter of a hut until the stranger was close to the village then observing that the party on the hill had laid down their arms and seated themselves on the grass he advanced still however retaining his weapons  the stranger was a little man and appeared timid but seeing that the chief evidently meant no mischief and knowing that the guns of his friends had him within range he drew near  where come you from demanded kambira  to this antoniofor it was hereplied that his party came from the coast that they wanted to pass through the land to see it and to find out what it produced and what its people had to sell that it was led by two englishmen who belonged to a nation that detested slaverythe same nation that sent out dr livingstone who as everybody knew had passed through that land some years before  they were also he said countrymen of the men of god who had come out to teach the manganja the truth who had helped them in their troubles delivered them from the slavetraders and some of whom had died in their land  he added that there were manganja men and women in their company  the men of god to whom antonio referred and to whom he had been expressly told by harold seadrift to refer were those devoted missionaries mentioned in a previous chapter who under the leadership of the amiable and truehearted bishop mackenzie established a mission among these very manganja hills in the year 1861  by a rare combination of christian love and manly courage under very peculiar circumstances they acquired extraordinary power and influence over the natives in the space of a few months and laid the foundation of what might have been perhaps may yet betrue christianity in central africa  but the country was unhappily involved at the time in one of the wars created by the portuguese and arab slavetraders  the region was almost depopulated by manstealers and by the famine that resulted from the culture of the land having been neglected during the panic  the good bishop and several of his devoted band sank under the combined effects of climate and anxiety and died there while the enfeebled remnant were compelled sorrowfully to quit the field to the deep regret of the surviving manganja  the story of the universities mission to central africa by the reverend henry rowleywe can heartily recommend this to the youngay and to the oldas being next to the adventures of williams in the south seas one of the most interesting records of missionary enterprise that we ever read  when therefore antonio mentioned bishop mackenzie and dr livingstone a gleam of intelligent interest lit up kambiras swarthy countenance and he was about to speak but suddenly checked himself and a stern frown chased the gleam away  the manganja he said after a few moments silence during which poor antonio eyed him with some distrust know well that these men of god were not of the same country as the arab and the portuguese that they hated slavery and loved the manganja and that the graves of some of them are with us now but we know also that some white men are great liars  how am i to make sure that your leaders are english  why did you not bring down the manganja men and women you say are with you  the women were footsore and fell behind with their men answered antonio and we thought it best not to wait for them  go rejoined kambira waving his hand if you be true men let the englishmen come to me and also the manganja without guns then i will believe yougo  the peremptory manner in which this was said left no room for reply antonio therefore returned to his friends and the chief to his cover  on consultation and consideration it was agreed that kambiras advice should be acted on for said disco removing the pipe with which he had been solacing himself during antonios absence we can plant our fellers on the knoll here with a blunderbuss each and arrange a signal so that if there should be anything like foul play wed have nothin to do but hold aloft a kercher or suthin o that sort an theyd pour a broadside into em afore they could winkdee see  not quite clearly replied harold smiling because some of our fellows cant take an aim at all much less a good one so theyd be as likely to shoot us as them  disco pondered this a little and shook his head then shook the ashes out of his pipe and said that on the whole he was willing to risk it that they could not expect to travel through afriky without risking summat  as chimbolo with his wife and the rest of the party came up at that moment the case was put before him  he at once advised compliance with kambiras request saying that the presence of himself and his friends would be quite sufficient to put the chiefs mind at rest  in a few minutes the plan was carried out and kambira satisfied of the good faith of his visitors  nevertheless he did not at once throw open his arms to them  he stood upon his dignity asked them a good many questions and answered a good many more addressing himself always to antonio as the spokesman it being a point of etiquette not to address the principal of the party  then presents were exchanged in the management of which a considerable time was spent  one of the warriors having in the meantime been despatched to recall the fugitives these began to pour out of the woods the frail old people and forsaken toddlers being the last to return as they had been the last to fly  after this fires were kindled fowls were chased caught slain plucked roasted and boiled hippopotamusflesh was produced the strangers were invited to make themselves at home which they very soon did  beer and bang were introduced the celebrated fiddler was reinstated the dance which had been so long delayed was at last fairly begun and as if to make the picture perfect and felicity complete the moon came out from behind a thick cloud and clothed the valley with a flood of silver light    chapter eleven  reveals discos opinions about savages and the savages opinions of disco and other weighty matters  as two or three of harolds people were not very well just at that time he resolved to remain at kambiras village for a few days to give them rest and afterwards to push on to the country of his friend chimbolo  this arrangement he came to the more readily that he was short of provisions and kambira told him that a particular part of the country near the shores of a lake not far distant abounded with game of all sorts  to disco lillihammer he explained his plans next day while that worthy seated under the shade of a banyantree was busily engaged with what he styled his mornin dootiesnamely the filling and smoking of his cuttypipe  you see disco he said it wont do to knock up the men with continuous travel therefore i shall give them a spell of rest here kambira tells me that there is plenty of game large and small to be had not far off so that we shall be able to replenish our stock of meat and perchance give the niggers a feast such as they have not been accustomed to of late for it is not too much to expect that our rifles will do more execution at all events among lions and elephants than native spears  besides i wish to see something of the people who being what we may call pure outandout savages  savages interrupted disco removing his pipe and pointing with the stem of it to the village on an eminence at the outskirts of which they were seated dee call them folk savages  harold looked at the scene before him and paused for a few moments and well he might for not fifty yards off the blacksmith was plying his work energetically while a lad sat literally between a pair of native bellows one of which he blew with his left hand the other with his right and beyond these groups of men and women wrought at their primitive looms or tilled their vegetable gardens and patches of land  savages repeated disco still pointing to the village with the stem of his pipe and gazing earnestly at his companion humph  it is probable that disco might have said more but he was an accurate judge of the precise moment when a pipe is about to go out and delay will prove fatal  he therefore applied himself diligently to suck and cherish the dying spark  having revived its powers to such an extent that clouds enveloped his visage and his nose being red loomed luridly through them he removed the pipe and again said humph  they aint a bit more savages sir than you or me is  perhaps not replied harold  to say truth it would be difficult to point out any peculiarity that justifies the name except the fact that they wear very little clothing and neither go to school nor church  they wears no clothin rejoined disco cause they dont need for to do so an they dont go to church or school cause they haint got none to go tothat same bein not the fault o the niggers but o them as knows better  theres truth in what you say disco returned harold with a smile but come you must admit that there is something savage in the custom they have of wearing these hideous liprings  the custom to which he referred is one which prevails among several of the tribes of africa and is indeed so utterly hideous and outrageous that we should be justified in refusing to believe it were we not assured of the fact by dr livingstone and other missionaries and travellers of unquestionable integrity  the ring is worn in the upper lip not hanging from it but fitted into a hole in it in such a manner as to thrust the lip straight and far out from the face  as the ring is about the size of an ordinary napkinring it may be easily believed that time is required for the formation of the deformity  at an early age the middle of the upper lip of a girl is pierced close to the nose and a small pin introduced to prevent the hole closing up  after it is healed the pin is taken out and a larger one forced into its place and so for weeks months and years the process of increasing the size of the lip goes on until a ring of two inches in diameter can be introduced  nearly all the women in these parts use this ring or as it is called pelele  some make them of bamboo others of ivory or tin when a wearer of the pelele smiles the action of the cheek muscles draws the lip tight which has the effect of raising the ring towards the eyebrows so that the nose is seen in the middle of it and the teeth are exposed a revelation which shows that the latter have been chipped to sharp points so as to resemble the teeth of a cat or crocodile  no doubt said disco in reply to harolds remark the liprings are uncommon ugly but the principle o the thing sir thats were it is the principle aint no wuss than earrings  the savages as we calls em bores holes in their lips an sticks rings into em  the civilised folk as we calls ourselves bores holes in their ears an sticks rings into em  weres the difference thats wot i want to know  theres not much difference in principle said harold laughing but there is a great difference in appearance  earrings hang gracefully liprings stick out horribly  hm it appears to me that thats a matter o taste now  howsoever i do admit that liprings is wuss than earrings moreover it must make kissin somewhat difficult not to say onpleasant but as i said before so i says again its all in the principle were it lies  wy look here sirsavages as we call em wear brass rings round their necks our women wear gold and brass chains  the savages wear anklets we wear bracelets  they have no end o rings on their toes we have em on our fingers  some savages shave their heads some of us shaves our faces  their women are raither given to clothin which is too short and too narrer ours come out in toggery far too wide and so long sometimes that a feller darent come within a fathom of em astarn without runnin the risk o trampin on an carrying away some o the canvas  the savage women frizzes out their hair into most fantastical shapes till the very monkeys has to hold their sides sittin in the trees larfin at emand wot do we do in regard to that  wy some of our women puts on a mixture o hairy pads an combs an pins an ribbons an flowers in a bundle about twice the size o their heads all jumbled together in such a way as to defy description an if the monkeys was to see them theyd go off into such fits that theyd bust altogether an the race would become extinct in afriky  no sir its my opinion that there aint no such thing as savagesor if you choose to put it the tother way were all savages together  disco uttered the last part of his speech with intense energy winding it up with the usual slap on the thigh delivered with unusual fervour and then becoming aware that the vital spark of the cutty had all but fled he applied himself to its resuscitation in which occupation he found relief to his feelings and himself formed a brilliant illustration of his remarks on savage customs  harold admitted that there was much truth in what he said but rather inclined to the opinion that of the two sets of savages the uncivilised were if anything the wildest  disco however contrary to his usual habits had nailed his colours to the mast on that point and could not haul them down  meanwhile harolds opinion was to some extent justified by the appearance of a young man who issuing from the jungle close at hand advanced towards them  most of the men at the village displayed a good deal of pride if not taste in the arrangement of their hair  some wore it long and twisted into a coil which hung down their backs others trained and stiffened it in such a way that it took the form of buffalo horns while some allowed it to hang over the shoulders in large masses and many shaved it either entirely or partially in definite patterns  but the young dandy who now approached outdid all others for he had twisted his hair into innumerable little tails which being stiffened by fillets of the inner bark of a tree stuck straight out and radiated from the head in all directions  his costume otherwise was simple enough consisting merely of a small kilt of white calico  he was accompanied by antonio  weve be come from kambira said the interpreter to tell you for come to feast  all right said disco rising always ready for wittles if you only gives us an hour or two between timesi say tony he had by that time reduced the interpreters name to this extent ask this feller what he means by makin sitch a guy of hisself  hims say it look well said antonio with a broad grin  looks welleh and ask him why the women wear that abominable pelele  when this question was put to the black dandy he looked at disco evidently in surprise at his stupidity  because it is the fashion he said  they wear it for beauty to be sure  men have beards and whiskers women have none and what kind of creature would woman be without whiskers and without a pelele  she would have a mouth like a man and no beard  the bare idea of such a state of things tickled the dandy so much that he went into roars of laughter insomuch that all the radiating tails of his head quivered again  the effect of laughter and tails together was irresistible  harold disco and antonio laughed in sympathy till the tears ran down their cheeks and then returned to the village where kambira and his chief men awaited them  while enjoying the feast prepared for them harold communicated his intentions and desires to the chief who was delighted at the prospect of having such powerful allies on a hunting expedition  the playful obo meanwhile was clambering over his fathers person like a black monkey  he appeared to be particularly fond of his father and as love begets love it is not surprising that kambira was excessively fond of obo  but obo becoming obstreperous received an amicable punch from his father which sent him headlong into a basket of boiled hippopotamus  he gave a wild howl of alarm as disco snatched him out of the dish dripping with fat and set him on his knee  there there dont blubber said the seaman tenderly wiping off the fat while the natives including kambira exploded with laughter  you aint burnt are you  as obo could not reply disco put his finger into the gravy from which the urchin had been rescued and satisfied himself that it was not hot enough to have done the child injury  this was also rendered apparent by his suddenly ceasing to cry struggling off discos knee and renewing his assaults on his easygoing father  accepting an egg which was offered him by yohama harold broke it and entered into conversation with kambira through the medium of antonio  is your boys mother ahollo theres a chick in this egg he exclaimed throwing the offensive morsel into the fire  jumbo who sat near the place where it fell snatched it up grinned and putting it into his cavernous mouth swallowed it  dems betterer wid chickies he said resuming his gravity and his knife and fingersforks being held by him in light esteem  ask him antonio if obos mother is alive said harold trying another egg which proved to be in better condition  the interpreter instead of putting the question without comment as was his wont shook his head looked mysterious and whisperedno better ask dat  hims lost hims wife  the slavehunters cotch her some time ago and carry her off when hims away hunting  hims awful mad worser dan mad elerphint when hims speak to bout her  harold of course dropped the subject at once after remarking that he supposed yohama was the childs grandmother  yis said antonio she be kambiras moder an obos granmoderbof at once  this fact was we may almost say selfevident for obos attentions and favours were distributed exclusively between yohama and kambira though the latter had unquestionably the larger share  during the course of the feast beer was served round by the little man who had performed so deftly on the violin the previous evening  drink said kambira hospitably i am glad to see my white brothers here drink it will warm your hearts  ay an it wont make us drunk said disco destroying jumbos peace of mind by winking and making a face at him as he raised the calabash to his lips  heres long life to you kambira an death to slavery  there can be no doubt that the chief and his retainers would have heartily applauded that sentiment if they had understood it but at the moment antonio was too deeply engaged with another calabash to take the trouble to translate it  the beer which was pink and as thick as gruel was indeed too weak to produce intoxication unless taken in very large quantities nevertheless many of the men were so fond of it that they sometimes succeeded in taking enough to bring them to the condition which we style fuddled but at that time the particular brew was nearly exhausted so that temperance was happily the order of the day  having no hops in those regions they are unable to prevent fermentation and are therefore obliged to drink up a whole brewing as quickly as possible after it is made  man why dont ye wash yer face said disco to the little fiddler as he replenished his calabash its awful dirty  jumbo laughed of course and the small musician not understanding what was said followed suit out of sympathy  wash hims face cried antonio laughing him would as soon cut off hims head  manganja nevair wash  ah me  you laugh if you hear de womans ask me yesterdaywhy you wash dey say our men nevair do ho ho dey looks like it too  im sure that cannot be said of kambira or any of his chief men said harold  perhaps not retorted antonio but some of um nevair wash  once pon a time one man of dis tribe foller a party me was with  not go way for all we tell um  we said we shoot um  no matter hims foller still  at last we say you scounrel we wash you  ho how hims run  jist like zebra wid lion at ums tail  nevair see um after datnevair more  wot a most monstrous ugly feller that is sittin opposite kambira on the other side o the firethe feller with the halfshaved head said disco in an undertone to harold during a temporary pause in eating  a wellmade man however replied haroldi say disco he added with a peculiar smile you think yourself rather a goodlooking fellow dont you now  the worthy seaman who was indeed an exceptionally goodlooking tar modestly repliedwell now as you have put it so plump i dont mind if i do confess that ive had some wild suspicions o that sort now and then  then you may dismiss your suspicions now for i can assure you that you are regarded in this land as a very monster of ugliness said harold laughing  in the estimation of niggers your garments are hideous your legs they think elephantine your red beard frightful and your blue eyes savagesavage think of that  well well retorted disco your own eyes are as blue as mine an i dont suppose the niggers think more of a yaller beard than a red one  too true disco we are both illfavoured fellows here whatever we may be elsewhere however as we dont intend to take manganja wives it wont matter much  but what think you of our plan now that kambira is ready to fall in with it  it seems a good one  when do we start  tomorrow said harold  wery good replied disco im agreeable  the morrow came and with the early light all the people turned out to witness the departure of the hunters  scouts had been previously sent out in all directions to make sure that no enemies or slavetraders were at that time in their immediate neighbourhood and a strong force of the best warriors was left to guard the village  of harolds band two halfcastes jose and oliveira volunteered to stay in camp with the guard and two songolo and mabruki the freemen of quillimane remained in the village to recruit their health which had failed  chimbolo likewise remained the wounds on his back not having healed sufficiently to admit of the hard labour of hunting  all the rest accompanied the hunters and of these the three makololo men jumbo zombo and masiko were incomparably the best and bravest  of course the volatile antonio also went being indispensable  on setting outeach man with his sleepingmat on his back and his little wooden pillow hung at his neckthere was a great deal of shouting and hohoing and wellwishing on the part of those who remained behind but above all the noise there arose a shrill cry of intense and agonising despair  this proceeded from the small windpipe of little obo who had not until the last moment made the appalling discovery that kambira was going away without him  there was something very touching in the cry of the urchin and something which brought vividly to the minds of the englishmen the infantine community of their own land  there was the same sudden gaze of horror on realising the true position of affairsthe same sharp shriek and frantic struggle to escape from the grasp of those who held him back from following his fatherthe same loud cry of agony on finding that his efforts were vain and then the wideopen mouth the closeshut eyes and the awful prolonged silencesuggestive of fits that betokens the concentration of mind heart and lungs into that tremendous roar of unutterable significance which appears to be the safetyvalve of the human family black and white at that tender period of life  poor obo his sobs continued to burst out with steamengine power and his eyes to pour cataracts of tears into yohamas sympathetic bosom long after the hunting party had left the hills behind them and advanced into the almost impenetrable jungles of the low grounds    chapter twelve  describes a hunting expedition which was both exciting and successful  down by the reedy margin of a pretty large lakewhere wildfowl innumerable made the air vocal with their cries by day and frogs in numbers inconceivable chirped and croaked a lullaby to men who slept and a symphony to beasts that howled and growled and prowled at night in bush and brakekambira pitched his camp  he did not indeed select the moist level of the feverbreeding marshes but he chose for his temporary habitation the dry summit of a wooded hill which overlooked the lake  here the natives of the neighbourhood said that elephants had been lately seen and buffaloes zebras etcetera were at all times numerous  after two long days march they had reached the spot and encamped late in the evening  next morning early the business of the expedition began  various parties of natives armed with bows and arrows and spears were sent out in different directions but the principal band was composed of kambira and his chief men with harold and his party  they did not go far before game was found  guineafowl were numerous and those who were aimed with bows soon procured a goodly supply of these but our travellers did not waste their energies or powder on such small game  besides these monkeys peeped inquisitively at the hunters from among the trees and myriads of turtledoves were seen in the covers  as they advanced wild pigs elands waterbucks koodoos and other creatures were seen in herds and the natives dropped off or turned aside in pursuit of these so that ere long the band remaining with kambira was reduced to about forty men  coming to a small river in which were a number of deep pools and shallows they saw several hippopotami lying asleep their bodies nearly all out of the water appearing like masses of black rock in the stream but at the same place they discovered fresh traces of elephants and buffaloes therefore the hippopotami were left unmolested save that harold sent a bullet amongst them partly to let the natives hear the report of his gun and partly to see how the animals would take it  they all started to their feet at once and stared around them with looks of stolid surprise that were almost equal to the looks of the natives to whom firearms were little known except by report  another shot sent the whole herd with a heavy plunge into deep water  its a queer country observed disco when they had resumed their march  just look at them there lizards with red and blue tails running about among the rocks an eatin up the white ants like one oclock  disco might have said like twelve oclock if numbers would have added to the force of his remark for the little creatures referred to were miraculously active in pursuit of their food  but i spose continued disco the niggers would think our country a queerer place than this  undoubtedly they would replied harold just fancy what would be the feelings of kambira if he were suddenly transported into the heart of london  hallo exclaimed disco stopping suddenly and pointing to one of the men in advance who had crouched and made signals to his friends to halt breakers aheadeh  more likely buffaloes whispered harold as he cocked his rifle and advanced quickly with kambira who carried a short spear or javelin  on reaching an opening in the bushes a small herd of zebras was observed not much more than a hundred yards in advance  will the white mans gun kill so far asked the chief turning to antonio  the interpreter made no reply but pointed to harold who was in the act of taking aim  the loud report was followed by the fall of the nearest zebra  disco also fired and wounded another which bounded away in wild alarm with its fellows  the natives yelled with delight and disco cheered in sympathy  youve hit him said harold as he reloaded  ay but i hant disabled him  better luck next time  i think i took him somewhere on the port bow  if by that you mean the left shoulder returned harold with a laugh its likely he wont run far  what does kambira think of the white mans gun he added turning round  the tall chief nodded approvingly and said with a grave countenancegood good it is goodbetter than this shaking his short spear  at that moment a small antelope which had been startled and put to flight by some of the other bands of hunters came crashing wildly towards them ignorant of the enemy in its front until within about thirty yards  it turned at a sharp angle and plunged into the jungle but the spear which kambira had shaken whizzed though the air and pierced its heart before it had time to disappear  a splendid heave cried disco with enthusiasm why man alive youd make yer fortin as a harpooner if ye was to go to the whalefishin hallo theres somethin else wy the place is swarmin  its for all the world like a zoological gardings let loose  as he spoke the hoofs of a herd of ponderous animals were heard but the rank grass and underwood concealed them entirely from view  the whole party rushed to the nearest opening and were just in time to see the tail of an irate buffalo make a magnificent flourish in the air as its owner plunged into cover  there was no further attempt at conversation after this  the near presence of large game was too exciting so that merely a word of advice direction or inquiry passed as the party advanced rapidlyone or two of the most active going before as pioneers  while disco was striding along with flashing eyes rifle ready and head turning from side to side in momentary expectation of something bounding suddenly out of somewhere he chanced to cast his eyes upwards and to his horror beheld two huge serpents coiled together among the branches of a tree close to his head  uttering a yell of alarmfor he entertained an almost superstitious dread of serpentshe fired blindly upwards and dashed to one side so violently that he tumbled himself and harold into a bush of waitabit thorns out of which the laughing natives found it difficult to extract them  what is the matter man said harold somewhat testily  have a care look  avast  a bitell be death an no mistake cried disco pointing to the reptiles  harold fired at once and brought them both down and the natives attacking them with sticks soon killed them  no fear said antonio with a chuckle  dem not harm nobody though ums ugly an big enough  this was true  they were a couple of pythons and the larger of the two a female was ten feet long but the python is a harmless creature  while they were talking smoke was observed to rise from an isolated clump of long grass and bushes not far from the banks of the river much to the annoyance of kambira who feared that the fire might spread and scare away the game  it was confined however to the place where it began but it had the effect of driving out a solitary buffalo that had taken refuge in the cover  jumbo chanced to be most directly in front of the infuriated animal when it burst out and to him exclusively it directed its attentions  never since jumbo was the size of obo had that laughterloving savage used his lithe legs with greater energy than on this occasion  an ostrich might have envied him as he rushed towards the river into which he sprang headlong when the buffalo was barely six feet behind him  of course harold fired as well as disco and both shots told as also a spear from kambira nevertheless the animal turned abruptly on seeing jumbo disappear and charged furiously up the bank scattering its enemies right and left  harold fired again at little more than fifty yards off and heard the bullet thud as it went in just behind the shoulder yet strange to say it seemed to have no other effect than to rouse the brute to greater wrath and two more bullets failed to bring him down  this toughness of the buffalo is by no means uncommon but different animals vary much in their tenacity of life  some fall at once to the first welldirected shot others die hard  the animal the hunters were now in pursuit of or rather which was in pursuit of the hunters seemed to be of the latter class  harold fired another shot from behind a tree having loaded with a shellbullet which exploded on hitting the creatures ribs  it fell much to the satisfaction of disco of whom it happened to be in pursuit at the time  the seaman at once stopped and began to reload and the natives came running forward when antonio who had climbed a tree to be out of harms way slipped down and ran with great bravery up to the prostrate animal  just as he reached it the buffalo sprang up with the activity of a cat and charged him  antonio turned and ran with such rapidity that his little legs became almost invisible like those of a sparrow in a hurry he gained a tree and had just time to climb into it when the buffalo struck it like a batteringram hard enough almost to have split both head and tree  it paused a few seconds drew back several paces glared savagely at antonio and then charged again and again as if resolved either to shake him out of the tree or give itself a splitting headache but another shell from harold who could hardly take aim for laughing stretched the huge animal dead upon the ground  altogether it took two shells and five large solid rifleballs to finish him  that wos a pretty good spurt said disco panting as he joined harold beside the fallen beast  its wellknown that a starn chase is a long un but this would have been an exception to the rule if you hadnt shot him sir  he pretty nigh made short work o me  he was amost aboard of me wen you fired  true said harold and had that tree not grown where it stands and grown tough too i suspect he would have made short work of antonio too  bah said the interpreter with affected carelessness him was but a slow brute after all  disco looked at jumbo who was none the worse of his ducking and shut his right eye smartly  jumbo opened his cavernous mouth and exploded so violently that his double row of brilliant teeth must have been blown out and scattered on the ground had they not been miraculously strong  come now said kambira who had just given orders to some of his followers to remain behind and look after the carcase we go to find elephants  have we much chance of findin them inquired disco  kambira thought they had because fresh traces had been recently seen in the neighbourhood whereupon disco said that he would prefer to go after lions but kambira assured him that these animals were not so easy to find and much more dangerous when attacked  admitting the force of this though still asserting his preference of lions to elephants the bloodthirsty son of neptune shouldered his rifle and followed his leader  while the main party of hunters were thus successfully pushing along the other bands were not idle though possessing no firearms they were less noisy  in fact their proceedings were altogether of the catcatty  one fellow as black as a coal as lithe as an eel and as longaccording to discos standardas a fathom of pumpwater having come upon a herd of buffalo unseen by them and being armed with a small bow and quiver of arrows suddenly dropped on allfours and began to glide through the long grass  now there is a particular little bird in those regions which calls for special notice here  it is a very singular bird inasmuch as it has constituted itself the guardian of the buffalo  it frequently sits upon that animals back and whenever it sees the approach of man or any other danger it flaps its wings and screams to such an extent that the buffalo rushes off without waiting to inquire or see what is the matter and the small guardian seems to think itself sufficiently rewarded with the pickings it finds on the back of its fat friend  so vigilant is this little creature that it actually renders the approach of the hunter a matter of great difficulty in circumstances when but for it he might approach with ease  see livingstones zambesi and its tributaries page 200  our wary native was however aware of this little fellows propensities and took precautions to outwit the bird rather than the beast  it may perhaps cause some surprise to be told that a small bow and arrows were a sufficiently powerful species of artillery to bring to bear against such noble game but the surprise will vanish when we state that the arrows were poisoned  having crawled to within range the fathom of black pumpwater suddenly arose and let fly an arrow  the missile went deep into the side of a majestic bull  the little bird fluttered and screamed too late  the bull at once dashed away at full speed starting off the whole herd in alarm  the black fathom followed at the top of his speed and was joined by a number of other black fathoms who were quite aware of what had been done  the buffaloes were soon out of sight but the fathoms followed the trail with the unerring pertinacity of fate  after a long run they came up with the stricken bull which had fallen behind its fellows and waited patiently until the poison took full effect  in a short time the animal fell and the successful hunters fell to work upon his carcase with their knives  leaving them thus employed we will return to kambira and his friends  they had not gone far when a fine waterbuck was observed feeding beside a creek  kambira laid his hand on harolds shoulder and pointed to it with a smile which might have been interpreted now then theres a chance for you  harold fired and the waterbuck dropped  good said kambira  hallo exclaimed disco  and well he might for at that moment an enormous crocodile which had evidently been watching the waterbuck seized and dragged it into the water  it was not deep however and the wounded animal made a desperate plunge hauled the crocodile several yards and tore itself out of its hideous jaws  it then jumped into the stream and was swimming across when another crocodile made a dash at it but harold sent a ball into its ugly head which appeared to make it change its mind  it disappeared and the waterbuck turning made for the bank from which it had started  just as it reached it the vital spark fled the fine head dropped and the body turned over  it will be seen from what has been told that on this occasion the rifles did most of the work  the natives who followed harold had nothing to do but look on exultingly glare dance show their teeth and gums and secure the game  we cannot perhaps expect the goodnatured reader to follow us through all the details of that days work but it would be unpardonable were we to close the chapter without referring to the principal event of the day which occurred a couple of hours after the shooting of the waterbuck  it happened thuswhen the hunters began to grow tired and the prospect of falling in with large game became less hopeful the chief determined to return to camp but disco felt so disappointed at not having seen an elephant or a lion that he expressed a wish to continue the chase with a small select party  harold laughed at the idea of the seaman leading such a party but offered no objection although he did not care to accompany his friend having as he said had enough of it and being desirous of having a long chat with the chief in camp  you see sir said disco patting the stock of his rifle with his right hand we chance to have got so to speak into the heart of a shoal o big fish an theres no sayin how soon they may take it into their heads to up anchor and make sail for other grounds  therefore says i blaze away at em while youve got the chance  but you may have as good a chance tomorrow or next day suggested harold  we aint sure o that sir  tomorrow they say never comes returned disco  its my ambition to let fly a broadside at a lion or a elephant so i means for to go on an wot i says is who wolunteers to sail in company  when the party were given to understand what wolunteers meant the three makololo joined the tar with alacrity also the somali negroes nakoda and conda and about a dozen of the natives armed with spears discos own men were armed with their guns  antonio being necessary to harold returned to camp but this was a matter of little importance as jumbo and his fellowcountrymen knew enough of english to act as interpreters  every one who has had a few years experience of life knows the truth of the proverb which asserts that fortune favours the brave  its truth was exemplified on the present occasion not more than an hour after the little band of heroes had set out  disco led the way as a matter of course holding as he said that no nigger could possibly be equal to a white sailor in the matter of steering whether ashore or afloat  he steered by the sun and directed his course to nowhere in particular being influenced chiefly by the form of the ground and the appearance of the jungle  jumbo grinned a good deal at the sententious gravity with which the leader delivered his orders and the selfimportant strides with which he passed over the land  he would have grinned still more perhaps have laughed outright if he had understood that the occasional offhand kicks which disco bestowed on a thick bush here and there were given in the hope that a lion might thereby be set up as one dislodges a rabbit or a hare  at last on reaching the crest of a mound which was comparatively free of underwood disco beheld a sight which caused him to drop on his hands and knees as though he had been shot  not more than fifty yards off a herd of cow elephants and their calves were seen feeding quietly on tall heavyseeded grass in the plain below  avast said disco in a hoarse whisper at the same time crouching behind a bush and making frantic signals to the rest of the party to advance with extreme caution  wat um see inquired jumbo in a low whisper creeping up to his excited leader  there was no need for a reply  a glance over the top of the bush sufficed  be quiet as mice now lads said disco when all the members of his party had crept around him and become aware of the presence of elephants  get your guns laid and if any one of you dares to pull a trigger till i give the word ill keelhaul him  this or something distantly resembling it having been explained to the men who carried guns they lay down and took aim  the noise made by the hunters attracted the attention of the nearest elephant and with true motherly instinct she placed her young one between her forelegs for protection  we fire right in de middel ob de lot inquired zombo hastily  not at all whispered disco let every man point at the nearest one the one that lays broadside on to us wi the little un under her bows nowreadypresentfire  bang went the seven guns with a degree of precision that might have put to shame any corps of volunteer riflemen in england up went the trunks and tails of the elephants little and big and away rushed the whole herd in dire alarm  but the wounded animal suddenly stumbled and fell on its knees then leaped up and ran on heavily  meanwhile disco who had discharged only one barrel of his heavy gun leaped over the bushes and rushed forward at a pace which for a few seconds enabled him to keep ahead even of the fleet natives  the elephants however easily left them all behind and it appeared as if the affair were about to end in disappointment when the wounded beast again stumbled  hold on halt cried disco in a voice of thunder  he kneeled at the same time took aim and fired  whether it was this last shot or the effects of previous loss of blood we cannot tell but after receiving it the ponderous animal rolled over on its side and died  to say that the natives became temporarily insane would give but a feeble idea of what now took place because few readers are likely to be aware of the amazing power of the negro to give expression to the vagaries of insanity  we shall therefore content ourselves by saying that they cheered laughed howled shouted danced and yelledand leave the rest to imagination  now then boys avast howlin  clap a stopper on your bellows will ee said disco in a boatswains roar that effectually quelled the tumult  cut off to camp every mothers son of you an bring up kambira an all the boys with as many knives and dishes as ye can muster for this mountain of flesh aint to be cut up in a hurry an the sun wont be long o goin to bed  away with ee  lets see how you can wag yer black legs an ill keep watch over the carcase  if anything comes to have a look at ita lion for instanceso much the worse for the lion  it was in vain that jumbo explained there was no necessity for sending more than one of the party to the camp  disco was a strict disciplinarian and having given the order enforced it in a manner which admitted of no disobedience  they therefore departed leaving the seaman seated on the elephant smoking his pipe with his gun beside him  but jumbo did not go far  he soon turned aside from his companions and returned to the scene of the hunt resolved if possible to give his leader a fright  gaining the skirts of the jungle which surrounded the open space where disco kept watch he crept cautiously as near to him as possible  disco still sat smoking and eyeing the elephant with a smile of satisfaction  presently he roseretreated a few yards from the carcase and stood admiring it with his head on one side as if it were a picture and he a connoisseur  he had in this act approached somewhat nearer to jumbo who saluted him with a most awful growl  no monkey in africa could have dropped its pipe had it been a smoker or sprung to seize its gun had it been a sportsman with greater agility than did disco lillihammer on that trying occasion  getting on the other side of the dead elephant he faced round cocked both barrels and prepared to receive whatever might come  jumbo lying very low behind a bank of earth for safety gave another low growl  disco started and half raised his piece  jumbo then threw a large stone towards a neighbouring bush which it struck and caused to rustle  this was enough for disco who took a quick aim and let fly the contents of both barrels into the bush  jumbo noiselessly but swiftly crept back into the woods chuckling as he went leaving disco to reload in wild haste  but his haste was uncalled for  there was no more growling no more rustling in the bushes  ive done for him muttered disco after waiting patiently at the ready for some time  but it wont do for me to ventur up to it all by myself  praps its a lion an they do say that its chancy work to go near a wounded lion  to be sure the growl wasnt so loud as id have expected o the king o the forest but then they dont always growl loud  anyhow ill keep a bright lookout an wait till the niggers return  philosophising thus the bold seaman mounted guard over the elephant  meanwhile jumbo having got out of earshot of his friend indulged in a loud laugh and made after his friends but observing the visage of a small yellowcoloured monkey among the leaves overhead a thought flashed into his mind and induced him to change his plans  throwing his spear dexterously he transfixed the monkey and brought it down  returning with great caution to the bush into which disco had fired and gliding with the noiseless motion of a snake the latter part of the way he placed the dead monkey on the ground and left it there  it was by that time too late to overtake his comrades  he therefore waited until they returned and then joined the party in rear as though he had followed them from the camp  the same wild exhibition of delight was about to be enacted when the party came trooping up but disco quickly checked it by the astounding announcement that he thought he had shot a lion or somethin o that sort  you dont mean it said harold rather excited  all i know is said disco that i heerd somethin uncommon like a lion growl twice in yonder bush an saw the bush move too so i fired a broadside that seemed to finish him at once for there was no more rustlin after that  an no more growlin asked jumbo with much simplicity of countenance  not a growl nor nothin else answered disco  well get your guns ready lads said harold and stand by to fire while we go and search the bush  so saying harold and disco advanced together with their rifles ready while the natives who were more or less alarmed according to their respective degrees of courage scattered in a semicircle well in rear kambira armed with a spear kept close to harold and jumbo with unwonted bravery walked alongside of disco  antonio quietly retiring took refuge in a tree  yoos sure you hit um inquired jumbo in a whisper  cant say im sure replied disco but well soon see  was ums growl very bad asked jumbo  hold yer long tongue said disco testily for he was becoming excited  look see dere exclaimed jumbo in an energetic whisper  what where  look right troo de bush  dis way  dar don you zee ums skin tother side  fire  why eh exclaimed disco peering keenly through the leaves yellow hair yesits  stopping abruptly he pointed his gun at the bush and poured the contents of both barrels into it  then clubbing his weapon and brandishing it in the air he uttered a wild crywent crashing through the bush and next moment stood aghast before the yellow monkey whose little carcase he had almost blown to atoms  we wont chronicle the roars of laughter the yells of delight that followedthe immense amount of chaffing the innumerable witticisms and criticisms that ensuedno no regard for the gallant seaman constrains us to draw a veil over the scene and leave it as we have left many things before and shall leave many things yet to come to the readers vivid imagination  fortunately for disco the superior attractions of the dead elephant soon drew off attention from this exploit  the natives proceeded to cut up the huge mass of meat and this was indeed an amazing spectacle  at first the men stood round the carcase in dead silence while kambira delivered a species of oration in which he pointed out minutely the particular parts of the animal which were to be apportioned to the headmen of the different fires of which the camp was composedthe left hindleg and the parts around the eyes being allotted to his english visitors  these points settled the order was given to cut up and immediately the excitement which had been restrained burst forth again with tenfold violence  the natives seemed to be quite unable to restrain their feelings of delight as they cut away at the carcase with spears and knives  they screamed as well as danced with glee  some attacked the head others the flanks jumping over the animal or standing on it the better to expedite their operations some ever and anon ran off screaming with masses of bloody meat threw it on the grass and went back for more while others after cutting the carcase open jumped inside and wallowed about in their eagerness to reach and cut out the precious fatall talking and shouting at the utmost pitch of their voices  well now said disco to harold with a grin of amusement the likes o that i never did see nowheres  cuttin up a greenland whale is nothin to it  come come said harold checking his laughter and seizing an excited negro by the shoulder no fighting allowed  this had reference to two who chanced to have taken a fancy for the same mass of meat and were quarrelling so violently over it that blows seemed on the point of following but having let off part of their superabundant energy in words they rushed back to expend the remainder on their dead friend  suddenly a sharp agonised yell was heard inside the carcase  next moment zombo jumped out all bloody and furious holding up his right hand  while groping about inside one of his too eager comrades outside had laid about rather incautiously with his knife drove it through the meat and sliced zombos left hand  he was easily soothed however harold bound up the cut with a piece of rag and zombo went to work as recklessly as ever  in a marvellously short time tons of meat were cut up and divided amongst the band and before daylight had quite disappeared the hunters were on their way back to camp while a troop of hyenas and other carnivora were gorging themselves with the elephants remains    chapter thirteen  the encampment and the supperdiscussions political and otherwise kambira receives a shock and our wanderers are thrown into perplexity  turn we now to a more peaceful scene  the camp is almost quiet the stars are twinkling brightly overhead the fires are glimmering fitfully below  the natives having taken the edge off their appetites have stretched their dusky forms on their sleepingmats and laid their woolly heads on their little wooden pillows  the only persons moving are harold seadrift and disco lillihammerthe first being busy making notes in a small book the second being equally busy in manufacturing cloudlets from his unfailing pipe gazing the while with much interest at his notemaking companion  they was pretty vigorous wen they wos at it sir said disco in reference to supper observing that his companion looked up from his book but they wos sooner done than i had expected  yes they werent long about it replied harold with an abstracted air as he resumed his writing  lest the reader should erroneously imagine that supper is over it is necessary here to explain what taking the edge off a free africans appetite means  on reaching camp after the cutting up of the elephant as detailed in the last chapter the negroes had set to work to roast and boil with a degree of vigour that would have surprised even the chefs de cuisine of the worlds firstclass hotels  having gorged themselves to an extent that civilised people might perhaps have thought dangerous they had then commenced an uproarious dance accompanied by stentorian songs which soon reduced them to the condition of beings who needed repose proceeding upon the principle of overcoming temptation by giving way to it they at once lay down and went to sleep  it was during this stage of the nights proceedings that disco foolishly imagined that supper had come to a close  not many minutes after the observation was made and before the black cuttypipe was smoked out first one and then another of the sleepers awoke and after a yawn or two got up to rouse the fires and put on the cookingpots  in less than a quarter of an hour the whole camp was astir conversation was rife and the bubbling of pots that had not got time to cool and the hissing of roasts whose fat had not yet hardened mingled with songs whose echoes were still floating in the brains of the wild inhabitants of the surrounding jungle  roasting boiling and eating were recommenced with as much energy as if the feast had only just begun  kambira having roused himself gave orders to one of his men who brought one of the elephants feet and set about the cooking of it at harolds fire  kambira and disco with antonio and jumbo sat round the same fire  there was a hole in the ground close beside them which contained a small fire the embers of this were stirred up and replenished with fuel when the inside was thoroughly heated the elephants foot was placed in it and covered over with hot ashes and soil and another fire kindled above the whole  harold who regarded this proceeding with some surprise said to kambirathrough antoniowho are you cooking that for  for my white guests replied the chief  but we have supped already said harold we have already eaten as much as we can hold of the elephants trunk and tongue both of which were excellentwhy prepare more  this is not for tonight but for tomorrow returned kambira with a smile  the foot takes all night to cook  this was a sufficient explanation and in truth the nature of the dish required that it should be well done  when on the morrow they were called to partake of it they found that it was according to discos estimation fustrate  it was a whitish mass slightly gelatinous and sweet like marrow and very palatable  nevertheless they learned from experience that if the effect of bile were to be avoided a long march was necessary after a meal of elephants foot  meanwhile the proceedings of the natives were food enough for our travellers for the time being  like human creatures elsewhere they displayed great variety of taste  some preferred boiled meat others roast a few indulged in porridge made of mapira meal  the meal was very good but the porridge was doubtful owing to the cookery  it would appear that in africa as in england woman excels in the culinary art  at all events the mapira meal was better managed by them than by the men  on the present occasion the hunters tumbled in the meal by handfuls in rapid succession as soon as the water was hot until it became too thick to be stirred about then it was lifted off the fire and one man held the pot while another plied the porridgestick with all his might to prevent the solid mass from being burnt  thus it was prepared and thus eaten in enormous quantities  no wonder that dancing and profuse perspiration were esteemed a necessary adjunct to feeding  at the close of the second edition of supper which went into four or five editions before morning some of the men at the fire next to that of kambira engaged in a debate so furious that the curiosity of disco and harold was excited and they caused antonio to translate much of what was said  it is not possible to give a connected account of this debate as translated by antonio  to overcome the difficulty we shall give the substance of it in what disco styled antonios lingo  there were about a dozen natives round the fire but two of them sustained the chief part in the debate  one of these was a large man with a flat nose the other was a small man with a large frizzy head  hold oos tongue said flatnose so antonio named him tongue too longfar  boh oos brains too short retorted frizzyhead contemptuously  an immense amount of chattering by the others followed these pithy remarks of the principals  the question in debate was whether the two toes of the ostrich represented the thumb and forefinger in man or the little and ring fingers  but in a few minutes the subject changed gradually and somehow unaccountably to questions of a political naturefor strange to say in savage africa as in civilised england politics are keenly discussed doubtless at times with equal wisdom in the one land as in the other  what dat oo say inquired flatnose on hearing some muttered remarks of frizzyhead in reference to the misgovernment of chiefs  of course there as here present company was understood to be excepted  chiefs ob no useno use at all said frizzyhead so vehemently that the men at several of the nearest fires ceased to talk and began to listen  ob no use cried flatnose with vehemence so superior that the attention of the whole camp was arrested  no replied frizzyhead still more energetically ob no use at all we could govern ourselves betterer so what de use of um  the chief ums fat an hab plenty wife but we who do all de hard work hab hunger an only one wife prehaps none at all  dis is bad unjust wrong  there was a general shout of eehee from all quarters which was equivalent to our hear hear  oo know noting at all retorted flatnose who was a loyal subject is not de chief de fader of de peepil  can dere be peepil widout a fadereh  god made de chiefwho says dat chief is not wise  he is wise but ums childn am big fools  kambira nodded his head and smiled at this and there was a general inclination on the part of most of the audience to applaud for there as elsewhere men have a tendency to be blown about by every wind of doctrine  it was amusing to observe the earnestness and freedom with which men of the lowest grade assaulted the opinions of their betters on this occasion  unable at other times or in any other way to bring themselves into importance they were glad of the opportunity to do so with their tongues and like their civilised types they assumed an air of mock modesty  oh cried one of these in reply to flatnose we is littil infants we is still holdin on to de boosums ob our moders we not able to walk alone we knows notin at all but on dis point we knows that you old men speak like de ignorint peepil  we nebber hear such nonsense nebber  no notice was taken of this but frizzyhead whose passion was rising to white heat in consequence of the glibness of his opponents tongue cried outoo cannot prove wat ou says  oh yes can prove it well nuff replied flatnose but oos no got brain for onerstand  this last was too much for poor frizzyhead who leaped up stuttered and criedcan oo outrun me then  yeyeyes gasped flatnose springing up  away they went like two hunted springboks and ran for a mile then turned and came back into camp streaming with perspiration little frizzyhead far ahead of the big man and rejoicing in the fact that he could beat his opponent in a race if not in an argument  thus was peace restored  pity that civilised arguments cannot be terminated in the same way  while these discussions were going on disco observed that hyenas were occasionally to be seen prowling near the verge of the bushes around them as if anxious to join in the feast which no doubt was the case  dont they do mischief sometimes he inquired of antonio  no him a cowardly beast  him come at mans when sleepin or dyin but not at oder time  oo like see me catch um  why yes if ee can do it answered disco with a slight look of contempt at his friend who bore too much resemblance in some points to the hyena  come here den  they went together into the jungle a little distance and halted under the branch of a large tree  to this antonio suspended a lump of raw flesh at such a height from the ground that a hyena could only reach it by leaping  directly underneath it he planted a short spear in the earth with its point upward  now come back to fire he said to disco ou soon hear sometin  antonio was right  in a short time afterwards a sharp yell was heard and on running to the trap they found a hyena in its deathagonies it had leaped at the meat missed it and had come down on the spear and impaled itself  well of all the fellers i ever knowd for dodges said disco on reseating himself at the fire the men in these latitudes are the cleverest  by this time dancing was going on furiously therefore as it would have been impossible to sleep disco refilled his pipe and amused himself by contemplating the intelligent countenance of kambira who sat smoking bang out of a huge native meerschaum on the other side of the fire  i wonder said harold who lay stretched on a sleepingmat leaning on his right arm and gazing contemplatively at the glowing heart of the fire i wonder what has become of yoosoof  was ee thinkin that he deserved to be shoved in there asked disco pointing to the fire  not exactly replied harold laughing but i have frequently thought of the scoundrel and wondered where he is and what doing now  i have sometimes thought too about that girl azinte poor thing  she  he paused abruptly and gazed at kambira with great surprise not unmixed with alarm for the chief had suddenly dropped his pipe and glared at him in a manner that cannot be described  disco observed the change also and was about to speak when kambira sprang over the fire and seized harold by the arm  there was something in the movement however which forbade the idea of an attack therefore he lay still  what now kambira he said  antonio cried the chief in a voice that brought the interpreter to his side in a twinkling what name did the white man speak just now  azinte said harold rising to a sitting posture  kambira sat down drew up his knees to his chin and clasped his hands round them  tell me all you know about azinte he said in a low firm voice  it was evident that the chief was endeavouring to restrain some powerful feeling for his face black though it was indicated a distinct degree of pallor and his lips were firmly compressed together  harold therefore much surprised as well as interested related the little he knew about the poor girlhis meeting with her in yoosoofs hut discos kindness to her and her subsequent departure with the arab  kambira sat motionless until he had finished  do you know where she is gone he inquired  no  i know not but she was not in the boat with the other slaves when we sailed from which i think it likely that she remained upon the coastbut why do you ask kambira why are you so anxious about her  she is my wife muttered the chief between his teeth and as he said so a frown that was absolutely diabolical settled down on his features  for some minutes there was a dead silence for both harold and disco felt intuitively that to offer consolation or hope were out of the question  presently kambira raised his head and a smile chased the frown away as he saidyou have been kind to azinte will you be kind to her husband  we should be indeed unworthy the name of englishmen if we said no to that replied harold glancing at disco who nodded approval  good  will you take me with you to the shores of the great salt lake said kambira in a low pathetic tone will you make me your servant your slave  most gladly will i take you with me as a friend returned harold i need not ask why you wish to go he addedyou go to seek azinte  yes cried the chief springing up wildly and drawing himself up to his full height i go to seek azinte  ho up men up  ye have feasted enough and slept enough for one night  who knows but the slavers may be at our huts while we lie idly here  up  let us go  the ringing tones acted like a magic spell  savage camps are soon pitched and sooner raised  in a few minutes the obedient hunters had bundled up all their possessions and in less than a quarter of an hour the whole band was tracking its way by moonlight through the pathless jungle  the pace at which they travelled home was much more rapid than that at which they had set out on their expedition  somehow the vigorous tones in which kambira had given command to break up the camp coupled with his words roused the idea that he must have received information of danger threatening the village and some of the more anxious husbands and fathers unable to restrain themselves left the party altogether and ran back the whole way  to their great relief however they found on arriving that all was quiet  the women were singing and at work in the fields the children shouting at play and the men at their wonted occupation of weaving cotton cloth or making nets and bows under the banyantrees  perplexity is not a pleasant condition of existence nevertheless to perplexity mankind is more or less doomed in every period of life and in every mundane sceneparticularly in the jungles of central africa as harold and his friends found out many a time to their cost  on arriving at the native village the chief point that perplexed our hero there was as to whether he should return to the coast at once or push on further into the interior  on the one hand he wished very much to see more of the land and its inhabitants on the other hand kambira was painfully anxious to proceed at once to the coast in search of his lost wife and pressed him to set off without delay  the chief was rather an exception in regard to his feelings on this point  most other african potentates had several wives and in the event of losing one of them might have found consolation in the others but kambira had never apparently thought of taking another wife after the loss of azinte and the only comfort he had was in his little boy who bore a strong resemblance in some points to the mother  but although harold felt strong sympathy with the man and would have gone a long way out of his course to aid him he could not avoid perceiving that the case was almost if not altogether a hopeless one he had no idea to what part of the coast azinte had been taken  for all he knew to the contrary she might have been long ago shipped off to the northern markets and probably was even while he talked of her the inmate of an arab harem or at all events a piece of goodsa chattelin the absolute possession of an irresponsible master besides the improbability of kambira ever hearing what had become of his wife or to what part of the earth she had been transported there was also the difficulty of devising any definite course of action for the chief himself because the instant he should venture to leave the protection of the englishmen he would be certain to fall into the hands of arabs or portuguese and become enslaved  much of this harold had not the heart to explain to him  he dwelt however pretty strongly on the latter contingency though without producing much effect  death the chief replied he did not fear and slavery could easily be exchanged for death  alas not so easily as you think said harold pointing to chimbolo whose sad story he had heard they will try every kind of torture before they kill you  chimbolo nodded his head assenting and ground his teeth together fiercely when this was said  still kambira was unmoved he did not care what they did to him  azinte was as life to him and to search for her he would go in spite of every consideration  harold prevailed on him however to agree to wait until he should have spent another month in visiting chimbolos tribe after which he promised faithfully to return and take him along with his party to the coast  neither harold nor disco was quite at ease in his mind after making this arrangement but they both agreed that no other course could be pursued the former saying with a sigh that there was no help for it and the latter asserting with a grunt that the thing wos unawoidable  on the following day the journey of exploration was resumed  kambira accompanied his friends a few miles on the road and then bade them farewell  on the summit of an elevated ridge the party halted and looked back  kambiras manly form could be seen leaning on his spear behind him the little village lay embosomed in luxuriant verdure and glowing in the bright sunshine while songs and sounds of industry floated towards them like a sweet melody  it was with a feeling of keen regret that the travellers turned away after waving their hands in reply to a parting salute from the stalwart chief and descending to the plain pushed forward into the unknown wilderness beyond    chapter fourteen  camping travelling shooting dreaming poetising philosophising and surprising in equatorial africa  at sunset the travellers halted in a peculiarly wild spot and encamped under the shelter of a gigantic baobab tree  two rousing fires were quickly kindled round which the natives busied themselves in preparing supper while their leaders sat down the one to write up his journal the other to smoke his pipe  well sir said disco after a few puffs delivered with extreme satisfaction you do seem for to enjoy writin  you go at that log of yours every night as if it wos yer last will and testament that ye couldnt die happy without exikootin an signin it with yer blood  a better occupation isnt it replied harold with a sly glance than to make a chimneypot of my mouth  come sir returned disco with a deprecatory smile dont be too hard on a poor fellers pipe  if you cant enjoy it thats no argiment against it  how dyou know i cant enjoy it  why cos i spose youd take to it if you did  did you enjoy it when you first began asked harold  well i cant zactly say as i did  well then if you didnt that proves that it is not natural to smoke and why should i acquire an unnatural and useless habit  useless why sir ony think of wot you loses by not smokinwot a deal of enjoyment  well i am thinking replied harold affecting a look of profound thoughtfulness but i cant quite make it outenjoyment let me see do i not enjoy as good health as you do  o cernly sir cernly  youre quite up to the mark in that respect  well then i enjoy my food as well and can eat as much cant i  no doubt of it replied disco with a grin i was used to be considered raither a dab at wittles but i must say i knocks under to you sir  very good rejoined harold laughing then as to sleep i enjoy sleep quite as soundly as yourself dont i  i cant say as to that replied disco  you see sir as i never opens my eyes arter shuttin of em till the bosn pipes all hands ahoy ive no means of knowin wot you accomplish in that way  on the whole then it seems that i enjoy everything as much as you do and  no not everything you dont enjoy baccy you knowbut please sir dont go for to moralise i cant stand it  youll spile my pipe if ye do  well i shall spare you said harold all the more that i perceive supper is about  at that moment antonio who had gone down to a streamlet which trickled close at hand gave utterance to a hideous yell and came rushing into camp with a face that was peagreen from terror  ach he gasped a lion queek your guns  every one leaped up and seized his weapon with marvellous alacrity on receiving an alarm so violent and unlookedfor  where away inquired disco blazing with excitement and ready at a moments notice to rush into the jungle and fire both barrels at whatever should present itself  no no don go cried antonio in alarm be cautionous  the interpreters caution was enforced by chimbolo who laid his hand on discos arm and looked at him with such solemnity that he felt it necessary to restrain his ardour  meanwhile antonio with trembling steps led harold to a point in the thicket whence he beheld two bright phosphoriclooking objects which his companion said were the lions eyes adding that lions eyes always shone in that way  harold threw forward his rifle with the intention of taking aim but lowered it quickly for he felt convinced that no lion could possibly have eyes so wide apart unless its head were as large as that of an elephant  nonsense antonio he said laughing that cannot be a lion  ho yis hims a lion for sure antonio returned positively  we shall see  harold raised his rifle and fired while antonio turned and fled fully expecting the wounded beast to spring  harold himself half looked for some such act and shrank behind a bush by way of precaution but when the smoke cleared away he saw that the two glowing eyes were gazing at him as fixedly as ever  pooh exclaimed disco brushing past i knows wot it is  many a time ive seed em in the west injies  saying which he went straight up to the supposed lion picked up a couple of glowworms and brought them to the campfires much to the amusement of the men especially of jumbo and greatly to the confusion of the valorous interpreter who according to his invariable custom when danger threatened was found to have sought refuge in a tree  this incident furnished ground for much discussion and merriment during supper in which antonio being in no wise ashamed of himself joined noisily and chimbolo took occasion to reprove disco for his rashness telling him that it was impossible to kill lions in the jungle during the darkness of night and that if they did pay them a visit it would be wise to let them be and trust to the campfires keeping them at a respectful distance  to which disco retorted that he didnt believe there was any lions in afriky for hed heard a deal about em an travelled far but had not yet heard the sound of their woices an wot was more didnt expect to  before that night was far advanced disco was constrained to acknowledge himself in error for a veritable lion did actually prowl down to the camp and salute them with a roar which had a wonderfully aweinspiring effect on every member of the party especially on those who heard it for the first time in their lives  just before the arrival of this nocturnal visitor one of the men had been engaged in some poetic effusions which claim preliminary notice here because they were rudely terminated by the lion  this man was one of kambiras people and had joined the party by permission  he was one of those beings who gifted with something like genius or with superior powers of some sort have sprung up in africa as elsewhere no doubt from time immemorial to dazzle their fellows for a little and then pass away leaving a trail of tradition behind them the existence there in time past of men of mind far in advance of their fellows as well as of heroes whose physical powers were marvellous may be assumed from the fact that some such exist at the present time as well as from tradition  some of these heroes have excited the admiration of large districts by their wisdom others by their courage or their superior dexterity with the spear and bow like william tell and robin hood but the memory of these must soon have been obliterated for want of literature  the man who had joined harold was a poet and a musician  he was an improvvisatore composed verses on the incidents that occurred as they travelled along and sang them with an accompaniment on an instrument called the sansa which had nine iron keys and a calabash for a soundingboard  the poets name was mokompa  with the free and easy disposition of his race he allowed his fancy to play round the facts of which he sang and was never at a loss for if the right word did not come readily he spun out the measure with musical sounds which meant nothing at all  after supper was over or rather when the first interval of repose occurred mokompa who was an obliging and hearty little fellow was called on for a song  nothing loath he seized his sansa and began a ditty of which the following given by antonio may be regarded as a remarkably free not to say easy translation    mokompas song    kambira goes to hunt   yo ho   hims spear am nebber blunt

ho  the last yo ho was given with tremendous energy and followed by peals of laughter  it was at this point that the veritable lion thought proper to join in which he did as we have said with a roar so tremendous that it not only put a sudden stop to the music but filled the party with so much alarm that they sprang to their arms with surprising agility  mindful of chimbolos previous warning neither harold nor disco sought to advance but both looked at their savage friend for advice  now in some parts of africa there exists a popular belief that the souls of departed chiefs enter into lions and render them sacred and several members of harold seadrifts party entertained this notion chimbolo was one of these  from the sounds of growling and rending which issued from the thicket he knew that the lion in question was devouring part of their buffalomeat which had been hung on the branch of a neighbouring tree not however near enough to the fires to be visible  believing that the beast was a chief in disguise chimbolo advanced a little towards the place where he was and much to our travellers amusement gave him a good scolding  you call yourself a chief do youeh he said sternly  what kind of a chief can you be to come sneaking about in the dark like this trying to steal our buffalomeat  are you not ashamed of yourself  a pretty chief truly you are like the scavengerbeetle and think of yourself only you have not the heart of a chief  why dont you kill your own beef  you must have a stone in your chest and no heart at all  thats werry flowery lingo but it dont seem to convince him said disco with a quiet smile as the lion which had been growling continuously over its meal all the time wound up chimbolos speech with another terrific roar  at this point another believer in transmigration of souls a quiet man who seldom volunteered remarks on any subject stepped forward and began seriously to expostulate with the lion  it is very wrong of you he said to treat strangers in this fashion you might have more respect for englishmen who have come to see your land and never did you any harm  we are travelling peaceably through the country we never kill anybody and never steal anything the buffalomeat is ours not yours and it ill becomes a great chief like you to be prowling about in the dark like a hyena trying to steal the meat of strangers  surely you can hunt for yourselfthere is plenty of meat in the forest  see livingstones zambesi and its tributaries page 160  as the lion was equally deaf to this mans reasoning harold thought it right to try a more persuasive plan  he drew up in a line all the men who had guns and at a word of command they fired a volley of balls into the jungle in the direction whence the sounds issued  a dead silence followed but it was deemed advisable not to venture in to see the effect as men had frequently lost their lives by so doing  a watch however was kept during the night and the fires were well replenished for they knew that the king of the forest usually shrinks from doing his evil deeds in the light of a strong campfire  we say usuallybecause they are not always thus shy  authentic instances are on record of lions having leaped into the centre of a bivouac and carried off one of the men in spite of being smitten in the face with flaming firebrands fortunately the lion of which we write thought discretion the better part of valour  he retired peaceably nevertheless disco and his friend continued to dream of him all night so vividly that they started up several times and seized their rifles under the impression that he had roared his loudest into their very ears and after each of these occasions they crept back into their sleeping bags to redream of the lion  the bag which formed each mans couch was made simply of two mats sewed together and left open not at one of the ends but at one of the sides so that a man could roll out of or into it more easily than he could have slid feet first into a sack  it was large enough also for two to sleep inside together always supposing that the two were of accommodating dispositions  that they had now reached a land which swarmed with wild animals was intimated to some extent by the running past within fifty yards of their bivouac of a troop of elephants  it was daybreak at the time so that having been thus rudely aroused they did not deem it necessary to return to rest but after taking a hasty mouthful of food set forth on their journey  the usual mode of proceeding on the march was as followsthey rose about five oclock or soon after the appearance of dawn and swallowed a cup of tea with a bit of biscuit then some of the men folded up the blankets and stowed them away in the bags others tied up the cooking utensils etcetera in bundles and hung them at the ends of carryingsticks which they bore upon their shoulders  the process did not take long  they were soon on the march either in single file if the path were narrow or in groups according to fancy where the ground admitted of their spreading out  about nine a convenient spot was chosen for a halt to breakfast which meat although not eaten the night before in order to save time in the morning was at all events cooked on the previous evening for the same end so that it only needed warming up  then the march was resumed a short rest was allowed in the heat of the day when of course disco had a pipe and much sagacious intercourse with his fellows and they finally encamped for the remainder of the day and night early in the afternoon  thus they travelled five or six hours at a stretch and averaged from twelve to fifteen miles a day which is about as much as europeans can stand in a hot climate without being oppressed  this disco called taking it easy and so it was when compared with the custom of some travellers whose chief end would appear to be the getting over as much ground as possible in a given time in order that they may afterwards boast of the same and for the accomplishment of which they are obliged to abuse and look ferocious at the blacks cock their pistols and flourish their whips in a manner which is only worthy of being styled contemptible and cowardly  we need not say that our friends harold and disco had no such propensities  they had kindly consideration for the feelings of their niggers coupled with great firmness became very sociable with them and thus got hearty willing work out of them  but to return from this digression  during the day the number of animals of all sorts that were seen was so great as to induce disco to protest with a slap of his thigh that the whole land from stem to stern seemed to him to be one prodigious zoological gardenit did an no mistake about it  disco was not far wrong  he and harold having started ahead of the party with chimbolo as their guide came on a wonderful variety of creatures in rapid succession  first they fell in with some large flocks of guineafowl and shot a few for dinner  as they advanced various birds ran across their path and clouds of turtledoves filled the air with the blatter of their wings as they rose above the trees ducks geese and francolins helped to swell the chorus of sounds  when the sun rose and sent a flood of light over a wide and richly wooded vale into which they were about to descend a herd of pallahs stood gazing at the travellers in stupid surprise and allowed them to approach within sixty yards before trotting leisurely away  these and all other animals were passed unmolested as the party had sufficient meat at the time and harold made it a point not to permit his followers to shoot animals for the mere sake of sport though several of them were uncommonly anxious to do so  soon afterwards a herd of waterbucks were passed and then a herd of koodoos with two or three magnificentlyhorned bucks amongst them which hurried off to the hillsides on seeing the travellers  antelopes also were seen and buffaloes grazing beside their path  ere long they came upon a small pond with a couple of elephants standing on its brink cooling their huge sides by drawing water into their trunks and throwing it all over themselves  behind these were several herds of zebras and waterbucks all of which took to flight on getting the wind of man  they seemed intuitively to know that he was an enemy wild pigs also were common and troops of monkeys large and small barked chattered grinned and made faces among the trees  after pitching the camp each afternoon and having had a mouthful of biscuit the two englishmen were in the habit of going off to hunt for the daily supply of fresh meat accompanied by chimbolo as their guide and gamecarrier antonio as their interpreter and mokompa as their poet and jester  they did not indeed appoint mokompa to that post of honour but the little worthy took it upon himself for the express purpose of noting the deeds of the white men in order to throw his black comrades into convulsions over supper by a poetic recital of the same  it pleases them an it dont hurt us was discos observation on this head  on the afternoon then of which we write the party of four went out to hunt while the encampment was being prepared under the superintendence of jumbo who had already proved himself to be an able manager and cook as also had his countrymen masiko and zombo  what a rich country exclaimed harold looking round in admiration from the top of a small hillock on as fine a scene as one could wish to behold and what a splendid cotton country it might be if properly cultivated  so it is said disco an i shouldnt wonder if there wos lots of gold too if we only knew where to look for it  gold exclaimed antonio who sat winking placidly on the stump of a fallen tree dere be lots ob gold near zambesian oder ting too  lets hear wot are some of the other things said disco  what are dereoh let me see der be coal lots ob coal on zambesi any

rest of de goods an chattels to a bad master who berry soon make him sorry him sole hisself  pushing forward for several days in the manner which we have attempted to describe our travellers passed through many varied scenes which however all bore one mark in common namely teeming animal and vegetable life  human beings were also found to be exceedingly numerous but not so universally distributed as the others for although many villages and hamlets were passed the inhabitants of which were all peacefully inclined and busy in their fields or with their native cotton iron and pottery manufactures vast expanses of rich ground were also traversed which as far as man was concerned appeared to be absolute solitudes  entering upon one of these about noon of a remarkably fine day harold could not help remarking on the strange stillness which pervaded the air  no sound was heard from beast bird or insect no village was near no rippling stream murmured or zephyr stirred the leaves in short it was a scene which from its solitude and profound silence became oppressive  wy sir said disco whose face was bathed in perspiration it do seem to me as if wed got to the fagend of the world altogether  there aint nothin nowhere  harold laughed and said it looked like it  but disco was wrong  it was only the hour when animals seem to find a siesta indispensable and vegetables as well as air had followed their example  a few minutes sufficed to prove their mistake for on entering a piece of woodland a herd of pallahs and another of waterbucks appeared standing as quiet and still as if they were part of a painted landscape  then in passing a thick clump of thorns they could see through openings in the bushes the dim phantomlike forms of buffaloes with heads lowered and eyes glaring at them ready to charge if need be though too lazy from heat apparently to begin the fray and willing to act on the principle of let be for let be  still farther on a native was observed keeping at a respectful distance  he had seen the travellers from afar and come with noiseless tread to get a nearer view  halting to rest the party for a few minutes in a shady hollow harold threw himself at full length on the grass but disco who strange to say did not feel inclined to smoke at the momentprobably because he had only just finished his fifth pipe a few minutes previously sauntered on alone to the top of the next ridge  he had barely reached the summit when harold who chanced to be looking after him observed that he crouched suddenly behind a bush and after gazing steadfastly for a few seconds over the hill turned and ran back making excessively wild demonstrations with head and arms but uttering no sound  of course the whole party sprang up and ran towards the excited mariner and soon were near enough to understand that his violent actions were meant to caution them to make no noise  hush he said eagerly on coming near enough to be heard keep quiet as mice  theres a slavegang or somethin uncommon like it goin along on right athwart us  without a word of reply the whole party hurried forward and gained a point of observation behind the low bushes which crowned the ridge    chapter fifteen  shows some of the effects of the slavetrade at the fountainhead  down in a gorge just below the spot where harold seadrift and his men lay concealed a strange sight met the eyes of the two englishmen in regard to which despite all that they had heard and seen and were prepared to see they were as much shocked as if it had never been presented even to their imaginations up to that moment  it was a gang of slaves winding its way slowly but steadily through the gorge  the head of the dusky procession was just emerging on the open ground beyond the gorge when the travellers first came upon it  the slaves advanced towards the spot where they lay passing under it so closely that they could see the very expressions on the faces of the men women and children who composed the gang  these expressions were varied and very terrible  our travellers had now reached the fountainhead whence the perennial stream of black ivory flows out of africa  the process of manufacture although considerably advanced had not yet reached that perfection of callous subjection and settled despair which had struck our englishmen so forcibly in the slavemarket of zanzibar  there was anxiety not unmingled with faint hope in the faces of some of the women and a few of the more stalwart and courageous among the men wore a fierce determined aspect which told of manhood not yet absolutely prostrated in the dust of abject servility while in regard to some of the children surprise at the peculiar circumstances of their surroundings had not yet been swallowed up in a condition of chronic terror  they marched in a long line fastened to each other by chains and ropes and heavy gorees or slavesticks  the latter implements were poles from six to seven feet long with a fork at the end of each in which the necks of the men were fitted and secured by means of an iron bolt passing across the throat and riveted at both ends  to render marching possible with such encumbrances the men went in couples one behind the other so that the slavestick of the leading man could be tied to the stick of his fellow behind which was slewed round to the front for the purpose  their wrists were also tied some in front others behind their backs  secured thus hercules himself might have been reduced to obedience especially if he had felt the frequent sting of the cruel lash that was laid on these captives a lash whose power was made manifest by the numerous seams and scars which crossed and recrossed their backs and limbs  the women and children were deemed sufficiently secure by being fastened to each other with ropes and iron rings round their necks  all were naked with the exception of a little piece of cloth round the loins and some of the women had infants of a few weeks old strapped to their backs by means of this shred of cloth while others carried baskets on their heads containing meal for the sustenance of the party during their journey  in advance of the line marched a tall powerfullybuilt halfcaste armed with a musket and small axe and clad in a loose coat short drawers reaching the knees and straw hat  he was obviously the commander of the band  behind him came several negroes also armed with muskets and with thick wands for the purpose of flagellation  these wore loincloths and turbans or red caps but nothing more  they laughed talked and strutted as they went along forming a marked contrast to the silent and depressed slaves  at intervals along the line and in rear there were stationed one or two of these drivers who urged on their cattle with more or less cruelty according to their individual impulses or natures  we need scarcely say that this sight filled harold and disco not only with feelings of horror and pity but with sensations of towering indignation that almost suffocated them  those who only read of such things at home can form but a faint conception of what it is actually to behold them  we must fight muttered harold between his teeth  disco could not speak but he looked at his companion and gave a nod that plainly indicated the state of his feelings  sh hissed chimbolo creeping up at that moment and laying his hand which trembled violently on harolds shoulder marizano  what the scoundrel in advance  chimbolo pointed to the leader of the slavegang and almost foamed at the mouth with suppressed rage  at that moment their attention was attracted to a woman who walked immediately behind the slavers  she was a young and according to african ideas a comely girl but was apparently very weakso weak that she panted and stumbled as she went along a circumstance which was accounted for by the little infant tied to her back which could not have been more than a couple of weeks old  stumbling against the fallen branch of a tree she fell at last with a low wail to the ground and made no effort as on previous occasions to recover herself  the whole gang stopped and marizano turning back pushed the woman with his foot  a finelooking young man who was the leader in a couple secured by a slavestick seemed to regard this woman with a degree of interest that argued near relationship  he started forward half involuntarily when the portuguese halfcaste kicked her  he had forgotten for an instant his fellow in rear as well as the bar of the goree across his throat which checked him violently at the same time one of the drivers who had observed the movement laid a supple wand across his bare back so sharply as to draw forth a terrific yell of agony  this was too much for disco lillihammer  unable to restrain himself he leaped up seized his rifle by the muzzle with both hands and swinging it round his head rushed upon marizano with a bursting shout of rage and defiance  it is probable that the halfcaste leader who was by no means destitute of courage would have stood his ground had his assailant been a man of colour but this unexpected apparition of a white man with a fiery countenance and blue eyes that absolutely flashed as he rushed forward with irresistible fury was too much for him  firing hastily and with bad aim marizano turned and fled into the woods followed by all his men  there was however a large band of ajawa savages in rear armed with bows and poisoned arrows  when he encountered these the portuguese chief halted and rallying his men took shelter behind trees and began to fire at the advancing enemy  seeing this harold drew his men together and made them fire a united volley which had the effect of utterly routing the slavers  disco meanwhile finding that he could not overtake marizano at last did what he ought to have done at firstkneeled down took deliberate aim at him and fired  his agitation prevented accuracy of aim nevertheless he succeeded in sending a bullet through the fleshy part of the mans arm above the elbow which effectually put him to flight  returning to the slaves who had been left standing where they were first stopped in a state of great surprise and perplexity he assisted his companions in freeing them  this was easy enough in regard to the women and children but the gorees on the men were very difficult to remove  being riveted as we have said it became necessary to split the forks with hatchets an operation which endangered the heads of the poor captives and hurt their galled necks considerably  it was accomplished however in the midst of a deal of excitement and hurried conversation while jumbo and his comrades kindled fires and harold bade the women cook the mealwhich they had hitherto carriedfor themselves and their children  they seemed to consider this too good news to be true but on being encouraged began with alacrity  dont be afeared lass cried disco patting a young woman on the head eat as much as ee like  you need it poor thing an stuff the childer till they cant hold no more  bust em if ee can  the slavers wont come back here in a hurry  ha  i only wish they would an let us have a brush with em  but theres no such luck  cowards never fight xcept wen theyre sure to winnow piccaninny here you are he said stuffing some raw mapira meal into the open mouth of a thin little girl of about six or seven who was gazing at him in openeyed surprise dont put off time youre halfstarved already  the little black skeleton began to chew the dry meal with evident satisfaction but without taking her eyes off her deliverer  who are you asked a somewhat older girl of harold whom she regarded with looks of reverence and wonder  of course harold did not understand her but he immediately called antonio who translated  who are you she said the other people tied and starved us but you cut the ropes and tell us to eat what sort of people are you  where did you come from  to this harold replied briefly that he was an englishman who hated slavers and slavery but he said nothing more at that time as he intended to have a palaver and explanation with the freed captives after their meal was over  there was a great clapping of hands among the slaves expressive of gratitude on hearing that they were free  about a hundred sat down to that meal most of whom were women and children and the manner in which they devoured the food set before them told eloquently of their previous sufferings  at first they timidly held back scarce venturing to believe that their new captors as they thought them were in earnest  but when their doubts and fears were removed they attacked the mapira porridge like ravening wolves gradually the human element began to reappear in the shape of a comment or a smile and before long the women were chatting together and a few of the stronger among the young children were making feeble attempts to play  when the oldest man of the party who appeared to be between twenty and thirty was brought forward and questioned he gave some interesting and startling information  tell him said harold to antonio that we are englishmen that we belong to the same nation as the great white man dr livingstone who travelled through this land some years agothe nation which hates slavery because the great god hates it and would have all men to be free to serve each other in love and to do to other people as they would have other people do to them  ask him also where he comes from and who captured him and his companions  to this the negro repliedwhat the white man says may be true but the white men seem to tell lies too much  the men who killed our warriors burned our villages and took our women and children away came to us saying that they were friends that they were the servants of the same people as the white man livingstone and wanted to trade with us  when we believed and trusted them and were off our guard they fired on us with their guns  we know not what to think or to believe  harold was much perplexed by this reply for he knew not what evidence to cite in proof that he at least was not a deceiver  tell him he said at length that there are false white men as well as true and that the best proof i can give him that i am one of the true is to set him and his friends at liberty  they are now as free to go where they please as we are  on receiving this assurance the negro retired to consult with his friends  meanwhile antonio who seemed to have been touched by the unvarying kindness with which he had been treated by his employers opened his mind to them and gave them a good deal of information of which the substance is as follows  at that time the merchants of the portuguese inland town of tette on the zambesi were carrying on the slavetrade with unusual vigour for this reason that they found it difficult to obtain ivory except in exchange for slaves  in former years they had carried on a trade in ivory with a tribe called the banyai these banyai being great elephanthunters but it happened that they went to war with another tribe named the matabele who had managed to steal from them all their women and children  consequently the forlorn banyai said to the tette merchants when they went to trade with them as they had been accustomed to do we do not want your merchandise  bring us women and children and you shall have as much ivory as you wish  these good people of tettebeing chiefly halfcaste portuguese and under portuguese government and claiming as they do to be the possessors of that region of africaare so utterly incapable of holding their own that they are under the necessity of paying tribute to a tribe of savages who come down annually to tette to receive it and who but for that tribute would as they easily could expel them from the land  these merchants of tette moreover in common with all the portuguese in africa are by the laws of portugal prohibited from engaging in the export slavetrade  they are not however forbidden to engage temporarily in the domestic slavetrade hence they had sent out slaving partiesin other words robbers kidnappers murdererswho hired the warlike ajawa tribe to aid them in killing the manganja men and robbing them of their wives and little ones by which means they were enabled to supply the demand for such cattle among the banyai and thus obtained the desired supply of ivory  so vigorously had this slave traffic been carried on at the time of which we write that no fewer than two hundred peoplemostly women and childrenwere carried out of the hillcountry every week  see the universities mission to central africa page 112  in a short time the negro returned to the place where harold and disco were seated and said that he believed his white deliverers were true men but added that he and his people had no home to go to their village having been burnt and all the old people and warriors killed or dispersed by marizano who was a terribly cruel man  in proof of this assertion he said that only the day before marizano had shot two of the women for attempting to untie their thongs a man had been killed with an axe because he had brokendown with fatigue and a woman had her infants brains dashed out because she was unable to carry it as well as the load assigned to her  it is difficult to decide what one should do in these circumstances said harold to disco  you know it would never do to leave these helpless people here to starve but if we take them on with us our progress will be uncommonly slow  wed better take em back said disco  back  where to  wy to the last village wot we passed through  it aint more than a days march an im sure the old feller as is capting of it would take care o the lot  there is good advice in that yet i grudge to go back said harold if there were a village the same distance in advance i would rather take them on  but there aint returned disco  hallo  i say wots wrong with tony  the interpreter came forward with a look of much excitement as he spoke  what now antonio  oh its drefful replied the interpreter  dey tells me have hear marizano speak ob anoder slaving party what go straight to kambiras village for attack it  who told you that  are they sure asked harold hastily  two tree mans tole me replied antonio  all say same ting  too late to help him now mes fraid  never say too late cried disco starting up never say die while theres a shot in the locker  it may be time enough yet if we only look sharp  i votes that we leave nearly all the provisions we have with these poor critters here up anchor bout ship clap on all sail and away this werry minit  harold agreed with this advice heartily and at once acted on it  the arrangements were quickly made the provisions distributed an explanation made and in less than an hour the travellers were retracing their steps in hot haste  by taking a straight line and making forced marches they arrived in sight of the ridge where they had last seen kambira on the evening of the third day  as they drew near harold pushed impatiently forward and outrunning his companions was first to reach the summit  discos heart sank within him for he observed that his companion stood still bowed his head and covered his face with both hands  he soon joined him and a groan burst from the seamans breast when he saw dense volumes of smoke rising above the spot where the village had so recently lain a picture of peaceful beauty  even their followers accustomed though they were to scenes and deeds of violence and cruelty could not witness the grief of the englishmen unmoved  praps said disco in a husky voice theres some of em left alive hidin in the bushes  it may be so replied harold as he descended the slope with rapid strides  god help them  a few minutes sufficed to bring them to the scene of ruin but the devastation caused by the fire was so great that they had difficulty in recognising the different spots where the huts had stood  kambiras hut was however easily found as it stood on a rising ground  there the fight with the slavers had evidently been fiercest for around it lay the charred and mutilated remains of many human bodies  some of these were so far distinguishable that it could be told whether they belonged to man woman or child  look here said disco in a deep stern voice as he pointed to an object on the ground not far from the hut  it was the form of a woman who had been savagely mangled by her murderers  the upturned and distorted face proved it to be yohama the grandmother of little obo  near to her lay the body of a greyhaired negro who might to judge from his position have fallen in attempting to defend her  oh if the people of england only saw this sight said harold in a low tone if they only believed in and realised this fact there would be one universal and indignant shout of no toleration of slavery anywhere throughout the world  look closely for kambira or his son he added turning to his men  a careful search among the sickening remains was accordingly made but without any discovery worth noting being made after which they searched the surrounding thickets  here sad evidence of the poor fugitives having been closely pursued was found in the dead bodies of many of the old men and women and of the very young children and infants also the bodies of a few of the warriors  all these had been speared chiefly through the back  still they were unsuccessful in finding the bodies of the chief or his little boy  its plain said disco that they have either escaped or been took prisoners  here is some one not quite dead said haroldah poor fellow  he raised the unfortunate mans head on his knee and recognised the features of the little man who had entertained them with his tunes on the native violin  it was in vain that antonio tried to gain his attention while disco moistened his lips with water  he had been pierced in the chest with an arrow  once only he opened his eyes and a faint smile played on his lips as if he recognised friends but it faded quickly and left the poor musician a corpse  leaving with heavy hearts the spot where they had spent such pleasant days and nights enjoying the hospitality of kambira and his tribe our travellers began to retrace their steps to the place where they had left the rescued slaves but that night the strong frame of disco lillihammer succumbed to the influence of climate  he was suddenly stricken with african fever and in a few hours became as helpless as a little child  in this extremity harold found it necessary to encamp  he selected the highest and healthiest spot in the neighbourhood caused his followers to build a rude but comparatively comfortable hut and set himself diligently to hunt for and to tend his sick friend    chapter sixteen  treats of love hatred and sorrow and proves that slavery and its consequences are not confined to black men and women  we must now change the scene to the garden of that excellent governor senhor francisco alfonso toledo bignoso letotti and the date to three months in advance of the period in which occurred the events related in the last chapter  maraquita i am sorry to find that you still persist in encouraging that morbid regret for the loss of one who cannot now be recovered  thus spoke the governor in tones that were unusually petulant for one who idolised his child  father why did you sell her without saying a word to me about your intention  it was very very very unkindindeed it was  poor maraquitas eyes were already red and swollen with much weeping nevertheless she proceeded to increase the redness and the swelling by a renewed burst of passionate distress  the worthy governor found it difficult to frame a reply or to administer suitable consolation for in his heart he knew that he had sold azinte as it were surreptitiously to marizano for an unusually large sum of money at a time when his daughter was absent on a visit to a friend the noted portuguese kidnapper murderer rebel and trader in black ivory having recovered from his wound had returned to the town and being well aware of azintes market value as a rare and remarkably beautiful piece of ivory of extrasuperfine quality had threatened as well as tempted governor letotti beyond his powers of resistance marizano did not want the girl as his own slave  he wanted dollars and therefore destined her for the markets of arabia or persia where the smoothtongued and yellowskinned inhabitants hold that robbery violence and cruelty such as would make the flesh of civilised people creep although horrible vices in themselves are nevertheless quite justifiable when covered by the sanction of that miraculous talisman called a domestic institution  the british government had by treaty agreed to respect slavery in the dominions of the sultan of zanzibar as a domestic institution with which it would not interfere  governor letottis heart had smitten him at first for he really was an amiable man and felt kindly disposed to humanity at large slaves included  unfortunately the same kindliness was concentrated with tenfold power on himself so that when selfinterest came into play the amiable man became capable of deeds that marizano himself might have been proud of  the only difference in fact between the two was that the governor like the drunkard often felt ashamed of himself and sometimes wished that he were a better man while the manstealer gloried in his deeds and had neither wish nor intention to improve  maraquita said senhor letotti still somewhat petulantly though with more of remonstrance in his tone how can you speak so foolishly  it was out of my power you know to speak to you when you were absent about what i intended to do  besides i was at the time very much in need of some ready money for although i am rich enough there are times when most of my capital is what business men called locked up and therefore not immediately available  in these circumstances marizano came to me with a very tempting offer  but there are plenty of goodlooking amiable affectionate girls in africa  i can easily buy you another slave quite as good as azinte  as good as azinte echoed maraquita wildly starting up and gazing at her father with eyes that flashed through her tears azinte who has opened her heart to meher bursting bleeding heartand told me all her former joys and all her present woes and who loves me as she lovesay better than she lovesher own soul merely because i dropped a few tears of sympathy on her little hand  another as good as azinte she cried with increasing vehemence would you listen with patience to any one who should talk to you of another as good as maraquita  nay but remonstrated the governor you are now raving your feelings towards azinte cannot be compared with my love for you  if you loved me as i thought you did you would notyou could not have thus taken from me my darling little maid  oh shame shame on you father  she could say no more but rushed from the room to fling herself down and sob out her feelings in the privacy of her own chamber where she was sought out by the black cook who had overheard some of the conversation and was a sympathetic soul  but that amiable domestic happened to be inopportunely officious she instantly fled from the chamber followed by the neatest pair of little slippers imaginable which hit her on the back of her woolly headfor maraquita like other spoilt children had made up her mind not to be comforted  meanwhile the governor paced the floor of his drawingroom with uneasy feelings which however were suddenly put to flight by the report of a gun  hastening to the window he saw that the shot had been fired by a warsteamer which was entering the bay  ha the firefly good exclaimed the governor with a gratified look this will put it all right  he said nothing more but left the room hastily  it may however be as well to explain that his remark had reference to the mutual affection which he was well aware existed between his daughter and the gallant lieutenant lindsay  he had not indeed the most remote intention of permitting maraquita to wed the penniless officer but he had no objection whatever to their flirting as much as they pleased and he readily perceived that nothing would be more likely to take the senhorinas thoughts off her lost maid than the presence of her lover  there was a bower in a secluded corner of the governor letottis garden a very charming bower indeed in which lieutenant lindsay had been wont at times when duty to the queen of england permitted to hold sweet converse with the queen of his soul  what that converse was it neither becomes us to say nor the reader to inquire  perhaps it had reference to astronomy perchance to domestic economy  at all events it was always eminently satisfactory to both parties engaged save when the senhorina indulged in a little touch of waywardness and sent the poor officer back to his ship with a heavy heart for the express purpose of teaching him the extent of her power and the value of her favour  she overclouded him now and then just to make him the more ardently long for sunshine and to convince him that in the highest sense of the word he was a slave  to this bower then the senhorina returned with a sad heart and swollen eyes to indulge in vain regrets  her sorrows had overwhelmed her to such an extent that she failed to observe the fireflys salute  it was therefore with a look of genuine surprise and agitation that she suddenly beheld lieutenant lindsay who had availed himself of the first free moment striding up the little path that led to the bower  maraquita he exclaimed looking in amazement at the countenance of his ladylove which was what norsemen style begrutten  but maraquita was in no mood to be driven out of her humour even by her lover  i am miserable she said with vehemence clenching one of her little fists as though she meditated an assault on the lieutenantutterly absolutely inconsolably miserable  if lindsay had entertained any doubt regarding the truth of her assertion it would have been dispelled by her subsequent conduct for she buried her face in a handkerchief and burst into tears  beloved adorable tender delicious maraquita were words which leapt into the lieutenants mind but he dare not utter them with his lips neither did he venture to clasp maraquitas waist with his left arm lay her pretty little head on his breast and smooth her luxuriant hair with his right hand though he felt almost irresistibly tempted so to do entirely from feelings of pity of coursefor the senhorina had hitherto permitted no familiarities beyond a gentle pressure of the hand on meeting and at parting  it is unnecessary to repeat all that the bashful though ardent man of war said to maraquita or all that maraquita said to the man of war how ignoring the celestial orbs and domestic economy she launched out into a rhapsodical panegyric of azinte told how the poor slave had unburdened her heart to her about her handsome young husband and her darling little boy in the far off interior from whom she had been rudely torn and whom she never expected to see again and how she maraquita had tried to console azinte by telling her that there was a heaven where good people might hope to meet again even though they never met on earth and a great deal more besides to all of which the earnest lieutenant sought to find words wherewith to express his pity and sympathy but found them not though he was at no loss to find words to tell the queen of his soul that in the peculiar circumstances of the case and all things considered his love for her maraquita was tenfold more intense than it had ever been before  foolish boy said the senhorina smiling through her tears what is the use of telling me that  can it do any good to azinte  not much im afraid replied the lieutenant  well then dont talk nonsense but tell me what i am to do to recover my little maid  it is impossible for me to advise said the lieutenant with a perplexed look  but you must advise said maraquita with great decision  well i will try  how long is it since azinte was taken away from you  about two weeks  you say that marizano was the purchaser  do you know to what part of the coast he intended to convey her  how should i know  i have only just heard of the matter from my father  well then you must try to find out from your father all that he knows about marizano and his movements  that is the first step  after that i will consider what can be done  yes senhor said maraquita rising suddenly you must consider quickly and you must act at once for you must not come here again until you bring me news of azinte  poor lindsay who knew enough of the girls character to believe her to be thoroughly in earnest protested solemnly that he would do his utmost  all that maraquita could ascertain from her father was that marizano meant to proceed to kilwa the great slavedepot of the coast there to collect a large cargo of slaves and proceed with them to arabia whenever he had reason to believe that the british cruisers were out of the way  this was not much to go upon but the senhorina was as unreasonable as were the egyptians of old when they insisted on the israelites making bricks without straw  he was unexpectedly helped out of his dilemma by captain romer who called him into his cabin that same evening told him that he had obtained information of the movements of slavers which induced him to think it might be worth while to watch the coast to the northward of cape dalgado and bade him prepare for a cruise in charge of the cutter adding that the steamer would soon follow and keep them in view  with a lightened heart lindsay went off to prepare and late that night the cutter quietly pulled away from the fireflys side with a wellarmed crew and provisioned for a short cruise  their object was to proceed as stealthily as possible along the coast therefore they kept inside of islands as much as possible and cruised about a good deal at nights always sleeping on board the boat as the lowlying coast was very unhealthy but landing occasionally to obtain water and to take a survey of the sea from convenient heights  early one morning as they were sailing with a very light breeze between two small islands a vessel was seen looming through the haze not far from shore  jackson one of the men who has been introduced to the reader at an earlier part of this narrative was the first to observe the strangers  its a brig he said i can make out her royals  no its a barque said the coxswain  a little midshipman named midgley differed from both and said it was a large dhow for he could make out the top of its lateen sail  whatever it is well give chase said lindsay ordering the men to put out the oars and give way the sail being of little use  in a few minutes the haze cleared sufficiently to prove that midgley was right  at the same time it revealed to those on board the dhow that they were being chased by the boat of a manofwar  the little wind that blew at the time was insufficient to enable the dhow to weather a point just ahead of her and the cutter rowed down on her so fast that it was evidently impossible for her to escape  seeing this the commander of the dhow at once ran straight for the shore  before the boat could reach her she was among the breakers on the bar which were so terrible at that part of the coast as to render landing in a small boat quite out of the question  in a few minutes the dhow was hurled on the beach and began to break up while her crew and cargo of slaves swarmed into the sea and tried to gain the shore  it seemed to those in the boat that some hundreds of negroes were struggling at one time in the seething foam  we must risk it and try to save some of the poor wretches cried lindsay give way lads give way  the boat shot in amongst the breakers and was struck by several seas in succession and nearly swamped ere it reached the shore  but they were too late to save many of the drowning  most of the strongest of the slaves had gained the shore and taken to the hills in wild terror under the impression so carefully instilled into them by the arabs that the only object the englishmen had in view was to catch cook and eat them the rest were drowned with the exception of two men and seven little children varying from five to eight years of age who were found crawling on the beach in such a state of emaciation that they could not follow their companions into the bush  they tried however in their own feeble helpless way to avoid capture and the terrible fate which they thought awaited them  these were soon lifted tenderly into the boat  here jackson cried lindsay lifting one of the children in his strong arms and handing it to the sailor carry that one very carefully she seems to be almost gone  god help her poor poor child  there was good cause for lindsays pity for the little girl was so thin that every bone in her body was sticking outher elbow and kneejoints being the largest parts of her shrunken limbs and it was found that she could not rise or even stretch herself out in consequence as was afterwards ascertained of her having been kept for many days in the dhow in a sitting posture with her knees doubled up against her face indeed most of the poor little things captured were found to be more or less stiffened from the same cause  an arab interpreter had been sent with lindsay but he turned out to be so incapable that it was scarcely possible to gain any information from him  he was either stupid in reality or pretended to be so  the latter supposition is not improbable for many of the interpreters furnished to the menofwar on that coast were found to be favourable to the slavers insomuch that they have been known to mislead those whom they were paid to serve  with great difficulty the cutter was pulled through the surf  that afternoon the firefly hove in sight and took the rescued slaves on board  next day two boats from the steamer chased another dhow on shore but with even less result than before for the whole of the slaves escaped to the hills  on the day following however a large dhow was captured with about a hundred and fifty slaves on board all of whom were rescued and the dhow destroyed  the dhows which were thus chased or captured were all regular and undisguised slavers  their owners were openly engaged in what they knew was held to be piracy alike by the portuguese the sultan of zanzibar and the english  they were exporting slaves from africa to arabia and persia which is an illegal species of traffic  in dealing with these no difficulty was experienced except the difficulty of catching them when caught the dhows were invariably destroyed and the slaves set freethat is to say carried to those ports where they might be set free with safety  but there were two other sorts of traffickers in the bodies and souls of human beings who were much more difficult to deal with  there were first the legal slavetraders namely the men who convey slaves by sea from one part of the sultan of zanzibars dominions to another  this kind of slavery was prosecuted under the shelter of what we have already referred to as a domestic institution  it involved as we have said before brutality injustice cruelty theft murder and extermination but being a domestic institution of zanzibar it was held to be legal and the british government have recognised and tolerated it by treaty for a considerable portion of this century  it is however but justice to ourselves to say that our government entered into the treaty with the view of checking limiting and mitigating the evils of the slavetrade  we have erred in recognising any form of slavery no matter how humane our object wasone proof of which is that we have by our interference unintentionally increased the evils of slavery instead of abating them  it is worth while remarking here that slavery is also a domestic institution in arabia and persia  if it be right that we should not interfere with the zanzibar institution why should we interfere with that of arabia or persia  our treaty appears to have been founded on the principle that we ought to respect domestic institutions  we maintain a squadron on the east coast of africa to stop the flow of africans to the latter countries while we permit the flow by treaty as well as by practice to the former  is this consistent  the only difference between the two cases is one of distance not of principle  but to return to our pointthe legal traders  in consequence of the sultans dominions lying partly on an island and partly on the mainland his domestic institution necessitates boats and in order to distinguish between his boats and the pirates there is a particular season fixed in which he may carry his slaves by sea from one part of his dominions to another and each boat is furnished with papers which prove it to be a legal trader  this is the point on which the grand fallacy of our interference hinges  the domestic institution would be amply supplied by about 4000 slaves a year  the socalled legal traders are simply legalised deceivers who transport not fewer than 30000 slaves a year it must be borne in mind that these 30000 represent only a portionthe zanzibar portionof the great african slavetrade  from the portuguese settlements to the south and from the north by way of egypt the export of negroes as slaves is larger  it is estimated that the total number of human beings enslaved on the east and northeast coast of africa is about 70000 a year  as all authorities agree in the statement that at the lowest estimate only one out of every five captured survives to go into slavery this number represents a loss to africa of 350000 human beings a year  they leave zanzibar with full cargoes continually with far more than is required for what we may term homeconsumption nevertheless correct papers are furnished to them by the sultan which protects them from british cruisers within the prescribed limits namely between cape dalgado and lamoo a line of coast about 1500 miles in extent  but it is easy for them to evade the cruisers in these wide seas and extensive coasts and the value of black ivory is so great that the loss of a few is but a small matter  on reaching the northern limits the legal traders become pirates  they run to the northward and take their chance of being captured by cruisers  the reason of all this is very obvious  the sultan receives nearly half a sovereign a head for each slave imported into zanzibar and our governments in time past have allowed themselves to entertain the belief that by treaty the sultan could be induced to destroy this the chief source of his revenue  surely it is not too much to say that great britain ought to enter into no treaty whatever in regard to slavery excepting such as shall provide for the absolute total and immediate extirpation thereof by whatsoever name called  besides these two classes of slaversthe open professional pirates and the sneaking deceiving domestic slaversthere are the slavesmugglers  they are men who profess to be and actually are legal traders in ivory gum copal and other produce of africa  these fellows manage to smuggle two or three slaves each voyage to the black ivory markets under pretence that they form part of the crew of their dhows  it is exceedingly difficult almost impossible for the officers of our cruisers to convict these smugglersto distinguish between slaves and crews consequently immense numbers of slaves are carried off to the northern ports in this manner  sometimes these dhows carry arab or other passengers and when there are so many slaves on board that it would be obviously absurd to pretend that they formed part of the crew the owner dresses the poor wretches up in the habiliments that come most readily to hand and passes them off as the wives or servants of these passengers  any one might see at a glance that the stupid silent timidlooking creatures who have had almost every human element beaten out of them are nothing of the sort but there is no means of proving them other than they are represented to be  if an interpreter were to ask them they would be ready to swear anything that their owner had commanded hence the cruisers are deceived in every wayin many ways besides those now mentionedand our philanthropic intentions are utterly thwarted for the rescuing and setting free of 1000 or 2000 negroes a year out of the 30000 annually exported is not an adequate result for our great expense in keeping a squadron on the coast especially when we consider that hundreds probably thousands of slaves perish amid horrible sufferings caused by the efforts of the manstealers to avoid our cruisers  these would probably not lose their lives and the entire body of slaves would suffer less if we did not interfere at all  from this we do not argue that noninterference would be best but that as our present system of repression does not effectively accomplish what is aimed at it ought to be changed  what the change should be many wise and able men have stated  their opinion we cannot quote here but one thing taught to us by past experience is clear we cannot cure the slavetrade by merely limiting it  our motto in regard to slavery ought to betotal and immediate extinction everywhere    chapter seventeen  strong measures lead to unexpected discoveries  im terribly worried and perplexed said lieutenant lindsay one afternoon to midshipman midgley as they were creeping along the coast in the neighbourhood of cape dalgado  why so inquired the middy  because i can learn nothing whatever about the movements of marizano replied the lieutenant  i have not spoken to you about this man hitherto becausebecausethat is to saythe fact is it wasnt worth while seeing that you know no more about him than i do perhaps not so much  but i cant help thinking that we might have learned something about him by this time only our interpreter is such an unmitigated ass he seems to understand nothingto pick up nothing  indeed exclaimed the midshipman im surprised to hear you say so because i heard suliman whispering last night with that halfcaste fellow whom we captured along with the other niggers and i am confident that he mentioned the name of marizano several times  did he  well now the rascal invariably looks quite blank when i mention marizanos name and shakes his head as if he had never heard of it before  couldnt you intimidate him into disgorging a little of his knowledge suggested midgley with an arch look  i have thought of that replied lindsay with a frown  come its not a bad idea ill try  hallo  suliman come aft i want you  lieutenant lindsay was one of those men who are apt to surprise people by the precipitancy of their actions  he was not indeed hasty but when his mind was made up he was not slow in proceeding to action  it was so on the present occasion to the consternation of suliman who had hitherto conceived him to be rather a soft easygoing man  suliman he said in a low but remarkably firm tone of voice you know more about marizano than you choose to tell me  now he continued gazing into the arabs cold grey eyes while he pulled a revolver from his coatpocket and cocked it i intend to make you tell me all you know about him or to blow your brains out  he moved the pistol gently as he spoke and placed his forefinger on the trigger  i not know began suliman who evidently did not believe him to be quite in earnest but before the words had well left his lips the drum of his left ear was almost split by the report of the pistol and a part of his turban was blown away  you dont know very well said lindsay recocking the pistol and placing the cold muzzle of it against the arabs yellow nose  this was too much for suliman  he grew pale and suddenly fell on his knees  oh stop nono not fire me tell you bout im  good get up and do so said the lieutenant uncocking the revolver and returning it to his pocket and be sure that you tell me all else your life wont be worth the value of the damaged turban on your head  with a good deal of trepidation the alarmed interpreter thereupon gave lindsay all the information he possessed in regard to the slaver which amounted to this that he had gone to kilwa where he had collected a band of slaves sufficient to fill a large dhow with which he intended in two days more to sail in company with a fleet of slavers for the north  does he intend to touch at zanzibar inquired lindsay  me tink no replied the interpreter got many pritty garlsgo straight for persia  on hearing this the lieutenant put the cutter about and sailed out to sea in search of the firefly which he knew could not at that time be at any great distance from the shore  he found her sooner than he had expected and to his immense astonishment as well as joy one of the first persons he beheld on stepping over the side of his ship was azinte  you have captured marizano sir i see he said to captain romer  not the scoundrel himself but one of his dhows replied the captain he had started for the northern ports with two heavilyladen vessels we discovered him five days ago and fortunately just beyond the protected water so that he was a fair and lawful prize  the first of his dhows being farthest out from shore we captured but the other commanded by himself succeeded in running ashore and he escaped with nearly all his slavesonly a few of the women and children being drowned in the surf  and now as our cargo of poor wretches is pretty large i shall run for the seychelles  after landing them i shall return as fast as possible to intercept a few more of these pirates  to the seychelles muttered the lieutenant to himself as he went below with an expression on his countenance something between surprise and despair  poor lindsay  his mind was so taken up with and confused by the constant and obtrusive presence of the senhorina maraquita that the particular turn which affairs had taken had not occurred to him although that turn was quite natural and by no means improbable marizano with azinte on board of one of his piratical dhows was proceeding to the north  captain romer with his warsteamer was on the lookout for piratical dhows  what more natural than that the captain should fall in with the pirate  but lieutenant lindsays mind had been so filled with maraquita that it seemed to be for the time incapable of holding more than one other ideathat idea was the fulfilment of maraquitas commands to obtain information as to her lost azinte  to this he had of late devoted all his powers happy in the thought that it fell in with and formed part of his duty to his queen and country as well as to the queen of his soul  to rescue azinte from marizano seemed to the bold lieutenant an easy enough matter but to rescue her from his own captain and send her back into slavery ass that i am he exclaimed not to have thought of this before  of course she can never be returned to maraquita and small comfort it will be to the senhorina to be told that her favourite is free in the seychelles islands and utterly beyond her reach unless she chooses to go there and stay with her  overwhelmed with disgust at his own stupidity and at the utter impossibility of doing anything to mend matters the unfortunate lieutenant sat down to think and the result of his thinking was that he resolved at all events to look well after azinte and see that she should be cared for on her arrival at the seychelles  among the poor creatures who had been rescued from marizanos dhow were nearly a hundred children in such a deplorable condition that small hopes were entertained of their reaching the island alive  their young lives however proved to be tenacious  experienced though their hardy rescuers were in rough and tumble work they had no conception what these poor creatures had already gone through and therefore formed a mistaken estimate of their powers of endurance  eightythree of them reached the seychelles alive  they were placed under the care of a warmhearted missionary who spared no pains for their restoration to health but despite his utmost efforts forty of these eventually died their little frames had been whipped and starved and tried to such an extent that recovery was impossible  to the care of this missionary lieutenant lindsay committed azinte telling him as much of her sad story as he was acquainted with  the missionary willingly took charge of her and placed her as a nurse in the temporary hospital which he had instituted for the little ones above referred to  here azinte proved herself to be a most tender affectionate and intelligent nurse to the poor children for whom she appeared to entertain particular regard and here on the departure of the firefly shortly afterwards lindsay left her in a state of comfort usefulness and comparative felicity    chapter eighteen  describes some of the doings of yoosoof and his men in procuring black ivory from the interior of africa  a dirty shop in a filthy street in the unhealthy town of zanzibar is the point to which we now beg leave to conduct our readerwhom we also request to leap in a free and easy way over a few months of time  it is not for the sake of the shop that we make this leap but for the purpose of introducing the two men who at the time we write of sat over their grog in a small backroom connected with that shop  still the shop itself is not altogether unworthy of notice  it is what the americans call a storea place where you can purchase almost every article that the wants of man have called into being  the prevailing smells are of oil sugar tea molasses paint and tar a compound which confuses the discriminating powers of the nose and on the principle that extremes meet removes the feeling of surprise that ought to be aroused by discovering that these odours are in close connexion with haberdashery and hardware  there are enormous casks puncheons and kegs on the floor bales on the shelves indescribable confusion in the corners preserved meat tins piled to the ceiling with dust and dirt encrusting everything  the walls beams and rafters appear to be held together by means of innumerable cobwebs  hosts of flies fatten on without diminishing the stock and squadrons of cockroaches career over the earthen floor  in the little backroom of this shop sat the slavedealer yoosoof in company with the captain of an english ship which lay in the harbour  smoke from the captains pipe filled the little den to such an extent that yoosoof and his friend were not so clearly distinguishable as might have been desired  youre all a set of falsehearted wrongheaded lowminded scoundrels said the plainspoken captain accompanying each asseveration with a puff so violent as to suggest the idea that his remarks were roundshot and his mouth a cannon  the briton was evidently not in a complimentary mood  it was equally evident that yoosoof was not in a touchy vein for he smiled the slightest possible smile and shrugged his shoulders  he had business to transact with the captain which was likely to result very much to his advantage and yoosoof was not the man to let feelings stand in the way of business  moreover pursued the captain in a gruff voice the trade in slaves is illegally conducted in one sense namely that it is largely carried on by british subjects  how you make that out asked yoosoof  how why easy enough  arent the richest men in zanzibar the banyans and dont these banyans who number about 17000 of your population supply you arabs with money to carry on the accursed slavetrade  and aint these banyans indian merchantssubjects of great britain  yoosoof shrugged his shoulders again and smiled  and dont these opulent rascals continued the briton love their ease as well as their money and when they want to increase the latter without destroying the former dont they make advances to the like of you and get 100 per cent out of you for every dollar advanced  yoosoof nodded his head decidedly at this and smiled again  well then aint the whole lot of you a set of mean scoundrels said the captain fiercely  yoosoof did not smile at this he even looked for a moment as if he were going to resent it but it was only for a moment  selfinterest came opportunely to his aid and made him submissive  what can we do he asked after a short silence  you knows what the sultan say other day to one british officer if you stop slavetrade you will ruin zanzibar  we mus not do that  zanzibar mus not be ruin  why not demanded the captain with a look of supreme contempt what if zanzibar was ruined  look here now yoosoof your dirty little islandthe whole island observeis not quite the size of my own scotch county of lanark  its population is short of 250000 all toldscarce equal to the half of the population of lanarkcomposed of semibarbarians and savages  thats one side of the question  heres the other side africa is one of the four quarters of the earth with millions of vigorous niggers and millions of acres of splendid land and no end of undeveloped resources and you have the impudence to tell me that an enormous lump of this land must be converted into a desert and something like 150000 of its best natives be drawn off annuallyfor whatfor what repeated the sailor bringing his fist down on the table before him with such force that the glasses danced on it and the dust flew up for what  i say for a paltry pitiful island ruled by a sham sultan without army or navy and with little money save what he gets by slavedealing an island which has no influence for good on the world morally religiously or socially and with little commercially though it has much influence for evil an island which has helped the portuguese to lock up the east coast of africa for centuries an island which would not be missedsave as a removed curseif it were sunk this night to the bottom of the sea and all its selfish sensual slavedealing population swept entirely off the face of the earth  the captain had risen and dashed his pipe to atoms on the floor in his indignation as he made these observations  he now made an effort to control himself and then sitting down he continuedjust think yoosoof youre a sharp man of business as i know to my cost  you can understand a thing in a commercial point of view  just try to look at it thus on the one side of the worlds account you have zanzibar sunk with all its banyan and arab population we wont sink the niggers poor wretches  well suppose them saved along with the consuls missionaries and suchlike  well thats a loss of somewhere about 83000 scoundrelsa gain we might call it but for the sake of argument well call it a loss  on the other side of the account you have 30000 niggersfair average specimens of humanitysaved from slavery besides something like 150000 more saved from death by war and starvation the results of the slavetrade 83000 from 150000 leaves 67000  the loss you see would be more than wiped off and a handsome balance left at the worlds credit the very first year  to say nothing of the opening up of legitimate commerce to one of the richest countries on earth and the consequent introduction of christianity  the captain paused to take breath  yoosoof shrugged his shoulders and a brief silence ensued which was happily broken not by a recurrence to the question of slavery but by the entrance of a slave  he came in search of yoosoof for the purpose of telling him that his master wished to speak with him  as the slaves master was one of the wealthy banyans just referred to yoosoof rose at once and apologising to the captain for quitting him so hurriedly left that worthy son of neptune to cool his indignation in solitude  passing through several dirty streets the slave led the slaver to a better sort of house in a more salubrious or rather less pestilential part of the town  he was ushered into the presence of an elderly man of quiet unobtrusive aspect  yoosoof said the banyan in arabic i have been considering the matter about which we had some conversation yesterday and i find that it will be convenient for me to make a small venture  i can let you have three thousand dollars  on the old terms asked yoosoof  on the old terms replied the merchant  will you be ready to start soon  yoosoof said that he would that he had already completed the greater part of his preparations and that he hoped to start for the interior in a week or two  that is well i hope you may succeed in doing a good deal of business said the merchant with an amiable nod and smile which might have led an ignorant onlooker to imagine that yoosoofs business in the interior was work of a purely philanthropic nature  there is another affair which it has struck me may lie in your way continued the merchant  the british consul is i am told anxious to find some one who will undertake to make inquiries in the interior about some englishmen who are said to have been captured by the black fellows and made slaves of  does the consul know what tribe has captured them asked yoosoof  i think not but as he offers five hundred dollars for every lost white man who shall be recovered and brought to the coast alive i thought that you might wish to aid him  true said yoosoof musing true i will go and see him  accordingly the slavedealer had an interview with the consul during which he learned that there was no absolute certainty of any englishmen having been captured  it was only a vague rumour nevertheless it was sufficiently probable to warrant the offer of five hundred dollars to any one who should effect a rescue therefore yoosoof having occasion to travel into the interior at any rate undertook to make inquiries  he was also told that two englishmen had not long before purchased an outfit and started off with the intention of proceeding to the interior by way of the zambesi river and they the consul said might possibly be heard of by him near the regions to which he was bound but these he suggested could not be the men who were reported as missing  of course yoosoof had not the most remote idea that these were the very englishmen whom he himself had captured on the coast for after parting from them abruptly as described in a former chapter he had ceased to care or think about them and besides was ignorant of the fact that they had been to zanzibar  yoosoofs own particular business required a rather imposing outfit first of all he purchased and packed about 600 pounds worth of beads of many colours cloth of different kinds thick brass wire and a variety of cheap trinkets such as black men and women are fond of for yoosoof was an honest trader and paid his way when he found it suitable to do so  he likewise hired a hundred men whom he armed with guns powder and ball for yoosoof was also a dishonest trader and fought his way when that course seemed most desirable  with this imposing caravan he embarked in a large dhow sailed for the coast landed at kilwa and proceeded into the interior of africa  it was a long and toilsome journey over several hundred miles of exceedingly fertile and beautiful country eminently suited for the happy abode of natives  but yoosoof and his class who traded in black ivory had depopulated it to such an extent that scarce a human being was to be seen all the way  there were plenty of villages but they were in ruins and acres of cultivated ground with the weeds growing rank where the grain had once flourished  further on in the journey near the end of it there was a change the weeds and grain grew together and did battle but in most places the weeds gained the victory  it was quite evident that the whole land had once been a rich garden teeming with human lifesavage life no doubt still not so savage but that it could manage to exist in comparative enjoyment and multiply  yoosoofpassed through a hundred and fifty miles of this land it was a huge grave which appropriately enough was profusely garnished with human bones see livingstones tributaries of the zambesi page 391  at last the slavetrader reached lands which were not utterly forsaken  entering a village one afternoon he sent a present of cloth and beads to the chief and after a few preliminary ceremonies announced that he wished to purchase slaves  the chief who was a finelooking young warrior said that he had no men women or children to sell except a few criminals to whom he was welcome at a very low priceabout two or three yards of calico each there were also one or two orphan children whose parents had died suddenly and to whom no one in the village could lay claim  it was true that these poor orphans had been adopted by various families who might not wish to part with them but no matter the chiefs command was law  yoosoof might have the orphans also for a very small suma yard of calico perhaps  but nothing would induce the chief to compel any of his people to part with their children and none of the people seemed desirous of doing so  the slavetrader therefore adopted another plan  he soon managed to ascertain that the chief had an old grudge against a neighbouring chief in the course of conversation he artfully stirred up the slumbering illwill and carefully fanned it into a flame without appearing to have any such end in view  when the iron was sufficiently hot he struck it supplied the chief with guns and ammunition and even as a great favour offered to lend him a few of his own men in order that he might make a vigorous attack on his old enemy  the device succeeded to perfection  war was begun without any previous declaration prisoners were soon brought innot only men but women and children  the first were coupled together with heavy slavesticks which were riveted to their necks the latter were attached to each other with ropes and thus yoosoof in a few days was enabled to proceed on his journey with a goodly drove of black cattle behind him  this occurred not far from lake nyassa which he intended should be his headquarters for a time while his men under a new leader whom he expected to meet there should push their victorious arms farther into the interior  on reaching the shores of the noble lake he found several birds of the same feather with himselfarabs engaged in the same trade  he also found his old friend and trusty ally marizano  this gratified him much for he was at once enabled to hand over the charge of the expedition to his lieutenant and send him forth on his mission  that same eveninga lovely and comparatively cool oneyoosoof and the halfcaste sauntered on the margin of the lake listening to the sweet melody of the free and happy birds and watching the debarkation from a large boat of a band of miserable slaves who had been captured or purchased on the other side  now marizano said yoosoof addressing the halfcaste in his native tongue i do not intend to cumber you with cloth or beads on this expedition  i have already spent a good deal in the purchase of slaves who are now in my barracoon and i think it will be both cheaper and easier to make up the rest of the gang by means of powder and lead  it is lighter to carry and more effectual remarked marizano with a nod of approval  true returned yoosoof and quicker  will a hundred men and guns suffice  eighty are enough to conquer any of the bow and spear tribes of this region replied the halfcaste carelessly  good continued yoosoof  then you shall start tomorrow  the tribes beyond this lake are not yet afraid of usthanks to the mad englishman livingstone who has opened up the country and spread the information that white men are the friends of the black and hate slavery livingstone tells us that he found on ascending the shire river that the portuguese slavetraders had followed closely in the footsteps of his previous discoveries and passed themselves off as his friends by which means they were successful in gaining the confidence of the natives whom they afterwards treacherously murdered or enslaved  you may try to pass yourself off as a white man though your face is not so white as might be desired however you can comfort yourself with the knowledge that it is whiter than your heart  the arab smiled and glanced at his lieutenant  marizano smiled bowed in acknowledgment of the compliment and replied that he believed himself to be second to no one except his employer in that respect  well then continued yoosoof you must follow up the discoveries of this englishman give out that you are his friend and have come there for the same purposes and when you have put them quite at their ease commence a brisk trade with themfor which purpose you may take with you just enough of cloth and beads to enable you to carry out the deception  for the rest i need not instruct you know what to do as well as i  marizano approved heartily of this plan and assured his chief that his views should be carried out to his entire satisfaction  but there is still another point said yoosoof on which i have to talk  it appears that there are some white men who have been taken prisoners by one of the interior tribesi know not whichfor the finding of whom the british consul at zanzibar has offered me five hundred dollars  if you can obtain information about these men it will be well  if you can find and rescue them it will be still better and you shall have a liberal share of the reward  while the arab was speaking the halfcastes visage betrayed a slight degree of surprise  white men he said pulling up his sleeve and showing a gunshot wound in his arm which appeared to be not very old  a white man inflicted that not long ago and not very far from the spot on which we stand  i had vowed to take the life of that white man if we should ever chance to meet but if it is worth five hundred dollars i may be tempted to spare it  he laughed lightly as he spoke and then added with a thoughtful lookbut i dont see how these menthere were two of them if not morecan be prisoners because when i came across them they were wellarmed well supplied and well attended else you may be sure they had not given me this wound and freed my slaves  but the scoundrels who were with me at the time were cowards  you are right said yoosoof  the white men you met i heard of at zanzibar  they cannot be the prisoners we are asked to search for they have not yet been long enough away i should think to have come by any mischance and the white men who are said to be lost have been talked about in zanzibar for a long time  however make diligent inquiries because the promise is that the five hundred dollars shall be ours if we rescue any white man no matter who he may chance to be and now i shall show you the cattle i have obtained on the way up  the barracoon to which the arab led his lieutenant was a space enclosed by a strong and high stockade in which slaves were kept under guard until a sufficient number should be secured to form a gang wherewith to start for the coast  at the entrance stood a savagelooking portuguese halfcaste armed with a gun  inside there was an assortment of yoosoofs black ivory  it was in comparatively good condition at that time not having travelled far and as it was necessary to keep it up to a point of strength sufficient to enable it to reach the coast it was pretty well fed except in the case of a few rebellious articles  there were however specimens of damaged goods even there  several of the orphans who had become yoosoofs property although sprightly enough when first purchased had not stood even the short journey to the lake so well as might have been expected  they had fallen off in flesh to such an extent that yoosoof was induced to remark to marizano as they stood surveying them that he feared they would never reach the coast alive  that one now he said pointing to a little boy who was tightly wedged in the midst of the group of slaves and sat on the ground with his face resting on his knees is the most troublesome piece of goods i have had to do with since i began business and it seems to me that i am going to lose him after all  whats the matter with him asked the halfcaste  nothing particular only he is a delicate boy  at first i refused him but he is so wellmade though delicate and such a goodlooking child and so spirited that i decided to take him but he turns out to be too spirited  nothing that i can do will tame himoh that wont do it said yoosoof observing that marizano raised the switch he carried in his hand with a significant action i have beaten him till there is scarcely a sound inch of skin on his whole body but its of no use  ho stand up called yoosoof letting the lash of his whip fall lightly on the boys shoulders  there was however no response the arab therefore repeated the order and laid the lash across the childs bare back with a degree of force that would have caused the stoutest man to wince still the boy did not move  somewhat surprised yoosoof pushed his way towards him seized him by the hair and threw back his head  the arab left him immediately and remarked in a quiet tone that he should have no more trouble with himhe was dead  whats the matter with that fellow asked marizano pointing to a man who was employed in constantly rolling up a bit of wet clay and applying it to his left eye  ah hes another of these unmanageable fellows replied yoosoof  i have been trying to tame him by starvation  the other morning he fell on his knees before the man who guards the barracoon and entreated him to give him food  the guard is a rough fellow and had been put out of temper lately by a good many of the slaves  instead of giving him food he gave him a blow in the eye which burst the ball of it and of course has rendered him worthless but he wont trouble us long  in another place a woman crouched on the ground having something wrapped in leaves which she pressed to her dried breast  it was the body of a child to which she had recently given birth in that place of woe  leaving his cringing and terrified goods to the guardian of the barracoon the arab returned to his tent beside the beautiful lake and there while enjoying the aroma of flowers and the cool breeze and the genial sunshine and the pleasant influences which god has scattered with bountiful hand over that luxuriant portion of the earth calmly concerted with marizano the best method by which he could bring inconceivable misery on thousands of its wretched inhabitants    chapter nineteen  tells of misfortunes that befell our wanderers of familiar toys under new aspects etcetera  when harold seadrift and disco lillihammer were stopped in their journey as related in a former chapter by the sudden illness of the bold seaman an event was impending over them which effectually overturned their plans  this was the sudden descent of a band of armed natives who had been recently driven from their homes by a slaving party  the slavers had taken them by surprise during the night set their huts on fire captured their women and children and slaughtered all the men excepting those who sought and found safety in flight  it was those who had thus escaped that chanced to come upon the camp of our travellers one evening about sunset  disco was recovering from his attack of fever at the time though still weak  harold was sitting by his couch of leaves in the hut which had been erected for him on the first day of the illness  jumbo was cutting up a piece of flesh for supper and antonio was putting the kettle on the fire  the rest of the party were away in the woods hunting  no guard was kept consequently the savages came down on them like a thunderbolt and found them quite unprepared to resist even if resistance had been of any use  at first their captors bitterly infuriated by their recent losses proposed to kill their prisoners without delay by means of the most excruciating tortures that they could invent but from some unknown cause changed their minds coupled harold and disco together by means of two slavesticks tied antonio and jumbo with ropes and drove them away  so suddenly was the thing done and so effectually that disco was far from the camp before he could realise that what had occurred was a fact and not one of the wild feverish dreams that had beset him during his illness  the natives would not listen to the earnest explanation of antonio that harold and disco were englishmen and haters of slavery  they scowled as they replied that the same had been said by the slavers who had attacked their village from which remark it would seem that yoosoof was not quite the originator of that device to throw the natives off their guard  the portuguese of tette on the zambesi had also thought of and acted on it  fortunately it was as we have said near sunset when the capture was made and before it became quite dark the band encamped else must poor disco have succumbed to weakness and fatigue  the very desperation of his circumstances however seemed to revive his strength for next morning he resumed his journey with some hope of being able to hold out the continued protestations and assurances of antonio also had the effect of inducing their captors to remove the heavy slavesticks from the necks of harold and disco though they did not unbind their wrists thus were they led further into the country they knew not whither for several days and nights and at last reached a large village where they were all thrust into a hut and left to their meditations while their captors went to palaver with the chief man of the place  this chief proved to be a furthersighted man than the men of the tribe who had captured the englishmen  his name was yambo  he had heard of dr livingstone and had met with men of other tribes who had seen and conversed with the great traveller  thus being of a thoughtful and inquiring disposition he had come to understand enough of the good white mans sentiments to guard him from being imposed on by pretended christians  yambos name signified how are you and was probably bestowed on him because of a strongly benevolent tendency to greet friend and stranger alike with a hearty how dee do sort of expression of face and tone of voice  he was a tall grave man with a commanding firm look and withal a dash of childlike humour and simplicity  on hearing his visitors remarks about their captives he at once paid them a visit and a few leading questions put to harold through antonio convinced him that the prisoners were true men  he therefore returned to his black visitors told them that he had perfect confidence in the good faith of the white men and said that he meant to take charge of them  he then entertained his black brothers hospitably gave them a few presents and sent them on their way  this done he returned to his guests and told them that they were free that their captors were gone and that they might go where they pleased but that it would gratify him much if they would consent to spend some time hunting with him in the neighbourhood of his village  now said disco after yambo left them this is wot i call the most uncommon fix that ever wos got into by man since adam an eve began housekeepin in the garden of eden  im not quite sure replied harold with a rueful look that it is absolutely the worst fix but it is bad enough  the worst of it is that this yambo has let these rascals off with all our firearms and campequipage so that we are absolutely helplessmight as well be prisoners for we cant quit this village in such circumstances  wots wuss than that to my mind sir is that here we are at sea in the heart of afriky without chart quadrant compass or rudder an no more idea of our whereabouts than one o them spider monkeys that grins among the trees  howsever were in luck to fall into the hands of a friendly chief so like these same monkeys we must grin an bear it only i cant help feelin a bit cast down at the loss of our messmates i fear theres no chance of their findin us  not the least chance in the world i should say returned harold they could not guess in which direction we had gone and unless they had hit on the right road at first every step they took afterwards would only widen the distance between us  its lucky i was beginnin to mend before we was catched said disco feeling the muscles of his legs true i aint much to boast of yet but im improvin  that is more than i can say for myself returned harold with a sigh as he passed his hand across his forehead i feel as if this last push through the woods in the hot sun and the weight of that terrible slavestick had been almost too much for me  disco looked earnestly and anxiously into the face of his friend  wot asked he does you feel  i can scarcely tell replied harold with a faint smile  oh i suppose im a little knocked up thats all  a nights rest will put me all right  so i thought myself but i wos wrong said disco  lets hear wot your feelins is sir im as good as any doctor now i am in regard to symptoms  well i feel a sort of alloverishness a kind of lassitude and sleepiness with a slight headache and a dull pain which appears to be creeping up my spine  youre in for it sir said disco  its lucky you have always carried the physic in your pockets cause youll need it an its lucky too that i am here and well enough to return tit for tat and nurse you cause youll have that ere pain in your spine creep up your back and round your ribs till it lays hold of yer shoulders where itll stick as if it had made up its mind to stay there for ever an a day  arter that youll get cold an shivering like iceoh doesnt i know it wellan then hot as fire with heavy head an swimming eyes an twisted sight an confusion of  hold hold cried harold laughing if you go on in that way i shall have more than my fair share of it  pray stop and leave me a little to find out for myself  well sir take a purge and turn in at once thats my advice  ill dose you with quinine tomorrow mornin first thing said disco rising and proceeding forthwith to arrange a couch in a corner of the hut which yambo had assigned them  harold knew well enough that his follower was right  he took his advice without delay and next morning found himself little better than a child both physically and mentally for the disease not only prostrated his great strengthas it had that of his equally robust companionbut at a certain stage induced delirium during which he talked the most ineffable nonsense that his tongue could pronounce or his brain conceive  poor disco who of course had been unable to appreciate the extent of his own delirious condition began to fear that his leaders mind was gone for ever and jumbo was so depressed by the unutterably solemn expression of the mariners once jovial countenance that he did not once show his teeth for a whole week save when engaged with meals  as for antonio his nature not being very sympathetic and his health being good he rather enjoyed the quiet life and good living which characterised the native village and secretly hoped that harold might remain on the sicklist for a considerable time to come  how long this state of affairs lasted we cannot tell for both harold and disco lost the correct record of time during their respective illnesses  up to that period they had remembered the days of the week in consequence of their habit of refraining from going out to hunt on sundays except when a dearth of meat in the larder rendered hunting a necessity  upon these sundays harolds conscience sometimes reproached him for having set out on his journey into africa without a bible  he whispered to himself at first and afterwards suggested to disco the excuse that his bible had been lost in the wreck of his fathers vessel and that perhaps there were no bibles to be purchased in zanzibar but his conscience was a troublesome one and refused to tolerate such bad reasoning reminding him reproachfully that he had made no effort whatever to obtain a bible at zanzibar  as time had passed and some of the horrors of the slavetrade had been brought under his notice many of the words of scripture leaped to his remembrance and the regret that he had not carried a copy with him increased  that touch of thoughtlessness so natural to the young and healthyto whom life has so far been only a garden of roseswas utterly routed by the stern and dreadful realities which had been recently enacted around him and just in proportion as he was impressed with the lies tyranny cruelty and falsehood of man so did his thoughtful regard for the truth and the love of god increase especially those truths that were most directly opposed to the traffic in human flesh such aslove your enemies seek peace with all men be kindly affectioned one to another whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you do ye even so to them  an absolute infidel he thought could not fail to perceive that a most blessed change would come over the face of africa if such principles prevailed among its inhabitants even in an extremely moderate degree  but to return the unfortunate travellers were now at sea altogether in regard to the sabbath as well as the day of the month  indeed their minds were not very clear as to the month itself  howsever said disco when this subject afterwards came to be discussed it dont matter much  wot is it that the scriptur sayssix days shalt thou labour an do all that thou hast to do but the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy god  in it thou shalt do no work  i wos used always to stick at that pint wen my poor mother was ateachin of me  never got past it  but its enough for present use anyhow for the orders is work six days an dont work the seventh werry good well begin today an call it monday well work for six days an wen the seventh day comes well call it sunday  if it aint the right day we cant help it moreover wots the odds  its the seventh day so that to us itll be the sabbath  but we anticipate  harold was stillat the beginning of this digressionin the delirium of fever though there were symptoms of improvement about him  one afternoon one of these symptoms was strongly manifested in a long profound slumber  while he slept disco sat on a low stool beside him busily engaged with a claspknife on some species of manufacture the nature of which was not apparent at a glance  his admirer jumbo was seated on a stool opposite gazing at him openmouthed with a countenance that reflected every passing feeling of his dusky bosom  both men were so deeply absorbed in their occupationdisco in his manufacture and jumbo in staring at discothat they failed for a considerable time to observe that harold had wakened suddenly though quietly and was gazing at them with a look of lazy easygoing surprise  the mariner kept up a running commentary on his work addressed to jumbo indeed but in a quiet interjectional manner that seemed to imply that he was merely soliloquising and did not want or expect a reply  its the most strornary notion jumbo between you and me and the post that i ever did see  now then this here bullethead wants a pair o eyes an a nose on it the mouthll do but its the mouth as is most troublesome for you niggers have got such wappin muzzlesits quite a caution as the yankees saya pauseon the whole however the nose is very difficult to manage on a flat surface cause wyif i leaves it quite flat it dont look like a nose an if i carves it out ever so little its too prominent for a nigger nose there aint that a good head jumbo  thus directly appealed to jumbo nodded his own head violently and showed his magnificent teeth from ear to ear gums included  disco laid down the flat piece of board which he had carved into the form of a human head and took up another piece which was rudely blocked out into the form of a human legboth leg and head being as large as life  now this limb jumbo continued disco slowly as he whittled away with the claspknife vigorously is much more troublesome than i would have expected for you niggers have got such abominably illshaped legs below the knee  theres such an unnatral bend forard o the shinbone an such a rediklous sticking out o the heel astarn dee see that a feller with white man notions has to make a study of it if he sets up for a artist in course if he dont set up for a artist any sort o shapell do for it dont affect the jumpin  ha there they go he exclaimed with a humorous smile at a hearty shout of laughter which was heard just outside the hut enjoyin the old un but its nothin to wot the noo unll be wen its finished  at this exhibition of amusement on the countenance of his friend jumbo threw back his head and again showed not only his teeth and gums but the entire inside of his mouth and chuckled softly from the region of his breastbone  im dreaming of course thought harold and shut his eyes  poor fellow he was very weak and the mere act of shutting his eyes induced a halfslumber  he awoke again in a few minutes and reopening his eyes beheld the two men still sitting and occupied as before  it is a wonderfully pertinacious dream thought harold  ill try to dissipate it  thinking thus he called out aloudi say disco  hallo thats uncommon like the old tones exclaimed the seaman dropping his knife and the leg of wood as he looked anxiously at his friend  what old tones asked harold  the tones of your voice said disco  have they changed so much of late inquired harold in surprise  have they  i should think they have just  wy you havent spoke like that sir forbut surelyare you better or is this ony another dodge o yer madness asked disco with a troubled look  ah  i suppose ive been delirious have i said harold with a faint smile  to this disco replied that he had not only been delirious but stark staring mad and expressed a very earnest hope that now he had got his senses hauled taut again hed belay them an make all fast for if he didnt it was his discos opinion that another breeze o the same kind would blow em all to ribbons  moreover continued disco firmly youre not to talk  i once nursed a messmate through a fever an i remember that the doctor wos werry partikler wen he began to come round in orderin him to hold his tongue an keep quiet  you are right disco  i will keep quiet but you must first tell me what you are about for it has roused my curiosity and i cant rest till i know  well sir ill tell you but dont go for to make no obsarvations on it  just keep your mouth shut an yer ears open an ill do all the jawin  well you must know soon after you wos took bad i felt as if id like some sort o okipation wen sittin here watchin of youjumbo an mes bin takin the watch time about for antony isnt able to hold a boy much less you wen you gits obstropolouswell sir i had took a sort o fancy for yambos youngest boy for hes a fine brave little shaver he is an i thought id make him some sort o toy an it struck me that the thing as ud please him most ud be a jumpinjack so i set to an made him one about a futt high  you never see such a face o joy as that youngster put on sir wen i took it to him an pulled the string  he give a little squeak of delight he did tuk it in his hands an ran home to show it to his mother  well sir wot dee think the poor boy come back soon after blubberin an sobbin as natral as if hed bin an english boy an says he to tony says he fathers bin an took it away from me  i wos surprised at this an went right off to see about it an wen i come to yambos hut wot does i see but the chief pullin the string o the jumpinjack an grinnin an sniggerin like a bluefaced baboon in a passionhis wife likewise standin by holdin her sides wi laughin  well sir the moment i goes in up gits the chief an shouts for tony an tells him to tell me that i must make him a jumpinjack in course i says id do it with all the pleasure in life and he says that i must make it full size as big as hisself  i opened my eyes at this but he said he must have a thing that was fit for a mana chief so there was nothin for it but to set to work  an it wornt difficult to manage neither for they supplied me with slabs o timber an inch thick an i soon blocked out the body an limbs with a hatchet an polished em off with my knife and then put em together  wen the big jack wos all right yambo took it away for hed watched me all the time i wos at it an fixed it up to the branch of a tree an set to work  i never no i never did continued disco slapping his right thigh while jumbo grinned in sympathy see sitch a big baby as yambo became wen he got that monstrous jumpinjack into actionwith his courtiers all round him their faces blazin with surprise or conwulsed wi laughter  the chief hisself was too hard at work to laugh much  he could only glare an grin for big an strong though he is the jack wos so awful heavy that it took all his weight an muscle haulin on the rope which okipied the place o the string that were used to  haul away my hearty thought i wen i seed him heavin blowin an swettin at the jacks halyards youll not break that rope in a hurry  but i was wrong sir for although the halyards held on all right i had not calkilated on such wiolent action at the joints  all of a sudden off comes a leg at the knee  it was goin the upard kick at the time an went up like a rocket slap through a troop o monkeys that was lookin on aloft which it scattered like foam in a gale  yambo didnt seem to care a pinch o snuff  his blood was up  the sweat was runnin off him like rain  hi cries he givin another most awful tug  but it wasnt high that time for the other leg came off at the hipjint on the down kick an went straight into the buzzum of a black warrior an floored him wuss than he ever wos floored since he took to fightin  yambo didnt care for that either  he gave another haul with all his might which proved too much for jack without his legs for it threw his arms out with such force that they jammed hard an fast as if the poor critter was howlin for mercy  yambo looked awful blank at this  then he turned sharp round and looked at me for all the world as if he meant to say wot dee mean by that eh  he shouldnt ought to lick into him like that says i to tony the figure aint made to be druv by a sixhorse power steamengine  but tell him ill fix it up with jints thatll stand pullin by an elephant and ill make him another jack to the full as big as that one an twice as strong  this added disco in conclusion taking up the head on which he had been engaged is the noo jack  the old uns outside working away at this moment like a winmill  listen dont ee hear em  harold listened and found no difficulty in hearing them for peals of laughter and shrieks of delight burst forth every few minutes apparently from a vast crowd outside the hut  i do believe said disco rising and going towards the door of the hut that you can see em from where you lay  he drew aside the skin doorway as he spoke and there sure enough was the gigantic jumpingjack hanging from the limb of a tree clearly defined against the sky and galvanically kicking about its vast limbs with yambo pulling fiercely at the tail and the entire tribe looking on steeped in ecstasy and admiration  it may easily be believed that the sight of this coupled with discos narrative was almost too much for harolds nerves and for some time he exhibited to discos horror a tendency to repeat some antics which would have been much more appropriate to the jumpingjack but after a warm drink administered by his faithful though rough nurse he became composed and finally dropped into a pleasant sleep which was not broken till late the following morning  refreshed in body happy in mind and thankful in spirit he rose to feel that the illness against which he had fought for many days was conquered and that although still very weak he had fairly turned the corner and had begun to regain some of his wonted health and vigour    chapter twenty  harold appears in a new character and two old characters reappear to harold  the mind of yambo was a strange compounda curious mixture of gravity and rollicking joviality at one time displaying a phase of intense solemnity at another exhibiting quiet pleasantry and humour but earnestness was the prevailing trait of his character  whether indulging his passionate fondness for the jumpingjack or engaged in guiding the deliberations of his counsellors the earnest chief was equally devoted to the work in hand  being a savageand consequently led entirely by feeling which is perhaps the chief characteristic of savage as distinguished from civilised manhe hated his enemies with exceeding bitterness and loved his friends with all his heart  yambo was very tender to harold during his illness and the latter felt corresponding gratitude so that there sprang up between the two a closer friendship than one could have supposed to be possible considering that they were so different from each other mentally physically and socially and that their only mode of exchanging ideas was through the medium of a very incompetent interpreter  among other things harold discovered that his friend the chief was extremely fond of anecdotes and stories  he therefore while in a convalescent state and unable for much physical exercise amused himself and spent much of his time in narrating to him the adventures of robinson crusoe  yambos appetite for mental food increased and when crusoes tale was finished he eagerly demanded more  some of his warriors also came to hear and at last the hut was unable to contain the audiences that wished to enter  harold therefore removed to an open space under a banyantree and there daily for several hours related all the tales and narratives with which he was acquainted to the hundreds of openeyed and openmouthed negroes who squatted around him  at first he selected such tales as he thought would be likely to amuse but these being soon exhausted he told them about anything that chanced to recur to his memory  then finding that their power to swallow the marvellous was somewhat crocodilish he gave them jack the giantkiller and jack of beanstalk notoriety and tom thumb cinderella etcetera until his entire nursery stock was exhausted after which he fell back on his inventive powers but the labour of this last effort proving very considerable and the results not being adequately great he took to history and told them stories about william tell and wallace and bruce and the puritans of england and the scottish covenanters and the discoveries of columbus until the eyes and mouths of his black auditors were held so constantly and widely on the stretch that disco began to fear they would become gradually incapable of being shut and he entertained a fear that poor antonios tongue would ere long be dried up at the roots  at last a thought occurred to our hero which he promulgated to disco one morning as they were seated at breakfast on the floor of their hut  it seems to me disco he said after a prolonged silence during which they had been busily engaged with their knives and wooden spoons that illness must be sent sometimes to teach men that they give too little of their thoughts to the future world  werry true sir replied disco in that quiet matterofcourse tone with which men generally receive axiomatic verities we is raither given to be swallered up with this world which aint surprisin neither seein that weve bin putt into it and are surrounded by it mixed up with it steeped in it so to speak an cant werry well help ourselves  that last is just the point im not quite so sure about rejoined harold  since ive been lying ill here i have thought a good deal about forgetting to bring a bible with me and about the meaning of the term christian which name i bear and yet i cant when i look honestly at it see that i do much to deserve the name  well i dont quite see that sir said disco with an argumentative curl of his right eyebrow you doesnt swear or drink or steal or commit murder an a many other things o that sort  aint that the result o your being a christian  it may be so disco but that is only what may be styled the dont side of the question  what troubles me is that i dont see much on the do side of it  you says your prayers sir dont you asked disco with the air of a man who had put a telling question  well yes replied harold but what troubles me is that while in my creed i profess to think the salvation of souls is of such vital importance in my practice i seem to say that it is of no importance at all for here have i been for many weeks amongst these black fellows and have never so much as mentioned the name of our saviour to them although i have been telling them no end of stories of all kinds both true and fanciful  theres something in that sir admitted disco  harold also thought there was so much in it that he gave the subject a great deal of earnest consideration and finally resolved to begin to tell the negroes bible stories  he was thus gradually led to tell them that old old story of god the saviours life and death and love for man which he found interested affected and influenced the savages far more powerfully than any of the tales whether true or fanciful with which he had previously entertained them  while doing this a new spirit seemed to actuate himself and to influence his whole being  while harold was thus led almost unconsciously to become a sower of the blessed seed of gods word marizano was working his way through the country setting forth in the most extreme manner the ultimate results of mans sinful nature and the devils lies  one of his first deeds was to visit a village which was beautifully situated on the banks of a small but deep river  in order to avoid alarming the inhabitants he approached it with only about thirty of his men twenty of whom were armed  arrived at the outskirts he halted his armed men and advanced with the other ten calling out cheerfully we have things for sale have you anything to sell  the chief and his warriors armed with their bows and arrows and shields met him and forbade him to pass within the hedge that encircled the village but told him to sit down under a tree outside  a mat of split reeds was placed for marizano to sit on and when he had explained to the chief that the object of his visit was to trade with him for ivoryin proof of which he pointed to the bales which his men carriedhe was well received and a great clapping of hands ensued  presents were then exchanged and more clapping of hands took place for this was considered the appropriate ceremony  the chief and his warriors on sitting down before marizano and his men clapped their hands together and continued slapping on their thighs while handing their presents or when receiving those of their visitors  it was the african thank you to have omitted it would have been considered very bad manners  soon a brisk trade was commenced in which the entire community became ere long deeply and eagerly absorbed  meanwhile marizanos armed men were allowed to come forward  the women prepared food for the strangers and after they had eaten and drunk of the native beer heartily marizano asked the chief if he had ever seen firearms used  yes replied the chief but only once at a great distance off  it is told to me that your guns kill very far offmuch further than our bows is that so  it is true replied marizano who was very merry by this time under the influence of the beer as indeed were also his men and their entertainers  would you like to see what our guns can do asked the halfcaste  if you will permit me i shall let you hear and see them in use  the unsuspecting chief at once gave his consent  his visitors rose marizano gave the word a volley was poured forth which instantly killed the chief and twenty of his men  the survivors fled in horror  the young women and children were seized the village was sackedwhich means that the old and useless members of the community were murdered in cold blood and the place was set on fireand marizano marched away with his band of captives considerably augmented leaving a scene of death and horrible desolation behind him  see livingstones zambesi and its tributaries pages 201 202  thus did that villain walk through the land with fire and sword procuring slaves for the supply of the domestic institution of the sultan of zanzibar  by degrees the murderers drove of black cattle increased to such an extent that when he approached the neighbourhood of the village in which harold and disco sojourned he began to think that he had obtained about as many as he could conveniently manage and meditated turning his face eastward little dreaming how near he was to a thousand dollars worth of property in the shape of ransom for two white men  he was on the point of turning back and missing this when he chanced to fall in with a villager who was out hunting and who after a hot chase was captured  this man was made much of and presented with some yards of cloth as well as a few beads at the same time being assured that he had nothing to fear that the party was merely a slavetrading one that the number of slaves required had been made up but that a few more would be purchased if the chief of his village had any to dispose of  on learning from the man that his village was a large one fully two days march from the spot where he stood and filled with armed men marizano came to the conclusion that it would not be worth his while to proceed thither and was about to order his informant to be added to his gang with a slavestick round his neck when he suddenly bethought him of inquiring as to whether any white men had been seen in these parts as he had often made the same inquiry before without obtaining any satisfactory answer it was with great surprise that he now heard from his captive of two white men being in the very village about which he had been conversing  at once he changed his plan resumed his march and a couple of days afterwards presented himself before the astonished eyes of harold seadrift and disco lillihammer while they were taking a walk about a mile from the village  disco recognised the slavetrader at once and from the troubled as well as surprised look of marizano it was pretty evident that he remembered the countenance of disco  when the recollection of marizanos cruelty at the time of their first meeting flashed upon him disco felt an almost irresistible desire to rush upon and strangle the portuguese but the calm deportment of that wily man and the peaceful manner in which he had approached partly disarmed his wrath  he could not however quite restrain his tongue  ha said he you are the blackguard that we met and pretty nigh shot when we first came to these parts eh  pity we missed you you blackhearted villain  as marizano did not understand english these complimentary remarks were lost on him  he seemed however to comprehend the drift of them for he returned discos frown with a stare of defiance  whatever he was or whatever he is interposed harold we must restrain ourselves just now disco because we cannot punish him as he deserves however much we may wish to and he seems to have armed men enough to put us and our entertainers completely in his power  keep quiet while i speak to him  jumbo and antonio armed with bows and arrowsfor they were in search of small game wherewith to supply the potcame up looking very much surprised and the latter a good deal frightened  ask him antonio said harold what is his object in visiting this part of the country  to procure slaves said marizano curtly  i thought so returned harold but he will find that the men of this tribe are not easily overcome  i do not wish to overcome them said the halfcaste  i have procured enough of slaves as you see pointing to the gang which was halted some hundred yards or so in rear of his armed men but i heard that you were prisoners here and i have come to prove to you that even a slavetrader can return good for evil  you did this he said looking at disco and pointing to his old wound in the arm i now come to deliver you from slavery  having suppressed part of the truth and supplemented the rest of it with this magnificent lie marizano endeavoured to look magnanimous  i dont believe a word of it said disco decidedly  i incline to doubt it too said harold but he may have some good reason of his own for his friendly professions towards us  in any case we have no resource left but to assume that he speaks the truth  turning to marizano he said  we are not prisoners here  we are guests of the chief of this village  in that case replied the halfcaste i can return to the coast without you  as he said this a large band of the villagers having discovered that strangers had arrived drew near  marizano at once advanced making peaceful demonstrations and after the requisite amount of clapping of hands on both sides stated the object for which he had come  he made no attempt to conceal the fact that he was a slavetrader but said that having purchased enough of slaves he had visited their village because of certain rumours to the effect that some white men had been lost in these regions and could not find their way back to the coast he was anxious he said to help these white men to do so but finding that the white men then at the village were not the men he was in search of and did not want to go to the coast he would just stay long enough with the chief to exchange compliments and then depart  all this was translated to the white men in question by their faithful ally antonio and when they retired to consult as to what should be done they looked at each other with half amused and half perplexed expressions of countenance  werry odd said disco how contrairy things turns up at times  very odd indeed assented harold laughing  it is quite true that we are in one sense lost and utterly unable to undertake a journey through this country without men means or arms and nothing could be more fortunate than that we should have the chance thus suddenly thrown in our way of travelling under the escort of a band of armed men nevertheless i cannot bear the idea of travelling with or being indebted to a slavetrader and a scoundrel like marizano  thats were it is sir said disco with emphasis i could stand anything amost but that  and yet pursued harold it is our only chance  i see quite well that we may remain for years here without again having such an opportunity or such an escort thrown in our way  theres no help for it i fear said disco  we must take it like a dose o nasty physichold our nobs shut our daylights an down with it  the only thing i aint sure of is your ability to travel  you aint strong yet  oh im strong enough now or very nearly so and getting stronger every day  well then i suppose its settled that we go  humph  im agreeable an the whole business werry disagreeable said disco making a wry face  marizano was much pleased when the decision of the white men was made known to him and the native chief was naturally much distressed for not only was he about to lose two men of whom he had become very fond but he was on the point of being bereft of his storyteller the opener up of his mind the man who above all others had taught him to think about his maker and a future state  he had sense enough however to perceive that his guests could not choose but avail themselves of so good an opportunity and after the first feeling of regret was over made up his mind to the separation  next day harold and disco with feelings of strong revulsion almost of shame fell into the ranks of the slavegang and for many days thereafter marched through the land in company with marizano and his band of lawless villains  marizano usually walked some distance ahead of the main body with a few trusty comrades  our adventurers with their two followers came next in order of march the gang of slaves in single file followed and the armed men brought up the rear  it was necessarily a very long line and at a distance resembled some hideous reptile crawling slowly and tortuously through the fair fields and plains of africa  at first there were no stragglers for the slaves were as yet with few exceptions strong and vigorous  these exceptions and the lazy were easily kept in the line by means of rope and chain as well as the rod and lash  harold and disco studiously avoided their leader during the march marizano fell in with their humour and left them to themselves  at nights they made their own fire and cooked their own supper as far removed from the slave camp as was consistent with safety for they could not bear to witness the sufferings of the slaves or to look upon their captors  even the food that they were constrained to eat appeared to have a tendency to choke them and altogether their situation became so terrible that they several times almost formed the desperate resolution of leaving the party and trying to reach the coast by themselves as they best might but the utter madness and hopelessness of such a project soon forced itself on their minds and insured its being finally abandoned  one morning marizano threw off his usual reserve and approaching the white men told them that in two hours they would reach the lake where his employer was encamped  and who is your master asked harold  a blackfaced or yellowfaced blackguard like himself i doubt not growled disco  antonio put harolds question without discos comment and marizano replied that his master was an arab trader and added that he would push on in advance of the party and inform him of their approach  soon afterwards the lake was reached  a large dhow was in readiness the gang was embarked and ferried across to a place where several rude buildings and barracoons with a few tents indicated that it was one of the inland headquarters of the trade in black ivory  the moment our travellers landed marizano led them to one of the nearest buildings and introduced them to his master  yoosoof exclaimed disco in a shout of astonishment  it would have been a difficult question to have decided which of the three faces displayed the most extreme surprise  perhaps discos would have been awarded the palm but yoosoof was undoubtedly the first to regain his selfpossession  you be surprised he said in his very broken english while his paleyellow visage resumed its placid gravity of expression  undoubtedly we are said harold  bustin exclaimed disco  you would be not so mush surpriseddid you know dat i comes to here every year an dat engleesh consul ask me for quire about you  if that be so how comes it that you were surprised to see us asked harold  cause why i only knows dat some white mans be loss theirselfsnot knows what mansnot knows it was you  well now cried disco unable to restrain himself as he turned to harold did ever two unfortnits meet wi sitch luck  here have we bin obliged for days to keep company with the greatest portugee villian in the country an now were needcessitated to be under a obligation to the greatest arab scoundrel in afriky  the scoundrel in question smiled and shrugged his shoulders  yoosoof cried disco clenching his fist and looking full in the traders eyes when i last saw yer ugly face i vowed that if ever i seed it again id leave my mark on it pretty deep i did and now i does see it again but i havent the moral courage to touch sitch a poor pitiful shrivelledup package o bones an halftanned leather moreover im goin to be indebted to ee  ha ha  he laughed bitterly and with a dash of wild humour in the tone to travel under yer care an eat yer accursed bread andandoh there aint no sitch thing as shame left in my corpus  im a low meanspirited boastful idiot thats wot i am an i dont care the fagend of a hunk o gingerbread who knows it  after this explosion the sorely tried mariner brought his right hand down on his thigh with a tremendous crack turned about and walked away to cool himself    chapter twenty one  progress of the slaverunthe deadly swamp and the unexpected rescue  we will now leap over a short period of timeabout two or three weeks during which the sable procession had been winding its weary way over hill and dale plain and swamp  during that comparatively brief period harold and disco had seen so much cruelty and suffering that they both felt a strange tendency to believe that the whole must be the wild imaginings of a horrible dream perhaps weakness resulting from illness might have had something to do with this peculiar feeling of unbelief for both had been subject to a second though slight attack of fever  nevertheless coupled with their scepticism was a contradictory and dreadful certainty that they were not dreaming but that what they witnessed was absolute verity  it is probable that if they had been in their ordinary health and vigour they would have made a violent attempt to rescue the slaves even at the cost of their own lives  but severe and prolonged illness often unhinges the mind as well as the body and renders the spirit all but impotent  one sultry evening the sad procession came to a long stretch of swamp and prepared to cross it  although already thinned by death the slavegang was large  it numbered several hundreds and was led by marizano yoosoof having started some days in advance in charge of a similar gang  harold and disco were by that time in the habit of walking together in front of the gang chiefly for the purpose of avoiding the sight of cruelties and woes which they were powerless to prevent or assuage  on reaching the edge of the swamp however they felt so utterly wearied and disspirited that they sat down on a bank to rest intending to let the slavegang go into the swamp before them and then follow in rear antonio and jumbo also remained with them  you should go on in front said marizano significantly on observing their intention  tell him well remain where we are said disco sternly to antonio  marizano shrugged his shoulders and left them  the leading men of the slavegang were ordered to advance as soon as the armed guard had commenced the toilsome march over ground into which they sank kneedeep at every step  the first man of the gang hesitated and heaved a deep sigh as though his heart failed him at the prospectand well it might for although young he was not robust and overdriving coupled with the weight and the chafing of the goree had worn him to a skeleton  it was not the policy of the slavetraders to take much care of their black ivory  they procured it so cheaply that it was easier and more profitable to lose or cast away some of it than to put off time in resting and recruiting the weak  the moment it was observed therefore that the leading man hesitated one of the drivers gave him a slash across his naked back with a heavy whip which at once drew blood  poor wretch he could ill bear further loss of the precious stream of life for it had already been deeply drained from him by the slavestick  the chafing of that instrument of torture had not only worn the skin off his shoulders but had cut into the quivering flesh so that blood constantly dropped in small quantities from it  no cry burst from the mans lips on receiving the cruel blow but he turned his eyes on his captors with a look that seemed to implore for mercy  as well might he have looked for mercy at the hands of satan the lash again fell on him with stinging force  he made a feeble effort to advance staggered and fell to the ground dragging down the man to whom he was coupled with such violence as almost to break his neck  the lash was again about to be applied to make him rise but disco and harold rose simultaneously and rushed at the driver with what intent they scarcely knew but four armed halfcastes stepped between them and the slave  you had better not interfere said marizano who stood close by  out of the way cried harold fiercely in the strength of his passion hurling aside the man who opposed him  you shant give him another cut said disco between his teeth as he seized the driver by the throat  we dont intend to do so said marizano coolly while the driver released himself from poor discos weakened grasp he wont need any more  the englishmen required no explanation of these words  a glance told them that the man was dying  cut him out said marizano  one of his men immediately brought a saw and cut the fork of the stick which still held the living to the dying man and which being riveted on them could not otherwise be removed  harold and disco lifted him up as soon as he was free and carrying him a short distance aside to a soft part of the bank laid him gently down  the dying slave looked as if he were surprised at such unwonted tenderness  there was even a slight smile on his lips for a few moments but it quickly passed away with the fast ebbing tide of life  go fetch some water said harold  his lips are dry  disco rose and ran to fill a small cocoanutshell which he carried at his girdle as a drinkingcup  returning with it he moistened the mans lips and poured a little of the cool water on the raw sores on each side of his neck  they were so much engrossed with their occupation that neither of them observed that the slavegang had commenced to pass through the swamp until the sharp cry of a child drew their attention to it for a moment but knowing that they could do no good they endeavoured to shut their eyes and ears to everything save the duty they had in hand  by degrees the greater part of the long line had got into the swamp and were slowly toiling through it under the stimulus of the lash  some like the poor fellow who first fell had sunk under their accumulated trials and after a fruitless effort on the part of the slavers to drive them forward had been kicked aside into the jungle there to die or to be torn in pieces by that everwatchful scavenger of the wilderness the hyena  these were chiefly women who having become mothers not long before were unable to carry their infants and keep up with the gang others under the intense dread of flagellation made the attempt and staggered on a short distance only to fall and be left behind in the pestilential swamp where rank reeds and grass closed over them and formed a ready grave  the difficulties of the swamp were however felt most severely by the children who from little creatures of not much more than five years of age to wellgrown boys and girls were mingled with and chained to the adults along the line  their comparatively short legs were not well adapted for such ground and not a few of them perished there but although the losses here were terribly numerous in one sense they after all bore but a small proportion to those whose native vigour carried them through in safety  among the men there were some whose strength of frame and fierce expression indicated untameable spiritsmen who might have been probably were heroes among their fellows  it was for men of this stamp that the goree or slavestick had been invented and most effectually did that instrument serve its purpose  samson himself would have been a mere child in it  there were men in the gang quite as bold if not as strong as samson one of these a very tall and powerful negro on drawing near to the place where marizano stood superintending the passage turned suddenly aside and although coupled by the neck to a fellowslave and securely bound at the wrists with a cord which was evidently cutting into his swelled flesh made a desperate kick at the halfcaste leader  although the slave failed to reach him marizano was so enraged that he drew a hatchet from his belt and instantly dashed out the mans brains he fell dead without even a groan  terrified by this the rest passed on more rapidly and there was no further check till a woman in the line with an infant on her back stumbled and falling down appeared unable to rise  get up shouted marizano whose rage had rather been increased than abated by the murder he had just committed  the woman rose and attempted to advance but seemed ready to fall again seeing this marizano plucked the infant from her back dashed it against a tree and flung its quivering body into the jungle while a terrible application of the lash sent the mother shrieking into the swamp  see livingstones zambesi and its tributaries page 857 and for a record of cruelties too horrible to be set down in a book like this we refer the reader to mcleods travels in eastern africa volume two page 26  also to the appendix of captain sulivans dhowchasing in zanzibar waters which contains copious and interesting extracts from evidence taken before the select committee of the house of commons  harold and disco did not witness this though they heard the shriek of despair for at the moment the negro they were tending was breathing his last  when his eyes had closed and the spirit had been set free they rose and purposely refraining from looking back hurried away from the dreadful scene intending to plunge into the swamp at some distance from the place and push on until they should regain the head of the column  better if wed never fallen behind sir said disco in a deep tremulous voice  true replied harold  we should have been spared these sights and the pain of knowing that we cannot prevent this appalling misery and cruelty  but surely it is to be prevented somehow cried disco almost fiercely  many a war that has cost mints o money has been carried on for causes that aint worth mentionin in the same breath with this  as harold knew not what to say and was toiling kneedeep in the swamp at the moment he made no reply  after marching about half an hour he stopped abruptly and said with a heavy sighi hope we havent missed our way  hope not sir but it looks like as if we had  ive bin so took up thinkin o that accursed traffic in human beins that ive lost my reckonin  howsever we cant be far out an with the sun to guide us well  he was stopped by a loud halloo in the woods on the belt of the swamp  it was repeated in a few seconds and antonio who with jumbo had followed his master cried in an excited tone  me knows dat sound  wot may it be tony asked disco  there was neither time nor need for an answer for at that moment a ringing cry something like a bad imitation of a british cheer was heard and a band of men sprang out of the woods and ran at full speed towards our englishmen  why zombo exclaimed disco wildly  oliveira cried harold  masiko  songolo shouted antonio and jumbo  an jose nakoda chimbolo mabrukithe whole bun of em cried disco as one after another these worthies emerged from the wood and rushed in a state of frantic excitement towards their friendshooray  hooroohay replied the runners  in another minute our adventurous party of travellers was reunited and for some time nothing but wild excitement congratulations queries that got no replies and replies that ran tilt at irrelevant queries with confusion worse confounded by explosions of unbounded and irrepressible laughter not unmingled with tears was the order of the hour  but wat yoos ill cried zombo suddenly looking into discos face with an anxious expression  well i aint xacly ill nor i aint xacly well neither but im hearty all the same and werry glad to see your black face zombo  ho hooroohay sos me for see you cried the excitable zombo but come not good for talkee in de knees to watter  fall in boy ho sholler umsqueek mash  that zombo had assumed command of his party was made evident by the pat way in which he trolled off the words of command formerly taught to him by harold as well as by the prompt obedience that was accorded to his orders  he led the party out of the swamp and on reaching a dry spot halted in order to make further inquiries and answer questions  how did you find us zombo asked harold throwing himself wearily on the ground  yoos ill said zombo holding up a finger by way of rebuke  so i am though not so ill as i look  but come answer me  how came you to discover us  you could not have found us by mere chance in this wilderness  chanz wat am chanz asked the makololo  there was some difficulty in getting antonio to explain the word from the circumstance of himself being ignorant of it therefore harold put the question in a more direct form  oh ve comes here look for yoo cause peepils dreck umsshow de way  ves been veeks monts oh days look for yoo  travil far grong roadturin baktry aginfin yoo nowhooroohay  you may say that indeed  id have it in my heart said disco to give three good rousin british cheers if it warnt for the thoughts o that blackhearted villain marizano an his poor miserable slaves  marizano shouted chimbolo glaring at harold  marizano echoed zombo glaring at disco  harold now explained to his friends that the slavehunter was close at handa piece of news which visibly excited themand described the cruelties of which he had recently been a witness  zombo showed his teeth like a savage mastiff and grasped his musket as though he longed to use it but he uttered no word until the narrative reached that point in which the death of the poor captive was described  then he suddenly started forward and said something to his followers in the native tongue which caused each to fling down the small bundle that was strapped to his shoulders  yoo stop here he cried earnestly as he turned to harold and disco ves com bak soon  ho boys sholler ums queek mash  no trained band of britons ever obeyed with more ready alacrity  no attention was paid to harolds questions  the queek mash carried them out of sight in a few minutes and when the englishmen who had run after them a few paces halted under the conviction that in their weak condition they might as well endeavour to keep up with racehorses as with their old friends they found that antonio alone remained to keep them company  wheres jumbo inquired harold  gon way wid oders replied the interpreter  examining the bundles of their friends they found that their contents were powder ball and food  it was therefore resolved that a fire should be kindled and food prepared to be ready for their friends on their return  im not so sure about their return said harold gravely  they will have to fight against fearful odds if they find the slavers  foolish fellows i wish they had not rushed away so madly without consulting us  the day passed night came and passed also and another day dawned but there was no appearance of zombo and his men until the sun had been up for some hours  then they came back wending their way slowlyvery slowlythrough the woods with the whole of the slavegang men women and children at their heels  where is marizano inquired harold almost breathless with surprise  dead said zombo  dead  ay dead couldnt be deader  and his armed followers  dead toosome ob ums  ve got at um in de night  shotted marizano all to hatoms  shotted mos ob um follerers too  de res all scatter like leaves in de wind  me giv up now added zombo handing his musket to harold  boys orrer ums mees capitin not no more  now capitin harol yoos once more look afer us an take care ob all ums peepil  having thus demitted his charge the faithful zombo stepped back and left our hero in the unenviable position of a half brokendown man with the responsibility of conducting an expedition and disposing of a large gang of slaves in some unknown part of equatorial africa  leaving him there we will proceed at once to the coast and follow for a time the fortunes of that archvillain yoosoof    chapter twenty two  describes black ivory at sea  having started for the coast with a large gang of slaves a short time before marizano as we have already said and having left the englishmen to the care of the halfcaste chiefly because he did not desire their company although he had no objection to the ransom yoosoof proceeded over the same track which we have already described in part leaving a bloody trail behind him  it is a fearful track of about 500 miles in length that which lies between the head of lake nyassa and the seacoast at kilwa  we have no intention of dragging the reader over it to witness the cruelties and murders that were perpetrated by the slavers or the agonies endured by the slaves  livingstone speaks of it as a land of death of desolation and dead mens bones  and no wonder for it is one of the main arteries through which the blood of africa flows like the water of natural rivers to the sea  the slavegangs are perpetually passing eastward through itperpetually dropping fourfifths of their numbers on it as they go  dr livingstone estimates that in some cases not more than onetenth of the slaves captured reach the seacoast alive  it is therefore rather under than overstating the case to say that out of every hundred starting from the interior eighty perish on the road  yoosoof left with several thousands of strong and healthy men women and childrenmost of them being childrenhe arrived at kilwa with only eight hundred  the rest had sunk by the way either from exhaustion or cruel treatment or both  the loss was great but as regards the trader it could not be called severe because the whole gang of slaves cost him littlesome of them even nothingand the remaining eight hundred would fetch a good price  they were miserably thin indeed and exhibited on their poor worn and travelstained bodies the evidence of many a cruel castigation but yoosoof knew that a little rest and good feeding at kilwa would restore them to some degree of marketable value and at zanzibar he was pretty sure of obtaining in round numbers about 10 pounds a head for them while in the arabian and persian ports he could obtain much more if he chose to pass beyond the treatyprotected water at lamoo and run the risk of being captured by british cruisers it is piracy to carry slaves north of lamoo  south of that point for hundreds of miles robbery rapine murder cruelty such as devils could not excel if they were to try is a domestic institution with which britons are pledged not to interfere  since the above was written sir bartle frere has returned from his mission and we are told that a treaty has been signed by the sultan of zanzibar putting an end to this domestic slavery  we have not yet seen the terms of this treaty and must go to press before it appears  we have reason to rejoice and be thankful however that such an advantage has been gained  but let not the reader imagine that this settles the question of east african slavery  portugal still holds to the domestic institution in her colonies and has decreed that it shall not expire till the year 1878  decreed in fact that the horrors which we have attempted to depict shall continue for five years longer  and let it be noted that the export slavetrade cannot be stopped as long as domestic slavery is permitted  besides this there is a continual drain of human beings from africa through egypt  sir samuel bakers mission is a blow aimed at that but nothing that we know of is being done in regard to portuguese wickedness  if the people of this country could only realise the frightful state of things that exists in the african portuguese territory and knew how many thousand bodies shall be racked with torture and souls be launched into eternity during these five years they would indignantly insist that portugal should be compelled to stop it at once  if it is righteous to constrain the sultan of zanzibar is it not equally so to compel the king of portugal  the arch robber and murderer yoosoofsmooth and oily of face tongue and manner though he waspossessed a bold spirit and a grasping heart the domestic institution did not suit him  rather than sneak along his villainous course under its protecting pass he resolved to bid defiance to laws treaties and menofwar to bootas many hundreds of his compeers have done and doand make a bold dash to the north with his eight hundred specimens of black ivory  accordingly full of his purpose one afternoon he sauntered up to the barracoons in which his cattle were being rested and fedup  moosa his chief driver was busy among them with the lash for like other cattle they had a tendency to rebel at least a few of them had the most of them were by that time reduced to the callous condition which had struck harold and disco so much on the occasion of their visits to the slavemarket of zanzibar  moosa was engaged when yoosoof entered in whipping most unmercifully a small boy whose piercing shrieks had no influence whatever on his tormentor  close beside them a large strongboned man lay stretched on the ground  he had just been felled with a heavy stick by moosa for interfering  he had raised himself on one elbow while with his right hand he wiped away the blood that oozed from the wound in his head and appeared to struggle to recover himself from the stunning blow  what has he been doing asked yoosoof carelessly in portuguese  oh the old story rebelling said moosa savagely hurling the boy into the midst of a group of cowering children amongst whom he instantly shrank as much as possible out of sight  that brute pointing to the prostrate man was a chief it appears in his own country and has not yet got all the spirit lashed out of him  but it cant last much longer either the spirit or the life must go  he has carried that little whelp the last part of the way on his back and now objects to part with himgot fond of him i fancy  if you had taken my advice you would have cast them both to the hyenas long ago  you are a bad judge of human flesh moosa said yoosoof quietly more than once you have allowed your passion to rob me of a valuable piece of goods  this man will fetch a good price in persia and so will his son  i know that the child is his son though the fool thinks no one knows that but himself and rather prides himself on the clever way in which he has continued to keep his whelp beside him on the journey down  bah what can one expect from such cattle  dont separate them moosa  they will thrive better together  if we only get them to market in good condition then we can sell them in separate lots without risking loss of value from pining  in a somewhat sulky tone for he was not pleased to be found fault with by his chief the slavedriver ordered out the boy who was little more than five years old though the careworn expression of his thin face seemed to indicate a much more advanced age  trembling with alarm for he expected a repetition of the punishment yet not daring to disobey the child came slowly out from the midst of his hapless companions and advanced  the man who had partly recovered rose to a sitting position and regarded moosa and the arab with a look of hatred so intense that it is quite certain he would have sprung at them if the heavy slavestick had not rendered such an act impossible  go you little whelp said moosa pointing to the fallen chief and at the same time giving the child a cut with the whip  with a cry of mingled pain and delight poor obo for it was he rushed into his fathers open arms and laid his sobbing head on his breast he could not nestle into his neck as in the days of old he had been wont to dothe rough goree effectually prevented that  kambira bent his head over the child and remained perfectly still  he did not dare to move lest any action however inoffensive might induce moosa to change his mind and separate them again  poor kambira  how different from the hearty bold kindly chief to whom we introduced the reader in his own wilderness home  his colossal frame was now gaunt in the extreme and so thin that every rib stood out as though it would burst the skin and every joint seemed hideously large while from head to foot his skin was crossed and recrossed with terrible weals and scarred with open sores telling of the horrible cruelties to which he had been subjected in the vain attempt to tame his untameable spirit  there can be no question that if he had been left to the tender mercies of such portuguese halfcaste scoundrels as moosa or marizano he would have been brained with an axe or whipped to death long ago  but yoosoof was more cool and calculating in his cruelty he had more respect for his pocket than for the gratification of his angry feelings  therefore kambira had reached the coast alive  little had the simple chief imagined what awaited him on that coast and on his way to it when in the fulness of his heart he had stated to harold seadrift his determination to proceed thither in search of azinte  experience had now crushed hope and taught him to despair there was but one gleam of light in his otherwise black sky and that was the presence of his boy  life had still one charm in it as long as he could lay hold of obos little hand and hoist him not quite so easily as of yore on his broad shoulders  yoosoof was sufficiently a judge of human character to be aware that if he separated these two kambira would become more dangerous to approach than the fiercest monster in the african wilderness  we must sail tonight and take our chance said yoosoof turning away from his captives the time allowed for our trade is past and i shall run straight north without delay  the arab here referred to the fact that the period of the year allowed by treaty for the lawful slavetrade of the zanzibar dominions had come to an end  that period extended over several months and during its course passes from the sultan secured domestic slavers against the british cruisers  after its expiration no export of slaves was permitted anywhere nevertheless a very large export was carried on despite nonpermission and cruisers  yoosoof meant to run the blockade and take his chance  how many dhows have you got asked yoosoof  three replied moosa  that will do returned the arab after a few minutes thought it will be a tight fit at first perhaps but a few days at sea will rectify that  even in the most healthy season and favourable conditions we must unfortunately count on a good many losses  we shall sail tomorrow  the morrow came and three dhows left the harbour of kilwa hoisted their lateen sails and steered northwards  they were densely crowded with slaves  even to the eye of a superficial observer this would have been patent for the upper deck of each was so closely packed with black men women and children that a square inch of it could not anywhere be seen  they were packed very systematically in order to secure economical stowage  each human being sat on his haunches with his thighs against his breast and his knees touching his chin  they were all ranged thus in rows shoulder to shoulder and back to shin so that the deck was covered with a solid phalanx of human flesh  change of posture was not provided for it was not possible  there was no awning over the upper deck  the tropical sun poured its rays on the heads of the slaves all day  the dews fell on them all night  the voyage might last for days or weeks but there was no relief to the wretched multitude  for no purpose whatever could they move from their terrible position save for the one purpose of being thrown overboard when dead  but we have only spoken of the upper deck of these dhows  beneath this there was a temporary bamboo deck with just space sufficient to admit of men being seated in the position above referred to  this was also crowded but it was not the black hole of the vessel  that was lower still  seated on the stone ballast beneath the bamboo deck there was yet another layer of humanity whose condition can neither be described nor conceived  without air without light without room to move without hope with insufferable stench with hunger and thirst with heat unbearable with agony of body and soul with dread anticipations of the future and despairing memories of the past they sat for days and nights togetherfed with just enough of uncooked rice and water to keep soul and body together  not enough in all cases however for many succumbed especially among the women and children  down in the lowest filthiest and darkest corner of this foul hold sat kambira with little obo crushed against his shins  it may be supposed that there was a touch of mercy in this arrangement  let not the reader suppose so  yoosoof knew that if kambira was to be got to market alive obo must go along with him  moosa also knew that if the strongminded chief was to be subdued at all it would only be by the most terrible means  hence his position in the dhow  there was a man seated alongside of kambira who for some time had appeared to be ill  he could not be seen for the place was quite dark save when a man came down with a lantern daily to serve out rice and water but kambira knew that he was very ill from his groans and the quiverings of his body  one night these groans ceased and the man leaned heavily on the chiefnot very heavily however he was too closely wedged in all round to admit of that  soon afterwards he became very cold and kambira knew that he was dead  all that night and the greater part of next day the dead man sat propped up by his living comrades  when the daily visitor came down attention was drawn to the body and it was removed  moosa who was in charge of this dhow yoosoof having command of another gave orders to have the slaves in the hold examined and it was discovered that three others were dead and two dying  the dead were thrown overboard the dying were left till they died and then followed their released comrades  but now a worse evil befell that dhow  smallpox broke out among the slaves  it was a terrible emergency but moosa was quite equal to it  ordering the infected and suspected slaves to be brought on deck he examined them  in this operation he was assisted and accompanied by two powerful armed men  there were passengers on board the dhow chiefly arabs and a crew as well as slaves  the passengers and crew together numbered about thirtyfour all of whom were armed to the teeth  to these this inspection was of great importance for it was their interest to get rid of the deadly disease as fast as possible  the first slave inspected a youth of about fifteen was in an advanced stage of the disease in fact dying  a glance was sufficient and at a nod from moosa the two powerful men seized him and hurled him into the sea  the poor creature was too far gone even to struggle for life  he sank like a stone  several children followed  they were unquestionably smitten with the disease and were at once thrown overboard  whether the passengers felt pity or no we cannot say  they expressed none but looked on in silence  so far the work was easy but when men and women were brought up on whom the disease had not certainly taken effect moosa was divided between the desire to check the progress of the evil and the desire to save valuable property  the property itself also caused some trouble in a few instances for when it became obvious to one or two of the stronger slavegirls and men what was going to be done with them they made a hard struggle for their lives and the two strong men were under the necessity of using a knife now and then to facilitate the accomplishment of their purpose  but such cases were rare  most of the victims were callously submissive it might not be beyond the truth in some cases to say willingly submissive  each day this scene was enacted for moosa was a very determined man and full forty human beings were thus murdered but the disease was not stayed  the effort to check it was therefore given up and the slaves were left to recover or die where they sat  see account of capture of dhow by captain robert b cay of hms vulture in the times of india 1872  while this was going on in the vessel commanded by moosa the other two dhows under yoosoof and a man named suliman had been lost sight of  but this was a matter of little moment as they were all bound for the same persian port and were pretty sure british cruisers permitting to meet there at last  meanwhile the dhow ran short of water and moosa did not like to venture at that time to make the land lest he should be caught by one of the hated cruisers or their boats  he preferred to let the wretched slaves take their chance of dying of thirsthoping however to lose only a few of the weakest as water could be procured a little farther north with greater security  thus the horrible work of disease death and murder went on until an event occurred which entirely changed the aspect of affairs on board the dhow  early one morning moosa directed the head of his vessel towards the land with the intention of procuring the much needed water  at the same hour and place two cutters belonging to hms firefly armed with gun and rocket twenty men and an interpreter crept out under sail with the fishing boats from a neighbouring village  they were under the command of lieutenants small and lindsay respectively  for some days they had been there keeping vigilant watch but had seen no dhows and that morning were proceeding out rather depressed by the influence of hope deferred when a sail was observed in the offingor rather a mast for the sail of the dhow had been loweredthe owners intending to wait until the tide should enable them to cross the bar  out oars and give way lads was the immediate order for it was necessary to get up all speed on the boats if the dhow was to be reached before she had time to hoist her huge sail  i hope the haze will last earnestly muttered lieutenant small in the first cutter  oh that they may keep on sleeping for five minutes more excitedly whispered lieutenant lindsay in the second cutter  these hopes were coupled with orders to have the gun and rocket in readiness  but the haze would not last to oblige mr small neither would the arabs keep on sleeping to please mr lindsay  on the contrary the haze dissipated and the arabs observed and recognised their enemies when within about half a mile  with wonderful celerity they hoisted sail and stood out to sea in the fullswing of the monsoon  there was no little probability that the boats would fail to overhaul a vessel with so large a sail therefore other means were instantly resorted to  fire said mr small  fire cried mr lindsay  bang went the gun whiz went the rocket almost at the same moment  a rapid riflefire was also opened on the slavershot rocket and ball bespattered the sea and scattered foam in the air but did no harm to the dhow a heavy sea and a strong wind preventing accuracy of aim  give it them as fast as you can was now the order and well was the order obeyed for bluejackets are notoriously smart men in action and the gun the rocket and the rifles kept up a smart iron storm for upwards of two hours during which time the exciting chase lasted  at last jackson the linguist who was in the stern of lindsays boat mortally wounded the steersman of the dhow with a rifleball at a distance of about six hundred yards  not long afterwards the rocketcutter being less heavily weighted than her consort crept ahead and when within about a hundred and fifty yards of the slaver let fly a welldirected rocket  it carried away the parrell which secured the yard of the dhow to the mast and brought the sail down instantly on the deck  hurra burst irresistibly from the bluejackets  the arabs were doubly overwhelmed for besides getting the sail down on their heads they were astonished and stunned by the shriek smoke and flame of the warrocket  the guncutter coming up at the moment the two boats ranged alongside of the slaver and boarded together  as we have said the crew and passengers numbering thirtyfour were armed to the teeth and they had stood by the halyards during the chase with drawn creases swearing to kill any one who should attempt to shorten sail  these now appeared for a moment as though they meditated resistance but the irresistible dash of the sailors seemed to change their minds for they submitted without striking a blow though many of them were very reluctant to give up their swords and knives  fortunately the firefly arrived in search of her boats that evening and the slaves were transferred to her deck  but who shall describe the harrowing scene  the dhow seemed a very nest of black ants it was so crowded and the sailors who had to perform the duty of removing the slaves were nearly suffocated by the horrible stench  few of the slaves could straighten themselves after their long confinement  indeed some of them were unable to stand for days afterwards and many died on board the firefly before they reached a harbour of refuge and freedom those taken from the hold were in the worst condition especially the children many of whom were in the most loathsome stages of smallpox and scrofula of every description  they were so emaciated and weak that many had to be carried on board and lifted for every movement  kambira although able to stand was doubled up like an old man and poor little obo trembled and staggered when he attempted to follow his father to whom he still clung as to his last and only refuge  to convey these poor wretches to a place where they could be cared for was now captain romers chief anxiety  first however he landed the crew and passengers with the exception of moosa and three of his men the filthy dhow was then scuttled and sunk after which the firefly steamed away for aden that being the nearest port where the rescued slaves could be landed and set free    chapter twenty three  the remedy  reader we will turn aside at this point to preach you a lay sermon if you will lend an attentive ear  it shall be brief and straight to the point  our text isprevention and cure  there are at least three great channels by which the lifeblood of africa is drained  one trends to the east through the zanzibar dominions another to the southeast through the portuguese dependencies and a third to the north through egypt  if the slavetrade is to be effectually checked the flow through these three channels must be stopped  it is vain to rest content with the stoppage of one leak in our ship if two other leaks are left open  happily in regard to the first of these channels sir bartle frere has been successful in making a grand stride in the way of prevention  if the sultan of zanzibar holds to his treaty engagements domestic slavery in his dominions is at an end  nevertheless our fleet will be required just as much as ever to prevent the unauthorised piratical slavetrade and this after all is but onethird of the preventive work we have to do  domestic slavery remains untouched in the portuguese dependencies and portugal has decreed that it shall remain untouched until the year 1878  it is well that we should be thoroughly impressed with the fact that so long as slavery in any form is tolerated the internalwe may say infernalmiseries and horrors which we have attempted to depict will continue to blight the land and brutalise its people  besides this justice demands that the same constraint which we lay on the sultan of zanzibar should be applied to the king of portugal  we ought to insist that his domestic slavery shall cease at once  still further as sir bartle frere himself has recommended we should urge upon our government the appointment of efficient consular establishments in the portuguese dependencies as well as vigilance in securing the observance of the treaties signed by the sultans of zanzibar and muscat  a recent telegram from sir samuel baker assures us that a great step has been made in the way of checking the tide of slavery in the thirdthe egyptianchannel and sir bartle frere bears testimony to the desire of the khedive that slavery should be put down in his dominions  for this we have reason to be thankful and the appearance of affairs in that quarter is hopeful but our hope is mingled with anxiety because mankind is terribly prone to go to sleep on hopeful appearances  our nature is such that our only chance of success lies under god in resolving ceaselessly to energise until our ends be accomplished  we must see to it that the khedive of egypt acts in accordance with his professions and for this end efficient consular agency is as needful in the northeast as in the southeast  so much for prevention but prevention is not cure  in order to accomplish this two things are necessary  there must be points or centres of refuge for the oppressed on the mainland of africa and there must be the introduction of the bible  the first is essential to the second  where anarchy murder injustice and tyranny are rampant and triumphant the advance of the missionary is either terribly slow or altogether impossible  the lifegiving soulsoftening word of god is the only remedy for the woes of mankind and therefore the only cure for africa  to introduce it effectually and along with it civilisation and all the blessings that flow therefrom it is indispensable that great britain should obtain by treaty or by purchase one or more small pieces of land there to establish free christian negro settlements and there with force sufficient to defend them from the savages and worse than savagesthe arab and portuguese halfcaste barbarians and lawless men who infest the landhold out the hand of friendship to all natives who choose to claim her protection from the manstealer and offer to teach them the blessed truths of christianity and the arts of civilisation  many of the men who are best fitted to give an opinion on the point agree in holding that some such centre or centres on the mainland are essential to the permanent cure of slavery although they differ a little as to the best localities for them  take for instance darra salaam on the coast the manganja highlands near the river shire and kartoum on the nile  three such centres would if established begin at once to dry up the slavetrade at its three fountainheads while our cruisers would check it on the coast  in these centres of light and freedom the negroes might see exemplified the blessings of christianity and civilisation and thence trained native missionaries might radiate into all parts of the vast continent armed only with the word of god the shield of faith and the sword of the spirit in order to preach the glad tidings of salvation through jesus christ our lord  in brief the great points on which we ought as a nation to insist are the immediate abolition of the slavetrade in portuguese dependencies the scrupulous fulfilment of treaty obligations by the sultans of zanzibar and muscat the shah of persia and the khedive of egypt the establishment by our government of efficient consular agencies where such are required the acquisition of territory on the mainland for the purposes already mentioned and the united action of all christians in our land to raise funds and send men to preach the gospel to the negro so doing we shall with gods blessing put an end to the eastern slavetrade save equatorial africa and materially increase the commerce the riches and the happiness of the world    chapter twenty four  tells of sad sights and sudden events and unexpected meetings  in the course of time our hero harold seadrift and his faithful ally disco lillihammer after innumerable adventures which we are unwillingly obliged to pass over in silence returned to the coast and in the course of their wanderings in search of a vessel which should convey them to zanzibar found themselves at last in the town of governor letotti  being english travellers they were received as guests by the governor and harold was introduced to senhorina maraquita  passing through the marketplace one day they observed a crowd round the flagstaff in the centre of the square and following the irresistible tendency of human nature in such circumstances ran to see what was going on  they found that a slave was about to be publicly whipped by soldiers the unhappy man was suspended by the wrists from the flagstaff and a single cord of coir round his waist afforded him additional support  come away we can do no good here said harold in a low sorrowful tone which was drowned in the shriek of the victim as the first lash fell on his naked shoulders  praps hes a criminal suggested disco as he hurried away endeavouring to comfort himself with the thought that the man probably deserved punishment  its not the whippin i think so much of he added that is the only thing as will do for some characters but its the awful cruelties that goes along with it  returning through the same square about an hour later having almost forgotten about the slave by that time they were horrified to observe that the wretched man was still hanging there  hastening towards him they found that he was gasping for breath  his veins were bursting and his flesh was deeply lacerated by the cords with which he was suspended  he turned his head as the englishmen approached and spoke a few words which they did not understand but the appealing look of his bloodshot eyes spoke a language that required no interpreter  at an earlier period in their career in africa both harold and disco would have acted on their first impulse and cut the man down but experience had taught them that this style of interference while it put their own lives in jeopardy had sometimes the effect of increasing the punishment and sufferings of those whom they sought to befriend  acting on a wiser plan they resolved to appeal to governor letotti in his behalf  they therefore ran to his residence where maraquita who conversed with harold in french informed them that her father was in the geresa or public palaver house  to that building they hastened and found that it was in the very square they had left  but senhor letotti was not there  he had observed the englishmen coming and having a shrewd guess what their errand was had disappeared and hid himself  his chiefofficer informed them that he had left the town early in the morning and would not return till the afternoon  harold felt quite sure that this was a falsehood but of course was obliged to accept it as truth  is there no one to act for the governor in his absence he asked anxiously  no there was no one but after a few minutes the chiefofficer appeared to be overcome by harolds earnest entreaties and said that he could take upon himself to act that he would suspend the punishment till the governors return when harold might prefer his petition to him in person  accordingly the slave was taken down  in the afternoon harold saw the governor and explained that he did not wish to interfere with his province as a magistrate but that what he had witnessed was so shocking that he availed himself of his privilege as a guest to pray that the mans punishment might be mitigated  governor letottis health had failed him of late and he had suffered some severe disappointments in money matters so that his wonted amiability had been considerably reduced  he objected at first to interfere with the course of justice but finally gave a reluctant consent and the man was pardoned  afterwards however when our travellers were absent from the town for a day the wretched slave was again tied up and the full amount of his punishment inflicted in other words he was flogged to death  for the incident on which this is founded we are indebted to the reverend doctor ryan late bishop of the mauritius  this incident had such an effect on the mind of harold that he resolved no longer to accept the hospitality of governor letotti  he had some difficulty however in persuading himself to carry his resolve into effect for the governor although harsh in his dealing with the slave had been exceedingly kind and amiable to himself but an unexpected event occurred which put an end to his difficulties  this was the illness and sudden death of his host  poor disconsolate maraquita in the first passion of her grief fled to the residence of the only female friend she had in the town and refused firmly to return home  thus it came to pass that harolds intercourse with the senhorina was cut short at its commencement and thus he missed the opportunity of learning something of the fortunes of azinte for it is certain that if they had conversed much together as would probably have been the case had her father lived some mention of the slavegirls name could not fail to have been made and their mutual knowledge of her to have been elicited and interchanged  in those days there was no regular communication between one point and another of the east coast of africa and the neighbouring islands travellers had frequently to wait long for a chance and when they got one were often glad to take advantage of it without being fastidious as to its character  soon after the events above narrated a small trading schooner touched at the port  it was bound for the seychelles intending to return by zanzibar and madagascar and proceed to the cape harold would rather have gone direct to zanzibar but having plenty of time on his hands as well as means he was content to avail himself of the opportunity and took passage in the schooner for himself disco and jumbo  that sable and faithful friend was the only one of his companions who was willing to follow him anywhere on the face of the earth  the others received their pay and their discharge with smiling faces and scattered to their several homesantonio departing to complete his interrupted honeymoon  just before leaving harold sought and obtained permission to visit maraquita to bid her goodbye  the poor child was terribly overwhelmed by the death of her father and could not speak of him without giving way to passionate grief  she told harold that she meant to leave the coast by the first opportunity that should offer and proceed to the cape of good hope where in some part of the interior lived an old aunt the only relative she now had on earth who she knew would be glad to receive her  our hero did his best to comfort the poor girl and expressed deep sympathy with her but felt that his power to console was very small indeed  after a brief interview he bade her farewell  the voyage which our travellers now commenced was likely to be of considerable duration for the seychelles islands lie a long way to the eastward of africa but as we have said time was of no importance to harold and he was not sorry to have an opportunity of visiting a group of islands which are of some celebrity in connexion with the east african slavetrade  thus all unknown to himself or disco as well as to maraquita who would have been intensely interested had she known the fact he was led towards the new abode of our sable heroine azinte  but alas for kambira and obothey were being conveyed also of course unknown to themselves or to any one else further and further away from one whom they would have given their hearts blood to meet with and embrace and it seemed as if there were not a chance of any gleam of light bridging over the ever widening gulf that lay between them for although lieutenant lindsay knew that azinte had been left at the seychelles he had not the remotest idea that kambira was azintes husband and among several hundreds of freed slaves the second lieutenant of the firefly was not likely to single out and hold converse with a chief whose language he did not understand and who as far as appearances went was almost as miserable sickly and degraded as were the rest of the unhappy beings by whom he was surrounded  providence however turned the tide of affairs in favour of kambira and his son  on reaching zanzibar captain romer had learned from the commander of another cruiser that aden was at that time somewhat overwhelmed with freed slaves a considerable number of captures having been recently made about the neighbourhood of that great rendezvous of slavers the island of socotra  the captain therefore changed his mind and once more very unwillingly directed his course towards the distant seychelles  on the way thither many of the poor negroes died but many began to recover strength under the influence of kind treatment and generous diet  among these latter was kambira  his erect gait and manly look soon began to return and his ribs so to speak to disappear  it was otherwise with poor obo  the severity of the treatment to which he had been exposed was almost too much for so young a frame  he lost appetite and slowly declined notwithstanding the doctors utmost care  this state of things continuing until the firefly arrived at the seychelles obo was at once conveyed to the hospital which we have referred to as having been established there  azinte chanced to be absent in the neighbouring town on some errand connected with her duties as nurse when her boy was laid on his bed beside a number of similar sufferers  it was a sad sight to behold these little ones  out of the original eightythree children who had been placed there fortyseven had died in three weeks and the remnant were still in a pitiable condition  while on their beds of pain tossing about in their delirium the minds of these little ones frequently ran back to their forest homes and while some in spirit laughed and romped once more around their huts thousands of miles away on the banks of some african river others called aloud in their sufferings for the dearest of all earthly beings to themtheir mothers some of them also whispered the name of jesus for the missionary had been careful to tell them the story of our loving lord while tending their poor bodies  obo had fevered slightly and in the restless halfslumber into which he fell on being put to bed he too called earnestly for his mother  in his case poor child the call was not in vain  lieutenant lindsay and the doctor of the ship with kambira had accompanied obo to the hospital  now lindsay said the doctor when the child had been made as comfortable as circumstances would admit of this man must not be left here for he will be useless and it is of the utmost consequence that the child should have some days of absolute repose  what shall we do with him  take him on board again said lindsay  i daresay we shall find him employment for a short time  if you will allow me to take charge of him interposed the missionary who was standing by them at the time i can easily find him employment in the neighbourhood so that he can come occasionally to see his child when we think it safe to allow him  that will be the better plan said the doctor for as long as  a short sharp cry near the door of the room cut the sentence short  all eyes were turned in that direction and they beheld azinte gazing wildly at them and standing as if transformed to stone  the instant kambira saw his wife he leaped up as if he had received an electric shock bounded forward like a panther uttered a shout that did full credit to the chief of a warlike african tribe and seized azinte in his arms  no wonder that thirtysix little black heads leaped from thirtysix little white pillows and displayed all the whites of seventytwo eyes that were anything but little when this astonishing scene took place  but kambira quickly recovered himself and grasping azinte by the arm led her gently towards the bed which had just been occupied and pointed to the little one that slumbered uneasily there  strangely enough just at the moment little obo again whispered the word mother  poor azintes eyes seemed ready to start from their sockets  she stretched out her arms and tried to rush towards her child but kambira held her back  obo is very sick he said you must touch him tenderly  the chief looked into his wifes eyes saw that she understood him and let her go  azinte crept softly to the bed knelt down beside it and put her arms so softly round obo that she scarcely moved him yet she gradually drew him towards her until his head rested on her swelling bosom and she pressed her lips tenderly upon his brow  it was an old familiar attitude which seemed to pierce the slumbers of the child with a pleasant reminiscence and dissipate his malady for he heaved a deep sigh of contentment and sank into profound repose  good said the doctor in a low tone with a significant nod to lindsay when an interpreter had explained what had been already guessed by all present that kambira and azinte were man and wife obo has a better chance now of recovery than i had anticipated for joy goes a long way towards effecting a cure  come we will leave them together  kambira was naturally anxious to remain but like all commanding spirits he had long ago learned that cardinal virtue obedience to whom obedience is due  when it was explained to him that it would be for obos advantage to be left alone with his mother for a time he arose bowed his head and meekly followed his friends out of the room  exactly one week from that date little obo had recovered so much of his former health that he was permitted to go out into the air and a few days later lieutenant lindsay resolved to take him and his father and mother on board the firefly by way of a little ploy  in pursuance of this plan he set off from the hospital in company with kambira followed at a short distance by azinte and obo  poor lindsay his heart was heavy while he did his best to convey in dumb show his congratulations to kambira for he saw in this unexpected reunion an insurmountable difficulty in the way of taking azinte back to her former mistressnot that he had ever seen the remotest chance of his being able to achieve that desirable end before this difficulty arose but love is at times insanely hopeful just as at other times and with equally little reasonit is madly despairing  he had just made some complicated signs with hands mouth and eyebrows and had succeeded in rendering himself altogether incomprehensible to his sable companion when on rounding a turn of the path that led to the harbour he found himself suddenly face to face with harold seadrift disco lillihammer and their follower jumbo all of whom had landed from a schooner which about an hour before had cast anchor in the bay  mr lindsay  mr seadrift exclaimed each to the other simultaneously for the reader will remember that they had met once before when our heroes were rescued from yoosoof by the firefly  kambira shouted disco  azinte cried harold as our sable heroine came into view  obo roared the stricken mariner  jumbo could only vent his feelings in an appalling yell and an impromptu wardance round the party in which he was joined by disco who performed a hornpipe with obo in his arms to the intense delight of that convalescent youngster  thus laughing questioning shouting and dancing they all effervesced towards the shore like a band of lunatics just escaped from bedlam    chapter twenty five  the last  how comes it said lieutenant lindsay to harold on the first favourable opportunity that occurred after the meeting described in the last chapter how comes it that you and kambira know each other so well  i might reply by asking said harold with a smile how comes it that you are so well acquainted with azinte but before putting that question i will give a satisfactory answer to your own  hereupon he gave a brief outline of those events already narrated in full to the reader which bore on his first meeting with the slavegirl and his subsequent sojourn with her husband  after leaving the interior continued our hero and returning to the coast i visited various towns in order to observe the state of the slaves in the portuguese settlements and truly what i saw was most deplorabledemoralisation and cruelty and the obstruction of lawful trade prevailed everywhere  the settlements are to my mind a very pandemonium on earth  every one seemed to me more or less affected by the accursed atmosphere that prevails  of course there must be some exceptions  i met with one at the last town i visited in the person of governor letotti  letotti exclaimed lindsay stopping abruptly  yes said harold in some surprise at the lieutenants manner and a most amiable man he was  waswas  what do you mean  isis he dead exclaimed lindsay turning pale  he died suddenly just before i left said harold  and maraquitai mean his daughterwhat of her asked the lieutenant turning as red as he had previously turned pale  harold noted the change and a gleam of light seemed to break upon him as he replied  poor girl she was overwhelmed at first by the heavy blow  i had to quit the place almost immediately after the event  did you know her well asked lindsay with an uneasy glance at his companions handsome face  no i had just been introduced to her shortly before her fathers death and have scarcely exchanged a dozen sentences with her  it is said that her father died in debt but of course in regard to that i know nothing certainly  at parting she told me that she meant to leave the coast and go to stay with a relative at the cape  the poor lieutenants look on hearing this was so peculiar not to say alarming that harold could not help referring to it and lindsay was so much overwhelmed by such unexpected news and withal so strongly attracted by harolds sympathetic manner that he straightway made a confidant of him told him of his love for maraquita of maraquitas love for azinte of the utter impossibility of his being able to take azinte back to her old mistress now that she had found her husband and child even if it had been admissible for a lieutenant in the british navy to return freed negroes again into slavery and wound up with bitter lamentations as to his unhappy fate and expressions of poignant regret that fighting and other desperate means congenial and easy to his disposition were not available in the circumstances  after which explosion he subsided felt ashamed of having thus committed himself and looked rather foolish  but harold quickly put him at his ease  he entered on the subject with earnest gravity  it strikes me lindsay he said thoughtfully after the lieutenant had finished that i can aid you in this affair but you must not ask me how at present  give me a few hours to think over it and then i shall have matured my plans  of course the lieutenant hailed with heartfelt gratitude the gleam of hope held out to him and thus the friends parted for a time  that same afternoon harold sat under a palmtree in company with disco jumbo kambira azinte and obo  how would you like to go with me to the cape of good hope kambira asked harold abruptly  whar dat asked the chief through jumbo  far away to the south of africa answered harold  you know that you can never go back to your own land now unless you want to be again enslaved  him say him no want to go back interpreted jumbo got all him care for nowazinte and obo  then do you agree to go with me said harold  to this kambira replied heartily that he did  wy wot do ee mean for to do with em asked disco in some surprise  i will get them comfortably settled there replied harold  my father has a business friend in cape town who will easily manage to put me in the way of doing it  besides i have a particular reason for wishing to take azinte thereask her jumbo if she remembers a young lady named senhorina maraquita letotti  to this azinte replied that she did and the way in which her eyes sparkled proved that she remembered her with intense pleasure  well tell her rejoined harold that maraquita has grieved very much at losing her and is very anxious to get her back againnot as a slave but as a friend for no slavery is allowed in english settlements anywhere and i am sure that maraquita hates slavery as much as i do though she is not english so i intend to take her and kambira and obo to the cape where maraquita is livingor will be living soon  ye dont stick at trifles sir said disco whose eyes on hearing this assumed a thoughtful almost a troubled look  my plan does not seem to please you said harold  please me sir wy shouldnt it please me  in course you knows best i was only a little puzzled thats all  disco said no more but he thought a good deal for he had noted the beauty and sprightliness of maraquita and the admiration with which harold had first beheld her and it seemed to him that this rather powerful method of attempting to gratify the portuguese girl was proof positive that harold had lost his heart to her  harold guessed what was running in discos mind but did not care to undeceive him as in so doing he might run some risk of betraying the trust reposed in him by lindsay  the captain of the schooner being bound for the cape after visiting zanzibar was willing to take these additional passengers and the anxious lieutenant was induced to postpone total and irrevocable despair although maraquita being poor and he being poor and promotion in the service being very slow he had little reason to believe his prospects much brighter than they were beforepoor fellow    time passed on rapid wingas time is notoriously prone to doand the fortunes of our dramatis personae varied somewhat  captain romer continued to roam the eastern seas along with brother captains and spent his labour and strength in rescuing a few hundreds of captives from among the hundreds of thousands that were continually flowing out of unhappy africa  yoosoof and moosa continued to throw a boatload or two of damaged cattle in the way of the british cruisers as a decoy and succeeded on the whole pretty well in running full cargoes of valuable black ivory to the northern markets  the sultan of zanzibar continued to assure the british consul that he heartily sympathised with england in her desire to abolish slavery and to allow his officials for a consideration to prosecute the slavetrade to any extent they pleased  portugal continued to assure england of her sympathy and cooperation in the good work of repression and her subjects on the east coast of africa continued to export thousands of slaves under the protection of the portuguese and french flags styling them free engages  britishindian subjectsthe banyans of zanzibarcontinued to furnish the sinews of war which kept the gigantic trade in human flesh going on merrily  murders etcetera continued to be perpetrated tribes to be plundered and hearts to be brokenof course legally and domestically as well as piratically during this rapid flight of time  but nearly everything in this life has its bright lights and halftints as well as its deep shadows  during the same flight of time humane individuals have continued to urge on the good cause of the total abolition of slavery and christian missionaries have continued despite the difficulties of slavetrade climate and human apathy to sow here and there on the coasts the precious seed of gospel truth which we trust shall yet be sown broadcast by native hands throughout the length and breadth of that mighty land  to come more closely to the subjects of our tale  chimbolo with his recovered wife and child sought safety from the slavers in the far interior and continued to think with pleasure and gratitude of the two englishmen who hated slavery and who had gone to africa just in the nick of time to rescue that unhappy slave who had been almost flogged to death and was on the point of being drowned in the zambesi in a sack  mokompa also continued to poetise as in days gone by having made a safe retreat with chimbolo and among other things enshrined all the deeds of the two white men in native verse yambo continued to extol play admire and propagate the lifesized jumpingjack to such an extent that unless his career has been cut short by the slavers we fully expect to find that creature a domestic institution when the slavetrade has been crushed and africa opened upas in the end it is certain to be  during the progress and continuance of all these things you may be sure our hero was not idle  he sailed as proposed with kambira azinte obo disco and jumbo for zanzibar touched at the town over which poor senhor francisco alfonso toledo bignoso letotti had ruled found that the senhorina had taken her departure followed as disco said in her wake reached the cape hunted her up found her out and presented to her with lieutenant lindsays compliments the african chief kambira his wife azinte and his son obo  poor maraquita being of a passionately affectionate and romantic disposition went nearly mad with joy and bestowed so many grateful glances and smiles on harold that discos suspicions were confirmed and that bold mariner wished her maraquita at the bottom of the sea for disco disliked foreigners and could not bear the thought of his friend being caught by one of them  maraquita introduced harold to her aunt a middleaged leatherskinned excessively darkeyed daughter of portugal  she also introduced him to a bosom friend at that time on a visit to her aunt  the bosom friend was an auburnhaired fairskinned cheerfulspirited english girl before her harold seadrift at once without an instants warning fell flat down figuratively speaking of course and remained sostricken through the heart  the exigencies of our tale require at this point that we should draw our outline with a bold and rapid pencil  disco lillihammer was stunned and so was jumbo when harold some weeks after their arrival at the cape informed them that he was engaged to be married to alice gray only daughter of the late sir eustace gray who had been mp for some county in england which he had forgotten the name of alice not having been able to recall it as her father had died when she was four years old leaving her a fortune of nexttonothing a year and a sweet temper  being incapable of further stunning disco was rather revived than otherwise and his dark shadow was resuscitated when harold added that kambira had become maraquitas headgardener azinte cook to the establishment and obo pageinwaitingmore probably pageinmischief to the young senhorina  but both disco and jumbo had a relapse from which they were long of recovering when harold went on to say that he meant to sail for england by the next mail take jumbo with him as valet make proposals to his father to establish a branch of their house at the cape come back to manage the branch marry alice and reside in the neighbourhood of the senhorina maraquita letottis dwelling  you means wot you say i spose asked disco  of course i do said harold  an yer goin to take jumbo as yer walley  yes  hm ill go too as yer keeper  my what  yer keeperyer straitveskit buckler for if you aint a loonatic ye ought to be  but disco did not go to england in that capacity  he remained at the cape to assist kambira at the express command of maraquita and continued there until harold returned bringing lieutenant lindsay with him as a partner in the business until harold was married and required a gardener for his own domain until the senhorina became mrs lindsay until a large and thriving band of little cape colonists found it necessary to have a general storyteller and adventurerecounter with a nautical turn of mind until in short he found it convenient to go to england himself for the gal of his heart who had been photographed there years before and could be rubbed off neither by sickness sunstroke nor adversity  when disco had returned to the colony with the original of the said photograph and had fairly settled down on his own farm then it was that he was wont at eventide to assemble the little colonists round him light his pipe and through its hazy influence recount his experiences and deliver his opinions on the slavetrade of east africa sometimes he was pathetic sometimes humorous but however jocular he might be on other subjects he invariably became very grave and very earnest when he touched on the latter theme  theres only one way to cure it he was wont to say and that is to bring the portuguese and arabs to their marrowbones put the fleet on the east coast in better workin order have consuls everywhere with orders to keep their weathereyes open to the slavedealers start two or three british settlementsports o refugeon the mainland hoist the union jack and last but not least send em the bible  we earnestly commend the substance of discos opinions to the reader for there is urgent need for action  there is death where life should be ashes instead of beauty desolation in place of fertility and even while we write terrible activity in the horrible traffic inblack ivory  the end
