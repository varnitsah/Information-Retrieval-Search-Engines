77662276	going into society   at one period of its reverses the house fell into the occupation of a showman  he was found registered as its occupier on the parish books of the time when he rented the house and there was therefore no need of any clue to his name  but he himself was less easy to be found for he had led a wandering life and settled people had lost sight of him and people who plumed themselves on being respectable were shy of admitting that they had ever known anything of him  at last among the marsh lands near the rivers level that lie about deptford and the neighbouring marketgardens a grizzled personage in velveteen with a face so cut up by varieties of weather that he looked as if he had been tattooed was found smoking a pipe at the door of a wooden house on wheels  the wooden house was laid up in ordinary for the winter near the mouth of a muddy creek and everything near it the foggy river the misty marshes and the steaming marketgardens smoked in company with the grizzled man  in the midst of this smoking party the funnelchimney of the wooden house on wheels was not remiss but took its pipe with the rest in a companionable manner  on being asked if it were he who had once rented the house to let grizzled velveteen looked surprised and said yes  then his name was magsman  that was it toby magsmanwhich lawfully christened robert but called in the line from a infant toby  there was nothing agin toby magsman he believed  if there was suspicion of suchmention it  there was no suspicion of such he might rest assured  but some inquiries were making about that house and would he object to say why he left it  not at all why should he  he left it along of a dwarf  along of a dwarf  mr magsman repeated deliberately and emphatically along of a dwarf  might it be compatible with mr magsmans inclination and convenience to enter as a favour into a few particulars  mr magsman entered into the following particulars  it was a long time ago to begin withafore lotteries and a deal more was done away with  mr magsman was looking about for a good pitch and he see that house and he says to himself ill have you if youre to be had  if moneyll get you ill have you  the neighbours cut up rough and made complaints but mr magsman dont know what they would have had  it was a lovely thing  first of all there was the canvass representin the picter of the giant in spanish trunks and a ruff who was himself half the heighth of the house and was run up with a line and pulley to a pole on the roof so that his ed was coeval with the parapet  then there was the canvass representin the picter of the albina lady showing her white air to the army and navy in correct uniform  then there was the canvass representin the picter of the wild indian a scalpin a member of some foreign nation  then there was the canvass representin the picter of a child of a british planter seized by two boa constrictorsnot that we never had no child nor no constrictors neither  similarly there was the canvass representin the picter of the wild ass of the prairiesnot that we never had no wild asses nor wouldnt have had em at a gift  last there was the canvass representin the picter of the dwarf and like him too considerin with george the fourth in such a state of astonishment at him as his majesty couldnt with his utmost politeness and stoutness express  the front of the house was so covered with canvasses that there wasnt a spark of daylight ever visible on that side  magsmans amusements fifteen foot long by two foot high ran over the front door and parlour winders  the passage was a arbour of green baize and gardenstuff  a barrelorgan performed there unceasing  and as to respectabilityif threepence aint respectable what is  but the dwarf is the principal article at present and he was worth the money  he was wrote up as major tpschoffki of the imperial bulgraderian brigade  nobody couldnt pronounce the name and it never was intended anybody should  the public always turned it as a regular rule into chopski  in the line he was called chops partly on that account and partly because his real name if he ever had any real name which was very dubious was stakes  he was a uncommon small man he really was  certainly not so small as he was made out to be but where is your dwarf as is  he was a most uncommon small man with a most uncommon large ed and what he had inside that ed nobody ever knowed but himself even supposin himself to have ever took stock of it which it would have been a stiff job for even him to do  the kindest little man as never growed  spirited but not proud  when he travelled with the spotted babythough he knowed himself to be a natral dwarf and knowed the babys spots to be put upon him artificial he nursed that baby like a mother  you never heerd him give a illname to a giant  he did allow himself to break out into strong language respectin the fat lady from norfolk but that was an affair of the art and when a mans art has been trifled with by a lady and the preference giv to a indian he aint master of his actions  he was always in love of course every human natral phenomenon is  and he was always in love with a large woman i never knowed the dwarf as could be got to love a small one  which helps to keep em the curiosities they are  one singler idea he had in that ed of his which must have meant something or it wouldnt have been there  it was always his opinion that he was entitled to property  he never would put his name to anything  he had been taught to write by the young man without arms who got his living with his toes quite a writing master he was and taught scores in the line but chops would have starved to death afore hed have gained a bit of bread by putting his hand to a paper  this is the more curious to bear in mind because he had no property nor hope of property except his house and a sarser  when i say his house i mean the box painted and got up outside like a reglar sixroomer that he used to creep into with a diamond ring or quite as good to look at on his forefinger and ring a little bell out of what the public believed to be the drawingroom winder  and when i say a sarser i mean a chaney sarser in which he made a collection for himself at the end of every entertainment  his cue for that he took from me ladies and gentlemen the little man will now walk three times round the cairawan and retire behind the curtain  when he said anything important in private life he mostly wound it up with this form of words and they was generally the last thing he said to me at night afore he went to bed  he had what i consider a fine minda poetic mind  his ideas respectin his property never come upon him so strong as when he sat upon a barrel organ and had the handle turned  arter the wibration had run through him a little time he would screech out toby i feel my property cominggrind away  im counting my guineas by thousands tobygrind away  toby i shall be a man of fortun  i feel the mint a jingling in me toby and im swelling out into the bank of england  such is the influence of music on a poetic mind  not that he was partial to any other music but a barrelorgan on the contrary hated it  he had a kind of a everlasting grudge agin the public which is a thing you may notice in many phenomenons that get their living out of it  what riled him most in the nater of his occupation was that it kep him out of society  he was continiwally saying toby my ambition is to go into society  the curse of my position towards the public is that it keeps me hout of society  this dont signify to a low beast of a indian he ant formed for society  this dont signify to a spotted baby he ant formed for societyi am  nobody never could make out what chops done with his money  he had a good salary down on the drum every saturday as the day came round besides having the run of his teethand he was a woodpecker to eatbut all dwarfs are  the sarser was a little income bringing him in so many halfpence that hed carry em for a week together tied up in a pocket handkercher  and yet he never had money  and it couldnt be the fat lady from norfolk as was once supposed because it stands to reason that when you have a animosity towards a indian which makes you grind your teeth at him to his face and which can hardly hold you from goosing him audible when hes going through his wardanceit stands to reason you wouldnt under them circumstances deprive yourself to support that indian in the lap of luxury  most unexpected the mystery come out one day at egham races  the public was shy of bein pulled in and chops was ringin his little bell out of his drawingroom winder and was snarlin to me over his shoulder as he kneeled down with his legs out at the backdoorfor he couldnt be shoved into his house without kneeling down and the premises wouldnt accommodate his legswas snarlin heres a precious public for you why the devil dont they tumble up when a man in the crowd holds up a carrierpigeon and cries out if theres any person here as has got a ticket the lotterys just drawed and the number as has come up for the great prize is three seven fortytwo  three seven fortytwo  i was givin the man to the furies myself for calling off the publics attentionfor the public will turn away at any time to look at anything in preference to the thing showed em and if you doubt it get em together for any indiwidual purpose on the face of the earth and send only two people in late and see if the whole company ant far more interested in takin particular notice of them two than of youi say i wasnt best pleased with the man for callin out and wasnt blessin him in my own mind when i see chopss little bell fly out of winder at a old lady and he gets up and kicks his box over exposin the whole secret and he catches hold of the calves of my legs and he says to me carry me into the wan toby and throw a pail of water over me or im a dead man for ive come into my property  twelve thousand odd hundred pound was chopss winnins  he had bought a halfticket for the twentyfive thousand prize and it had come up  the first use he made of his property was to offer to fight the wild indian for five hundred pound a side him with a poisoned darninneedle and the indian with a club but the indian being in want of backers to that amount it went no further  arter he had been mad for a weekin a state of mind in short in which if i had let him sit on the organ for only two minutes i believe he would have bustbut we kep the organ from himmr chops come round and behaved liberal and beautiful to all  he then sent for a young man he knowed as had a wery genteel appearance and was a bonnet at a gaming booth most respectable brought up father havin been imminent in the livery stable line but unfortnate in a commercial crisis through paintin a old gray gingerbay and sellin him with a pedigree and mr chops said to this bonnet who said his name was normandy which it wasnt  normandy im a goin into society  will you go with me  says normandy do i understand you mr chops to hintimate that the ole of the expenses of that move will be borne by yourself  correct says mr chops  and you shall have a princely allowance too  the bonnet lifted mr chops upon a chair to shake hands with him and replied in poetry with his eyes seemingly full of tears     my boat is on the shore    and my bark is on the sea    and i do not ask for more    but ill goalong with thee  they went into society in a chay and four grays with silk jackets  they took lodgings in pall mall london and they blazed away  in consequence of a note that was brought to bartlemy fair in the autumn of next year by a servant most wonderful got up in milkwhite cords and tops i cleaned myself and went to pall mall one evening appinted  the gentlemen was at their wine arter dinner and mr chopss eyes was more fixed in that ed of his than i thought good for him  there was three of em in company i mean and i knowed the third well  when last met he had on a white roman shirt and a bishops mitre covered with leopard skin and played the clarionet all wrong in a band at a wild beast show  this gent took on not to know me and mr chops said gentlemen this is a old friend of former days and normandy looked at me through a eye glass and said magsman glad to see youwhich ill take my oath he wasnt  mr chops to git him convenient to the table had his chair on a throne much of the form of george the fourths in the canvass but he hardly appeared to me to be king there in any other pint of view for his two gentlemen ordered about like emperors  they was all dressed like may daygorgeousand as to wine they swam in all sorts  i made the round of the bottles first separate to say i had done it and then mixed em all together to say i had done it and then tried two of em as halfandhalf and then tother two  altogether i passed a pleasin evenin but with a tendency to feel muddled until i considered it good manners to get up and say mr chops the best of friends must part i thank you for the wariety of foreign drains you have stood so ansome i looks towards you in red wine and i takes my leave  mr chops replied if youll just hitch me out of this over your right arm magsman and carry me downstairs ill see you out  i said i couldnt think of such a thing but he would have it so i lifted him off his throne  he smelt strong of maideary and i couldnt help thinking as i carried him down that it was like carrying a large bottle full of wine with a rayther ugly stopper a good deal out of proportion  when i set him on the doormat in the hall he kep me close to him by holding on to my coatcollar and he whispers  i aint appy magsman  whats on your mind mr chops  they dont use me well  they ant grateful to me  they puts me on the mantelpiece when i wont have in more champagnewine and they locks me in the sideboard when i wont give up my property  get rid of em mr chops  i cant  were in society together and what would society say  come out of society says i  i cant  you dont know what youre talking about  when you have once gone into society you mustnt come out of it  then if youll excuse the freedom mr chops were my remark shaking my head grave i think its a pity you ever went in  mr chops shook that deep ed of his to a surprisin extent and slapped it half a dozen times with his hand and with more wice than i thought were in him  then he says youre a good fellow but you dont understand  goodnight go along  magsman the little man will now walk three times round the cairawan and retire behind the curtain  the last i see of him on that occasion was his tryin on the extremest werge of insensibility to climb up the stairs one by one with his hands and knees  theyd have been much too steep for him if he had been sober but he wouldnt be helped  it warnt long after that that i read in the newspaper of mr chopss being presented at court  it was printed it will be recollectedand ive noticed in my life that it is sure to be printed that it will be recollected whenever it wontthat mr chops is the individual of small stature whose brilliant success in the last state lottery attracted so much attention  well i says to myself such is life  he has been and done it in earnest at last  he has astonished george the fourth  on account of which i had that canvass newpainted him with a bag of money in his hand a presentin it to george the fourth and a lady in ostrich feathers fallin in love with him in a bagwig sword and buckles correct  i took the house as is the subject of present inquiriesthough not the honour of bein acquaintedand i run magsmans amusements in it thirteen monthssometimes one thing sometimes another sometimes nothin particular but always all the canvasses outside  one night when we had played the last company out which was a shy company through its raining heavens hard i was takin a pipe in the one pair back along with the young man with the toes which i had taken on for a month though he never drawedexcept on paper and i heard a kickin at the street door halloa i says to the young man whats up  he rubs his eyebrows with his toes and he says i cant imagine mr magsmanwhich he never could imagine nothin and was monotonous company  the noise not leavin off i laid down my pipe and i took up a candle and i went down and opened the door  i looked out into the street but nothin could i see and nothin was i aware of until i turned round quick because some creetur run between my legs into the passage  there was mr chops  magsman he says take me on the old terms and youve got me if its done say done  i was all of a maze but i said done sir  done to your done and double done says he  have you got a bit of supper in the house  bearin in mind them sparklin warieties of foreign drains as wed guzzled away at in pall mall i was ashamed to offer him cold sassages and gin andwater but he took em both and took em free havin a chair for his table and sittin down at it on a stool like hold times  i all of a maze all the while  it was arter he had made a clean sweep of the sassages beef and to the best of my calculations two pound and a quarter that the wisdom as was in that little man began to come out of him like prespiration  magsman he says look upon me  you see afore you one as has both gone into society and come out  o  you are out of it mr chops  how did you get out sir  sold out says he  you never saw the like of the wisdom as his ed expressed when he made use of them two words  my friend magsman ill impart to you a discovery ive made  its wallable its cost twelve thousand five hundred pound it may do you good in lifethe secret of this matter is that it aint so much that a person goes into society as that society goes into a person  not exactly keepin up with his meanin i shook my head put on a deep look and said youre right there mr chops  magsman he says twitchin me by the leg society has gone into me to the tune of every penny of my property  i felt that i went pale and though natrally a bold speaker i couldnt hardly say wheres normandy  bolted  with the plate said mr chops  and tother one meaning him as formerly wore the bishops mitre  bolted  with the jewels said mr chops  i sat down and looked at him and he stood up and looked at me  magsman he says and he seemed to myself to get wiser as he got hoarser society taken in the lump is all dwarfs  at the court of st jamess they was all a doing my old businessall a goin three times round the cairawan in the hold courtsuits and properties  elsewheres they was most of em ringin their little bells out of makebelieves everywheres the sarser was a goin round  magsman the sarser is the uniwersal institution  i perceived you understand that he was soured by his misfortunes and i felt for mr chops  as to fat ladies he says giving his head a tremendious one agin the wall theres lots of them in society and worse than the original hers was a outrage upon tastesimply a outrage upon tasteawakenin contemptcarryin its own punishment in the form of a indian  here he giv himself another tremendious one  but theirs magsman theirs is mercenary outrages  lay in cashmeer shawls buy bracelets strew em and a lot of andsome fans and things about your rooms let it be known that you give away like water to all as come to admire and the fat ladies that dont exhibit for so much down upon the drum will come from all the pints of the compass to flock about you whatever you are  theyll drill holes in your art magsman like a cullender  and when youve no more left to give theyll laugh at you to your face and leave you to have your bones picked dry by wulturs like the dead wild ass of the prairies that you deserve to be  here he giv himself the most tremendious one of all and dropped  i thought he was gone  his ed was so heavy and he knocked it so hard and he fell so stoney and the sassagerial disturbance in him must have been so immense that i thought he was gone  but he soon come round with care and he sat up on the floor and he said to me with wisdom comin out of his eyes if ever it come  magsman  the most material difference between the two states of existence through which your unhappy friend has passed he reached out his poor little hand and his tears dropped down on the moustachio which it was a credit to him to have done his best to grow but it is not in mortals to command successthe difference this  when i was out of society i was paid light for being seen  when i went into society i paid heavy for being seen  i prefer the former even if i wasnt forced upon it  give me out through the trumpet in the hold way tomorrow  arter that he slid into the line again as easy as if he had been iled all over  but the organ was kep from him and no allusions was ever made when a company was in to his property  he got wiser every day his views of society and the public was luminous bewilderin awful and his ed got bigger and bigger as his wisdom expanded it  he took well and pulled em in most excellent for nine weeks  at the expiration of that period when his ed was a sight he expressed one evenin the last company havin been turned out and the door shut a wish to have a little music  mr chops i said i never dropped the mr with him the world might do it but not me mr chops are you sure as you are in a state of mind and body to sit upon the organ  his answer was this toby when next met with on the tramp i forgive her and the indian  and i am  it was with fear and trembling that i began to turn the handle but he sat like a lamb  i will be my belief to my dying day that i see his ed expand as he sat you may therefore judge how great his thoughts was  he sat out all the changes and then he come off  toby he says with a quiet smile the little man will now walk three times round the cairawan and retire behind the curtain  when we called him in the morning we found him gone into a much better society than mine or pall malls  i giv mr chops as comfortable a funeral as lay in my power followed myself as chief and had the george the fourth canvass carried first in the form of a banner  but the house was so dismal arterwards that i giv it up and took to the wan again        i dont triumph said jarber folding up the second manuscript and looking hard at trottle  i dont triumph over this worthy creature  i merely ask him if he is satisfied now  how can he be anything else i said answering for trottle who sat obstinately silent  this time jarber you have not only read us a delightfully amusing story but you have also answered the question about the house  of course it stands empty now  who would think of taking it after it had been turned into a caravan  i looked at trottle as i said those last words and jarber waved his hand indulgently in the same direction  let this excellent person speak said jarber  you were about to say my good man  i only wished to ask sir said trottle doggedly if you could kindly oblige me with a date or two in connection with that last story  a date repeated jarber  what does the man want with dates  i should be glad to know with great respect persisted trottle if the person named magsman was the last tenant who lived in the house  its my opinionif i may be excused for giving itthat he most decidedly was not  with those words trottle made a low bow and quietly left the room  there is no denying that jarber when we were left together looked sadly discomposed  he had evidently forgotten to inquire about dates and in spite of his magnificent talk about his series of discoveries it was quite as plain that the two stories he had just read had really and truly exhausted his present stock  i thought myself bound in common gratitude to help him out of his embarrassment by a timely suggestion so i proposed that he should come to tea again on the next monday evening the thirteenth and should make such inquiries in the meantime as might enable him to dispose triumphantly of trottles objection  he gallantly kissed my hand made a neat little speech of acknowledgment and took his leave  for the rest of the week i would not encourage trottle by allowing him to refer to the house at all  i suspected he was making his own inquiries about dates but i put no questions to him  on monday evening the thirteenth that dear unfortunate jarber came punctual to the appointed time  he looked so terribly harassed that he was really quite a spectacle of feebleness and fatigue  i saw at a glance that the question of dates had gone against him that mr magsman had not been the last tenant of the house and that the reason of its emptiness was still to seek  what i have gone through said jarber words are not eloquent enough to tell  o sophonisba i have begun another series of discoveries accept the last two as stories laid on your shrine and wait to blame me for leaving your curiosity unappeased until you have heard number three  number three looked like a very short manuscript and i said as much jarber explained to me that we were to have some poetry this time  in the course of his investigations he had stepped into the circulating library to seek for information on the one important subject  all the librarypeople knew about the house was that a female relative of the last tenant as they believed had just after that tenant left sent a little manuscript poem to them which she described as referring to events that had actually passed in the house and which she wanted the proprietor of the library to publish  she had written no address on her letter and the proprietor had kept the manuscript ready to be given back to her the publishing of poems not being in his line when she might call for it  she had never called for it and the poem had been lent to jarber at his express request to read to me  before he began i rang the bell for trottle being determined to have him present at the new reading as a wholesome check on his obstinacy  to my surprise peggy answered the bell and told me that trottle had stepped out without saying where  i instantly felt the strongest possible conviction that he was at his old tricks and that his stepping out in the evening without leave meantphilandering  controlling myself on my visitors account i dismissed peggy stifled my indignation and prepared as politely as might be to listen to jarber
