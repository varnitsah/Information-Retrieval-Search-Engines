beric the briton in freedoms cause the lion of the north the young carthaginian under wellingtons command c  illustrated by walter paget  london  blackie  son limited 50 old bailey ec glasgow and dublin     preface   there are few difficulties that cannot be surmounted by patience resolution and pluck and great as are the obstacles that nature and the russian government oppose to an escape from the prisons of siberia such evasions have occasionally been successfully carried out and that under far less advantageous circumstances than those under which the hero of this story undertook the venture for the account of life in the convict establishments in siberia i am indebted to the very valuable books by my friend the rev dr lansdell who has made himself thoroughly acquainted with siberia traversing the country from end to end and visiting all the principal prisons he conversed not only with officials but with many of the prisoners and convicts and with russian and foreign residents in the country and his testimony as to the management of the prisons and the condition of the convicts is confirmed by other independent writers personally cognizant of the facts and like

in one of the studies at shrewsbury a packed portmanteau and the general state of litter on the floor was sufficient to show that it was the last day of term  well i am awfully sorry you are going bullen we shall all miss you you would certainly have been in the football team next term it is a nuisance altogether  it is a nuisance and i am beastly sorry i am leaving of course i have known for some time that i should be going out to russia but i did not think the governor would have sent me until after i had gone through the school his letter a fortnight ago was a regular stumper i thought i should have had another year and a half or two years and of course that is just the jolliest part of school life however it cannot be helped  you talk the language dont you bullen  well i used to talk it but i dont remember much about it now you see i have been home six years i expect i shall pick it up again fast enough i should not mind it so much if the governor were out there still but you see he came home for good two years ago still it wont be like going to a strange place altogether and as he has been living there so long i shall soon get to know lots of the english there still i do wish i could have had a couple of years more at shrewsbury i should have been content to have gone out then  well it is time for us to be starting i can hear the omnibus  in a few minutes the omnibus was filled with luggage inside and out the lads started to walk to the station as the train drew up there were hearty goodbyes and then the train steamed out of the station the compartment in which godfrey bullen had taken his seat being filled with boys going like himself straight through to town all were in high spirits and bullen who had felt sorry at leaving school for the last time was soon as merry as any of them  you must mind what you are up to bullen one of his companions said they are terrible fellows those nihilists they say  they wont hurt bullen another put in unless he goes into the secret police i should say he would make a good sort of secret policeman  no no he is more likely to turn a nihilist  bosh bullen said laughing i am not likely to turn a secret policeman but i am more likely to do that than to turn nihilist i hate revolutionists and assassins and all those sort of fellows  yes we all know that you are a tory bullen but people change you know i hope we shall never see among the lists of nihilists tried for sedition and conspiracy and sentenced to execution the name of one godfrey bullen  oh they wouldnt execute bullen another said they would send him to siberia bullens always good at fighting an uphill game and he would show off to great advantage in a chaingang do they crop their hair there bullen and put on a gray suit as i saw them at work in portsmouth dockyard last year  i am more likely to see you working in a chaingang at portsmouth wilkinson when i come back than i am to form part of a convict gang in siberiaat any rate for being a nihilist i wont say about other things for i suppose there is no saying what a fellow may come to i dont suppose any of the men who get penal servitude for forgery and swindling and so on ever have any idea when they are sixteen that that is what they are coming to at present i dont feel any inclination that way  i should say you were not likely to turn forger anyhow bullen whatever you take to  why is that parker  because you write such a thundering bad hand that you would never be able to imitate anyone elses signature unless he couldnt go farther than making a cross for his name and the betting is about even that you would blot that  there was a roar of laughter for bullens handwriting was a perpetual source of trouble to him and he was continually losing marks for his exercises in consequence he joined heartily in the laugh  it is an awful nuisance that handwriting of mine he said especially when one is going to be a merchant you know the governor has talked two or three times about my going to one of those fellows who teach you to write copperplate in twenty lessons i shouldnt be surprised if he does let me have a course these holidays i should not mind if he does for my writing is disgusting  never mind bullen bad handwriting is a sign of genius you know you have never shown any particular genius yet except for rowing and boxing and i suppose that is muscular genius but you may blossom out in a new line some day  i dont want to disturb the harmony of this last meeting parker or i should bring my muscular genius into play at your expense  no no bullen another boy said you keep that for russia fancy bullen polishing off a gigantic cossack or defending the czars life against half a dozen infuriated nihilists that would be the thing bullen it would be better than trade any day why you would get an estate as big as an english county with ten thousand serfs and sacks upon sacks of roubles  what bosh you fellows talk bullen laughed there is one thing i do expect i shall learn in russia and that is to skate fancy six months of regular skating instead of a miserable three or four days i shall meet some of you fellows some day at the round pond and there you will be just working away at the outside edge and i shall be joining in those skatingclub figures and flying round and round like a bird  what birds fly round and round bullen  lots of them do as you would know jordan if you kept your eyes open instead of being always on the edge of going to sleep swallows do and eagles never mind you fellows will turn yellow with jealousy when you see me  and so they laughed and joked until they reached london then there was another hearty goodbye all round and in a couple of minutes they were speeding in hansoms to their various destinations godfrey bullens was eccleston square his father was now senior partner in a firm that carried on a considerable business with the east of europe he had when junior partner resided at st petersburg as the firm had at that time large dealings in the baltic from various causes this trade had fallen off a good deal and the firm had dealt more largely with odessa and the southern ports consequently when at the death of the senior partner mr bullen returned to england to take up the principal management of the affairs of the firm it was not deemed advisable to continue the branch at st petersburg and ivan petrovytch a russian trader of good standing had been appointed their agent there  the arrangement had not worked quite satisfactorily petrovytch was an excellent agent as far as he went the business he did was sound and he was careful and conscientious but he lacked push and energy had no initiative and would do nothing on his own responsibility mr bullen had all along intended that godfrey should on leaving school go for a few years to russia and should in time occupy the same position there that he himself had done but he had now determined that this should take place earlier than he had before intended he thought that godfrey would now more speedily pick up the language again than if he remained another two or three years in england and that in five or six years time he might be able to represent the firm there either in conjunction with ivan petrovytch or by himself therefore ten days before the breakingup of the school for the long holidays he had written to godfrey telling him that he should take him away at the end of the term and that in two or three months time he would go out to st petersburg  mr bullens family consisted of two girls in addition to godfrey hilda the elder was seventeen a year older than the lad while ella was two years his junior  well godfrey his father said as after the first greeting they sat down to dinner which had been kept back for half an hour for his arrival you did not seem very enthusiastic in your reply to my letter  i did not feel very enthusiastic father godfrey replied of course ones two last years at school are just the jolly time and i was really very sorry to leave still of course you know what is best for me and i dare say i shall get on very well at st petersburg  i have no doubt of that godfrey i have arranged for you to live with mr petrovytch as you will regain the language much more quickly in a russian family than you would in an english one besides it will be handy for your work in russia merchants offices are generally in their houses and it is so with him but of course you will know most of the english families i shall write to several of my old friends and i am sure they will do all they can for you but i shall write more to my russian acquaintances than to my english the last are sure to call upon you when they hear you have come out but it is not so easy to get a footing in russian families and you might be some time before you make acquaintances that way besides it is much better for you to be principally in the russian set than in the english in the first place because of the language and in the second because you will get a much better acquaintance with the country in general with them than among the english  there are not many english lads of your own age out therevery few indeed and those nearest your age would be young clerks i have nothing whatever to say against young clerks but as a rule they consort together spend their evenings in each others rooms or in playing billiards or otherwise amuse themselves and so learn very little of the language and nothing of the people it is unfortunate that it should be so but they are not altogether to blame for as i have said the russians although friendly enough with englishmen in business in the club and so on do not as a rule invite them to their houses and therefore the english especially the class i am speaking of are almost forced to associate entirely with each other and form a sort of colony quite apart from native society i was fortunate enough to make some acquaintances among them soon after i went out and your mother and i were much more in russian society than is usual with our countrymen there i found great advantage from it and shall be glad for you to do the same you will have one very great advantage that you will be able to speak russian fluently in a short time  i dont think i remember much about it now father  i dare say not godfrey that is to say you know it but you have lost a good deal of the facility of speaking it you have always got on fairly enough with it when we have spoken it occasionally during your holidays since we have been in england and in a very few weeks you will find that it has completely come back to you you spoke it as you did english indeed better when you came over to school when you were ten and in six years one does not forget a language if you had been another five or six years older no doubt you would have lost it a good deal but even then you would have learnt it very much more quickly than you would have done had you never spoken it your mother and the girls have been grumbling at me a good deal for sending you away so soon  it is horrid father hilda said we have always looked forward so to godfreys coming home and of course it would be better still as he got older we could have gone about everywhere with him and we shall miss him especially when we go away in summer  well you must make the most of him this time then her father said  have you settled where we are going godfrey asked  no we would not settle until you came home godfrey mrs bullen said as this was to be your last holiday we thought we would give you the choice  then i vote for some quiet seaside place mother we went to switzerland last year and as i am going abroad for ever so long i would rather stop at home now and besides i would rather be quiet with you all instead of always travelling about and going to places only of course if the girls would rather go abroad i dont mind  however it was settled that it should be as godfrey wished  but i do think father godfrey said that it will be a good thing if i had lessons in writing from one of those fellows who guarantee to teach you in a few lessons i suppose that is all bosh but if i got their system and worked at it it might do me good i really do write badly  the girls laughed  i dont think that quite describes it godfrey his father said if anyone asked me about your accomplishments i should say that you knew a good deal of latin and greek that you had a vague idea of english and that you could read but unfortunately you were quite unable to write according to my idea it is perfectly scandalous that at the great schools such an essential as writing is altogether neglected while years are spent over greek which is of no earthly use when you have once left school i suppose the very worst writers in the world are men who have been educated in public schools  well i am glad you have had the good sense to suggest it godfrey i had thought of it myself but i was afraid you would think it was spoiling your last holidays at home i will see about it tomorrow i cannot get away very well for another fortnight if you have a dozen lessons before we go you can practise while we are away and mind from today we will talk nothing but russian when we are alone  this had been indeed a common habit in the family since they had come home two years before as the two girls and mr and mrs bullen spoke russian as fluently as english and mr bullen thought it was just as well that they should not let it drop altogether indeed on their travels in switzerland they had several times come across russians and had made pleasant acquaintances from their knowledge of that language  the holidays passed pleasantly at weymouth godfrey practised two hours a day steadily at the system of handwriting and although he was at the end of the holidays very far from attaining the perfection shown in the examples produced by his teachers of the marvels they had effected in many of their pupils he did improve vastly and wrote a fair current hand instead of the almost undecipherable scrawl that had so puzzled and annoyed a succession of masters at shrewsbury after another month spent in london getting his clothes and outfit godfrey started for st petersburg on his last evening at home his father had a serious talk with him  i have told petrovytch he said that you may possibly some day take up the agency with him but that nothing is decided as to that at present and that it will all depend upon circumstances however in any case you will learn the ins and outs of the trade there and if at the end of a few years you think that you would rather work by yourself than with him i can send out a special clerk to work with you on the other hand it is possible that i may require you at home here venables has no family and is rather inclined to take it easy possibly in a few years he may retire altogether and i may want you at home at five or six and twenty you should be able to undertake the management of the russian part of the business running out there occasionally to see that everything goes on well i hope i need not tell you to be steady there is a good deal too much drinking goes on out there arising no doubt from the fact that the young men have no family society there and nothing particular to do when work is over  stick to the business lad you will find petrovytch himself a thoroughly good fellow of course he has russian ways and prejudices but he is less narrow than most of his countrymen of that class above all things dont express any opinion you may feel about public affairsat any rate outside the walls of the house the secret police are everywhere and a chance word might get you into a very serious scrape as you get on you will find a good deal that you do not like even in business there is no getting a government contract or indeed a contract at all without bribing right and left it is disgusting but business cannot be done without it the whole system is corrupt and rotten and you will find that every official has his price however you wont have anything to do with this for the present if i were you i should work for an hour or two a day with a german master there are a great many germans there and you will find a knowledge of the language very useful to you you see your russian has pretty nearly come back to you during the last two months and you will very soon speak it perfectly so you will have no trouble about that  godfrey found the long railway journey across the flat plains of germany very dull as he was unable to exchange a word with his fellowpassengers but as soon as he crossed the russian frontier he felt at home again and enjoyed the run through the thicklywooded country lying between wilna and st petersburg as he stepped out at the station everything seemed to come back vividly to his memory it was late in october and the first snow had fallen and round the station were a crowd of sledges drawn by rough little horses avoiding the importunities of the drivers of the hotel vehicles he hailed an isvostchik in furred cap and coat lined with sheepskin his portmanteaus were corded at the back of the sledge he jumped up into the seat behind the driver pulled the fur rug over his legs and said drive to the vassili ostrov 52 ulitsa nicolai the driver gave a peculiar cry cracked his whip half a dozen times making a noise almost as loud as the discharge of a pistol and the horse went off at a sharp trot  i thought your excellency was a foreigner the driver said but i see you are one of us  no i am an englishman but i lived here till i was ten years old the snow has begun earlier than usual has it not  it wont last the isvostchik said sometimes we have a week at this time of year but it is not till december that it sets in in earnest we may have droskies out again tomorrow instead of the sledges  the sledges are the pleasantest godfrey said  yes your excellency for those that travel but not for us at night when we are waiting we can get into the drosky and sleep while it is terrible without shelter there are many of us frozen to death every winter  godfrey felt a sense of keen enjoyment as the sledge glided along there were many rough bumps and sharp swings for the snow was not deep enough to cover thoroughly the roughness of the road below but the air was brisk and the sun shone brightly and he looked with pleasure at the people and costumes which seemed to his surprise perfectly familiar to him he was quite sorry when the journey came to an end at the house of ivan petrovytch the merchant whose office was on the groundfloor and who occupied the floor above the rest of the house being let off by floors to other families came out to greet him i am glad to see you godfrey bullen he said i should have sent to the station to meet you but your good father did not say whether you would arrive by the morning or evening train and as my driver did not know you he would have missed you i hope that all has gone well on the journey paul he said to a man who had followed him out carry these trunks upstairs  after paying the driver godfrey followed his host to the floor above petrovytch was a portly man with a pleasant but by no means goodlooking face wife he said as he entered the sittingroom this is godfrey bullen i will leave him in your hands for the present as i have some business that i must complete before we close  my name mrs petrovytch said is catharine you know in this country we always address each other by our names the highborn may use titles but simple people use the christian name and the family name unless they are very intimate and then the christian name only i heard you speaking to my husband as you came in so that you have not forgotten our language i should have thought that you would have done so i can remember you as quite a little fellow before you went away  i have been speaking it for the last two months at home godfrey said and it has nearly come back to me  and your father and mother and your sisters are they all well  they are quite well and my father and mother begged me to give their kind regards to you  at this moment the servant came in with the samovar or teaurn  it is four oclock now we dine at five oclock when the office is closed many dine at one but my husband likes it when he has done his work as then he does not need to hurry  after drinking a tumbler of tea and eating a flatcake or two with it godfrey went to his room to have a wash after his long journey and to unpack some of his things he thought that he should like both petrovytch and his wife but that the evenings would be dull if he had to spend them in the house of this however he had but little fear for he was sure that between his fathers friends and the acquaintances he might himself make he should be out as much as he liked  in the course of the next week godfrey called at the houses of the various people to whom he had letters of introduction and left them with the hall porter his host told him that he thought he had better take a fortnight to go about the capital and see the sights before he settled down to work at the office and as not only the gentlemen with whom he had left letters of introduction and his cardfor in russia strangers always call firstbut many others of his fathers friends called or invited him to their houses he speedily made a large number of acquaintances at the end of the fortnight he took his place in the office at first he was of very little use there for although he could talk and understand russian as spoken he had entirely forgotten the written characters and it took him some little time before he could either read the business correspondence or make entries in the office books ivan petrovytch did his best to assist him and in the course of a month he began to master the mysteries of russian writing  at five oclock the office closed godfrey very frequently dined out but if he had no engagement he took his meal with the merchant and his wife and then sallied out and went either alone or with some of his acquaintances to a russian theatre with december winter set in in earnest the waters were frozen and skating began the season at st petersburg commenced about the same time and as godfrey was often sent with messages or letters to other business houses he had an opportunity of seeing the streets of st petersburg by day as well as by night he was delighted with the scene on the nevski prospekt the principal street of st petersburg the footways were crowded with people the wealthy in high boots coats lined with sable and caps to match the poorer in equally ample coats but with linings of sheep fox or rabbit skins with the national russian cap of fur with velvet top and with furlined hoods which were often drawn up over the head  the shops were excellent reminding godfrey rather of paris than london but the chief interest of the scene lay in the roadway there were vehicles of every description from the heavy sledge of the peasant piled up with logs for fuel or carrying perhaps the body of an elk shot in the woods to the splendid turnouts of the nobles with their handsome fur wraps their coachmen in the national costume and horses covered with brown blue or violet nets almost touching the ground to prevent the snow from being thrown up from the animals hoofs into the faces of those in the sledge the harness was in most cases more or less decorated with bells which gaily tinkled in the still air as the sledges dashed along most struck was godfrey with the vehicles of the nobles who adhered to old russian customs the sledge was drawn by three horses the one in the centre was trained to trot while the two outside went at a canter the heads of the latter were bent half round so that they looked towards the side or even almost behind them as they went an english acquaintance to whom godfrey expressed his surprise the first time he saw one of these sledges replied yes that is the old russian pattern and curiously enough if you look at greek basreliefs and sculptures of the chariot of phoebus or at any other representations of chariots with three or four horses you will see that the animals outside turn their heads in a similar manner  but it must be horribly uncomfortable for the horses to have their heads turned round like that  it is the effect of training they are always tied up to the stables with their heads pulled in that way until it becomes a second nature to go with them in that position  it is a very curious idea godfrey said but it certainly looks nice what magnificent beards all the drivers in the good sledges have  yes that again is an old russian custom a driver with a big beard is considered an absolute necessity for a wellappointed turnout and the longer and fuller the beard the higher the wages a man will command and the greater the pride of his employer  it seems silly godfrey said but there is no doubt those fellows do look wonderfully imposing with their fur caps and their long blue caftans and red sashes and those splendid beards they remind me of pictures of neptune certainly i never saw such beards in england  besides these vehicles there were crowds of public sledges driven by the isvostchiks long rough country sledges laden perhaps with a dozen peasant women returning from market light wellgotup vehicles of english and other merchants dashing turnouts carrying an officer or two of high rank and others filled with ladies half buried in rich furs the air was tremulous with the music of countless bells and broken by the loud cracking of whips with which the faster vehicles heralded their approach these whips had short handles but very long heavy thongs and godfrey observed that however loud he might crack this weapon it was very seldom indeed that a russian driver ever struck one of his horses with it  sometimes when ivan petrovytch told him that there was little to be done in the office and that he need not return for an hour or two godfrey would stroll into the isaac or kasan cathedrals both splendid structures and wonder at the taste that marred their effect by the profusion of the gilding lavished everywhere he was delighted by the singing which was unaccompanied by instruments the bass voices predominating and which certainly struck him as being much finer than anything he had ever heard in an english cathedral there was no lack of amusement in the evening some of his english friends at once put godfrey up as a member of the skating club this club possessed a large garden well planted with trees in this was an artificial lake of considerable extent broken by wooded islets this was always lit up of an evening by coloured lights and twice in the week was thrown open upon a small payment to the public when a military band played and the grounds were brilliantly illuminated  the scene was an exceedingly gay one and the gardens were frequented by the rank and fashion of st petersburg the innumerable lights were reflected by the snow that covered the ground and by the white masses that clung to the boughs of the leafless trees the ice was covered with skaters male and female the latter in gay dresses tightfitting jackets trimmed with fur and dainty little fur caps many of the former were in uniform and the air was filled with merry laughter and the ringing sound of innumerable skates sometimes parties of acquaintances executed figures but for the most part they moved about in couples the gentleman holding the ladys hand or sometimes placing his arm round her waist as if dancing very often godfrey spent the evening at the houses of one or other of his russian or english friends and occasionally went to the theatre sometimes he spent a quiet evening at home he liked catharine petrovytch she was an excellent housewife and devoted to the comfort of her husband but when not engaged in household cares she seldom cared to go out and passed her time for the most part on the sofa she was like most other russian ladies when at home and without visitors very careless and untidy in her dress  among the acquaintances of whom godfrey saw most were two young students one of them was the son of a trader in moscow the other of a small landed proprietor he had met them for the first time at a fair held on the surface of the neva and had been introduced to them by a fellowstudent of theirs a member of a family with whom godfrey was intimate having met another acquaintance he had left the party and godfrey had spent the afternoon on the ice with akim soushiloff and petroff stepanoff he found them pleasant young men he was they told him the first englishman they had met and asked many questions about his country he met them several times afterwards and one day they asked him if he would come up to their room  it is a poor place one said laughing but you know most of us students are poor and have to live as best we can  it makes no odds to me godfrey said it was a pretty bare place i had when i was at school i shall be very glad to come up  the room which the students shared was a large one at the top of a house in a narrow street it was simply furnished enough containing but two beds a deal table four chairs and the indispensable stove which kept the room warm and comfortable  we are in funds just at present akim said petroff has had a remittance and so you find the stove well alight which is not always the case  but how do you manage to exist without a fire  we dont trouble the room much then petroff said we walk about till we are dead tired out and then come up and sleep in one bed together for warmth and heap all the coverings from the other bed over us oh we get on very well food is cheap here if you know where to get it fuel costs more than food now which will you take tea or vodka  godfrey declared for tea some of the water from a great pot standing on the top of the stove was poured into the samovar some glowing embers were taken from the stove and placed in the urn and in a few minutes the water was boiling and three tumblers of tea with a slice of lemon floating on the top were soon steaming on the table the conversation first turned upon university life in russia and then petroff began to ask questions about english schools and universities and then the subject changed to english institutions in general  what a different life to ours akim said and the peasants are they comfortable  well their lives are pretty hard ones godfrey acknowledged they have to work hard and for long hours and the pay is poor but then on the other hand they generally have their cottages at a very low rent with a good bit of garden and a few fruit trees they earn a little extra money at harvest time and though their pay is smaller i think on the whole they are better off and happier than many of the working people in the towns  and they are free to go where they like  certainly they are free but as a rule they dont move about much  then if they have a bad master they can leave him and go to someone else  oh yes they would go to some other farmer in the neighbourhood but there are seldom what you may call bad masters the wages are always about the same through a district and the hours of work and so on so that one master cant be much better or worse than another except in point of temper and if a man were very bad tempered of course the men would leave him and work somewhere else so he would be the loser as he would soon only get the very worst hands in the neighbourhood to work for him  and they are not beaten  beaten i should think not godfrey said nobody is beaten with us though i think it would be a capital thing if instead of shutting up people in prison for small crimes they had a good flogging it would do them a deal more good and it would be better for their wives and families who have to get on as best they can while they are shut up  and nobody is beaten at all  no there used to be flogging in the army and navy but it was very rare and is now abolished  and not even a lord can flog his peasants  certainly not if a lord struck a peasant the peasant would certainly hit him back again and if he didnt feel strong enough to do that he would have him up before the magistrates and he would get fined pretty heavily  and how do they punish political prisoners  there are no political prisoners as long as a man keeps quiet and doesnt get up a row he may have any opinions he likes he may argue in favour of a republic or he may be a socialist or anything he pleases but of course if he tried to kick up a row attack the police or made a riot or anything of that sort he would be punished for breaking the law but that would have nothing to do with his politics  the two young men looked in surprise at each other  but if they printed a paper and attacked the government akim asked  oh they do that there are as many papers pitch into the government as there are in favour of the government parties are pretty equally divided you see and the party that is out always abuses the party which is in power  and even that is lawful  certainly it is you can abuse the government as much as you like say that the ministers are a parcel of incompetent fools and so on but of course you cannot attack them as to their private life and character any more than you can anyone else because then you would render yourself liable to an action for libel  and you can travel where you like in the country and out of the country without official permits or passports  yes there is nothing like that known in england every man can go where he likes and live where he likes and do anything he likes providing that it does not interfere with the rights of other people  ah shall we ever come to this in russia akim petroff said  akim made no answer but godfrey replied for him no doubt you will in time petroff but you see liberties like these do not grow up in a day we had serfs and vassals in england at one time and feudal barons who could do pretty much what they chose and it was only in the course of centuries that these things got done away with at this moment there was a knock at the door  it is katia akim said jumping up from his seat and opening the door a young woman entered she was pleasant and intelligent looking katia this is an english gentleman a friend of ours who has been telling us about his country godfrey this is my cousin katia she teaches music in the houses of many people of good family  i did not expect to find visitors here the girl said smiling and how do you like our winter it is a good deal colder than you are accustomed to  it is a great deal more pleasant godfrey said i call it glorious weather it is infinitely better than alternate rains and winds with just enough frost occasionally to make you think you are going to do some skating and then a thaw  you are extravagant the girl said looking round it is a long time since i have felt the room as warm as this i suppose petroff has got his allowance  yes and a grumbling letter my father has a vague idea that in some way or other i ought to pick up my living though he never offers a suggestion as to how i should do it  the young woman went to the cupboard fetched another tumbler and poured herself out some tea and then chatted gaily about st petersburg her pupils and their parents  do you live at the house of one of your pupils godfrey asked  oh no she said i dont mind work but i like to be free when work is over i board in an honest family and live in a little room at the top of the house which is all my own and where i can see my friends  after chatting for some time longer godfrey took his leave as soon as he had gone the girls manner changed  do you think you are wise to have him here akim  why not the student asked in turn he is frank and agreeable he is respectable and even you will allow that it would be safer walking with him than some we know we do not talk politics with him  for all that i am sorry akim you know how it will be we shall get him into trouble it is our fate we have a great end in view we risk our own lives and although for the good of the cause we must not hesitate even if others suffer i do hate with all my heart that others should be involved in our fortunes  this is not like you katia petroff said i have heard you say your maxim is at any cost and you have certainly lived up to it  yes and i shall live up to it she said firmly but it hurts sometimes petroff it hurt me just now when i thought that that lad laughing and chatting with us had no idea that he had better have thrust his hand into that stove than have given it to us i do not shrink i should use him as i should use anyone else as an instrument if it were needful but dont suppose that i like it  i dont think there is any fear of our doing him harm akim said he is english and would find no difficulty in showing that he knew nothing of us save as casual acquaintances they might send him out of the country but that would be all  it would all depend she said upon how he fell into their hands if you happened to be arrested only as you were walking with him down the nevski prospekt he would be questioned of course but as soon as they learned who he was and that he had nothing to do with you they would let him go but if he were with us say here when we were pounced upon and you had no time to pull the trigger of the pistol pointing into that keg of powder in the cupboard he would be hurried away with us to one of the fortresses and the chances are that not a soul would ever know what had become of him still it cannot be helped now he may be useful and as we give our own lives so we must not shrink from giving others but this is not what i came here to talk to you about have you heard of the arrest of michaelovich  no they both exclaimed leaping from their seats  it happened at three oclock this morning katia said they surrounded the house and broke in suddenly and rushed down into the cellar and found him at work he shot two of them and then he was beaten down and badly wounded  where were the other two akim asked  he sent them away but an hour before but he went on working himself to complete the number of handbills of course he was betrayed i dont think there are six people who knew where the press was even i didnt know  where did you hear of it katia  feodorina samuloff told me you know she often helps michaelovich to work at the press she thinks it must have been either louka or gasin why should michaelovich have sent them away when he hadnt finished work if one or the other of them had not made some excuse so as to get out of the way before the police came but that is nothing there will be time to find out which is the traitor they know nothing either of them except that they worked at the secret press with him they were never much trusted but michaelovich is a terrible loss he was always daring and full of expedients  they will get nothing from him petroff said  not they she agreed when do they ever get anything out of us one of the outercircle fellows like louka and gasin who know nothing who are instruments and nothing more may tell all they know for gold or for fear of the knout but never once have they learned anything from one who knows fortunately the press was a very old one and there was but little type there only just enough for printing small handbills we have two others ready to set up  were there any papers there  no michaelovich was too careful for that  i hear that old libka died in prison yesterday akim said  he is released from his suffering katia said solemnly anything else akim  yes a batch of prisoners start for siberia tomorrow and there are ten of us among them  well be careful for the next few days akim katia said dont do anything in the schools it will not be long now before all is ready to strike a blow and it is not worth while to risk anything until after that i have orders that we are all to keep perfectly quiet till the plans are settled and we each get our instructions now i must go i have two lessons to give this afternoon it tries one a little to be talking to children about quavers and semiquavers when ones head is full of great plans and you know that at any moment a policeman may tap you on the shoulder and take you off to the dungeons of st nicholas from which one will never return unless one is carried out or is sent to siberia which would be worse be careful the police have certainly got scent of something they are very active at present and with a nod she turned and left the room  she is a brave girl akim said i think the women make better conspirators than we do petroff look at her she was a little serious today because of michaelovich but generally she is in high spirits and no one would dream that she thought of anything but her pupils and pleasure then there is feodorina samuloff she works all day i believe in a laundry and she looks as impassive as if she had been carved out of soap yet she is ready to go on working all night if required and if she had orders she would walk into the winter palace and throw down a bomb that would kill her as well as everyone else within its reach with as much coolness as if she was merely delivering a message     chapter ii  a catspaw   one evening a fortnight later godfrey went with two young englishmen to a masked ball at the opera it was a brilliant scene comparatively few of the men were masked or in costume but many of the ladies were so every other man was in uniform of some kind and the floor of the house was filled with a gay laughing crowd while the boxes were occupied by ladies of the highest rank several of the imperial family being present he speedily became separated from his companions and after walking about for an hour he became tired of the scene and was about to make his way towards the entrance when a hand was slipped behind his arm as several masked figures had joked him on walking about so vaguely by himself he thought that this was but another jest  you are just the person i wanted the mask said  i think you have mistaken me for some one else lady he replied  not at all now put up your arm and look as if i belong to you nonsense do as you are told godfrey bullen  who are you who know my name godfrey laughed doing as he was ordered for he had no doubt that the masked woman was a member of one of the families whom he had visited  you dont know who i am she asked  how should i when i can see nothing but your eyes through those holes  i am katia the cousin of your friend akim  oh of course godfrey said a little surprised at meeting the music mistress in such an assembly i fancied i knew your voice though i could not remember where i had heard it and now what can i do for you  the young woman hesitated we have got up a little mystification she said after a pause and i am sure i can trust you besides you dont know the parties there is a gentleman here who is supposed to be with his regiment at moscow but there is a sweetheart in the case and you know when there are sweethearts people do foolish things  i have heard so godfrey laughed though i dont know anything about it myself for i shant begin to think of such luxuries as sweethearts for years to come  well he is here masked the girl went on and unfortunately the colonel of his regiment is here and some illnatured personwe fancy it is a rival of hishas told the colonel he is furious about it and declares that he will catch him and have him tried by courtmartial for being absent without leave the only thing is he is not certain as to his information  well what can i do godfrey asked how can i help him  you can help if you like and that without much trouble to yourself he is at present in the back of that empty box on the third tier i was with him when i saw you down here so i left him to say goodbye to his sweetheart alone and ran down to fetch you for i felt sure you would oblige me what i thought was this if you put his mask and cloak onyou are about the same heightit would be supposed that you are he the colonel is waiting down by the entrance he will come up to you and say captain presnovich you will naturally say by no means he will insist on your taking your mask off this you will do and he will of course make profuse apologies and will believe that he has been altogether misinformed in the meantime presnovich will manage to slip out and will go down by the early train to moscow it is not likely that the colonel will ever make any more inquiries about it but if he does some of presnovichs friends will be ready to declare that he never left moscow  but cant he manage to leave his mask and cloak in the box and to slip away without them  no that would never do it is necessary that the colonel should see for himself that the man in the cloak with the white and red bow pinned to it is not the captain  very well then i will do it godfrey said it will be fun to see the colonels face when he finds out his mistake but mind i am doing it to oblige you  i feel very much obliged the girl said but dont you bring my name into it though  how could i he laughed i do not see that i am likely to be crossquestioned in any way but never fear i will keep your counsel  by this time they had arrived at the door of the box wait a moment she said i will speak to him first  she was two minutes gone and then opened the door and let him in i am greatly obliged to you sir a man said as he entered it is a foolish business altogether but if you will enact my part for a few minutes you will get me out of an awkward scrape  dont mention it godfrey replied it will be a joke to laugh over afterwards he placed the broad hat to which the black silk mask was sewn on his head and katia put the cloak on his shoulders  i trust you she said in a low voice as she walked with him to the top of the stairs there i must go now i had better see captain presnovich safely off and then go and tell the young lady who is a great friend of mineit is for her sake i am doing it you know not for hishow nicely we have managed to throw dust in the colonels eyes  regarding the matter as a capital joke godfrey went downstairs and made his way to the entrance expecting every moment to be accosted by the irascible colonel no one spoke to him however and he began to imagine that the colonel must have gone to seek the captain elsewhere and hoped that he would not meet him as he went down the stairs with katia he walked down the steps into the street as he stepped on to the pavement a man seized him from behind two others grasped his wrists and before he knew what had happened he was run forward across the pavement to a covered sledge standing there and flung into it his three assailants leapt in after him the door was slammed another man jumped on to the box with the driver and two mounted men took their places beside it as it dashed off from the door the men had again seized godfreys hands and held them firmly the instant they entered the carriage  it is of no use your attempting to struggle one of the men said there is an escort riding beside the sledge and a dozen more behind it there is no chance of a rescue and i warn you you had best not open your lips if you do we will gag you  godfrey was still half bewildered with the suddenness of the transaction what had he been seized for who were the men who had got hold of him and why were they gripping his wrists so tightly he had heard of arbitrary treatment in the russian army but that a colonel should have a captain seized in this extraordinary way merely because he was absent from his post without leave was beyond anything he thought possible  i thought i was going to have the laugh all on my side he said to himself but so far it is all the other way in ten minutes the carriage stopped for a moment there was a challenge then some gates were opened godfrey had already guessed his destination and his feeling of discomfort had increased every foot he went there was no doubt he was being taken to the fortress it seems to me that miss katia has got me into a horrible scrape of some kind he said to himself what a fool i was to let myself be humbugged by the girl in that way  two men with lanterns were at the door of a building at which the carriage after passing into a large courtyard drew up still retaining their grip on his wrists two of the men walked beside him down a passage while several others followed behind an officer of high rank was sitting at the head of a table one of inferior rank stood beside him while at the end of the table were two others with papers and pens before them  so you have captured him the general said eagerly  yes your excellency the man who had spoken to godfrey in the carriage said respectfully  has he been searched  no your excellency the distance was so short and i feared that he might wrench one of his hands loose moreover i thought that you might prefer his being searched in your presence  it is better so take off that disguise as the hat and mask were removed the officer sprang to his feet and exclaimed why who is this this is not the man you were ordered to arrest you have made some confounded blunder  i assure you your excellency the official said in trembling accents this is the only man who was there in the disguise we were told of there your excellency is the bunch of white and red ribbons on his cloak  and who are you sir the general thundered  my name sir is godfrey bullen i reside with ivan petrovytch a merchant living in the vassili ostrov  but how come you mixed up in this business sir the general exclaimed furiously how is it that you are thus disguised and that you are wearing that bunch of ribbon beware how you answer me sir for this is a matter which concerns your life  so far as i am concerned sir godfrey said i am absolutely ignorant of having done any harm in the matter and have not the most remote idea why i have been arrested i may have behaved foolishly in allowing myself to take part in what i thought was a masquerade joke but beyond that i have nothing to blame myself for i went to the operahouse never having seen a masked ball before i was alone and being young and evidently a stranger i was spoken to and joked by several masked ladies presently one of them came up to me i had no idea who she was she was closely masked and i could see nothing of her face he then repeated the request that had been made him  do you expect me to believe this ridiculous nonsense about this captain presnovich and his colonel  i can only say sir what i am telling you is precisely what happened and that i absolutely believed it it seemed to me a natural thing that a young officer might come to a ball to see a lady who perhaps he had no other opportunity of meeting alone i see now that i was very foolish to allow myself to be mixed up in the affair but i thought that it was a harmless joke and so i did as this woman asked me  go on sir the general said in a tone of suppressed rage  there is little more to tell sir i went up with this woman to the box she had pointed out and there found this captain presnovich as i believed him to be i put on his hat mask and cloak walked down the stairs and was leaving the operahouse when i was arrested and am even now wholly ignorant of having committed any offence  a likely story the general said sarcastically and this woman did you see her face  no sir she was closely masked i could not even see if she were young or old and she spoke in the same disguised squeaking sort of voice that all the others that had spoken to me used  and that is your entire story sir you have nothing to add to it  nothing whatever sir i have told you the simple truth  the general threw himself back in his chair too exasperated to speak farther but made a sign to the officer standing next to him to take up the interrogation the questions were now formal your name is godfrey bullen he asked  it is  your nationality  british  your domicile  godfrey gave the address  how long have you been in russia  four months  what is your business  a clerk to ivan petrovytch  how comes it that you speak russian so well  i was born here and lived up to the age of ten with my father john bullen who was a wellknown merchant here and left only two years ago  that will do the general said impatiently take him to his cell and search him thoroughly  naturally the most minute search revealed nothing of an incriminating character at length godfrey was left alone in the cell which contained only a single chair and a rough pallet i have put my foot in it somehow he said to himself and i cant make head nor tail of it beyond the fact that i have made an ass of myself was the whole story a lie was the fellows name presnovich if not who was he by the rage of the general who i suppose is the chief of the police it was evident he was frightfully disappointed that i wasnt the man he was looking for was this presnovich somebody that girl katia knew and wanted to get safely away or was she made a fool of just as i was she looked a bright jolly sort of girl but that goes for nothing in russia all sorts of people get mixed up in plots if she was concerned in getting him away i suppose she fixed on me because being english and a newcomer here it would be easy for me to prove that i had nothing to do with plots or anything of that sort whereas if a russian had been in my place he might have got into a frightful mess over it well i suppose it will all come right in the end it is lucky that the weather has got milder or i should have had a good chance of being frozen to death it is cold enough as it is  resuming his clothes which had been thrown down on the pallet godfrey drew the solitary rug over him and in spite of the uncertainty of the position was soon fast asleep he woke just as daylight was breaking and was so bitterly cold that he was obliged to get up and stamp about the cell to restore circulation two hours later the cell door was opened and a piece of darkcoloured bread and a jug of water were handed in to him if this is prison fare i dont care how soon i am out of it he said to himself as he munched the bread i wonder what it is made of rye  the day passed without anyone coming near him save the jailer who brought a bowl of thin broth and a ration of bread for his dinner  cant you get me another rug he asked the man if i have got to stop here for another night i shall have a good chance of being frozen to death  just as it was getting dark the man came in again with another blanket and a flat earthenware pan half full of sand on which was burning a handful or two of sticks he placed a bundle of wood beside it  that is more cheerful by a long way godfrey said to himself as the man who had maintained absolute silence on each of his visits left the cell no doubt they have been making a lot of inquiries about me and find that i have not been in the habit of frequenting low company i should not have had these indulgences if they hadnt well it will be an amusement to keep this fire up the wood is as dry as a bone luckily or i should be smoked out in no time for there is not much ventilation through that narrow loophole  the warmth of the fire and the additional blanket made all the difference and in a couple of hours godfrey was sound asleep when he woke it was broad daylight and although he felt cold it was nothing to what he had experienced on the previous morning at about eleven oclock as near as he could guess for his watch and everything had been removed when he was searched the door was opened and a prison official with two warders appeared by these he was conducted to the same room where he had been first examined neither of the officers who had then been there was present but an elderly man sat at the centre of the table  godfrey bullen he said a careful investigation has been made into your antecedents and with one exception and that not for various reasons an important one we have received a good report of you ivan petrovytch tells us that you work in his office from breakfasttime till five in the afternoon and that your evenings are at your own disposal but that you generally dine with him he gave us the names of the families with which you are acquainted and where as he understood you spend your evenings when you are not at the skating club where you generally go on tuesdays and fridays at least we learn that you did spend your evenings with these families and we have learned at the club that you are a regular attendant there two or three times a week and that your general associates are and he read out a list which included to godfreys surprise the names of every one of his acquaintances there therefore we have been forced to come to the conclusion that your story incredible as it appeared is a true one that you a youth and a foreigner should have had the incredible levity to act in the way you describe and to assume the disguise of a person absolutely unknown to you upon the persuasion of a woman also absolutely unknown to you wellnigh passes belief had you been older you would at once have been sent to the frontier but as it is the czar to whom the case has been specially submitted has graciously allowed you to continue your residence here the testimony being unanimous as to your fathers position as a merchant and to the prudence of his behaviour while resident here but i warn you godfrey bullen that escapades of this kind which may be harmless in england are very serious matters here ignorantly i admit but none the less certainly you have aided in the escape of a malefactor of the worst kind and but for the proofs that have been afforded us that you were a mere dupe the consequences would have been most serious to you and even the fact of your being a foreigner would not have sufficed to save you from the hands of justice you are now free to depart but let this be a lesson to you and a most serious one never again to mix yourself up in any way with persons of whose antecedents you are ignorant and in future to conduct yourself in all respects wisely and prudently  it will certainly be a lesson to me sir i am heartily sorry that i was so foolish as to allow myself to be mixed up in such an affair and think i can promise you that henceforth there will be no fault to be found in my conduct  in the anteroom godfreys watch money and the other contents of his pocket were restored to him a carriage was in waiting for him at the outer door and he was driven rapidly to the house of the merchant  this is a nice scrape into which you have got yourself godfrey ivan petrovytch said as he entered it is lucky for you that you are not a russian but how on earth have you got mixed up in a plot we know nothing about it beyond the fact that you had been arrested for although a thousand questions were asked me about you nothing was said to me as to the charge brought against you we have been in the greatest anxiety about you all sorts of rumours were current in the city as to the discovery of a plot to assassinate one of the granddukes at the operahouse and there are rumours that explosive bombs had been discovered in one of the boxes it is said that the police had received information of the attempt that was to be made and that every precaution had been taken to arrest the principal conspirator but that in some extraordinary manner he slipped through their fingers but surely you can never have been mixed up in that matter  that is what it was godfrey said though i had no more idea of having anything to do with a plot than i had of flying i see now that i behaved like an awful fool and he told the story to petrovytch and his wife as he had told it to the head of the police both were shocked at the thought that a member of their household should have been engaged even unwittingly in such a treasonable affair  it is a wonder that we ever saw you again the merchants wife exclaimed it is fortunate that we are known as quiet people or we might have been arrested too i could not have believed that anyone with sense could be silly enough to put on a strangers mantle and hat  but i thought godfrey urged that at masked balls people did play all sorts of tricks upon each other i am sure i have read so in books and it did seem quite likelydidnt it nowthat an officer should have come up to meet a young lady masked whom he had no chance of meeting at any other time it certainly seemed to me quite natural and i believe almost any fellow if he were asked to help anyone to get out of a scrape like that would do it  you may do it in england or in france but it doesnt do to take part in anything that you dont know for certain all about here the wonder is they made any inquiries at all if you had been a russian the chances are that your family would never have heard of you again from the time you left to go to the opera nothing that you could have said would have been believed your story would have been regarded by the police as a mere invention they would have considered it as certain that in some way or other you were mixed up in the conspiracy they would have regarded your denials as simple obstinacy and you would have been sent to siberia for life  i should advise you godfrey ivan petrovytch said to keep an absolute silence about this affair mention it to no one everyone knows that something has happened to you as the police have been everywhere inquiring but there is no occasion to tell anyone the particulars of course rumours get about as to the action of the nihilists and of the police but as little is said as possible it is of course a mere rumour that a plot was discovered at the operahouse probably there were an unusual number of police at all the entrances and a very little thing gives rise to talk and conjecture people think that the police would not have been there had they not had suspicion that something or other was going to take place and as everything in our days is put down to the nihilists it was naturally reported that the police had discovered some plot and as two of the granddukes were there people made sure it was in some way connected with them  as nothing came of it and no one was as far as was known arrested it would be supposed that the culprit whoever he was managed to evade the police such rumours as these are of very common occurrence and it is quite possible that there is not much more truth in them this time than there is generally however of one thing you may be sure the police are not fonder than other people of being outwitted and whether the man for whom they were in search was a nihilist or a criminal of some other sort you certainly aided him to escape you are sure to be watched for some time and it will be known to the police in a very few hours if you repeat this story to your acquaintances if they find you keep silence about it they will give you credit for discretion while it would certainly do you a good deal of harm and might even now lead to your being promptly sent across the frontier were it known that you made a boast of having outwitted them  there is another reason you will find that for a time most of your friends here will be a little shy of you people are not fond of having as their intimates persons about whom the police are inquiring and you will certainly find for a time that you will receive very few invitations to enter the houses of any russians it would be different however if it were known that the trouble was about something that had no connection with politics therefore i should advise you when you are asked questions to turn it off with a laugh say you got mixed up in an affair between a young lady and her lover and that like many other people you found that those who mingle in such matters often get left in the lurch you need not say much more than that you might do anything here without your friends troubling much about it provided it had nothing to do with politics rob a bank perpetrate a big swindle run away with a court heiress and as long as the police dont lay hands on you nobody else will trouble their heads about the affair but if you are suspected of being mixed up in the most remote way with politics your best friends will shun you like the plague  i will take your advice certainly godfrey said and even putting aside the danger you point out i should not be anxious to tell people that i suffered myself to be entrapped so foolishly  for some time indeed godfrey found that his acquaintance fell away from him and that he was not asked to the houses of any of the russian merchants where he had been before made welcome cautious questions would be asked by the younger men as to the trouble into which he got with the police but he turned these off with a laugh i am not going to tell the particulars he said they concern other people i can only tell you that i was fool enough to be humbugged by a pretty little masker and to get mixed up in a love intrigue in which a young lady her lover a captain in the army and an irascible colonel were concerned and that the young people made a catspaw of me i am not going to say more than that i dont want to be laughed at for the next six months and so it became understood that the young englishman had simply got into some silly scrape and had been charged by a colonel in the army with running away with his daughter and he was therefore restored to his former footing at most of the houses that he had before visited  two days after his release a note was slipped into godfreys hand by a boy as he went out after dinner for a walk it was unsigned and ran as follows  dear godfrey bullen my cousin is in a great state of distress she was deceived by a third person and in turn deceived you she has heard since that the story was an entire fiction to enable a gentleman for whom the police were in search to escape she only heard last night of your arrest and release and is in the greatest grief that she should have been the innocent means of this trouble coming upon you you know how things are here and she is overwhelmed with gratitude that you did not in defence give any particulars that might have enabled them to trace her for she would have found it much more difficult than a stranger would have done to have proved her innocence she knows that you did say nothing for had you done so she would have been arrested before morning not improbably we might also have found ourselves within the walls of a prison since you met her at our room and the mere acquaintanceship with a suspected person is enough to condemn one here by the way we have moved our lodging but will give you our new address when we meet you that is if you are good enough to continue our acquaintance in spite of the trouble that has been caused you by the credulity and folly of my cousin  godfrey who had begun to learn prudence did not open the letter until he returned home and as soon as he had read it dropped it into the stove he was pleased at its receipt for he had not liked to think that he had been duped by a girl from the first he had believed that she like himself had been deceived for it had seemed to him out of the question that a young music mistress who did not seem more than twenty years old could have been mixed up in the doings of a desperate set of conspirators however he quite understood the alarm she must have felt for though his story might have been believed owing to his being a stranger and unconnected in any way with men who could have been concerned in a nihilist plot it would no doubt have been vastly more difficult for her to prove her innocence especially as it was known that there were many women in the ranks of the nihilists  it was a fortnight before he met either of the students and he then ran against them upon the quay just at the foot of the equestrian statue of peter the great opposite the isaac cathedral they hesitated for a moment but he held out his hand cordially  where have you been and how is it i have not seen you before  we were afraid that you might not care to know us further akim said after the trouble that that foolish cousin of mine involved you in  that would have been ridiculous godfrey said if we were to blame our friends for the faults of persons to whom they introduce us there would be an end to introductions  everyone wouldnt think as you do akim said we both wished to meet you and thank you for so nobly shielding her the silly girl might be on her way to siberia now if you had given her name  i certainly should not have done that in any case it is not the way of an englishman to betray his friend especially when that friend is a woman but i thought even before i got your letter that she must in some way or other have been misled herself  it was very good of you petroff said katia has been in great distress over it she thinks that you can never forgive her  pray tell her from me petroff that i have blamed myself not her i ought not to have let myself be persuaded into taking any part in the matter i entered into it as a joke thinking it would be fine fun to see the old colonels face and also to help a pair of lovers out of a scrape it would have been a good joke in england but this is not a country where jokes are understood at any rate it has been a useful lesson to me and in future young ladies will plead in vain to get me to mix myself up in other peoples affairs  we are going to a students party tonight petroff said one of our number who has just passed the faculty of medicine has received an appointment at tobolsk it is a long way off but it is said to be a pleasant town and the pay is good he is an orphan and richer than most of us so he is going to celebrate it with a party tonight before he starts will you come with us  i should like it very much godfrey said but surely your friend would not wish a stranger there on such an occasion  oh yes he would he would be delighted he is very fond of the english i will answer for it that you will be welcome meet us here at seven oclock this evening he has hired a big room and there will be two or three dozen of us thereall good fellows most of them have passed and you will see the army and navy the law and medicine all represented  godfrey willingly agreed to go he thought he should see a new phase of russian life and at the appointed hour he met the two students the entertainment was held in a large room in a traktar or eatinghouse in a small street the room was already full of smoke a number of young men were seated along two tables extending the length of the room and crossed by one at the upper end several were in military uniform and two or three in that of the navy akim and petroff were greeted boisterously by name as they entered  i will talk to you presently akim shouted in reply to various invitations to take his seat i have a friend whom i must first introduce to alexis he and petroff took godfrey up to the table at the end of the room alexis akim said i have brought you a gentleman whom i am sure you will welcome he has proved himself a true friend one worthy of friendship and honour his name is godfrey bullen  there was general silence as akim spoke and an evident curiosity as to the stranger their comrade had introduced the host who had risen to his feet grasped godfreys hand warmly  i am indeed glad to meet you godfrey bullen he said  my friends greet with me the english friend of akim and petroff  there was a general thumping of glasses on the table and two or three of those sitting near alexis rose from their seats and shook hands with godfrey with a warmth and cordiality which astonished him room was made for him and his two friends at the upper end of one of the side tables and when he had taken his seat the lad was able to survey the scene quietly  numbers of bottles were ranged down the middle of the tables which were of bare wood without cloth these contained as petroff told him wines from various parts of russia there were wines similar to sherry and bordeaux from the crimea kahetinskoe strongly resembling good burgundy from the caucasus and don skoe a sparkling wine resembling champagne from the don besides these were tankards of iablochin kavas or cider grushevoi kavas or perry malovinoi a drink prepared from raspberries and lompopo a favourite drink on the shores of the baltic the conversation naturally turned on student topics of tricks played on professors on past festivities amusements and quarrels no allusion of any kind was made to politics or to the matters of the day jovial songs were sung the whole joining in chorus with great animation at nine oclock waiters appeared with trays containing the indispensable beginning of all russian feasts each tray contained a large number of small dishes with fresh caviar raw herrings smoked salmon dried sturgeon slices of german sausage smoked goose ham radishes cheese and butter from these the guests helped themselves at will the servants handing round small glasses of k√ºmmel liftofka a spirit flavoured with the leaves of the blackcurrant and vodka  then came the supper before each guest was placed a basin of stehi a cabbage soup sour cream being handed round to be added to it then came rastigai patties composed of the flesh of the sturgeon and isinglass this was followed by cold boiled sucking pig with horseradish sauce after this came roast mutton stuffed with buckwheat which concluded the supper when the table was cleared singing began again but godfrey stayed no longer excusing himself to his host on the ground that the merchant kept early hours and that unless when he had specially mentioned that he should not be home until late he made a point of being in between ten and eleven  he was again surprised at the warmth with which several of the guests spoke to him as he said goodnight and went away with the idea in his mind that among the younger russians at any rate englishmen must be much more popular than he had before supposed one or two young officers had given him their cards and said that they should be pleased if he would call upon them  i have had a pleasant evening he said to himself they are a jolly set of fellows more like boys than men it was just the sort of thing i could fancy a big breakingup supper would be if fellows could do as they liked only no headmaster would stand the tremendous row they made with their choruses however i dont expect they very often have a jollification like this i suppose our host was a good deal better off than most of them petroff said that he was the son of a manufacturer down in the south i wonder what he meant when he laughed in that quiet way of his when i said i wondered that as his father was well off he should take an appointment at such an outoftheway place as tobolsk dont ask questions here he said those fellows handing round the meat may be government spies i dont see if they were what interest they could have in the question why alexis stumpoff should go to tobolsk  however i suppose they make a point of never touching on private affairs where any one can hear them however innocent the matter may be it must be hateful to be in a country where for aught you know every other man you come across is a spy i daresay i am watched now that police fellow told me i should be it would be a lark to turn off down bystreets and lead the spy if there is one a tremendous dance but jokes like that wont do here i got off once but if i give them the least excuse again they may send me off to the frontier i should not care much myself but it would annoy the governor horribly so i will walk back as gravely as a judge     chapter iii  a hunting party   two days later robson an english merchant who had been one of the most intimate of godfreys acquaintances and to whom he had confided the truth about his arrest said to him  you are not looking quite yourself lad  oh i am all right he said but it is not a pleasant thing having had such a close shave of being sent to siberia and it isnt only that no doubt the police feel that they owe me a grudge for having been the means of this fellow whoever he was slipping through their fingers and i shall be a suspected person for a long time of course it is only fancy but i am always thinking there is some one following me when i go out i know it is nonsense but i cant get rid of it  i dont suppose they are watching you as closely as that mr robson said but i do think it is likely that they may be keeping an eye on you but if they are they will be tired of it before long when they see that you go your own way and have nothing to do with any suspected persons you want a change lad i have an invitation to join a party who are going up to finland to shoot for a couple of days it is more likely than not that we shall never have a chance of firing a shot but it will be an outing for you and will clear your brain do you think you would like it  thank you very much mr robson i should like it immensely petrovytch was saying this morning that he thought i should be all the better for a holiday so i am sure he will spare me i am nothing of a shot in fact i never fired a shot at game in my life though i have practised a bit with the rifle but i am sure it will be very jolly whether we shoot anything or not  very well then be at the station to catch the seven oclock train in the morning it is a four hours railway journey  is there anything to bring sir  no you can take a handbag and sleeping things but beyond a bit of soap and a towel i dont suppose you will have need of anything for you will most likely sleep at some farmhouse or perhaps in a woodmans hut and there will not be any undressing there are six of us going from here counting you but the party is got up by two or three men we know there they tell me some of the officers of the regiment stationed there will be of the party and they will have a hundred or so of their men to act as beaters i have a spare gun that i will bring for you  the next morning godfrey joined mr robson at the station a mr white whom he knew well was one of the party and the other three were russians they had secured a firstclass compartment and as soon as they started they rigged up a table with one of the cushions and began to play whist  you dont play i suppose godfrey mr robson said  no sir i have played a little at my fathers but it will be a long time before i shall be good enough to play i have heard my father say that there is better whist at st petersburg than in any place in the world  i think he is right lad the russians are firstrate players and are passionately fond of the game and naturally we english here have had to learn to play up to their standard the game is similar to that in england but they score altogether differently  the four hours passed rapidly godfrey sometimes looked out of the window at the flat country they were passing through but more often watched the play they were met at the station by two of mr robsons friends and found that sledges were in readiness and they were to start at once  we have ten miles to drive one of them said the others went on early they will have had one beat by the time we get there and are then to assemble for luncheon  the road was good and the horses fast so that the sledges flew along rapidly most of the distance was through forest but the last halfmile was open and the sledge drew up at a large farmhouse standing in the centre of the cleared space and surrounded at a distance of half a mile on all sides by the forest a dozen men about half of whom were in uniform poured out from the door as the four sledges drew up  you are just in time one of them said the soup is ready and in another minute we should have set to  the civilians all knew each other but the newcomers were introduced to the russian colonel and his five officers  have you had any luck colonel mr robson asked  wonderful the latter replied with a laugh a stag came along and every one of us had a shot at it and each and every one is ready to take oath that he hit it so that every one is satisfied dont you call that luck  mr robson laughed but where is the stag he asked looking round  that is more than any one can tell you he went straight on and carried off our twelve bullets captain fomitch here and in fact all my officers are ready to swear that the deer is enchanted and they have all been crossing themselves against the evil omen such a thing was never heard of before for being such crack shots all of us of course there can be no doubt about our each having hit the stag when it was not more than a hundred yards away at the outside but come in the soup smells too good to wait and the sight of that enchanted beast has sharpened my appetite wonderfully  godfrey entered with the rest large as the farmhouse was the greater portion of the groundfloor was occupied by the room they entered it was entirely constructed of wood blackened with smoke and age a great fire burned on the hearth and the farmers wife and two maids were occupied with several large pots some suspended over the fire others standing among the brands the window was low but extended half across one side of the room and was filled with small lattice panes from the roof hung hams sides of bacon potatoes in network bags bunches of herbs and several joints of meat a table extended the length of the room covered with plates and dishes that from their appearance had evidently been brought out from the town and differed widely from the rough earthenware standing on a great dresser of darkened wood extending down one side of the room at one end the great pot was placed the cloth having been pushed back for the purpose and the colonel seizing the ladle began to fill the earthenware bowls which were used instead of soup plates  each man come for his ration before he sits down he said it would be better if you did not sit down at all for i know well enough that when my countrymen sit down to a meal it is a long time before they get up again and we have to be in the forest again in threequarters of an hour  quite right colonel one of the hosts said this evening you may sit as long as you like but if we are to have another drive today we must waste no time a basin of soup and a plate of stew are all you will get now with a cup of coffee afterwards to arm you against the cold and a glass of vodka or k√ºmmil to top up with no colonel not any punch just now punch in the evening but if we were to begin with that now i know that there would be no shooting this afternoon  what are the beaters doing mr robson asked as they hastily ate their dinner  they have brought their bread with them the colonel said and our friends here have provided a deer almost as fine as that which carried off the twelve bullets it was roasting over a fire in the forest when we went past and i saw some black bottles which i guessed were vodka  yes colonel i ordered that they should have a glass each with their dinner and another glass when they had done this afternoon  they would not mind being on fatigue duty every day through the winter on those terms the colonel said it is better for them than soldiering we must mind that we dont shoot any of them gentlemen the lives of the czars soldiers are not to be lightly sacrificed and next time you know the whole of the bullets may not hit the mark as they did this morning  there really is some danger in it mr robson said to godfrey who was sitting next to him in fact i should say there was a good deal of danger however i fancy the beaters all throw themselves down flat when they hear the crack of the first rifle  i see most of them have got a gun as well as a rifle  yes there is no saying what may come along and indeed they are more likely to get birds than fur i was told there are a good many elk in the forest and the peasants have been bringing an unusual number in lately a friend of mine shot two last week but as our party did not get one in their first drive they are not likely to get any afterwards occasionally in these big drives a good many animals are inclosed but as a rule the noise the soldiers make as they move along to take up their places is enough to frighten every creature within a couple of miles i told you you were not likely to have to draw a trigger expeditions like this are rather an excuse for a couple of days fun than anything else the real hunting is more quiet men who are fond of it have peasants in their pay all over the country and if one of these hears of a bear or an elk anywhere in his neighbourhood he brings in the news at once and then one or two men drive out to the village where beaters will be in readiness for them and have the hunt to themselves  i used to do a good deal of it the first few years i came out but it is bitter cold work waiting for hours till a beast comes past or trying to crawl up to him after all there is no great fun in putting a bullet into a creature as big as a horse at a distance of thirty or forty yards but there they are making a move they are going to drink the coffee and vodka standing which is wise for after standing in the snow for four hours as they have been doing they are apt to get so sleepy after a warm meal that if we were to stop here much longer you would find half the number would not make a start at all  the sledges were brought up and there was a three miles drive through the forest then the shooters were placed in a line some forty or fifty yards apart each taking his station behind a tree then a small bugler sounded a note godfrey heard a reply a long distance off threequarters of an hour passed without any further sound being heard and then godfrey who had been stamping his feet and swinging his arms to keep himself warm heard a confused murmur looking along the line he saw that the others were all on the alert and he accordingly took up his gun and began to gaze across the snow the righthand barrel was loaded with shot the left with ball presently a shot rang out away on his right followed almost immediately afterwards by another after this evidence that there must be something in the forest he watched more eagerly for signs of life presently he saw a hare coming loping along from time to time it stopped and turned its head to listen and then came on again he soon saw that it was bearing to the left and that it was not going to come within his range he watched it disappear among the trees and two minutes later heard a shot others followed to the right and left of him and presently a hare which he had not noticed dashed past at full speed almost touching his legs he was so startled for the moment that the hare had got some distance before he had turned round and was ready to fire and he was in no way surprised to see it dash on unharmed by his shot when there was a pause in the firing the shouting recommenced this time not far distant and he soon saw men making their way towards him through the trees  it is all over now mr robson shouted from the next tree if they have not done better elsewhere than we have here the bag is not a very large one  did you shoot anything mr robson  i knocked a hare over that is the only thing i have seen what have you done  i think i succeeded in frightening a hare but that was all godfrey laughed it ran almost between my legs before i saw it and i think it startled me quite as much as my shot alarmed it  the bugle sounded again and the party were presently collected round the colonel the result of the beat was five hares and a small stag that had fallen to the gun of mr white  much cry and little wool mr robson said a hundred beaters twenty guns and six head of game  another short beat was organized resulting in two stags and three more hares one of the stags and the three hares were placed on a sledge to be taken back to the farmhouse and the rest of the game was given to the soldiers a glass of vodka was served out to each of them and highly pleased with their days work the men slung the deer to poles and set out on their march of eight miles back to the town  they will have done a tremendous days work by the time they have finished godfrey said eight miles out and eight miles back and three beats which must have cost them four or five miles walking at least they must have gone over thirty miles through the snow  it wont be as much as that though it will be a long days work the colonel said they came out yesterday evening and slept in a barn another company come out tonight to take their place  it was already dark by the time the party reached the farmhouse and after a cup of coffee all round they began to prepare the dinner they were like a party of schoolboys laughing joking and playing tricks with each other two of them undertook the preparation of haresoup two others were appointed to roast a quarter of venison keeping it turning as it hung by a cord in front of the fire and being told that should it burn from want of basting they would forfeit their share of it the colonel undertook the mixing of punch and the odour of lemons rum and other spirits soon mingled with that of the cooking godfrey was set to whip eggs for a gigantic omelette and most of the others had some task or other assigned to them the farmers wife and her assistants not being allowed to have anything to do with the matter  the dinner was a great success after it was over a huge bowl of punch was placed on the table and after the health of the czar and that of the queen of england had been drunk speeches were made songs were sung and stories told while this was going on the farmer brought in a dozen trusses of straw these his wife and the maids opened and distributed along both sides of the room laying blankets over them it was not long before godfrey began to feel very drowsy the result of the days work in the cold a good dinner the heated air of the room and the din and would have gladly lain down but his movement to leave the table was at once frustrated and he was condemned to drink an extra tumbler of punch as a penalty after that he had but a confused idea of the rest of the evening he knew that many songs were sung and that everyone seemed talking together and as at last he managed to get away and lie down on the straw he had a vague idea that the colonel was standing on a chair making a final oration with the punchbowl turned upside down and worn as a helmet  godfrey had not touched the wine at dinner knowing that he would be expected to take punch afterwards and he had only sipped this occasionally except the glass he had been condemned to drink and when he heard the colonel shout in a stentorian voice to arms he got up and shook himself and felt ready for another days work although many of the others were sitting up yawning or abusing the colonel for having called them so early however it was already light two great samovars were steaming and the cups set in readiness on the table godfrey managed to get hold of a pail of water and indulged in a good wash as after a few minutes did all the others while a cup or two of tea and a few slices of fried bacon set up even those who were at first least inclined to rise  a quarter of an hour later the sledges were at the door and the party started the hunt was even less successful than that of the previous day no stag was seen but some ten hares and five brace of grouse were shot at three oclock the party assembled again at the farmhouse and had another hearty meal terminating with one glass of punch round then they took their places in their sledges and were driven back to the town the party for st petersburg started by the sixoclock train the rest giving them a hearty cheer as the carriage moved off from the platform  well have you enjoyed it godfrey mr robson asked  immensely sir it has been grand fun the colonel is a wonderful fellow  there are no more pleasant companions than the russians mr robson said they more closely resemble the irish than any people i know they have a wonderful fund of spirits enjoy a practical joke are fond of sport and have too a sympathetic and one may almost say a melancholy vein in their disposition just as the irish have they have their faults of courseall of us have and the virtue of temperance has not as yet made much way here society in fact is a good deal like that in england two or three generations back when it was considered no disgrace for a man to sit after dinner at the table until he had to be helped up to bed by the servants now white you have got the cards i think  godfrey watched the game for a short time then his eyes closed and he knew nothing more until mr robson shook him and shouted pull yourself together godfrey here we are at st petersburg  three days later when ivan petrovytch came in to breakfast at eleven oclockfor the inmates of the house had a cup of coffee or chocolate and a roll in their rooms at halfpast seven and office work commenced an hour latergodfrey saw that he and his wife were both looking very grave nothing was said until the servant having handed round the dishes left the room  has anything happened godfrey asked  yes there is bad news another plot against the life of the czar has been discovered the nihilists have mined under the road by which he was yesterday evening to have travelled to the railwaystation it seems that some suspicion was felt by the police i do not know how it arose at any rate at the last moment the route was changed during the night all the houses in the suspected neighbourhood were searched and in the cellar of one of them a passage was found leading under the road a mine was heavily charged with powder and was connected by wires to an electric battery and there can be no doubt that had the czar passed by as intended he would have been destroyed by the explosion it is terrible terrible  did they find any one in the cellar godfrey asked  no one the conspirators had no doubt taken the alarm when they heard that the route was changed and the place was deserted it seems that the shop above was taken four months ago as a store for the sale of coal and wood and the cellar and an adjoining one were hired at the same time there was also a room behind the shop where the man and woman who kept it lived they say that arrests have been made all over the city this morning and we shall no doubt have a renewal of the wholesale trials that followed the assassination of general mesentzeff the head of the police last autumn it is terrible these misguided men hope to conquer the empire by fear instead of that they will in the end only strengthen the hands of despotism i have always been inclined to liberalism but i have wished for gradual changes only for large changes we are not yet fit but as education spreads and we approach the western standard some power and voice ought to be given to all intelligent enough to use it that is to say to the educated classes i would notno one in his senses wouldgive the power of voting to illiterate and ignorant men who would simply be tools in the hands of the designing and ambitious but the peoples of the great towns st petersburg moskow kieff odessa and others should be permitted to send representativesmen of their own choiceto the provincial councils which should be strengthened and given a real instead of a nominal voice in the control of affairs  that was all i and thousands like me ever wished for in the present but it would have been the first step towards a constitution which the empire when the people become fit for it might enjoy that dream is over these men by their wild violence have thrown back the reforms for half a century at least they have driven the czar to war against them they have strengthened the hands of the men who will use their acts as an excuse for the extremest measures of repression they have ranged on the other side all the moderate men like myself who though desirous of constitutional changes shrink with horror from a revolution heralded by deeds of bloodshed and murder  i quite agree with you godfrey said warmly men must be mad who could counsel such abominable plans the french revolution was terrible although it began peacefully and was at first supported by all the best spirits of france but at last it became a hideous butchery but here in russia it seems to me that it would be infinitely worse for it is only in the towns that there are men with any education and if it began with the murder of the czar what would it grow to  what indeed ivan petrovytch repeated and yet like the french revolution the pioneers of this movement were earnest and thoughtful men with noble dreams for the regeneration of russia  but how did it begin  it may be said to have started about 1860 the emancipation of the serfs produced a sort of fever every one looked for change but it was in the universities the seminaries and among the younger professional men that it first began prohibited works of all kinds especially those of european socialists were in spite of every precaution at the frontier introduced and widely circulated socialistic ideas made tremendous progress among the class i speak of and these by writing by the circulation of prohibited papers and so on carried on a sort of crusade against the government and indeed against all governments carrying their ideas of liberty to the most extreme point and waging war against religion as well as against society  in the latter respect they were more successful than in the former and i regret to say that atheism made immense strides among the educated class they had some profound thinkers among them tchernyshevsky dobroluboff mikhailoff besides herzen and ogareff the two men who brought out the kolokol in london in the russian language and by their agents spread it broadcast over russia the stifling of the insurrection in poland strengthened the reactionary party more repressive edicts were issued with the usual result that secret societies multiplied everywhere then came the revolution and commune in paris which greatly strengthened the spread of revolutionary ideas here another circumstance gave a fresh impetus to this some time before there had been a movement for what was called the emancipation of women and a perfect furore arose among girls of all classes for education  there were no upper schools or colleges open to them in russia and they went in enormous numbers to switzerland especially to zurich girls of the upper classes shared their means with the poorer ones and the latter eked out their resources by work of all descriptions zurich as you know is a hotbed of radicalism and those young women who went to learn soon imbibed the wildest ideas then came a ukase ordering the immediate return home of all russian girls abroad it was undoubtedly a great mistake in switzerland they were harmless but when they returned to russia and scattered over the towns and villages they became so many apostles of socialism and undoubtedly strengthened the movement so it grew men of good families left their homes and in the disguise of workmen expounded their principles among the lower classes among these was prince peter krapotkine the rich cossack obuchoff scisoko and rogaceff both officers and scores of others who gave up everything and worked as workmen among workmen  innumerable arrests were made and at one trial a thousand prisoners were convicted so wholesale were the arrests that even the most enthusiastic saw that they were simply sacrificing themselves in vain and about 1877 they changed their tactics the prisons were crowded and the treatment there of the political prisoners was vastly harder than that given to those condemned for the most atrocious crimes as you may imagine when i tell you that in the course of the trial of that one batch i spoke of which lasted four years seventyfive of the prisoners committed suicide went mad or died then when the authorities thought nihilism was stamped out by wholesale severity the matter assumed another phase the crusade by preaching had failed and the nihilists began a crusade of terror first police spies were killed in many places then more highly placed persons officers of the police judges and officials who distinguished themselves by their activity and severity then in the spring of last year vera zasulitch shot at general tr√©poff who had ordered a political prisoner to be flogged she was tried by a jury and the feeling throughout the country was so much in favour of the people who had been so terribly persecuted that she was acquitted the authorities were furious and every effort was made to find and rearrest vera and a verdict of the court acquitting many of the accused in one of the trials was annulled by the czar  well you know godfrey bullen i am not one who meddles with politics you have never heard me speak of them before and i consider the aims of these men would bring about anarchy an anarchy that would deluge the land with blood seems to me detestable and wicked but i cannot but think the government has made a terrible mistake by its severity these people are all enthusiastic fanatics they see that things are not as they should be and they would destroy everything to right them hate their aims as one may one must admit that their conduct is heroic few have quailed in their trials all preserve a calmness of demeanour that even their judges and executioners cannot but admire they seem made of iron they suffer everything give up everything dare everything for their faith they die as the christian martyrs died in rome unflinching unrepentant if they have become as wild beasts severity has made them so their propaganda was at first a peaceful one it is cruelty that has driven them to use the only weapon at their disposal assassination  one man for example in 1877 jacob stefanovic organized a conspiracy in the district of sighirino it spread widely among the peasants the priests violating the secret of the confessional informed the police but these although using every effort could learn no more hundreds of arrests were made but nothing discovered learning that the priests had betrayed them the peasants no longer went to confession and to avoid betraying themselves in a state of drunkenness abstained from the use of brandy but one man tired and without food took a glass it made him drunk and in his drunkenness he spoke to the man who had sold him spirits he was arrested and although he did not know all gave enough clue for the police to follow up and all the leaders and over a thousand persons were arrested two thousand others who were affiliated to the society were warned in time and escaped you can guess the fate of those who were captured  last year three months before you came here general mezentsoff the head of the police was assassinated and since then we know that it is open war between the nihilists and the czar the police hush matters up but they get abroad threatening letters reach the czar in his inmost apartments and it is known that several attempts have been made to assassinate him but have failed  one of the most extraordinary things connected with the movement is that women play a large part in it being in the thick of every conspiracy they are the life and soul of the movement and they are of all classes there are a score of women for whose arrest the authorities would pay any money and yet they elude every effort it is horrible this is what comes of women going to switzerland and learning to look upon religion as a myth and all authority as hateful and to have wild dreams of an impossible state of affairs such as never has existed in this world it is horrible but it is pitiable the prisons in the land are full of victims trains of prisoners set off monthly for siberia it is enough to turn the brain to think of such things how it is to end no one can say  but it was only in bated breath and within closed doors that the discovery of the nihilist plot was discussed in st petersburg elsewhere it was scarcely alluded to although if mentioned those present vied with each other in the violence of their denunciation of it but when society from the highest to the lowest was permeated by secret agents of the police and every word was liable to be reported and misinterpreted a subject so dangerous was shunned by common consent it was known though that large numbers of arrests had been made but even those whose dearest friends had suddenly disappeared said no word of it in public for to be even a distant acquaintance of such a person was dangerous yet apparently everything went on as usual the theatres were as well filled the nevski as crowded and gay     chapter iv  a prisoner   soon after this st petersburg was startled at the news that there had been a terrible explosion at the winter palace and that the czar and royal family had narrowly escaped with their lives upon the following evening godfrey was walking down the nevski where groups of people were still discussing the terrible affair he presently met akim soushiloff and petroff stepanoff he had not seen them for some time and as they had omitted to give him the address of the lodging into which they had moved he was really glad to see them for he liked them better than any of the russians of his acquaintance for both had an earnest manner and seemed to be free from narrow prejudices sincere admirers of england and on most subjects very well informed  it is quite an age since i have seen you both he said where have you been hiding  we have been working harder than usual petroff said our last examinations are just coming off but you said that you would come to see us and you have never done so  you did not tell me where you had moved to godfrey said or i should have done so long ago  that was stupid indeed akim said have you an hour to spare now  yes i have nothing to do and shall be very glad to come round and have a talk this is a horrible business at the winter palace  horrible petroff said but it is just as well not to talk about it in the streets come along we will take you to our place we were just thinking of going back  a quarter of an hours walking took them to the students room which was like the last at the top of the house a lamp was lighted the samovar placed on the table and a little charcoal fire lit under it a glass of vodka was handed round to pass the time until the water was boiling pipes were brought out from the cupboard and filled for cigars which are cheap and good are generally smoked in the streets in russia by the middle and upper classes pipes being only used there by isvostchiks labourers and englishmen the conversation naturally for a time turned upon the explosion in the winter palace the russians expressing an indignation fully equal to that of godfrey then they talked of england both regretting that they were unable to speak the language  i would give much to be able to read shakespeare petroff said i have heard his works spoken of in such high terms by some of our friends who have studied your language and i have heard too from them of your dickens they tell me it is like reading of another worlda world in which there are no officials and no police and no soldiers that must be very near a paradise  we have some soldiers godfrey laughed but one does not see much of them about half of those we have at home are in two military camps one in england and one in ireland there are the guards in london but the population is so large that you might go a week without seeing one while in very few of the provincial towns are there any garrisons at all there are police and plenty of them but as their business is only to prevent crime they naturally dont play a prominent part in novels giving a picture of everyday life as to officials beyond ratecollectors we dont see anything of them though there are magistrates and government clerks and custom officers and that sort of thing but they certainly dont play any prominent part in our lives  so they chatted for an hour when at short intervals two other men came in one was a tall handsome fellow who was introduced by petroff as the son of baron kinkoff the other was a young advocate of moscow on a visit to st petersburg both godfrey observed had knocked in a somewhat peculiar manner at the door which opened as he had noticed when they came in only by a key akim observed a slight expression of surprise in godfreys face at the second knock and said laughing  our remittances have not come to hand of late godfrey and some of our creditors are getting troublesome so we have established a signal by which we know our friends while inconvenient visitors can knock as long as they like and then go away thinking we are out  godfrey chatted for a short time longer and then got up to go akim went to the door with him as it opened there was a sudden rush of men from outside that nearly knocked him down of what followed he had but a vague idea pistol shots rang out there was a desperate struggle he received a blow on the head which struck him to the ground and an instant later there was a tremendous explosion the next thing he knew was that he was being hauled from below some debris as he looked round bewildered he saw that a considerable portion of the ceiling and of the roof above it had been blown out several bodies lay stretched on the floor the room was still full of smoke but by the light of two or three lanterns he perceived that the young baron bleeding freely from a sabre wound across the forehead was standing bound between two policemen with drawn swords policemen were examining the bodies on the floor while others were searching the closets cutting open the beds and turning out their contents akim lay on his back dead and across him lay the young advocate of petroff he could see nothing the other bodies were those of policemen three of these near the door appeared to have been shot the others were lying in contorted positions against the walls as if they had been flung there by the force of the explosion all this he saw in a state of vague wonderment while the two policemen kneeling at his side were passing cords tightly round him  this one still lives one of the policemen said stooping over the young advocate but i think he is nearly done for  never mind bring him along with the others a man in plain clothes said in tones of authority get them away at once we shall have half st petersburg here in a few minutes  godfrey was lifted by the policemen one at his head and one at his feet carried downstairs and flung into a vehicle at the door dully he heard a roar of excited shouts and questions and the sharp orders of the police ranged round the vehicle three policemen took their places inside with him and the vehicle drove off slowly at first until it was free of the crowd and then at a sharp gallop godfrey was conscious of but little as he went along he had a vague idea of a warm moist feeling down the back and wondered whether it was his own blood gradually his impressions became more and more indistinct and he knew nothing more until he was conscious of a sensation of cold at the back of the head and of a murmur of voices round him soon he was lifted up into a sitting position and he felt that bandages were being wrapped round his head then he was laid down again he heard a door slam and a key turn and then he knew nothing more when he awoke daylight was streaming in through a loophole high up in the wall he tried to sit up but could not and looked round trying to recall where he was and what had happened he was in a dark cell with no furniture save the straw on which he was lying  it is a prison certainly he muttered to himself how did i get here  then gradually the events of the night before came to his mind there had been a terrible fight akim had been killed there had been a tremendous explosion the police had something to do with it was it all a dream or was it real was he dreaming now he was some time before he could persuade himself that it was all real and indeed it was not until the door opened and two men entered that he felt quite sure that he godfrey bullen was really lying there in a prison cell with a dull numbing pain at the back of his head and too weak even to sit upright one of the men leaned over him godfrey tried to speak but could not do so above a whisper  he will do now the man said without paying any attention to his words he must have a thick skull or that swordcut would have finished him give him some wine and water now and some soup presently we must not let him slip through our fingers  some liquid was poured between his lips and then he was left alone again certainly it is all real he said to himself akim must have been killed and i must be a prisoner what in the world can it be all about he was too weak to think but after another visit had been paid him and he had been lifted up and given some strong broth he began to think more clearly can it have been a nihilist arrest he thought to himself akim and petroff can never be nihilists the idea is absurd i have never heard them say a word against the government or the czar  then he thought of their friend katia and how she had got him to aid in the escape of a nihilist it is all nonsense he murmured the idea of a girl like that being mixed up in a conspiracy then his ideas again became more and more confused and when the doctor visited him again in the evening he was in a state of high fever talking incoherently to himself for seven days he continued in that state there was no lack of care the doctor visited him at very short intervals and an attendant remained night and day beside him applying cold bandages to his head and carefully noting down in a book every word that passed his lips then a good constitution gradually triumphed over the fever and on the eighth day he lay a mere shadow of himself but cool and sensible on a bed in an airy ward nourishing food was given to him in abundance but it was another week before he was able to stand alone then one morning two attendants brought a stretcher to the side of his bed he was assisted to put on his clothes and was then placed on the stretcher and carried away he was taken through long passages up and down stairs at last into a large room here he was lifted on the stretcher and placed in a chair facing him at a table were nine officers  prisoner the president said glancing at a large closelywritten sheet of paper before him you are accused of taking part in a nihilist conspiracy to murder the czar  i know nothing of any nihilist conspiracy godfrey said i was accidentally in the room with my friends akim and petroff when the police entered  the president waved his hand impatiently that of course he said your name is godfrey bullen  yes sir  born in st petersburg but of english parentage  godfrey bowed his head  three months since you took part in the plot by means of which the notorious valerian ossinsky escaped from the hands of the police and you were the accomplice of sophia perovskaia in that matter  i never heard the name before godfrey said  the president paid no attention but went on you said at the time he continued reading from the notes that you did not know the woman who spoke to you but it is known that she was an associate of akim soushiloff and petroff stepanoff at whose place you were captured the other day there is therefore no doubt that you know her  i knew her under another name godfrey said but if i had been told she was sophia perovskaia it conveyed nothing to me for i had never heard of her  you are committing yourself prisoner the president said coldly when examined you denied all acquaintance with the woman and declared that she was a stranger  excuse me sir godfrey said i said it was a masked woman and that i did not see her face which was perfectly true i admit now that i did know who she was but naturally as a gentleman i endeavoured to shield her in a matter concerning which i believed that she was as innocent as i was  a murmur of incredulity ran round the circle of officers  a few days after that the president went on again reading from his notes you were present with akim soushiloff and petroff stepanoff at a supper in a trakir in ossuloff street there were present on that occasionand he read a list of six namesfour of whom have since been convicted and punished and two of whom although not yet taken are known to have been engaged in the murderous attempt at the winter palace you were greeted there with significant enthusiasm which was evidently a testimony on the part of these conspirators to the part you had played in the affair of ossinsky  godfrey felt that the meshes were closing round him he remembered that he had wondered at the time why he had been received with such great cordiality  now the president went on you are captured in the room of akim soushiloff and petroff stepanoff who were both beyond doubt engaged in the plot at the winter palace with two other equally guilty conspirators and were doubtless deliberating on some fresh atrocity when interrupted by the agents of the police you shared in the desperate resistance they made which resulted in the death of eight police officers by pistol shot or by the explosion of gunpowder by which petroff stepanoff who fired it was also blown to pieces what have you to say in your defence  i still say that i am perfectly innocent godfrey said i knew nothing of these men being conspirators in any way and i demand to be allowed to communicate with my friends and to obtain the assistance of an advocate  an advocate could say nothing for you the president said you do not deny any of the charges brought against you which are that you were the associate of these assassins that you aided sophia perovskaia in effecting the escape of valerian ossinsky that you received the congratulations of the conspirators at the banquet and that you were found in this room in company with four of the men concerned in the attempt to assassinate the czar but the court is willing to be merciful and if you will tell all you know with reference to this plot and give the names of all the conspirators with whom you have been concerned your offence will be dealt with as leniently as possible  i repeat that i know nothing and can therefore disclose nothing sir and i venture to protest against the authority of this court to try and condemn me an englishman  no matter what is the nationality of the person the president said coldly who offends against the laws of this country he is amenable to its laws and his nationality affords him no protection whatever you will have time given you to think the matter over before your sentence is communicated to you remove the prisoner  godfrey was laid on the stretcher again and carried away this time he was taken not to the room where he had been placed while ill but to a dark cell where scarce a ray of light penetrated there was a heap of straw in one corner a loaf of black bread and a jug of water godfrey when left alone shook up the straw to make it as comfortable as he possibly could then sat down upon it with his back against the wall  well this is certainly a go he said to himself if there was one thing that seemed less likely than another it was that i should get involved in this nihilist business in the first place the governor specially warned me against it in the second place i have been extremely careful never to give any opinion on public affairs and in the third place if there is one thing i detest more than another it is assassination i cannot say it is cowardly in these men the nihilists do more than risk their lives they give their lives away to carry out their end still though i own it is not cowardly i hate it the question is what next petrovytch will of course write home to say that i am missing i dont suppose he will have the slightest idea that i have been arrested as a nihilist i dont see how he could think so he is more likely to think that i have been made away with somehow no doubt my father will come out but of course he wont learn any more than petrovytch unless they choose to tell him i dont suppose they will tell him i have heard that generally families of people they seize know nothing about it unless they are arrested too they may guess what has happened but they dont know in my case i should fancy the police would say nothing  they will hear from the inquiries that my father makes that he has no suspicion of what has happened to me and they will know if they did tell him our ambassador would be making a row but even if the governor were to learn what had become of me and were to insist upon learning what crime i am accused of committing i do not see that things would be much better they would hand over the notes of the evidence on which i was convicted and taking it altogether i am bound to say i do not see how they could help convicting me short of catching me like a sort of guy fawkes blowing up the palace the case is about as strong as it could be i certainly have put my foot in it i was acquainted with these two conspirators through them i got acquainted with that confounded woman katia though it seems that wasnt her name then through her i helped this fellow ossinsky to escape then trying to shield her i make matters twenty times worse for while my answer before led them to believe that she was a perfect stranger to me i was ass enough to let out just now that i knew her then there was that supper i could not make out at the time why they greeted me so heartily now of course it is plain enough and now just after this blowingup business here am i caught with four notorious conspirators and mixed up in a fight in which eight or ten policemen are killed and the roof blown off a house that would be circumstantial evidence enough to condemn a man in england let alone russia  i dont suppose they are going to hang me because they publish the names of the fellows they hang but imprisonment for years in one of their ghastly dungeons is bad enough if it is to be it will be siberia i hope there must be some way of getting out of a big country like thatnorth south east or west well i dont see any use bothering over it i have got into a horrible scrape there is no doubt about that and i must take what comes  godfrey was essentially of a hopeful nature and always looked at the bright side of things he was a strong believer in the adage where there is a will there is a way he had been in his full share of scrapes at school and had always made a rule of taking things easily he now examined the cell  beastly place he said and horribly damp i wonder why dungeons are always damp cellars at home are not damp and a dungeon is nothing but a cellar after all well i shall take a nap  the next day godfrey was again taken before the tribunal and again closely questioned as to his knowledge of the nihilists he again insisted that he knew nothing of them  of course i knew akim soushiloff and petroff stepanoff but i had only been in their rooms once before and the only person i met there before was the young woman who called herself katia but who you say was somebody else this was at the lodgings they occupied before  but you were found with alexander kinkoff and paul kousmitch  they only arrived a short time before the police entered i had never seen either of them before  these two prisoners had been examined before godfrey entered and had been questioned about him kousmitch had declared that he had never seen him before and the court knew that the spies who had been watching the house had seen him enter but a short time before the police force arrived as the two statements had been made independently it was thought probable that in this respect godfrey was speaking the truth not so however his assertions that he was unacquainted with any of the other conspirators  he was again taken back to his cell and for the next week saw no one but the warder who brought his bread and water and who did not reply by a single word to any questions that he asked him godfrey did his best to keep up his spirits he had learnt by heart at shrewsbury the first two books of the iliad and these he daily repeated aloud set himself equations to do and solved them in his head repeated the dates in greek history and went through everything he could remember as having learned  he occasionally heard footsteps above him and wondered whether that also was a cell and what sort of man the prisoner was once or twice at night when all was quiet he heard loud cries and wondered whether they were the result of delirium or torture his gruff jailer was somewhat won by his cheerfulness every day godfrey wished him good morning as he visited the cell inquired what the weather was like outside expressed an earnest hope that silence didnt disagree with him and generally joked and laughed as if he rather enjoyed himself than otherwise at the end of the week an official entered the cell  i have come to inform you prisoner that the sentence of death that had been passed upon you has by the clemency of the czar been commuted to banishment for life to siberia  very well sir godfrey said i know of course that i am perfectly innocent of the crime of which i am charged but as the czar no doubt supposes that i am guilty of taking part in a plot against his life i acknowledge and thank him for his clemency i have no peculiar desire to visit siberia but at least it will be a change for the better from this place i trust that it shall not be long before i start  as the official was unable to make out whether godfrey spoke in mockery or not he made no reply  these nihilists are men of iron he said afterwards they walk to the scaffold with smiling faces they exist in dungeons that would kill a dog in twentyfour hours and nothing can tempt them to divulge their secrets even starvation does not affect them they are dangerous enemies but it must be owned that they are brave men and women this boy for he is little more almost laughed in our faces and in spite of his stay in that damp cell seemed to be in excellent spirits it is the same with them all though i own that some of them do break down sometimes but i think that those who commit suicide do so principally because they are afraid that under pressure they may divulge secrets against each other ossip who attends that young fellow says that he is always the same and speaks as cheerfully to him every morning as if he were in a palace instead of in a dungeon  two days later godfrey was aroused in the night  why it is not light yet he said what are you disturbing me at this time for  get up the man said you are going to start  thank goodness for that godfrey said jumping up from his straw that is the best news that i have heard for a long time  in the courtyard seven prisoners were standing they were placed at some distance from each other and by each stood a soldier and a policeman a similar guard took their places by the side of godfrey as he came out an official took charge of the whole party and still keeping a few paces apart they sallied out through the prison doors and marched through the sleeping city perhaps godfrey was the only one of the party who did not feel profoundly impressed they were going to leave behind them for ever family and friends and country and many would have welcomed death as an escape from the dreary prospect before them godfreys present feeling was that of exhilaration  he had done his best to keep his mind at work but the damp and unwholesome air of the cell had told upon him enfeebled as he had been by the attack of fever as he walked along now he drew in deep breaths of the brisk night air and looked with delight at the stars glistening overhead as to the future just at that moment it troubled him but little he knew nothing of siberia beyond having heard that the prisoners there led a terrible life that he should escape from it some time or other seemed to him a matter of course how he could form no idea until he got there but as to the fact he had no misgiving for it seemed to him ridiculous that in a country so enormous as siberia a prisoner could not make his way out sooner or later  when they reached the railwaystation a train stood in readiness each prisoner had a separate compartment his two guards accompanying him godfrey addressed a word to his custodians the policeman however said you are forbidden to speak and in a minute or two the train moved off  godfrey dozed occasionally until morning and then looked out at the dark woods through which they passed for hours twice the train stopped at lonely stations and the prisoners were supplied with food in the afternoon godfrey saw the gilded and painted domes of a great city and knew that it must be moscow here however they made no stay but steamed straight through the station and continued their way godfrey slept soundly after it became dark waking up once when the train came to a standstill at early morning he was roused and ordered to alight and in the same order as before the prisoners were marched through the streets of nijni novgorod to the bank of the volga few people were yet abroad in the streets but all they met looked pityingly at the group of exiles a sight of daily occurrence in the springtime of the year ordinary prisoners of whom from fifteen to twenty thousand are sent annually to siberia are taken down the volga in a convict barge towed by a steamer in batches of six or seven hundred political prisoners are differently treated they are carried on board the ordinary steamer each having a separate cabin and during the voyage they are allowed no intercourse whatever either with each other or with the ordinary passengers   illustration map of russian empire  of these there were a considerable number on board the steamer as the season had but just begun and merchants traders and officials were taking advantage of the rivers being open to push forward into siberia at present however these were all below the prisoners were conducted to the cabins reserved for them and then locked in presently godfrey heard a buzz of many voices and a general movement in the cabin outside and the fact that he was a prisoner and cut off from the world came to him more strongly than it had hitherto done an hour later there was a movement and shouting overhead then he felt the paddles revolving and knew that the steamer was under way he could however see nothing a sort of shutter was fastened outside the scuttle which gave him the opportunity to take a glimpse of the sky but nothing of the shore or water nothing could be more monotonous than the journey and yet the air and light that came down through the porthole rendered it far more pleasant than existence in a prison cell he knew too that dull as it was in the cabin there would be little to see on deck for the shores of the rivers were everywhere flat and low  after twentyfour hours travel the steamer stopped since godfrey had been in russia he had naturally studied the geography of the empire and knew a good deal about the routes he guessed therefore that the halt was at kasan the capital of the old tartar kingdom it was a break to him to listen to the noises overhead to guess at the passengers who were leaving and coming on board to listen to scraps of conversation that could be heard through the open porthole and to the shouts of farewell from those on board to those on shore as the vessel steamed on again he knew that after two hours more steaming down the volga the vessel turned up the kama a large river running into it and navigable for 1400 miles up this the vessel steamed for three days and then reached perm in the evening godfrey and his companions were disembarked and strictly guarded as before were marched to the railwaystation placed in a special carriage attached to a train and after twentyfour hours travel at the rate of about twelve miles an hour reached ekaterinburg this railway had only been open for a year and until its completion this portion of the journey had been one of the most tiresome along the whole route as the ural mountains intervene between perm and ekaterinburg their height is not great here and the railway crosses them at not more than 1700 feet above sealevel  on arriving at the station half the prisoners were at once placed in vehicles and the others were sent to the prison godfrey was one of the party that went on at once the vehicle which was called a telega was a sort of narrow waggon without springs seats or cover the bottom was covered with a deep layer of straw and there were some thick rugs for coverings at night it was drawn by three horses godfrey was in the last of the four vehicles that started together his soldier guard took his place beside him four mounted cossacks rode two on each side of the procession the driver a peasant to whom the horses belonged cracked his shorthandled whip and the horses sprang forward siberian horses are wiry little animals not taking to the eye but possessing speed and great endurance the posthouses are situated from twelve to twentyfive versts apart according to the difficulty of the country a verst being about twothirds of an english mile at these posthouses relays of horses are always kept in readiness for one or two vehicles but word is sent on before when political prisoners are coming and extra relays are obtained by the postmasters from the peasants  to godfrey the sensation of being whirled through the air as fast as the horses could gallop was after his long confinement perfectly delightful and he fairly shouted with joy and excitement now that they were past ekaterinburg godfreys guard a goodtemperedlooking young fellow seemed to consider that it was no longer necessary to preserve an absolute silence which had no doubt been as irksome to him as to his companion  we can talk now why are you so merry  to be in the air again is glorious godfrey said i should not mind how long the journey lasted if it were like this how far do we travel in carriages  to tiumen 300 versts then we take steamer again that is if you go farther  you dont know where we are going to then  not at all it will be known at tiumen that is where these things are settled generally but people like you are under special orders you dont look very wicked and he smiled in a friendly way as he looked at the lad beside him  i am not wicked at all not in the way you think godfrey said  do not talk about that the soldier interrupted i must not know anything about you talk about other things but not why you are here  godfrey nodded if we go on beyond tiumen we go by steamer do we not  yes through tobolsk to tomsk beyond that we shall drive you are lucky you people that you drive the others walk it is long work but not so long as it used to be they say i have been told that in the old times when they started on foot from moscow it took them sometimes two years to reach the farthest places now they have the railway and the steamers on the river as far as tomsk  how do they take them in the steamers  they take them in great barges that are towed we passed two on our way to perm they hold five or six hundred there is a great iron cage on deck and they let half the number up at a time in order to get air they are always going along at this time of year for they all go early in the season so as to get to the journeys end before the frosts set in  but surely all these men cannot be guilty of great crimes godfrey said for i have heard that about twenty thousand a year are sent away  no many of them are only lazy fellows who drink and will not work we sent away three from my village the year before i was taken for a soldier they were lazy and would not do their share of work so the heads of the village met and decided that they should go to siberia they drew up a paper which was sent to be confirmed by the judge of the district and then soldiers came and took them away  but you dont mean to say godfrey said that men are sent to prison all their lives because they are lazy  oh no no one would think of such a thing as that men like these are only sent to the big towns tiumen or perm or tobolsk and then they are settled on land or work in the towns but they are free to do as they like the country wants labour and men who wont work at home and expect the community to keep them have to work here or else they would starve then there are numbers who are only guilty of some small offence they have stolen something or they have resisted the taxgatherer or something of that sort they only go to prison for the term of their sentences perhaps only three or four months and then they too are free like the others and can work in the towns or trade if they happen to have money to set them up or they can settle in a village and take up land and cultivate it they can live where they like in siberia i had many rich men pointed out to me in tobolsk who had come out as convicts  you have been here before then godfrey said  yes this is my second journey i hope i shall come no more we get a little extra pay and are better fed than we are with the regiment and we have no drill but then it is sad last time i had one with me who had left his wife and family behind he was always sad he talked to me sometimes of them there was no one else to talk to he was here for life and he knew he should never see them again she was young and would marry again  but she couldnt do that as long as he lived godfrey said  oh yes from the day a prisoner crosses the frontier his marriage is annulled and his wife can marry again she may come with him if she likes but if she does she can never go back again  and do many wives come  a good many the soldier said but i only know what i have heard i was with one of you last time and it was only on the way back that i heard of things about the others formerly the guards remained in siberia if they chose it was too far to send them back to russia but now that the journey is done so quickly and we can get back all the way from tomsk by the rivers except this little bit we go back again as soon as we have handed over our charges i did not go farther than tomsk last time and i was back at nijni in less than three months after starting what part of russia do you come from  i am an englishman  the soldier looked round in surprise i did not know englishmen could speak our language so well of course i noticed that your speech was not quite like mine but i am from the south and i thought you must come from somewhere in the north or from poland how did and here he stopped but i must not ask that i dont want to know anything not even your name look there we are just going to pass a convoy of other prisoners  in a minute or two they overtook the party it consisted of about a hundred and fifty prisoners escorted by a dozen mounted cossacks the men were in prison garb of yellowishbrown stuff with a coloured patch in the back between the shoulders they had chains fastened to rings round the ankles and tied up to their belts they were not heavy and interfered very little with their walking the procession in no way accorded with godfreys preconceived idea the men were walking along without much attempt at regular order they were laughing and talking together or with their guards and some of them shouted chaffing remarks to the four vehicles as they swept past them  they do not look very unhappy godfrey said  why should they the soldier replied they are better off than they would be at home lots of men break the law on purpose to be sent out it is a good country they say wives get rid of their husbands by informing against them and getting them sent here i believe there are quite as many husbands with scolding wives who get themselves sent here to be free of them as long as they are on the road or employed in hard labour they are fed better than they ever were at home better a great deal than we soldiers are even in the prisons they do not work so very hard for it is difficult to find work for them only if they are sent to the mines their lot is bad of that i know nothing but i have heard as for the rest from what i have seen of it i should say that a convict here is better off than a peasant at home but here we are at the posthouse     chapter v  an old acquaintance   the stay at the posthouses was very short as soon as the vehicles were seen coming along the straight level road the first set of horses were brought out and the leading tarantass was ready to proceed in two or three minutes the other horses were changed as quickly and in less than ten minutes from their arrival the whole were on their way again while the horses were being changed the prisoners were permitted to get out and stretch their legs but were not allowed to exchange a word with each other or with anyone else at every fourth stage a bowl of soup with a hunch of bread was brought to each prisoner by one of the guards at the ostrov or prison where the convicts were lodged as they came along there were rugs in the vehicles to lay over them at night when the air was sharp and chilly although in the day the sun had great power and the dust rose in clouds under the horses feet  there was little of interest to be seen on the journey only round the villages was there any cultivation and the plains stretched away unbroken save by small groups of cattle horses and sheep although godfrey had not minded the shaking of the springless vehicle for the first stage or two he felt long before he reached the journeys end as if every bone was dislocated as a rule the road was good but in some places where it passed through swampy tracts it had given in the spring thaw and had been cut into deep ruts here the shaking as they passed along at night was tremendous godfrey and his companion were dashed against each other or against the sides with such force that godfrey several times thought his skull was fractured and he was indeed thankful when after forty hours on the road they drove into tiumen  tiumen is a town of over 15000 inhabitants and is the first town arrived at in siberia proper the frontier between russia and that country running between ekaterinburg and that town here the prisoners were at once placed on board a steamer and godfrey was glad indeed to throw himself down upon the bed where he slept without waking until the steamer got under way in the morning he was delighted to see that the porthole was not as in the first boat blocked by an outside shutter but that he could look out over the country as they passed along for a time the scenery was similar to that which they had been passing over bare and desolate but it presently assumed a different character fields of green wheat stretched away from the river side comfortablelooking little villages succeeded each other rapidly as the steamer passed along and save for the difference of architecture and the peculiar green domes and pinnacles of the little churches he might have been looking over a scene in england  the river was about two hundred yards wide here a smooth and placid stream the steamer did not proceed at any great pace as it was towing behind it one of the heavy convict barges and although the passage is ordinarily performed in a day and a half it took them nearly a day longer to accomplish and it was not until late in the afternoon of the third day that tobolsk came in sight through his porthole godfrey obtained a good view of the town containing nearly 30000 inhabitants with large government buildings and a great many houses built of stone it is built in a very unhealthy position the country round being exceedingly low and marshy after passing tobolsk they entered the obi one of the largest rivers in asia the next morning the steamer again started for her sixteenhundredmile journey to tomsk the journey occupied eight days the convict barge having been left behind at tobolsk  the time passed tediously to godfrey for the banks were low and flat villages were very rare and the steamer only touched at three places herds of horses were seen from time to time roaming untended over the country the only amusement was in watching the ostjaks the natives of the banks of the obi these people have no towns or villages but live in rough tents made of skins he saw many of them fishing from their tiny canoes but the steamer did not pass near enough to them to enable him to get a view of them as they generally paddled away towards the shore as the steamer approached he heard afterwards that they are wonderfully skilful in the use of the bow which they use principally for killing squirrels and other small animals these bows are six feet long the arrows four feet the head is a small iron ball so as to kill without injuring the fur of small animals and the feats recorded of the english archers of old times are far exceeded by the ostjaks even at long distances they seldom fail to strike a squirrel on the head and godfrey was informed by a man who had been present that he saw an ostjak shoot an arrow high into the air and cut it in two with another arrow as it descended a feat that seemed to him altogether incredible but is confirmed by the evidence of russian travellers  tomsk is situated on the river tom an affluent of the obi the town is about the same size as tobolsk the climate of the district is considered the best in siberia the land is fertile and among the mountains are many valuable mines although a comparatively small province in comparison to tobolsk on one side and yeneseisk on the other it contains an area of half a million square miles and excluding russia is bigger than any two countries of europe together it contains a rural population of 725000130000 natives chiefly tartars and kalmucs and 30000 troops  here godfrey was landed and marched to the prison of these there are two the one a permanent convict establishment the other for the temporary detention of prisoners passing through godfrey slipped a few roubles into the hand of his guard for his watch money and the other things in his pockets had been restored to him before starting on his journey after two days stop in the prison the journey was continued as before a soldier sitting by the driver a policeofficer taking the place of the soldier who had before accompanied him he began to speak to godfrey as soon as they started  we are not so strict now he said you will soon be across the line into eastern siberia and you will no longer meet people through whom you might send messages or letters as to escape that would be out of the question since you left ekaterinburg for none can travel either by steamer or post without a permit or even enter an inn and the document must be shown at every village  but i suppose prisoners do escape sometimes godfrey said  there have not been a dozen escapes in the last fifty years the policeman said there are great numbers get away from their prisons or employments every year but the authorities do not trouble about them they may take to the mountains or forests and live on game for a few months in summer but when winter arrives they must come in and give themselves up  what happens to them then godfrey asked  perhaps nothing but solitary confinement for a bit perhaps a beating with rods just according to the temper of the chief official at the time perhaps if it is a bad case they are sent to the mines for a bit that is what certainly happens when they are political prisoners  why cant they get right away  where are they to go to the officer said with a laugh to the south there are sandy deserts where they would certainly die of thirst to the north trackless forests cold that would freeze a bullock solid in a night great rivers miles wide to cross and terrible morasses to say nothing of the wolves who would make short work of you the native tribes to the west and the people of the desert are all fierce and savage and would kill anyone who came among them merely for his clothes and besides they get a reward from government for every escaped prisoner they bring in alive or dead no we dont want bolts or bars to keep prisoners in here the whole land is a prisonhouse and the prisoners know well enough that it is better to live under a roof and to be well fed there than to starve in the forest with the prospect of a flogging at the end of their holiday still there are thousands take to the woods in the summer the government does not care why should it it is spared the expense of feeding them and if they starve to death or kill each other off in their quarrels for the greater part of them would think no more of taking life than of killing a fowl there is an end of all further trouble about them for you understand it is only the men who have life sentences the murderers and so on that attempt to run away the shortsentence men are not such fools  no he went on kindly seeing that godfrey looked depressed at what he had heard whatever you do dont think of running away if you behave well and gain the good opinion of the authorities you wont find yourself uncomfortable you will be made a clerk or a storekeeper and will have a good deal of liberty after a time if you try to run away you will probably be sent to the mines and though it is not so bad there as they say it is bad enough  but even this prospect was not very cheering to godfrey hitherto it had seemed to him that there could be no real difficulty although there might be many hardships and privations in making his escape from so vast a prison he had told himself that it must be possible to evade pursuit in so vast a region but now it seemed that nature had set so strong a wall round the country that the russians did not even trouble themselves to pursue confident that in time the prisoners must come back again but he was not silent long with the buoyancy of youth he put the question aside for the present with the reflection where there is a will there is a way anyhow some fellows have got away and if they have done it i can  godfrey had not as yet realized his situation the sentence for life had fallen upon his ears but not upon his mind he still viewed the matter as he might have viewed some desperate scrape at school he had as he would have said put his foot in it horribly but that he should really have to pass his whole life in these wilds should never see england again his father mother or sisters was a thing that his mind absolutely refused to grasp of course i shall get away somehow this had been the refrain that was constantly running through his mind and even now a satisfactory reply to the assertion that not a dozen men had made their escape at once occurred to him there was no motive to induce them to make their escape they could not return to russia and in any other country they would be even more in exile than here where everyone spoke their language and where as far as he had seen the climate was as good as that of russia and the country no more flat and ugly  there is nothing they can want to escape for he repeated to himself i have everything to escape for and i mean to do it having once reestablished that view to his satisfaction he began to chat away cheerfully again to his companion it is not everyone he said who possesses my advantages or who can travel five or six thousand miles by rail steamer and carriage without ever having to put his hand in his pocket for a single kopec the only objection to it is that they dont give me a return ticket  that is an objection the policeman agreed smiling  we are not going to travel night and day as we did between ekaterinburg and tiumen i hope  oh no we shall only travel while it is light  well that is a comfort it was bad enough for that short distance it would be something awful if it had to be kept up for a fortnight how long shall we be before we get to irkoutsk  about a month i know nothing as to what will be done with you beyond that you may for anything i know go to the mines at nertchinsk which are a long distance east beyond irkoutsk or you may go to verkhoyansk a yakout settlement 3000 miles from irkutsk within the arctic circle there are lots of these penal settlements scattered over the country they do not send the ordinary convict population there there is no danger from them but the theory is that the politicals are always plotting and therefore they are for the most part sent where by no possibility can they get up trouble  godfrey set his lips hard together and asked no questions for the next halfhour although the journey was not continued by night the telega was still godfreys constant place of abode sometimes it was wheeled under a shed sometimes it stood in the road but in all cases the policeman was by his side night and day godfrey was indifferent whether he slept in a bed or in the telega which when the straw was fresh shaken up and a couple of rugs laid upon it was by no means uncomfortable the nights were not cold and no rain had fallen since he left nijni he further reflected that probably there would be fleas and other vermin in the posthouses and that altogether he was a gainer instead of a loser by the regulation  he was pleased with the appearance of atchinsk a bright little town a days journey from tomsk it was like all the siberian towns built of wood but the houses were all painted white or gray picked out with bright colours it stood in the middle of a large grass plain with inclosed meadows of luxuriant herbage and bright flowers among which large numbers of sheep and cattle were feeding beyond this the country again became dull and monotonous krasnoiarsk was the next town reached between this town and kansk the country was again cultivated  scarce a day passed without large gangs of convicts being overtaken on the road for some distance godfrey suffered terribly from mosquitoes which swarmed so thickly that the peasants working in the fields were obliged to wear black veils over their faces fortunately he had been warned by his guard at atchinsk that there would be trouble with these pests on further and the man had at his request bought for him a few yards of muslin under which they sat during the day and spread over the telega at night it was however a long and dreary journey and godfrey was heartily glad when at last they saw the domes of irkoutsk a city of fifty thousand inhabitants  they drove rapidly through the town to the prison where he was placed in a cell by himself the morning after his arrival the warder entered with a man carrying a basin and shaving apparatus  confound it godfrey muttered i have been expecting this ever since i saw the first gang of convicts but i hoped they did not do it to us  it was of course useless to remonstrate his hair which had grown to a great length since he left st petersburg was first cut short then the barber lathered his head and set to work with a razor godfrey wondered what his particular style of hair was going to be he had noticed that all the convicts were partially shaved some were left bare from the centre of the head down one side others had the front half of the head shaved while the hair at the back was left some had only a ridge of hair running along the top of the head either from the forehead to the nape of the neck or from one ear to the other  he is shaving me like a monk he said to himself as the work proceeded well i think that is the best after all for with a cap on it wont show  when the barber had done he stepped back and surveyed godfrey with an air of satisfaction while the jailer as he wrote down the particulars in a notebook grinned godfrey passed his hand over his head and found that as he supposed he had been shaved halfway down to the ears but in the middle of this bald place the barber had left a patch of hair about the size of halfacrown which stood up perfectly erect he burst into a shout of laughter in which the other two men joined the jailer patted him approvingly on the shoulder bravo young fellow he said pleased at seeing how lightly godfrey took it for many of the exiles who had stood bravely the loss of their liberty were completely broken down by the loss of a portion of their hair which branded them wherever they went as convicts  godfrey was then taken out into a large courtyard and out through a gate into another inclosure this had evidently been added but a very short time to the precincts of the prison it was of considerable size being four or five acres in extent and was surrounded on three sides by a palisade some fourteen feet in height of newlysawn timber the wall of the prison formed the fourth side of the square in each corner of the inclosure was placed a clump of six little wooden huts two low fences ran across the inclosure at right angles to each other dividing the space into four equal squares where the fences crossed each other there was an inclosure a few yards across and in this were two sentryboxes with soldiers musket in hand standing by them a few men were listlessly moving about while others were digging and working in small garden patches into which the inclosures were divided the policeman who accompanied godfrey led him to one of the little huts he opened the door and went in a young man was sitting there  i have brought you a companion the policeman said he will share your hut with you you can teach him what is required with this brief introduction he closed the door behind him and left the young man had risen and he and godfrey looked hard at each other  surely we have met before the prisoner said i know your face quite well  and i know yours also godfrey replied  now that you speak i know you you are the young englishman godfrey bullen  i am godfrey replied and you  alexis stumpoff  so it is godfrey exclaimed in surprise and delighted at this meeting they shook hands cordially  but what are you here for godfrey asked i thought that you had obtained an appointment at tobolsk  yes i was sent out as assistant to the doctor of one of the prisons i suppose you understood that it was not the sort of appointment one would choose  i was certainly surprised when i heard that you were going so far away godfrey said as my friends told me that you had property it seemed almost like going into banishment  that was just what it was the young doctor laughed i had been too outspoken in my political opinions and one or two of our set had been arrested and sent out here and when i was informed on the day after i passed my examinations that i was appointed to a prison at tobolsk it was also intimated to me that it would be more agreeable to go there in that capacity than as a prisoner as i was also of that opinion and as to tell you the truth some of our friends were for pushing matters a good deal farther than i cared about doing i was not altogether sorry to get out of it  but how is it that you are here as a prisoner godfrey asked  that is more than i can tell you some two months ago the governor of the prison entered my room with two warders and informed me briefly that i was to be sent here as a prisoner i had ten minutes given me to pack up my things for the journey and half an hour later was in the cabin of a steamer with a cossack at the door what it was for heaven only knows i had never broken any regulations never spoken to a political prisoner when in the hospital except to ask him medical questions and had never opened my lips on politics to a soul there  i think perhaps i can enlighten you godfrey said and he related to him the attempt to blow up the emperor at the winter palace and the fate of petroff stepanoff and akim soushiloff  that does indeed explain it alexis said i was very intimate with both of them and it is quite enough to have been intimate with two men engaged in a plot against the life of the czar to ensure one a visit to siberia so that is it i have thought of everything and it seemed to me that it must have been something at st petersburgthat my name had been found on a list when some of the nihilists were arrested or something of that sort for i certainly did join them but that was before there was any idea of taking steps against the czar no wonder you are here after being mixed up in that escape of valerian ossinsky and then being caught again with four nihilists just after that terrible attempt to blow up the czar i wonder they did not hang you  i wonder too godfrey said i suppose if i had been a year or two older they would have done so but i can assure you i had not the slightest idea that petroff and akim were nihilists i do think that the country is horribly misgoverned but as a foreigner that was no business of mine and however strongly i felt i would have had nothing to do with men who tried to gain their end by assassination i was just as innocent in the affair of ossinsky i behaved like a fool i grant but that was all i had met the woman who as i now know was sophia perovskaia but she was only known to me then from having met her once in petroff and akims room and she was introduced to me as akims cousin katia i met her at the operahouse and she told me a cockandbull story about a young officer who had come to see a lady there and had left his regiment at moscow without leave to do so his colonel who was at the operahouse had heard of his being there and was looking for him and i was persuaded to change dominoes with him to enable him to slip off  oh that was it alexis said i wondered how you got mixed up in the affair and still more why they let you out after your having been caught in what they considered a serious business well here we are victims both and it is a curious chance that has thrown us together again  well what is our life here godfrey asked  alexis shrugged his shoulders as a life it is detestable though were it for a short time only there would be nothing to grumble about we are fairly fed we have each a patch of ground where we can grow vegetables the twelve men in these huts can visit and talk to each other when that is said all is said oh by the way we are also permitted to make anything we like that is we can buy the materials if we have money and the work can be sold in the town there is one man has made himself a turninglathe and he makes all sorts of pretty little things there is another man who was an officer in the navy he carves little models of ships out of wood and bone another man paints i have not decided yet what i shall do i had two or three hundred roubles when i was sent off here and as i only spent four or five on the road i have plenty to last me for some time for tea and tobacco  but how do you get them  the warders smuggle them in it is an understood thing and there is no real objection to it though they are very strict about bringing in spirits still we can get vodka if we have a mind to it is only a question of bribery  how long are you here for alexis  fifteen years  i am supposed to be in for life godfrey said  fifteen years is as bad as life the young doctor said what is the use of your life after having been shut up here for fifteen years  well i dont mean to stay that is one thing godfrey said there cant be any difficulty in escaping from here  not the least in the world alexis said quietly but where do you propose to go  i have not settled yet it seems to me that any one with pluck and energy ought to be able to make his way out of this country somehow besides from what i hear great numbers do get away and take to the woods  yes but they have to give themselves up again  that may be but i hear also that if they give themselves up a long way from the prison they escape from and refuse to give any account whatever of themselves they are simply sent to prison again as vagabonds in that case they are treated as ordinary convicts now from what i hear an ordinary convict is infinitely better off than a political one of course you have to associate with a bad lot still that is better than almost solitary confinement the work they have to do is not hard and if they are well conducted they are let out after a time whereas there is no hope for a political prisoner at any rate even if i knew that if i was retaken i should be hung at once i should try it  but the distance to the frontier is enormous and even when you get there you would be arrested at the first place you come to if you have no papers besides how could you get through the winter  i should get through the winter somehow godfrey said stoutly there are hundreds and thousands of people in scattered villages who live through the winter why shouldnt i i would make friends with the natives in the north and live in their huts and hunt with them but i am not thinking of that the distance is as you say enormous and the cold terrible my idea is to escape by the south  it is a desert godfrey  oh they call it a desert to frighten people from trying to escape that way but i know there is a caravan route by which the teas come from china besides there are tribesmen who wander about there and pick up a living somehow i dont say that i am going to succeed i only say i am going to try i may lose my life or i may be sent back again very well then i will try again some other way we are not far from the chinese frontier here are we  no the frontier is at kiakhta not more than three or four hundred miles away  what are the people like  they are called buriats and are a sort of mongol tribe living generally in tents and wandering with their flocks and herds through the country like the patriarchs of old  if they have large flocks and herds godfrey said the reward the russians offer for escaped convicts cant tempt them much most likely they are hospitable almost all these wandering tribes are if one had luck one might get befriended and stick for a time to one of these tribes in their wanderings south and then get hold of some other people and so get passed on there cant be anything impossible in it alexis we know that travellers have made their way through africa alone mungo park did and lots of other people have done so and some of the negro tribes are according to all accounts a deal more savage than the asiatic tribes once among them it doesnt much matter which way one goes whether it is east to china or west to persia  alexis sat and looked with some wonder at his companion by the saints godfrey bullen i begin to understand now how it is that your people living in a bit of an island which could be pinched out of russia and never missed are colonizing half the world how they go in ships to explore the polar seas have penetrated africa in all directions as travellers go among the wildest people as missionaries we are brought up to have everything done for us to think as we are told to think to have officials keep their eyes over us at every turn to be punished if we dare to think independently till we have come to be a nation of grownup children you are only a boy if you will forgive my calling you so and yet you talk about facing the most horrible dangers as coolly as if you were proposing going for a promenade on the nevski we wont talk any more about it now for you have made me feel quite restless there you have been here two hours and i have forgotten all my duties as host and have not even offered you a cup of tea it is shameful and alexis brought out a samovar and soon had water boiling and tea made  after they had drunk it they went out of the hut and godfrey was introduced to the other exiles two of them who lived together were quite old men they had been professors at the university of kieff and were exiled for having in their lectures taught what were considered pernicious doctrines there were three military and two naval officers a noble another doctor and two sons of merchants all received him cordially and godfrey saw that in any other place the society would be a pleasant one but there was an air of settled melancholy in the majority of the faces while the sentry fifty yards away and the high prison wall behind seemed ever in their minds  by common consent as it seemed no allusion was ever made to politics they had all strong opinions and had sacrificed everything for them but of what use to discuss matters the course of which they were powerless to influence in the smallest degree free there was probably not one of them but would again have striven in one way or another to bring about reforms either by instructing the ignorant rousing the intelligent or frightening the powerful but here with no hope of returning the whole thing was best forgotten the past was dead to them and they were without a future the news that godfrey brought of the blow that had been struck against the czar roused them for a few days the war then was still being carried on others were wielding the weapons they had forged but of what had happened afterwards godfrey was ignorant four men had been arrested or killed but whether they had played an important part in the matter he knew not nor whether others had shared their fate all he could say was that so far as he heard numerous arrests had taken place  but the excitement caused by the news very speedily died away and they again became listless and indifferent all worked for a little time in their gardens but beyond that only those who had made some sort of occupation for themselves had anything to interest themselves actively in sometimes they played chess draughts or cards but they did so as godfrey observed in a halfhearted manner with the exception indeed of one of the professors who was by far the strongest chessplayer of the party and who passed all his time in inventing problems which when complete he carefully noted down in a book with their solutions  when i am dead he said one day to godfrey who was watching him they will send this book to a nephew of mine you see i have written his name and address outside he is a great chessplayer and will send it to england or france to be published and it is pleasant for me to think that my work even here in prison may serve as an amusement to people out in the world  except in the dulness and monotony of the life there was little to complain of and godfrey was surprised to find how far it differed from his own preconceived notions of the life of a political prisoner in siberia it was only when by an effort he looked ahead for years and tried to fancy the possibility of being so cut off from the world for life that he could appreciate the terrible nature of the punishment better a thousand times to be one of the murderers in the prison behind the wall they had work to occupy their time and constantly changing associates with the knowledge that by good conduct they would sooner or later be released and be allowed to live outside the prison  when at eight oclock in the evening the prisoners were locked up in their huts he endeavoured to learn everything that alexis stumpoff knew of siberia  he found that his knowledge was much more extensive than he had expected as i came out nominally godfrey as a free man i brought with me every book i could buy on the country and i almost got them by heart it seemed to me that i was likely to be kept here for years if not for life i might be sent from one government prison to another from tobolsk to the eastern sea therefore every place possessed an interest for me besides this although i was not actually a political prisoner myself i was virtually so and my sympathies were wholly with the prisoners and i thought that i might possibly be able to advise and counsel men who came under my charge to describe to them the places where they might have relations or friends shut up and to dissuade those who like yourself meditated escape for my studies had not gone far before i became convinced that this was wellnigh hopeless i learned how strict were the regulations on the frontier how impossible even if this were reached to journey on without being arrested at the very first village that a fugitive entered and that so strict were they that although numbers of the convict establishments were within comparatively short distances of the frontier escapes were no more frequent from them than from those three thousand miles to the east when i say escapes i mean escapes from siberia escapes from the prisons are of constant occurrence since most of the work is done outside the walls there are thousands i might almost say tens of thousands get away every spring but they all have to come back again in winter the authorities trouble themselves little about them for they know that they must give themselves up in a few months  yes my guard told me about that he said they were not punished much when they came in  sometimes they are flogged but the russian peasant is accustomed to flogging and thinks but little of it more often they are not flogged they have perhaps a heavier chain for the convicts all wear chainswe have an advantage over them thereand they are put on poorer diet for a time they lose the remission of sentence they would obtain by good behaviour that is all even when they are recognized but as a rule they take care not to give themselves up at the prison they left but at one many hundred miles from it in the course of the summer their hair has grown again they assert stoutly that they are free labourers who have lost their papers and who cannot earn their living through the winter the authorities know of course that they are escaped convicts but they have no means of identifying them they cannot send them the rounds of a hundred convict establishments so instead of a man being entered as alexis stumpoff murderer for instance he is put down by the name he gives and the word vagabond is added the next year they may break out again but in time the hardships they suffer in the woods become distasteful and they settle down to their prison life and then after perhaps six perhaps ten years of good conduct they are released and allowed to settle where they will so you see godfrey bullen how hopeless is the chance of escape  not at all godfrey said these men are most of them peasantsmen without education and without enterprise incapable of forming any plan and wholly without resources in themselves i feel as certain of escaping as i am of being here at present i dont say that i shall succeed the first time but as you say yourself there is no difficulty in getting away and if i fail in one direction i will try in another     chapter vi  an escape   the evenings were spent principally in conversations about siberia godfrey being eager to learn everything that he could about its geography and peoples  alexis told him all he knew as to the mountains and rivers the various native tribes the districts where the villages were comparatively numerous and the mighty forests that stretching away to the arctic sea could hardly be said to be explored books and paper were forbidden to the political prisoners and so strict were the regulations that the warders would not under any considerations bring them in but godfrey wrote all the particulars that he judged might in any way be useful with a burnt piece of stick upon the table as alexis gave them and then learned them by heart washing them off after he had done so  but few of the details alexis could give him would be of any use in the attempt he first intended to make the southern frontier was so temptingly close that it seemed absurd to turn from that and to attempt a tremendous journey north involving the certainty of having to struggle through an arctic winter and to face the difficulties of the passage west either by land or sea beyond the fact that from irkutsk he would have to make for the southern point of lake baikal some sixty miles away and then strike about southeast for another two hundred through a country inhabited almost entirely by buriats the doctor could tell him little  kiakhta he said or rather as far as the russians are concerned troitzkosavsk which is a sort of suburb of kiakhta is the frontier town kiakhta is a sort of neutral town inhabited only by merchants and by a treaty between russia and china no officer or stranger is allowed to sleep there across the frontier a few miles away is the chinese or i suppose i should say the mongol town of maimatchin beyond the fact that the people about there are mongols rather than chinese and that such religion as they have is that of thibet rather than china for their priests are called lamas i know nothing except that the caravan route from kiakhta to pekin is somewhere about a thousand miles and that the camels do it in about thirtyfive days  then they make about thirty miles a day godfrey said i suppose there must be wells at their haltingplaces  ah that is another matter godfrey you see a camel can go three days without water easily enough and of course they would carry skins of water for the travellers  oh that is no odds godfrey said one could walk the ninety miles easily enough in three days and there would be no difficulty in carrying water enough for that time besides one would of course join a caravan if one could luckily enough i had two hundred roubles in notes when i was captured and they restored them as well as my watch and other things when i started i suppose the mongols are just as fond of money as other people the chinese are certainly and i might get some chinese teamerchant to let me go in his train for a consideration  the russian laughed pon my word godfrey i begin to think you will do it  there cant be anything impossible in doing it godfrey said why did not burton disguise himself and go with a caravan to mecca and visit the holy places and that was twenty times as difficult and dangerous going along the caravan route of course the difficulty is the language and the buriats if one could talk mongol or whatever the fellows call their language it would be easy sailing but i own that it is a difficult thing to get along and explain what you want with people who cannot understand a word you say i suppose the buriats speak russian  i should say that a great many of them do godfrey i know there are missionaries and schools among them and some of them live in settled villages though they are so wedded to their own wandering life that they build their houses on the exact model of their tents with a hole in the roof to let the smoke out still as they deal with the towns and come in to sell their cattle and sheep and herds and so on no doubt the greater part of them at any rate on this side of the frontier speak a certain amount of russian the difficulty will be to persuade them not to give you up  but i can pay them more not to give me up than they can get for doing so godfrey said  they would kill you for what you have godfrey they are permitted to kill runaways in fact encouraged to do so and the reward is the same whether they are brought in dead or alive  i should think alexis it is easier to bring in a live man than a dead one  i dont know the russian laughed i dont think a buriat would find it very easy to take you any distance alive but there would be no trouble in chucking you into a cart and bringing you here after the preliminary operation of knocking you on the head  godfrey smiled you forget there would be some preliminary trouble in knocking me on the head alexis but seriously i dont think any natives who have been in contact at all with civilization are disposed to take life without some strong motive of course robbery would be a motive but i should certainly have nothing about me that a tartar or a buriati suppose they are all something of the same thingwould covet you were telling me yourself that many of these people have very large flocks and herds is it likely such people as these would cut a strangers throat on the chance of finding a few roubles in his pocket  well one would think not godfrey but of course they are not all rich  no they may not be rich but you say they are always nomads well people who are nomads must always have some sort of animals to carry their tents and a certain amount anyhow of cattle horses or sheep no i dont at all believe in cutting throats without a motive  but let us understand a little more about your intentions godfrey do you mean to climb over that fence and then to stroll away to the south with your hands in your pockets and your hat on one side of your head and to ask the first man you come upon to direct you to the shortest road to pekin  godfrey laughed no not quite that alexis these clothes did very well in st petersburg and though they are all the worse for the journey here i daresay they would pass well enough in the streets of irkutsk the first thing to do will be to get some clothes for as far as i could see coming along the natives all dress a good deal like the russians i suppose in winter they wrap up more in furs or they may wear their furs differently but any sort of peasant dress would do as it would not excite attention while this tweed suit would be singular even in the streets here  that furlined greatcoat would be all right godfrey  yes i bought that at st petersburg i dont know that it would go very well with a peasants dress and it is certainly not suitable for the time of year though i shall take it with me if i can if i could roll it up and carry it as a knapsack it would be first rate for sleeping in besides it might do as something to exchange when one gets to places where money is of little use if i can get hold of a pistol anyhow i shall be glad a pistol will always produce civility if one meets only one or two men the other things i should want are a box of matches for making fires a good knife or better still a small axe for chopping wood and a bottle or skin for holding water  you will be seized and sent back in a week godfrey  very well then there will be no harm done i regard this as a sort of preliminary investigation i shall ascertain the difficulties of travel in siberia and shall learn lessons for next time i believe myself the true way is to strike one of the great rivers to build or steal a boat to go down in it to the arctic sea and then to coast along until one gets to norway but that is a big affair and besides it is a great deal too late in the year for it when i attempt that i shall make off as early in the spring as possible  remember you may be flogged when you are caught godfrey  well i shouldnt like to be flogged but as you say the convicts dont think much of it i suppose i could bear it they used to flog in our army and navy till quite lately  it is a dishonour alexis exclaimed passionately  godfrey shrugged his shoulders  the dishonour lies in the crime and not in the punishment he said at our great public schools in england fellows are flogged well there is no disgrace in it if its only for breaking the rules or anything of that sort but it would be a horrible dishonour if it were for thieving all that sort of thing is absurd i believe flogging is the best punishment there is it is a lot better to give a man a couple of dozen and send him about his business than it is to keep him for a year in prison at the public expense and to have to maintain his wife and children also at the public expense while he is there besides i thought you said the other day that they did not flog political prisoners  well they dont at least not at any of the large prisons but in some of the small establishments with perhaps a brutal drunken captain or major as governor no doubt it may be done sometimes  well i will take my chance of it  and when do you think of starting alexis asked after a pause  directly i have only to decide how i am to get out after the door is locked and to make a rope of some sort to climb the fence with the blankets tied together will do for that as to the getting out there is no difficulty one only has to throw a blanket over that cross beam get up on that and get off one of the lining boards displace a few tiles crawl through  i have half a mind to go with you godfrey  have you alexis i should be awfully glad but at the same time i would not say a word to persuade you to do it you know i make light of it but i know very well that there will be some danger and a tremendous lot of hardship to be gone through  i dont think i am afraid of that godfrey alexis said seriously it is not that i have been thinking of ever since you began to talk to me of getting away i consider it is a hundred to one against success but as you say if we fail and get brought back no great harm is done if we get killed or die of hunger and thirst again no harm is done for certainly life is not a thing to cling to when one is a prisoner in siberia but it is not that you see i am differently situated to you if you do succeed in getting away you go home and you are all right if i succeed in getting away what is to become of me i speak russian and german but there would be no return for me to russia unless some day when a new czar ascends the throne or on some such occasion when a general amnesty is granted but even that would hardly extend to political prisoners what am i to do so far as i can see i might starve and after all one might almost as well remain here as starve in pekin or in some chinese port granted that i could work my way back to europe on board ship what should i do if i landed at marseilles or liverpool i could not go through the streets shouting in german i am a doctor who wants to be cured  no alexis godfrey agreed you could not well do that but i will tell you what you could do of course at the first place i get to where there is a telegraph to england i will send a message to my father to cable to some firm there to let me have what money i require very well then of course you would go home with me to england and there is one thing i could promise you and that is a post in my fathers office you know we trade with russia and though our correspondence is generally carried on in german i am quite sure that my father would after you had been my companion on such a journey as that we propose make a berth for you in the office to undertake correspondence in russian and german and that he would pay a salary quite sufficient for you to live in comfort or if you would rather i am sure that he would find you means for going out and settling say in the united states in the part where german is the general language  then in that case godfrey the russian said shaking his hand warmly i am your man i think i should have gone with you anyhow but what you have said quite decides me now then what is our first proceeding  godfrey laughed  i should say to take an inventory of our belongings alexis or rather of your belongings for mine are very briefly described two hundred roubles in notes a watch a pocketknife the suit of clothes i stand up in half a dozen pairs of socks and three flannel shirts i bought on the way one greatcoat lined with fur i think that is about all it is a very small share yours are much more numerous  more numerous but not much more useful alexis said they let me bring one large portmanteau of clothes but as i cant carry that away on my shoulders it is of very little use all i can take in that way is a suit of clothes and a spare flannel shirt or two and some socks i have got two cases of surgical instruments i will take a few of the most useful and some other things a pair of forceps for instance we may come across a tartar with a raging tooth and make him our friend for ever by extracting it and i will put a bandage or two and some plaster in my pocket they are things one ought always to carry for one is always liable to get a hurt or a sprain as to money i have a hundred and twenty roubles they are all in silver i changed my paper at tobolsk thinking that silver would be more handy here unfortunately they took away my pistol but a couple of amputating knives will make good weapons i have got a leather waistcoat which i will cut up and make from it a couple of sheaths of course i have got fur cloaks one of them a very handsome one i will take that and another there ought to be no difficulty whatever in getting some one to give us two peasants dresses in exchange for that coat for all these people know something of the value of furs  yes and if you can get a gun and some ammunition thrown into the bargain alexis it will be most useful for we may have to depend upon what we shoot sometimes  yes that would be a great addition godfrey well we will set about making the sheaths at once i have got a store of needles and stout thread  they will be useful to take with us godfrey said not only for mending our clothes if we want it but for exchange women have to sew all over the world and even the most savage people can appreciate the advantage of a good needle  that is so godfrey i have got a packet of capital surgical needles and some silk i will put them in with the others they wont take up much room well shall we start tomorrow night  i think we had better wait for two or three days godfrey said we must save up some of our food  yes we shall want some bread alexis agreed we cant well get that in through the warders it would look suspicious but i will get in some meat through them we have got some of the last lot left so we can do with very little bread  for the next two days they found plenty to occupy them while their stock of bread was accumulating one of the russians coats was cut up and made into two bags like haversacks with a band to pass over the shoulder for carrying their belongings straps were make of the cloth for fastening the greatcoats knapsack fashion they agreed that however long they might have to wait they must choose a stormy night for their flight as otherwise they could hardly break through the roof and scale the fence without being heard by the sentries who kept watch night and day they were eager to be off for it was already the end of july and the winter would be severe in the country over which they had to travel on the fourth day a heavy rain set in and in the evening it began to blow hard  now is our time godfrey said nothing could have been better  they had already loosened two of the lining boards of the roof and as soon as they had been locked up for the night they removed these altogether they packed their haversacks with the articles they had agreed to take with six pounds of bread each and some meat rolled four blankets up and knotted them tightly together strapped up the three furlined cloaks and placed the knives in their belts then without much difficulty they prised up one of the thick planks with which the hut was roofed godfrey got through the opening and alexis passed out to him the haversacks and coats and then joined him and they slid down the roof and dropped to the ground  the paling was but twenty yards behind the huts as soon as they reached it godfrey climbed upon his companions shoulders threw the loop of a doubled rope over one of the palisades and climbed on to the top then with the rope he pulled up the coats and haversacks and dropped them outside alexis pulled himself up by the rope this was then dropped on the outside and he slid down by it godfrey shifted the rope on to the point of one of the palings so that it could be easily shaken off from below and then slipped down it the rope shaken off and two of the blankets opened the haversacks hung over their shoulders and the greatcoats strapped on each put one of the twisted blankets over his shoulder scarf fashion wrapped the other round as a cloak and then set out on their way fortunately the prison lay on the south side of the town and at a distance of half a mile from it and as their course to the extremity of lake baikal lay almost due south they were able to strike right across the country  the wind was from the north and they had therefore only to keep their backs to it to follow the right direction it was halfpast ten when they started for the nights were short and had it not been that the sky was covered with clouds and the air thick with rain it would not have been dark enough for them to make the attempt until an hour later by three oclock it was light again but they knew there was little chance of their escape being discovered until the warders came to unlock the hut at six in the morning as the planks they had removed from the roof were at the back of the hut and therefore invisible to the sentries  no doubt they will send a few mounted cossacks out to search for us as we are political prisoners alexis said but we may calculate it will be seven oclock before they set out and as this is the very last direction they will imagine we have taken we need not trouble ourselves about them besides we shall soon be getting into wooded country i believe it is all wood round the lower end of the lake and we shall be quite out of the way of traffic for everything going east from irkutsk is taken across the lake by steamer  after twelve hours walking with only one halt of half an hour for refreshment they reached the edge of the forest and after again making a hearty meal of their bread and cold meat and taking each a sip from a bottle containing cold tea they lay down and slept until late in the afternoon  well we have accomplished so much satisfactorily alexis said now we have to keep on to kaltuk at the extreme southwestern point of the lake it is a very small place i believe and that is where we must get what we want we shall be there by the evening we shall be just right as it wouldnt do for us to go in until it is pretty nearly dark a place of that sort is sure to have a store where they sell clothes and other things and trade with the people round  they struck the lake a mile or two from its extremity and following it until they could see the roofs of the houses lay down for an hour until it should be dark enough to enter  we had better put on our fur coats alexis said the people all wear long coats of some fashion or other and in the dusk we shall pass well enough  it was a village containing some fifty or sixty houses for the most part the tentlike structures of the buriats they met no one in the street and kept on until they saw a light in a window of a house larger than any others and looking in saw that it was the place for which they were in search opening the door they went in and closed it behind them a man came out from the room behind the shop he stopped for a moment at seeing two strangers then advanced with a suspicious look on his face  do you want a bargain alexis asked him abruptly  i have little money to buy with he said sullenly  that matters little for we will take it out in goods  the man hesitated alexis drew out the long keen amputating knife look here he said we are not to be fooled with you may guess what we are or not it is nothing to us and nothing to you we want some of your goods and are ready to give you good exchange for them we are not robbers here is this coat look at it it is almost unworn i have used it only one winter you can see it is lined with real sable and it cost me three hundred roubles at any rate it is worth a hundred to you even if you take out the lining sell the skins separately and burn the coat examine it for yourself  the shopkeeper did so they are good skins he said and alexis could see that he quite appreciated their value  now alexis said i want two peasant dresses complete coat trousers high boots and caps what do you charge for them  twenty roubles each suit  very well pick two suits the right size for us and lay them down on the counter now we want two pounds of bricktea and two pounds of tobacco we want two skins that will each hold a gallon or a gallon and a half of water and a tin pot that will hold a quart and two tin drinking mugs we want a gun and ammunition it need not be a new one i see you have got half a dozen standing over there in the corner what do you charge your customers for those i see they are all old single barrels and flintlocks  i charge fifteen roubles a piece  well we will take two of them and we want two pounds of powder and six pounds of shot and a couple of dozen bullets now add that up and see how much it comes to  ninetytwo roubles the man said  well i tell you what i will give you this cloak and twelve paper roubles for them i dont suppose the goods cost you fifty at the outside and you will get at least a hundred for the skins alone  i will take it the man said i take it because i cannot help it  you take it because you are making an excellent bargain alexis said fiercely now mind if you give the alarm when we have gone it will be worse for you they wont catch us but you will see your house on fire over your head before the week is past  godfrey placed a tenrouble note and two onerouble notes on the table they gathered up their goods and made them into a bundle carefully loaded their guns and put the powder and shot into their haversacks then alexis lifted the bundle and shouldering the guns they left the shop  will he give the alarm do you think godfrey asked  not he he is thoroughly well satisfied i daresay he will get a hundred and fifty roubles for the coat besides he knows that escaped convicts are desperate men and that we should be likely to execute my threat besides i dont suppose he would venture to stir out for aught he knows we may be waiting just outside the shop to see what he does and he will fear that he might get that hungrylooking knife into him if he came out to raise the alarm  all was quiet and they were soon beyond the limits of the village and struck out for the country  they held on for two or three miles filled their waterskins at a little stream running towards the lake and then entering a wood pushed on for some little distance lighted a fire and made themselves some tea  we are fairly off now godfrey we have become what they call wanderers and should be safe enough among the russian peasants most of whom have been convicts in their time in the villages north for they are always willing enough to help men who have taken to the woods well except in the villages of which there are few enough about here we are not likely to come upon them from here to the frontier are buriats and indeed beyond the frontier however as we have both got guns we need not be afraid of any small party of course some of them have guns too but i dont suppose they will be fools enough to risk throwing their lives away for nothing at any rate there is one comfort there is nothing to show that we are political prisoners now we might be honest peasants if it were not for these confounded heads of hair  i should think godfrey said we had better get rid of our hair altogether it will be some time before it grows but anything will be better than it is now  we have got no scissors godfrey and we have no soap if we had those knives of ours are sharp enough to shave with  we can singe it off godfrey said not now but in the morning when we can see i will do it for you and you can do it for me i would rather be baldheaded altogether than be such a figure as i am now  accordingly in the morning they singed off their hair with redhot brands then they changed their clothes for those they had obtained the night before folded up their greatcoats divided the tea tobacco and the greater part of the powder and shot between them put a portion in their haversacks and rolled the rest up in the coats then strapped these to their shoulders and started on their way  now i feel ready for anything alexis said as they tramped along we have no weight to speak of to carry and we have means of getting a meal occasionally now if we keep a little west of south we shall strike the selenga river which runs through maimatchin and then we shall be in china we shall have to avoid the town because i know there is a treaty between russia and china about sending back exiles who cross the frontier still when we get there we are at the startingplace of the caravans  is it a desert the whole distance  no the first part is a mountainous country with two or three rivers to cross i dont think the real desert is more than eight or ten days march across we shall certainly have no difficulty about water for some time to come there are plenty of squirrels in these woods at least i expect so for they abound in all the forests we must knock some of them over if we can i believe they are not bad eating though i never tried one then by the streams we ought to be able to pick up some wild duck though of course at this time of year the greater portion of them are far north still i have great hopes we shall be able to keep ourselves in food with the assistance of what we may be able to buy occasionally i think the only thing we have got to fear at this part of our journey is the buriats the thing i am really afraid of is the getting into china i dont mean the frontier here this is mongolia and it is only nominally chinese but when we get across the desert and enter china itself i tell you frankly i dont see our way we neither of us can speak a word of the language we have no papers and we may be arrested and shut up as suspicious vagabonds there is one thing at kalgan which is close to the great wall there are russian traders and i should go boldly to them and ask their help russians out of russia are sure to be liberal though they may not dare to be so when they are at home and i feel sure they would help us when we tell them our story if we can only get at them however we need not trouble ourselves much about that at present  once beyond the forest they were in an undulating country the hills sometimes rising to a considerable height occasionally they saw in the distance encampments of natives with sheep cattle and horses in considerable numbers they kept clear of these although occasionally they had to make wide detours to do so time was no object to them and they made but short journeys for the russian who had never been accustomed to walk long distances had blistered both his feet badly on the first nights journey and the subsequent travelling had added to the inflammation on the fourth evening they halted for the night on a little rivulet after making only five or six miles  it is no use alexis godfrey said we must stop here until your feet are quite well we shall gain by it rather than lose for when you are quite right again we could do our fiveandtwenty or thirty miles a day easily and might do forty at a push but your feet will never get well if you go on walking and it makes your journey a perfect penance so i vote we establish ourselves here for three or four days there is water and wood and i dare say i shall be able to shoot somethingat any rate you cant go on as you are now  it is horribly annoying alexis said to be knocked up like this just at the start  but it makes no difference godfrey urged we are not due at pekin on any given day it is very pleasant out here where one can enjoy ones freedom and exult that there is no policeman or cossack watching every movement it would make no difference to me if we stopped here for a month now let me pull those boots off for you then you can sit with your feet in this little pool  warm water would be better godfrey if you will get the kettle to boil i will dip my two flannel shirts in and wrap them round and keep on at that that will be better than cold water  all right i will soon get a fire alight by jove they are bad he exclaimed as alexis pulled off his stocking they must have been hurting you desperately why did you not say how bad they were two days ago we might as well have stopped then as now  i hoped they would have got better when i put on these big boots instead of those i started with but i did not think they were as bad as they are i am afraid this is going to be a troublesome business godfrey  well it cant be helped godfrey said cheerfully at any rate dont worry on my account  the russians feet were indeed greatly swollen and inflamed the skin had been rubbed off in several places and the wounds had an angry look their edges being a fiery red which extended for some distance round them  well you have plenty of pluck alexis or you never could have gone on walking with such feet as those i am sure i could not have done so  we thought over most difficulties godfrey that we might possibly have to encounter but not of this  no we did not think of it though we might really have calculated upon it after being three or four months without walking twenty yards it is only natural ones feet should go at first we ought to have brought some soap with usi do not mean for washing though we ought to have brought it for thatbut for soaping the inside of our stockings that is a firstrate dodge to prevent feet from blistering well i must see about the fire i will go up to those trees on the hillside i daresay i shall be able to find some sticks there for lighting it these bushes round here will do well enough when it is once fairly burning but we shall have a great trouble to get them to light to begin with    illustration a supper of roasted squirrels  in half an hour he was back with a large faggot  it is lucky he said there is a fallen tree so we shall have no difficulty about firewood we ought to have brought a hatchet when we got the other things these knives are firstrate for cutting meat and that sort of thing but they are of no use for rough work my old knife is better  while he was talking he was engaged in cutting some shavings off the sticks then he split up another into somewhat larger pieces and laying them over the shavings struck a match and applied it the flame shot up brightly and in five minutes there was an excellent fire on which the kettle was placed  we had better have our dinner first godfrey then i can go on steadily with these fomentations while you take your gun and look round  perhaps that will be the best way godfrey said we have nothing left but six squirrels we finished the last piece of bread this morning and the meat last night how had we better do these squirrels  i will skin them godfrey while you are seeing to the fire then we will spit them on a ramrod and i will hold them in the flame  i think we can manage better than that godfrey said and he went to the bushes and cut two sticks of a foot long with a fork at one end he stuck these in the ground on the opposite sides of the fire there he said you can lay the ramrod on these forks and all you have got to do is to give it a turn occasionally  how long do you suppose these things want cooking  not above five minutes i should think i know that a steak only takes about eight minutes before a good fire and these little beggars are not half the thickness of a steak they are beginning to frizzle already and the water is just on the boil  the squirrels were pronounced very good eating when the meal was over godfrey filled the kettle again and gave it to alexis and then taking his gun started down the valley he was away three hours and brought back twenty birds of various sorts but for the most part small  no very great sport he said as he emptied his haversack however they will do for breakfast and i may have better luck tomorrow there are some fish in the pools but i do not see how we are to get them i saw one spring out of the water it must have weighed a couple of pounds  you might shoot them godfrey if you could find a place where the bank is pretty high so as to look down on the water  so i could i did not think of that i must try tomorrow  if it hadnt been for my feet alexis said we should have been down on the selenga tomorrow and we had calculated on being able to buy food at one of the villages there  we shall be able to hold on here godfrey said for a few days and i expect that one days good tramp when your feet are better will take us there after that we ought to have no great difficulty till we get down near the desert     chapter vii  the buriats child   after three days rest the russians feet were so much better that he said he should be able to make a start the next morning godfrey however would not listen to the proposal  we are getting on all right he said i am not much of a shot but at any rate i am able to bag enough birds to keep us going and though i have only succeeded in shooting one fish as yet it was a good big one and was a real help to us it is no use going on till your feet get really hard for you would only be laming yourself again it will be quite time enough to talk about making a start in three days time  the next morning godfrey was roughly awakened by a violent kick starting up he saw a group of six buriats standing round them three of them had guns which were pointed at the prisoners the others were armed with spears resistance was evidently useless their guns had been removed to a distance and the knives taken from their belts before they were roused godfrey held out his hands to show that he surrendered and addressed the usual russian salutation to them the men were short squarebuilt figures with large skulls low foreheads flat noses and long eyes like those of the chinese their cheekbones were high and wide apart the complexion a yellowbrown and the hair jet black and worn in a platted tail down the back they made signs to their prisoners to accompany them alexis pulled on his boots two of the men with guns stood guard over them while the others examined the stores and were evidently highly pleased with the two brightly polished knives  rather an abrupt termination to our journey godfrey  painfully so i was almost afraid everything was going on too well with us alexis it began to look so easy that one could not understand why there should not be hundreds of prisoners every year make their way across  i should not have minded so much alexis said if we had not got such a satisfactory kit together we had everything we really wanted for a journey across asia  except food and water alexis  well yes those are important items certainly and if we had difficulty about it here in a decent sort of country what might be expected on farther well we have had our outing i only hope they wont give us up at irkutsk i suppose it depends where their grazinggrounds are there are another two months of summer i wish we could have had our fling till then  half a mile along the valley they came upon a tent evidently belonging to the men who had taken them they talked a good deal among themselves as they approached it but went straight on without making a stop  i expect they are taking us down to some chief or other if they call them chiefs alexis said i expect they came out to hunt for horses or cattle that have strayed  seven or eight miles farther the valley opened on to a plain and a short distance in front of them on the stream stood ten tents one of which was considerably larger than the others great flocks of sheep grazed on the plain and at a distance they could see numbers of cattle while some horses with their saddles on were hobbled near the tents  i think we are lucky godfrey the owner of all this must be a rich man and can hardly covet the roubles he would get for giving us up besides he is sure to talk russian  as they came up to the huts they saw that their occupants were all gathered talking excitedly in front of a large tent one of the men ran on and then returned the news he gave was evidently bad he talked excitedly pointing to his own leg about halfway between the knee and the ankle the men broke into exclamations of regret  i wonder what is the matter alexis something has happened i should think that someone must have met with an accident  without wishing ill to anyone godfrey i sincerely wish it may be so then i might be able to win their goodwill  little attention was paid to the party when they joined the group all were too busy in discussing some event or other three or four minutes later a man came to the door of the tent and waved his hand and gave some order his dress was a handsome one the little crowd fell back but one of the men who had brought the captives in went up and spoke to him he again waved his hand impatiently and was turning to enter the tent when alexis cried loudly i am a doctor if anyone has been hurt i may be of service to him  the man stepped hastily forward do you say you are a doctor  i am  come in then he said abruptly and entered the tent  i will call you if you can be of any use alexis said to godfrey as he followed him  the tent was a large one some handsome koord carpets covered the ground facing the door was another opening leading into a small tent serving as the womens apartment  there were several piles of sheepskins round the tent and by one of these three women were standing two of these were richly dressed in gowns of handsome striped materials they wore headdresses of silver work with beads of malachite and motherofpearl and had heavy silver ornaments hanging on their breasts their hair fell down their backs in two thick braids the other woman was evidently of inferior rank all were leaning over a pile of skins covered with costly furs on which a boy of seven or eight years old was lying his father for such the man evidently was said something in his own language and the women turned eagerly to alexis  you are a russian doctor one of the women exclaimed joyfully  i am lady he said i graduated at st petersburg  can you do anything for my son she asked half an hour ago he went up incautiously behind a young horse that had been driven in from the herd only yesterday and it kicked him see it is terrible and she burst into tears  alexis went forward and lifted a wet cloth that had been placed on the leg a slight exclamation broke from his lips as he did so the bone was evidently completely smashed and one of the splintered ends projected through the skin  he must die the mother sobbed nothing can save him  the father did not speak but looked inquiringly at alexis the latter made a sign to him to move to the other side of the tent  well the buriat asked must he die  there is no reason for his dying alexis said but there is no possibility of saving his leg it must be amputated  what would be the use of living without a leg the buriat exclaimed  a great deal of use alexis said quietly there are hundreds aye thousands of men in russia who have lost a leg some from an accident like this or from a waggon going over them some from a wound in battle in some cases the leg is taken off much above the knee but even then they are able to get about and enjoy their lives but when it is below the knee like this they are able to do everything just the same as if they had both feet they can walk and ride and in fact do everything like others besides for such men there are people at st petersburg who make feet of cork and when these are on with a boot and trousers or with a high boot no one could tell that the wearer had not two feet i have met men who had lost a leg and they walked so well that i did not know till i was told that they had not two legs  i will speak to his mother the buriat said and returning to the women he spoke to them in their own language at first they appeared shocked and even terrified at the idea but as he went on evidently repeating what alexis had told him the expression of their faces changed the buriat called alexis across  you cannot hesitate lady he said when your childs life is at stake no russian mother would do so for a moment it may seem to you dreadful that he should have but one foot but in a little time even with so rough a limb as i could make for him he would be running about and playing again and as i have been telling his father he can obtain from st petersburg a foot so perfect that when wearing a high boot no one would suspect the misfortune that has happened to him  can he not be cured without that  no lady if it had been a simple fracture his leg might be bandaged up so that it would heal in time but as you can see for yourself the bone is all splintered and broken and unless something is done mortification will set in and in a few days he will cease to live  but are you sure that he will live if you do it  i am sure lady that the operation will not kill him i believe that he will live but that is in the hands of god you see him now the shock has prostrated him he has but little life in him and if he dies he will die from that and not from the taking off of his foot but i do not think he will die he is young and hardy and on my faith as a russian gentleman i believe that he will live  it shall be tried the buriat said abruptly god has doubtless sent you here at this moment why otherwise should a doctor be brought to my door when this has happened do as you will  alexis felt the boys pulse i must wait he said until he has recovered somewhat from the shock give him some warm milk with a spoonful not more of vodka in it your men have taken the knives that i and my friend carried they were specially made for this and we shall need them do not fear as to the operation it is the most simple in surgery let him have the milk at once let him remain quiet upon his back and do not let him attempt to move his leg do not tell him about this it would frighten and agitate him if i had medicines that we use in our hospitals i could send him to sleep so that he would know nothing about it and when he woke up would be ignorant that his foot had been removed but as there is none of it within a hundred miles of us we must manage it as we best can please tell your men to release my friend i shall need his assistance  after bidding the woman heat some milk at once the buriat went out and ordered godfreys guards to release him at once and to restore to them their knives and all their other possessions alexis informed godfrey of what had taken place and what he proposed to do  the operation would be a very easy one if we had chloroform and proper implements unfortunately there is no chance of their having such a thing as a fine saw and how in the world i am to make a clean cut through the bone i do not know the knife that you carry is just the right thing for the job but how about a saw if we could have chloroformed him we could after making the cuts through the flesh have put the leg on a log of wood and have cut clean through the bone with a chopper it would not be a good plan for it would probably splinter the bone but it might have been tried but without chloroform it is not to be thought of  godfrey thought for a moment the knives are of a very good steel alexis  oh yes of the very best steel  is it hard steel like that of a razor  yes very much the same  then i should think it could be managed i know the least thing will notch a razor now i should think if we took the large knife and with my pocketknife or with the edge of a hard stone notch the edge carefully all the way down it would make a very good saw  i should think it might do anyhow godfrey and the idea is a very good one well let us set about it at once i can get a piece of fresh bone to try on no doubt they kill a sheep here every day  they set to work and in ten minutes had notched the blade of the knife all the way down alexis had as he expected no trouble in obtaining a freshlypicked bone and they found that the knife sawed through it very cleanly then alexis went in to see the boy again before he had been lying with his eyes halfclosed without a vestige of colour in his cheeks the warm milk had done its work almost instantaneously and he was perfectly conscious and there was a slight colour in his cheeks his pulse had recovered strength wonderfully alexis nodded approvingly to the buriat he drew him outside the tent  if i were you he said i would send away all the people from the other huts if the poor child screams they may get excited and rush in and it is better that everything should be perfectly quiet i should send away also the ladies unless of course his mother particularly wishes to be with him but it will be trying for her and i own that i would rather not have anyone in the tent but you and my friend  the buriat went inside he returned in two or three minutes my wife will stay my sister and the attendant will go then he called to the men who were standing at the doors of their huts  the doctor says there must be silence for some time he is going to do something and he wishes that all shall retire to a distance until i wave my hand for them to return will there be anything you want he asked alexis  a large jug of warm water he said a bowl and some soft ragthat is all by the time that is ready i shall be you will have to hold his leg godfrey he went on as the buriat returned to his tent you must hold it just under the knee as firmly as possible so as to prevent the slightest movement but i am going to try to mesmerize him i have seen it done with perfect success and at any rate it is worth trying in the weak state he is in i ought to be able to succeed without difficulty now i want a couple of small flat stones with rounded edges a strip of soft skin and a bit of stick three or four inches long and as thick as your finger to make a tourniquet with  by the time that these were ready a perfect stillness reigned in the camp the whole of the natives had gone away to a distance of over a quarter of a mile and were sitting in a group watching the tents and godfrey had no doubt debating hotly as to the folly of allowing a stranger to have anything to do with the son of their employer he now followed alexis into the tent where all was in readiness the childs head was slightly raised by a skin folded and placed under it his mother knelt beside him  what do you wish me to do the buriat asked  i wish you to stand beside him and aid his mother to hold him should he struggle and i may need you to dip the rag into the warm water squeeze it out and give it me  of course he will struggle the buriat said we men can bear pain but a child cannot  i am going to try to put him to sleep alexis replied a sleep so sound that he will not wake with the pain i do not say that i shall be able to but i will try  the buriat looked at alexis as if he doubted his sanity that a russian doctor should be able to take off the childs leg was within his comprehension he had once seen a man in the street of irkutsk with only one arm but that anyone could make a child sleep so soundly that he would not wake under such an operation seemed to him beyond the bounds of possibility  tell the child that i am going to do him good alexis said to the mother and that he is to look at my eyes steadily he placed himself at the side of the couch and gazed down steadily at the child then he began to make passes slowly down his face for three or four minutes the black eyes looked into his unwinkingly then the lids closed a little alexis continued his efforts the lids drooped more and more until they closed completely he continued the motions of his hand for another minute or two then stooping he lifted an eyelid the eye was turned upwards so that the iris was no longer visible  thank god he has gone off he said now for the tourniquet that is right twist gradually now godfrey and place the stone on the main artery now he said to the buriat hold this stick firm with one hand and place the other on his chest to prevent his moving do you lay your arm across him this to the mother that is right kneel with your face against his now godfrey grasp the leg just below the knee and hold it firmly  godfrey did so and then shut his eyes as he saw the doctor about to use the knife expecting to hear a piercing scream from the child there was no sound however and in a very few seconds he heard alexis utter a low exclamation of satisfaction he looked now the flesh was already cut through and no cry had escaped the child another moment the foot and the lower portion of the leg came away at the point where the bone was crushed then alexis pushed the flesh upwards so as to expose another inch of the shinbone and then took the saw and cut through it some strands of silk lay close to his hand with a long needle he took up the ends of the arteries and tied them with the silk then he took hold of the stick of the tourniquet and loosened it a little the result was satisfactory the arteries were securely tied then he tightened it again and gave it to the buriat to hold wiped the wound with the damp rag drew down the flesh over the end of the bone brought up the flap of flesh from behind and with a few stitches sewed it in its place  it is all done he said rising to his feet then he passed his hand several times across the childs forehead tell him softly when he opens his eyes he said to the mother that he will soon be well now and that he must go to sleep he continued the passes for some time occasionally lifting the eyelid he is coming round now he said at last a few more passes and the child drowsily opened its eyes his mother spoke to him softly and with a faint smile he closed them again alexis stood quietly for another minute or two he is asleep now he said to the buriat you need hold him no longer  the tears were running down the mans cheeks he seized one of the hands of alexis and pressed it to his lips while the mother sobbing with joy did the same to the other to them it seemed almost a miracle  have some milk kept warm alexis said and give it to him when he awakes do not tell him anything about his foot having been taken off keep a blanket lying over him so that he will not see it it is well that he should not be agitated but tell him that he must lie perfectly quiet and not move his leg as it would hurt him if he did so now chief it would be as well if you called the others back and told your servant to get some breakfast for my friend and i have had nothing to eat since your men woke us this morning  the buriat went outside the tent and waved a blanket and the others came running in at the signal  tell them not to make a noise alexis said the longer the child sleeps quietly the better  the buriats uttered exclamations of the most profound astonishment when the chief told them that the russian doctor had taken off the leg of the child without his feeling the slightest pain and that there was every hope of his speedily recovering whereupon they looked at alexis with a feeling of respect amounting to awe a sheep was at once killed skinned cut up and placed in a great cooking pot over a fire but long before this was done two great bowls of hot milk were brought out by the buriat to alexis and godfrey to enable them to hold on until the meal was prepared at his order the men at once set about erecting a tent for them close to his own and as soon as this was up piles of soft skins were brought in  that has been a lucky stroke indeed godfrey alexis said as they took possession of their new abode  it has indeed alexis nothing could have been more providential we are in clover as long as we choose to stop here do you think the child will recover  i think there is every hope of his doing so these natives are as hard as nails i dont suppose the child has ever had a days illness in his life and in this pure dry air there is little fear of the wound doing badly the next thing to do is to make him a pair of crutches to get about with till he can bear to have a wooden stump on the only nuisance is that we shall be delayed as a doctor i cannot very well leave my patient till he is fairly on the road towards recovery  certainly not godfrey agreed well i daresay we shall put away the time pleasantly enough here  half an hour later two horses were brought up and these with their saddles and bridles were presented by the buriat to his guests and were picketed by their tent the next three weeks passed pleasantly they rode hunted and shot the little patient made rapid progress towards recovery and at the end of that time was able to get about on two crutches godfrey had made for him  it is better that you should make them godfrey and also the wooden leg when he is ready for it alexis had said it is just as well that their gratitude should be divided a little so i will hand that part of the work over to you  the buriats were delighted indeed when they saw the child hopping about the camp with his crutches and their gratitude knew no bounds to their guests alexis had made no secret to the buriat of their intention of trying to make their way to pekin he endeavoured in every way to dissuade them from it  you will never find your way across the desert he said and will die for want of water the people are wild and savage they are ruled by their lamas and if they do not put you to death which they would be likely to do for what you have they will certainly send you back to kiakhta and hand you over to the russians there and even if you got through the desert the chinese would seize you and send you back it would be madness to try it would be better than that to go south and make for thibet although even that would be a desperate expedition the tribes are wild and savage the desert is terrible for those who do not know it you would never find the wells and would perish miserably of thirst even if you escaped being killed by the tribesmen still your chances would be greater than they would be of reaching pekin but you had far better make up your minds to live here i will give you flocks and herds you should be as of my family and you alexis should marry my sister who is rich as well as pretty for she owns a third of all the flocks and herds you see  alexis warmly thanked the buriat for the offer but said they must take time to consider it one might do worse he said laughing to godfrey when they were alone the women are certainly a great deal betterlooking than the men and the girl would be considered fairlooking even in russia at any rate it would be vastly better being a buriat here than being inside that prison at irkutsk  i agree with you there alexis but it would be horrible being cut off here from the world for life  but one is cut off in prison godfrey and though i agreed to share your attempt i have never been very hopeful about its success and i am still less hopeful now from what i hear of the difficulties ahead of us as i said when you first talked of it there must be some frightful difficulties here or this would be the way by which convicts would always try to escape and yet we have never heard of one doing so  yes i begin to think myself i have made a mistake alexis in choosing this route instead of a northern one besides we shall have winter upon us in a very few weeks now which would of course add tremendously to our difficulties but you are not seriously thinking of stopping here are you  i dont know godfrey you see you have got a home and friends waiting for you if you do get away i have nothing but exile i do believe we shall never succeed in getting out through china and i think we couldnt do better than stop here for a year or two by the end of that time we may succeed in establishing relations by means of this buriat with some of the tea merchants at kiakhta and getting one of them to smuggle us through with a caravan but at any rate if you still hold to going i shall go too i have no intention of deserting you i can assure you  in another fortnight godfrey had made a stump for the child the hollow was lined with sheepskin to take off the jar and it strapped firmly on to the limb the wound was not quite sufficiently healed yet for the child to use it regularly but when on first trying it he walked across the tent the joy of his father and mother knew no bounds  they had only been waiting for this to make a move for the pasture had for some time been getting short and on the following day the tents were pulled down and for three days they journeyed east and then finding a suitable spot again pitched their tents they were now as the buriat told them only some thirty miles from kiakhta godfrey and alexis had talked matters over during the journey they agreed that the season was now too late for them to think of attempting the journey until the following spring and had almost concluded that the attempt to get through china should be altogether abandoned going north there were the rigour of the climate and the enormous distances as obstacles but the passage would be chiefly by water there was no danger from the tribes they would have to pass through no difficulties such as they might meet with from the opposition of the chinese and they had pretty well resolved to pass the winter with the buriats and to make a start in the spring  their host was greatly pleased when they informed him of their intention at any rate to spend the winter with them for he hoped that before the spring alexis would have made up his mind to accept his offer and to settle down as a member of the tribe  the day after the buriats pitched their fresh camp one of the men reported that he had seen a large bear at the edge of a forest two miles from the huts alexis and godfrey at once took their guns borrowed a couple of long spears and two hunting knives and started for the wood the native going with them to show them the exact spot where he had seen the bear there was a good deal of undergrowth about and they thought it probable that the animal was not far off the buriat had brought a dog with him and the animal at once began sniffing the ground his master encouraged it and presently it started sniffing the ground as it went it had gone but a few hundred yards when it stopped before a thick clump of bushes and began growling furiously they had a short consultation and then the two friends took up their post one at each corner of the bushes while the buriat went round to the rear of the clump with his dog and began beating the bushes with his stick while the dog barked and yelped a minute later a bear broke out of the bushes within four yards of alexis  the russian levelled his gun godfrey heard a report far louder than usual and something flew close to his head a moment later he saw alexis struck to the ground by the bear godfrey rushed up and fired when within two paces of the animal which with a fierce growl turned upon him he sprang aside and plunged his spear deep into its side the bear struck at the handle and broke it in two and then rose on its hindlegs godfrey drew his knife and awaited its rush but it stood stationary for half a minute swayed to and fro and then fell on its side godfrey leaned over it and plunged his knife in deep behind its shoulders pressing it until the blade disappeared then feeling certain it was dead he ran to alexis who lay motionless on the ground by the side of him lay the stock of the gun and a portion of the barrel it had exploded completely shattering the russians left hand but this was not his only or even his most serious injury the bear had struck him on the side of the head almost tearing off a portion of the scalp and ear  the buriat had by this time come round and godfrey bade him run to the camp at the top of his speed to fetch assistance feeling in his friends pocket he drew out the bandage which alexis always carried and wrapped up as well as he could his shattered hand of which the thumb and two first fingers were altogether missing the wound on the head was he felt altogether beyond him in less than half an hour the chief buriat and four of his men dashed up on horseback they had brought with them two poles and a hide to form a litter the chief was deeply concerned when he saw how serious were the russians injuries no time was lost in lashing the hides to the poles alexis was lifted and laid upon the litter and two of the buriats took the poles while the others led back the horses as soon as he arrived in camp godfrey bathed the wounds with warm water and poured some spirits between the lips of the wounded man but he gave no signs of consciousness  i am afraid he said to the buriat who was looking on anxiously that his skull is injured or there is concussion of the brain the only thing that i can see will be for him to be carried at once to kiakhta there is sure to be a hospital there and doctors  that would be best the buriat said but i will take a house there and my wife and sister shall nurse him  that will be better than going into the hospital godfrey agreed for two reasons in the first because alexis would certainly get more careful nursing among his friends than in a hospital and he might then avoid if he survives his injuries being again imprisoned  no time was lost four buriats took the poles godfrey walked beside the litter and the buriat his wife and sister mounted and rode off to have everything ready for them when they arrived at troitzkosavsk the suburb of kiakhta it was late before they reached it the buriat met them half a mile outside the town and at once conducted them to a house that he had hired from a friend established there as soon as alexis was laid upon a couch godfrey and the buriat went out and ascertained where one of the surgeons of the military hospital lived on reaching the house they were shown by the cossack who acted as the doctors servant to his room  a friend of mine has been badly injured by a bear the buriat said i wish you to come and see him at once he is in a house i have taken near this i will be responsible for all charges  the doctor looked keenly at godfrey and then said i will come you are not a buriat he said to godfrey as they started  i am not doctor though i have been living with them for some time  and the man who is ill is he a buriat  no sir he is a russian and a member of your own profession  he is clever the buriat said he saved the life of my child by taking off his leg and he is running about again now he is as a brother to me and i would gladly give a thousand cattle rather than that he should die  no other words were spoken until they arrived at the house the surgeon stooped over alexis lifted one of his eyelids and felt his pulse  concussion of the brain he said a serious case bring me rags and hot water he bathed the wound for some time and then carefully examined it there is a fracture of the skull he said to godfrey and i fancy there is a piece of bone pressing on the brain put wet cloths round his head for the present i will go and fetch my colleague and i will send down some ice from the hospital his hand is bandaged up what is the matter with that  his gun burst doctor and has mangled his hand dreadfully that was how it was the bear got at him and struck him  the surgeon removed the bandages and examined it keep it bathed with warm water until i return he said  half an hour later he came back with the other surgeon a man older than himself both carrying cases of instruments the wound on the head was again examined they then proceeded to operate and in a few minutes removed a portion of splintered bone then the flap of skin was carefully replaced in its position and a few stitches put in to hold it the hand was then attended to  no i dont think it need come off the senior surgeon said we may save the third and little fingers at any rate we will try if it does not do we can take the whole off afterwards  the operation was performed then ordering the ice that had just been brought to be applied to the head the surgeons left  we will look in again early in the morning one of them said to godfrey and then we will have a chat with you  the women took it by turns to watch and godfrey worn out by the excitement of the day slept until morning alexis was restless moving uneasily and muttering to himself his eyes were open but he took no notice of what was going on around him the surgeon they had first seen came alone  he is better he said to the buriat but he is very far from being out of danger yet it will be a long illness but i hope that we may be able to bring him round i will send him some medicine presently keep cloths with cold water and ice to his head he beckoned to godfrey to follow him out of the room  i dont want to ask any questions he said about my patient i have been called in by this buriat to see a friend of his and it does not concern me who or what he may be but it is different with you as a russian officer i cannot be seeing you daily without reporting that i have met a person who scarcely appears to be what he seems it is painful to me to be obliged to say so i do not give advice any way i only say that if you do not wish to be asked questions it would be best for you to leave here after nightfall until then i shall not consider it necessary to make any report i shall be back again once or twice today you had better think the matter over  godfrey had been thinking the matter over as he walked beside the litter and had already arrived at a decision it was evident that many weeks if not months must elapse before alexis would be fit to sustain the hardships that would attend an attempt to escape and he thought it probable that more than ever he would be inclined to throw in his lot with the wandering buriats he had therefore only himself to think about he had foreseen that he would not be able to stop at kiakhta without being exposed to being questioned and that there remained therefore only the option of living with the buriats during the winter or of giving himself up the former plan would be the most advantageous in the event of his trying to reach pekin but the difficulties in that direction appeared to him so great that he shrank from the thought of facing them especially as he should now be alone and he preferred the idea of trying to escape by the north  in this case a further sojourn among the buriats would be useless in a russian prison he would be able to pick up many valuable hints from the men with whom he would work and might find someone ready to make the attempt with him the difficulties of escape from prison did not seem very great and would he thought be even less at one of the penal settlements than if confined in an ordinary jail when however the doctor spoke to him godfrey only thanked him and said he would speak with him again when he next called the buriat saw that he was looking serious when he returned to the room  what did he say to you he asked did he threaten to report you  he spoke very kindly godfrey replied but he said that it would be his duty to do so if i remained here  the buriat shook his head i was thinking of that yesterday and was afraid for you out on the plains there would have been none to question you but here in the town a stranger is noticed at once for every resident is known you must make off at once you can take my horse we will watch over your friend once in my tents you will be safe  godfrey thanked him warmly but told him that he had not quite decided as to what he should do but would let him know later on then as he could do nothing for alexis he threw himself down on a pile of skins and thought the matter over in every light     chapter viii  the mines of kara   godfrey found it a difficult matter to decide what was best to be done but after two hours thinking his mind was quite made up he did not stand in the same position as alexis with the buriats it was alexis who had laid them under such an obligation by saving their childs life he himself was simply liked as the doctors companion and without alexis the long months of winter would be dreary indeed he thought that imprisonment would be preferable to living alone in a buriat hut accordingly he rose at last and told the buriat that his course was decided  i shall give myself up he said i know that you would make me welcome in your tents but from what you have told me i see that there is no prospect whatever of an escape through china and that if i go out to the plains i shall be there for life while if i go to a prison i may in time be released or at any rate i can again escape  whenever you come to us you will be welcome the buriat said for yourself you know best but we shall be all sorry to lose you is there anything i can do for you i know the governor here for i have had large dealings with him for sheep and cattle for the troops  i shall be very glad if you will go with me to him godfrey said a word from you may be of great advantage to me there are no prisons here and i am most anxious to be sent to nertchinsk and not to irkutsk because it was from there we escaped  the buriats wife and sister were sorry when they heard godfreys determination but they were too much occupied with alexis to try and dispute it  when will you go the buriat said  at once if you will take me i have no preparations to make i only cause extra trouble here and can be of no assistance but first if you will procure paper pen and ink i will write a letter for you to give to alexis when he recovers telling him why i leave him  the buriat sent out one of his men who presently returned with writing materials and godfrey then wrote a long letter to alexis explaining at length the reasons that actuated him in deciding to give himself up  you are in good hands he said and i could do nothing for you and in any case i should have to leave you now for did i not give myself up i must leave this evening therefore i could do no good to you in any case i know that you were half inclined to stay with the buriats and you will now have even greater reasons for doing so than before if however you should at any future time change your mind and try to make your escape i need not tell you how delighted i should be to see you in england i inclose the address of my fathers office where you will be sure either to find me or to hear of me but even if i have not got home you will receive the heartiest welcome when you tell him of our having been together and show him this letter and you may rely upon it that my father will be able to procure a situation for you in london even if he cannot find a berth for you in his own house of business  when he had finished he handed the letter to the buriat to give to alexis  here is money the buriat said which my wife found upon alexis you had better take it with you  i cannot do that godfrey said it is his i have some of my own i know he would gladly give it to me if he were conscious but i cannot take it now  very well the buriat said you are doubtless right but at any rate you can take some from me i am rich i have many thousands of sheep and cattle if you do not take it i shall be offended and shall think that in some way we have displeased you a thousand roubles are nothing to me i have given as much for one suit of furs for my wife you must take this if you ever attempt to escape again you will need money  after much debate godfrey accepted five hundred roubles in notes seeing that the buriat would be really pained by his refusal and knowing that the money would indeed be useful to him when he next tried to make his escape being anxious to hear the surgeons next report about alexis godfrey delayed his start until after his visit  there is no change the doctor said after examining his patient nor did i expect there would be after such serious injuries as he has received it would be strange indeed if he did not suffer from the shock it may be some days before any change takes place it is vastly better that he should be restless or even wildly delirious than lying unconscious as he was when i first saw him well and what are you going to do young fellow  i am going to give myself up he said  you have had enough of the plains eh  yes sir for the present  mind dont be foolish enough to say that you have escaped there is not the least occasion for that that would make the case a great deal worse  my friend here was going with me to the governor doctor to tell him that i have been living with him for some time  yes that is all well enough but if you give yourself up it is a confession that you have escaped that wont do at all i tell you what will be the best thing i will go with you to colonel prescoff the governor i shall tell him the truth that i was attending one of the buriats men who had been badly injured by a bear when i saw you there i found that you could not give a good account of yourself and had no papers and that therefore as was my duty i brought you to him then you must say that you have been working here and there and that you come from say tomsk i suppose you have been there  godfrey smiled  that is near enough the doctor went on as for your papers you lost them or they were burnt or stolen from you he wont ask you many questions then the buriat will speak up for youhe is rather an important man being one of the richest of his tribeand say what he can for you is there anything you want done particularly  i want to be sent to nertchinsk instead of to irkutsk i would rather work in the mines or anywhere else than be shut up in prison  and besides you would not be known the doctor laughed  that is the principal thing sir  whatever you do my lad the doctor said if you have been a political prisonermind i dont ask the question and dont want to knowbut if you have been dont let it out it is better to have been a murderer than a nihilist out here i dare say the colonel would send you to nertchinsk if your friend here asks him but it is a good deal further and a more expensive journey  i will gladly pay for the vehicle sir  ah well if you will do that i should think it could be managed i will go in first with your friend and have a talk with the colonel and we will see if we can put the matter straight for you before you are called in  godfrey took his furlined coat said goodbye to the two ladies gently put his hand on his comrades shoulder and followed the doctor and his host when they arrived at the governors house the doctor left him in the room where two military clerks were writing and went in with the buriat to the governor in five minutes the bell rang an orderly answered it and returning bade godfrey follow him the governor was seated at a table the doctor and the buriat standing near  so i hear the colonel said looking sharply at godfrey that you are unable to give an account of yourself and have nothing but a cockandbull story of having wandered about through the country we understand what that means however our friend here and he motioned to the buriat speaks well of you and says that you have done him some service however that cannot be taken into consideration it is clear that having no papers and no domicile you are a vagabond and as such must be committed to prison you will be taken to nertchinsk godfrey bowed the colonel touched the bell again and the orderly entered take this man to the cells  the buriat stepped forward and shook hands with godfrey come again he said in a low voice you will always be welcome  the doctor nodded i shall see you before you start he said godfrey saluted the colonel and followed the orderly out of the room he was taken across a courtyard to a cell  a good style of young fellow the colonel said when he left he has either been an officer and got into some scrape with his colonel or he is a political  one or the other colonel no doubt the doctor agreed  well it is no business of mine the colonel said i suppose he has had four or five months in the woods and wants to get into snug quarters again before winter well good morning gentlemen and his visitors took their leave  late in the evening the doctor came into godfreys cell by the bye he said i put your name down as ivan holstoff it was as good as any other and you had to be entered by some name i feared that you might blurt out your own whatever it may be and that might be fatal for if you are a political prisoner your name will have been sent to every station where there are troops  i am very much obliged to you doctor for your kindness godfrey said i will take care to remain ivan holstoff how much am i to pay for the carriage  your friend the buriat has seen to that and handed the governor money for a vehicle there and back as the soldier in charge of you will have to return  it is very good of him godfrey said gratefully please tell him when you see him how much obliged i am to him for his kindness to me  i think my patient will do the doctor said he is quieter and less feverish this evening i think he will pull round and now good bye i think you have done right in giving yourself up you are but a lad yet and with good conduct now that you are entered only as a vagabond you will get leave to work outside the prison in two or three years and get a permit to settle anywhere in siberia a couple of years later  the next morning at daybreak godfrey was placed in a vehicle a soldier mounted by the side of the driver the latter shouted to his horses and started at full gallop soon after leaving the town they passed a caravan of forty carts carrying tea the soldier who appeared a chatty fellow told him they would be three months on their way to moscow at a town named verchne udinsk they regained the main road and turned east and continued their journey through chita a town of three thousand inhabitants to nertchinsk a distance of six hundred miles the country was hilly and for the most part wooded but varied at times by rolling prairies on which large herds of cattle were grazing the journey was far more pleasant than that godfrey had before made for being no longer regarded as a political prisoner his guard chatted with him freely and at night instead of having to sleep in the vehicle in the open air he was lodged in the convict stations which as the season was late were for the most part unoccupied he was glad however when he arrived at nertchinsk for the jolting of the springless vehicle was very trying he did not see the governor of the prison but was at once assigned to a cell there on the guard handing to the authorities the official report of the governor at kiakhta  you are to go on again tomorrow the warder said to him that evening we are full here and there is a party going on to kara you will go with them the barber will be here to shave you directly you have not been out very long judging by the length of your hair here is your prison dress you must put that on tomorrow instead of the one you have on but you may carry yours with you if you like it will be useful to you when your term in the prison is done  accordingly the next morning godfrey was taken into the courtyard where some fifty other prisoners were assembled and ten minutes later marched off under a guard of eight mounted cossacks he carried his peasants clothes and fur coat rolled up into a bundle on his shoulder and had after he changed his dress sewn up his money in the collar of his jacket with a needle and thread he had brought with him keeping out some twenty roubles for present purposes the journey occupied five days the marches averaging twentyfive miles apiece the prisoners talked and sung by the way picked the blackberries and raspberries that grew thickly on the bushes by the wayside and at night slept in the stations their food consisting of very fair broth with cabbage in it meat and black bread godfrey was asked no questions he did not know whether this was because the convicts thought only of themselves and had no curiosity about their companions or whether it was a sort of etiquette observed among them godfrey was surprised to find how much the country differed from the ideas he had formed of siberia  the forests were beautiful with a great variety of foliage late lilies bloomed by the roadside with flowers of other kinds of whose names he was ignorant to the north was a chain of hills of considerable height the forest was alive with birds and he frequently caught sight of squirrels running about among the branches no objection was offered by the guards to their making purchases at the villages through which they passed except that they would not allow them to buy spirits at the first opportunity godfrey laid out four or five roubles in tea and tobacco some of which he presented to the guards and divided the rest among his fellowprisoners who forthwith dubbed him the count at length kara was reached it was not a town but purely a convict settlement the prisoners being divided among four or five prisons situated two or three miles from each other they were first marched to the most central of these here they were inspected by the governor who had the details of each case reported by the authorities of the prisons they had left they were at once divided into parties in accordance with the vacancies in the various prisons  only four were left behind these were taken to a guardroom until allotted to the various wards one by one they were taken out godfrey being the last to be summoned he was conducted to a room in which several convicts were seated writing through this a long passage led to the governors room  you are known as ivan holstoff the governor said when the warder had retired  yes sir  age  seventeen  charged with being a vagabond found without papers or documents and unable to give a satisfactory account of yourself  godfrey bowed the colonel glanced through the paper by his side signed by the governor at kiakhta and saying that the prisoner had been most favourably reported upon by a wealthy buriat a government contractor with whom he had been living out on the plains  you persist in giving no further account of yourself the governor asked  i would rather say nothing further sir godfrey replied  you are not a russian the governor said sharply  i am a russian born the lad replied  you speak with a slight accent  i was away for some years from my country godfrey replied  i suppose you would call yourself a student  yes sir i was a student until lately  you are a young lad to have got yourself into trouble how was it do not tell me what crime you are charged with but you can tell me anything else it will go no farther and there will be no record of what you say  godfrey liked the officers face it was stern but sternness is a necessity when a man is in charge of some three thousand prisoners the greater proportion of whom are desperate men but there was a kindness in the halfsmile with which he spoke  i am here sir from pure misfortune i have no doubt most people you question declare they are innocent and i do not expect you to believe me the facts against me were very strong so strong that i believe any jury would have convicted me upon them but in spite of that i was innocent i behaved like a fool and was made the dupe of others but beyond that i have nothing whatever to blame myself for or to regret  it may be as you say colonel konovovitch said i am not here to revise sentences but to see them carried out conduct yourself well lad and in two years you will get a permit to reside outside the prison three years later you will be practically free and can go where you like in siberia and earn your living in any way you choose many of the richest men in the country have been convicts i shall keep an eye on you and shall make matters as easy for you as i can  he touched the bell and the warder reentered and led godfrey away the colonel sat for some little time in thought he liked the lads face and his manner which although perfectly respectful had none of the servility with which russians generally address their superiors he did not say that he was a russian he said to himself only that he was born in russia i should say from his appearance and manner that he was english what was he sent out here for i wonder he may have been a clerk and been condemned for forgery or embezzlement he may have been a political prisoner most likely that i should say he may have got mixed up in some of these nihilist plots if so he has done well to become a vagabond i cant help thinking he was speaking the truth when he declared he was innocent well perhaps in the long run it will be the best for him a clerks lot is not a very bright one and i should say he is likely to make his way anywhere he has a hard two years time before him among those scoundrels but i should think he is likely to hold his own  then he dismissed the subject from his thoughts and turned to a pile of papers before him  godfrey on leaving the presence of the governor was taken by the warder to one of the prison blocks and was handed over to the prison official in charge of it he was taken to a small room and there furnished with a bag in which to keep his underclothing and other effects  you will use this bag for a pillow at night the official said what money you have you can either give to me to take charge of for you or can hand it over to the head man of the room to lay out for you as you require it or you can keep it yourself if you choose to hold it yourself you had better keep a very sharp lookout not that there are any professional thieves here it is only for very serious offences that men are sent east of irkutsk  godfrey thanked the official but said that what little he had he might as well keep with him his money in paper was safely hidden in the lining of his convict jacket and as he knew that that would be worn by night as well as by day it was perfectly safe there he was provided with some flannel shirts and other underclothing  i see you have underclothing of your own the official said but of course you have the regular allowance given you if you run short of money you can sell them now come along with me  godfrey was led into a large room where the scene somewhat widely differed from what he had pictured to himself would be the interior of a prison at the dreaded mines of kara the room was large and fairly lofty the walls were clean and whitewashed down both sides ran benches six feet wide similar to one he had seen in an english guardhouse there were some sixty men in the room some of these were lying upon the bedplaces smoking pipes others were sitting on them talking together or mending their clothes and several parties were engaged in cardplaying save for the ugly gray uniforms with the coloured patches in the centre of the back significant of the term of imprisonment to which their wearers had been sentenced and the strangely shaved heads of those present he might have been in a singularly freeandeasy barrackroom most of the men looked up as the official entered  a new comrade he said mikail stomoff do you take him in your charge and having said this he at once left the room  mikail stomoff a big powerful man came across to godfrey he was the starosta or head man of the ward elected to the position by the votes of his fellowprisoners it was his duty to keep order and prevent quarrelling and to see that the ward was swept out and kept tidy he transacted all business for the prisoners made their purchases outside and was generally the intermediary between them and the authorities in return for all this he was free from labour at the mines  well my lad he said you began early how long are you in for and what have you done  i am in here for being a vagabond godfrey said and i believe the punishment for that is five years  a vagabond eh we have not many of them here the wanderers generally work their way west however i daresay you had your reasons and i dont know that you are not right for most of us prefer hard work here to the dulness of the prisons in the west now lad he went on dropping his voice if you have got any money do not say a word about it you will be robbed to a certainty if you keep it yourself the best thing you can do is to hand it over to me and i will take care of it for you godfrey nodded and putting his hand in his pocket pulled out the tenrouble note he had set aside and two or three smaller notes and slipped them into the mans hand  you can have it out as you want it the man said and anything you want outside i can get for you out of it the only thing prohibited is vodka  some of the other men came round and godfrey thought he had never seen more villainous faces some of them were heavy stolid and stupid others were fierce and passionate  he is a vagabond mikail said to them i dont know what he has been before that and if he is wise and he gave a significant glance at godfrey he will keep that to himself  i should say he had been a political one of the men said in a tone of contempt for there was a certain jealousy of the politicals among the convict class because although their lot was really much harder than that of ordinary convicts they were allowed to retain their own clothes were lodged separately and were almost all men of education and in many cases of noble family the feeling was evidenced by the indifference with which the rest of the men strolled away again when they heard the suggestion  how do they all get tobacco godfrey asked the starosta is it part of the rations surely the money they may have when they come in here must soon be spent  we may buy the tobacco mikail said every man has something for his work they pretend it is half the value of the work we do but of course we know better than that still we all get something each day and can spend it as we like i dont think they allow smoking in the western prisons but they do in all those east of irkutsk the authorities encourage it indeed for it is considered healthy and keeps away fever there are no fevers in summer but in winter from so many men being shut up together the air gets bad and sometimes we have outbreaks of fever  but where do you buy your tobacco  people come to the prison gates and sell it as we come back from work you can buy anything except vodka and you can buy that though not openly it gets smuggled in  how many hours do you work a day  thirteen but of course it is only for five months in the year in winter the ground is too hard  too hard godfrey repeated why it never gets cold in mines  you dont think you are going to work underground do you the man said there are very few underground mines here it is all on the surface there are some underground because i have worked in them i would rather work there than here they cant look after you so sharp and you can take it as easily as you like  godfrey looked astonished his ideas of the siberian mines had been taken from stories written by men who had never been within thousands of miles of them and who drew terrible pictures of the sufferings of exiles simply for the purpose of exciting feeling throughout europe against the russian government  but it is very unhealthy in the mines underground is it not  no why should it be it is much cooler and pleasanter working underground than it is in the dust and heat i can tell you  but i thought all quicksilver mines were unhealthy  quicksilver the man repeated there is not a quicksilver mine in all siberia there is gold and silver but i dont believe there is a place where quicksilver is found anyhow there is not one that is worked they have been gammoning you young fellow  well they have gammoned a good many other people too godfrey said i know i have read frightful accounts of the sufferings of prisoners in quicksilver mines  who wrote them mikail asked there are a few convicts who may years afterwards be proved innocent and allowed to return to russia but they are not the sort that would write lies about this place for if they did they would soon find themselves on the road again there are not a dozen men who have ever made their escape some of them may have invented lies for the sake of getting pity and make themselves out to be hard used have you ever read any books by them  only one godfrey said it was written by baron rosen he was a political prisoner who was pardoned after being here a great many years he described the life of political prisoners of course and even that was not very bad many of them had their wives with them and they seem to have lived together pretty comfortably  ah well i dont think a political prisoner who came here now would say as much they are sent to lonely settlements many of them up at yakutsk though of course there are some down here it is a horribly dull life some of them do work in the mines but they are better off than those who have no work to do at all i would rather be in for murder a hundred times than be a political and what name do you go by young fellow  i am entered as ivan holstoff  that will do well enough dont you be fool enough to tell any one what your real name is there are sneaks here as well as elsewhere who are glad enough to curry favour so as to get easy jobs or to be let out sooner than they otherwise would be by acting as spies so you keep your real name to yourself if it got to the ears of the governor he might find out what prison you escaped from and what you were in for and if you were a political you would either be sent back there or put with the politicals here so keep it to yourself  shall i give you my watch  yes i think you had better it would be of no good to anyone who took it as long as he was in here but he would be able to sell it when he went to live outside i will take care of it for you i have got a safe where i keep the money and things locked  we have got to work and pretty hard but i tell you we are a good bit better off than they are in the prisons of russia we have got plenty to eat though i cannot say much for its niceness anyhow we are a long way better fed than the soldiers who look after us but here comes the food  a warder brought in a huge tray upon which were placed bowls of a sort of soup while two others brought baskets piled up with huge chunks of black bread mikail took from a cupboard a spoon and gave it to godfrey you keep this for yourself he said we dont have knives and forks and do not want them  is this a days allowance of bread godfrey asked as he took hold of one of the lumps  no you get as much as that in the morning our allowance is four pounds a day two in the morning and two in the evening the evening bread generally lasts for evening and morning soup and we take the morning bread away with us to eat in the middle of the day  godfrey sat down on the edge of the bed bench and ate his supper as he looked at the men more carefully he saw that there were greater differences between them than he had at first noticed some of them he judged to have been gentlemen and he afterwards found that there were three or four who had been officers in the army but sentenced for grave military crimes there were half a dozen in for forgery or embezzlement and over thirty for murder some among the prisoners were tartars these were all in for murder or robbery with violence  where am i to sleep he presently asked mikail  i sleep in that corner next to the wall put your bag next to mine they are not so likely to play tricks with you then  godfrey was not sorry to lay himself down on the boards there was no attempt at undressing on the part of any of the convicts he would have thought the bed a very hard one a few months since but he was now well contented with it though he would have preferred rather more room on each side  i suppose i ought to feel very miserable he said to himself i cant make out why i dont here am i shut up with about a hundred as villainouslooking fellows as one could want to seesomething like half of them murderers all desperate criminals i ought to be down in the dumps it seems unnatural that i shouldnt be i suppose i have a sort of mark tapley disposition and get jolly under difficulties of course i should feel it more if i hadnt made up my mind to escape somehow the colonel seems a good sort of fellow and even the prisoners speak well of him then it is a comfort to hear that all that talk about the quicksilver mines was a lie and the work is going to be no worse than a golddigger would have in california or a navvy at home there is no great hardship about that at any rate for a time if it was not for the thought of how horribly anxious they must be at home about me i should not mind it will be something to talk about all ones life the first thing for me to do is to learn from the others as much as possible about the country i have learned a lot about the geography of siberia from alexis and have got a good idea about all the rivers i dare say i shall learn a good deal more from some of these men another thing is to pick up as much of their language as i can from these tartar fellows they seem to be scattered pretty well all over the country at least i have seen some of them all the way i have gone i know there are other tribes those fishing chaps they call ostjaks are the ones i should have most to do with i expect one could get on with them if one happened to get them in the right vein i suppose they speak some sort of dialect like that of these tartars at any rate i should think it would be sure to be near enough for the natives to understand each other i believe russian helps with all these languages for the russians are themselves only civilized tartars at any rate one of the first things to be done is to learn to speak the language and i should be able to learn a lot about the country from them too i have got eight or nine months before one can think of making a start for of course it must be done in the spring it is the end of september now though i have lost all account of the days of the month  so he lay thinking for a long time always confidently and hopefully soon after daylight the convicts were astir  is there any place where we can get water to wash he asked mikail  there is a tap and a trough out there in the yard the man said looking somewhat surprised at the request  godfrey hurried out threw off his jacket and shirt turned the tap on to his head and enjoyed a thorough sluice feeling vastly better for the wash he slipped on his things again and went into the room he was not surprised now that he had woke with something like a headache for the air of the room was close and unwholesome breakfast similar to the supper the night before was soon served godfrey had plenty of bread left from the evening before and put the piece now served out to him under his jacket half an hour later the convicts ranged two and two started for the mines the distance was five miles the heavy tools were taken in carts drawn by horses and a guard of soldiers with loaded muskets marched beside the line  the mine was a large open cutting and the prisoners were employed in digging the sand and carrying it on handbarrows to the place where it was to be washed the work was not entirely performed by prisoners as there were many free labourers also employed godfrey was given a shovel and his work consisted in loading the sand and gravel as the pickmen got it down on to the barrows being unaccustomed to work his back ached and his hands were blistered by the end of the day but he knew from his experience in rowing that this would pass off before long at any rate the labour was far easier than he had anticipated he had expected to see overseers with whips but there was nothing of the sort a few men directed the labour and spoke sharply enough if they saw any of the prisoners shirking but there was nothing to distinguish it from any other work of the kind save the cossack guards here and there leaning upon their muskets and certainly the men worked no harder than ordinary labourers would do indeed when the time was up and the prisoners started on their return towards the prison the free labourers continued their work and would do so he afterwards learned for some hours as it would take a considerable time for all the sand obtained during the day to be thoroughly washed up and the gold extracted godfrey had at first looked narrowly at the sand as he shovelled it for specks of gold but had seen none and indeed the proportion of gold at the mines of kara was so small that they would not have paid if worked by free labour but the produce served to lessen the expenses of the prisons and the mines afforded work to the convicts the prisoners were not forbidden to talk and godfrey who had happened to be placed next to a young fellow of the better class learned a good many particulars as to the mines he had seen no women at them and asked if they were not employed at that labour  i never heard of such a thing the other said they have to work they wash and mend our clothes and scrub the floors and help the cooks but that is all after working for a certain time according to the length of their sentence they are allowed to live out of prison and after a still further time are at liberty to settle down anywhere in siberia they choose  have you been here long godfrey asked  i have been here three years he said and i should be out by this time if i had not run away last year  how did you get on  i got on well enough till the cold weather came there are plenty of berries in the woods and besides we occasionally came down and stole things from the carts waiting at night at the posthouses we got a chest of tea once and that lasted us all through the summer there were ten of us together besides that the people all along the road are very good to escaped prisoners they dare not give them anything because if it were known they did so they would be severely punished but on the windowsill of almost every house is placed at night a plate with food on it in case any wanderer should come along of course when winter came i had to give myself up  do you think escape altogether is possible  i dont say that it is not possible for some have done it but i suppose for every one who has tried it hundreds have died there is no living in the mountains in winter men do get free there are a great many private mines and in some of these they ask no questions but are glad enough to engage anyone who comes along after working there as a free labourer for a couple of years it is comparatively easy to move somewhere else and in time one may even settle down as a free labourer in a town but there is no getting right away then for no one can leave siberia without a passport giving particulars of all his life  you are not thinking of trying are you because if you will take my advice you wont it is all very well to go out for a summer holiday but that is a very different thing from attempting an escape i was a fool to try it but i had such a longing to be in the woods that i could not help it so now i shall be obliged to work here for a couple of years longer before i can live outside the prison i am here for knocking down my colonel we were both in love with the same girl she liked me best and her father liked him best he was a tyrannical brute one day he insulted me before her and i knocked him down i was tried for that and he trumped up a lot of other charges against me and there was no difficulty in getting plenty of hounds to swear to them so you see here i am with a ten years sentence i dont know that i am not lucky  how is that godfrey asked  there were half a dozen fellows in the regimenti was one of themwho ventured to think for themselves we had secret meetings and were in communication with men of other regiments well i was sent off before anything came of it but they got hold of the names of the others when they arrested some nihilists at kieff and they were all sent out here for life i met one of them a few months back and he told me so so you see it was rather lucky that i knocked down the colonel when i did besides it is ever so much better to be a convict than a political i dont know how it was you had the luck to get turned in with us i can tell you there is no comparison between their lot and ours still it is hateful of course living among such a gang as these fellows  they look pretty bad godfrey said  bad is not the word for it the other said a man i know who works as a clerk in the office told me that there are about two thousand two hundred prisoners in the six prisons of kara but of these only about a hundred and fifty are women they are even worse than the men for of the hundred and fifty there are a hundred and twentyfive murderesses and of the others twelve are classed as vagabonds and i suppose most of these are murderesses too out of the two thousand men there are about six hundred and seventy murderers that is not such a big proportion as among the women though as there are nearly seven hundred classed as vagabonds you would not be far wrong if you put down every other man as a murderer  it is horrible godfrey said  well it is not pleasant but you must remember that a great many of these murderers may be otherwise pretty honest fellows a great many of them have killed a man or woman when mad with vodka some of the others have done it in a fit of jealousy a few perhaps out of vengeance for some great wrong the rest i grant are thoroughly bad  by the way my name is osip ivanoff there are two or three decent fellows in our ward i will introduce you to them this evening it makes it pleasanter keeping together we have got some cards and that helps pass away the summer evenings in winter it is too dark to play there is only one candle in the ward so there is nothing for it but to lay up and go to sleep as soon as it gets dark there is the prison i dare say you wont be sorry when you are back the first three or four days work is always trying     chapter ix  prison life   godfrey found that there was no sunday break in the work at kara but that once a fortnight the whole of the occupants of the ward had baths and upon these days no work was done upon a good many saints days they also rested so that practically they had a holiday about once in every ten days for his own part he would have been glad had the work gone on without these breaks when the men started for work at five in the morning and returned to the prison at seven at night the great majority after smoking a pipe or two turned in at once while upon the days when there was no work quarrels were frequent and what was to him still more objectionable men told stories of their early lives and seemed proud rather than otherwise of the horrible crimes they had committed his own time did not hang at all heavy upon his hands  one of the tartar prisoners who spoke russian was glad enough to agree in exchange for a sufficient amount of tobacco to enable him to smoke steadily while so employed to teach him his own dialect godfrey found as he had expected a sufficient similarity between the two languages to assist him very greatly and with two hours work every evening and a long bout on each holiday he made rapid progress with it especially as he got into the habit of going over and over again through the vocabulary of all the words he had learned while he was at work in the mine when not employed with the tartar he spent his time in conversation with osip ivanoff and the little group of men of the same type they spent much of their time in playing cards whist being a very popular game in russia they often invited godfrey to join them but his mind was so much occupied with his own plans that he felt quite unable to give the requisite attention to the game  he soon learnt the methods by which order and discipline were maintained in the prisons for small offences the punishment was a decrease in the rations the prohibition of smokingthe prisoners one enjoymentand confinement to the room the last part of the sentence was that which the prisoners most disliked so far from work being hardship the break which it afforded to the monotony of their life rendered the privation of it the severest of punishments and godfrey learned that there was the greatest difficulty in getting men to accept the position of starosta in spite of the privileges and power the position gave because he did not go out to work for more serious offences men were punished by a flogging more or less severe with birch rods for this however they seemed to care very little although sometimes incapacitated for doing work for some days from the effects of the beating  lastly for altogether exceptional crimes or for open outbreaks of insubordination there was the pleteflogging with a whip of twisted hide fastened to a handle ten inches long and an inch thick the lash is at first the same thickness as the handle tapering for twelve inches and then divided into three smaller lashes each twentyfive inches long and about the thickness of the little finger this terrible weapon is in use only at three of the siberian prisons of which kara is one from twenty to twentyfive lashes are given and the punishment is considered equivalent to a sentence to death as in many cases the culprit survives the punishment but a short time the prisoners were agreed that at kara the punishment of the plete was extremely rare only being given for the murder of a convict or official by one of the convicts the quarrels among the prisoners although frequent and attended by great shouting and gesticulation very rarely came to blows the russians having no idea of using their fists and the contests when it came to that being little more than a tussle with hair pulling and random blows had the prisoners had knives or other weapons ready to hand the results would have been very different  godfrey had not smoked until he arrived at kara but he found that in the dense atmosphere of the prison room it was almost necessary and therefore took to it besides smoking being allowed as useful to ward off fevers and improve the health of the prisoners it also had the effect of adding to their contentment rendering them more easy of management as the fear of the smoking being cut off did more to ensure ready obedience than even the fear of the stick tea was not among the articles of prison diet but a samovar was always kept going by mikail and the tea sold to the prisoners at its cost price and the small sum paid to the convicts sufficed to provide them with this and with tobacco  vodka was but seldom smuggled in the difficulty of bringing it in being great and the punishment of those detected in doing so being severe at times however a supply was brought in being carried as godfrey found in skins similar to those used for sausages filled with the spirit and wound round and round the body these were generally brought in when one or other of the prisoners had received a remittance as most of them were allowed to receive a letter once every three months and these letters in the case of men who had once been in a good position generally contained money this privilege was only allowed to men after two years unbroken good conduct  godfreys teacher in the tartar language had been recommended to him by osip as being the most companionable of the tartar prisoners he was a young fellow of three or four and twenty short and sturdy like most of his race and with a goodnatured expression in his flat face he was in for life having in a fit of passion killed a russian officer who had struck him with a whip he came from the neighbourhood of kasan in the far west godfrey took a strong liking to him and was not long before he conceived the idea that when he made his escape he would if possible take luka with him such companionship would be of immense advantage and would greatly diminish the difficulties of the journey as for luka he became greatly attached to his pupil the tartars were looked down upon by their fellowprisoners and the terms of equality with which godfrey chatted with them and his knowledge of the world which seemed to the tartar to be prodigious made him look up to him with unbounded respect  the friendship was finally cemented by an occurrence that took place three months after godfrey arrived at the prison among the convicts was a man named kobylin a man of great strength he boasted that he had committed ten murders and was always bullying and tyrannizing the quieter and weaker prisoners one day he passed where luka and godfrey were sitting on the edge of the plank bed talking together luka happened to get up just as he came along and kobylin gave him a violent push saying get out of the way you miserable little tartar dog  luka fell with his head against the edge of the bench and lay for a time half stunned godfrey leapt to his feet and springing forward struck the bully a righthanded blow straight from the shoulder the man staggered back several paces and fell over the opposite bench then with a shout of fury he recovered his feet and rushed at godfrey with his arms extended to grasp him but the lad who had been one of the best boxers at shrewsbury awaited his onset calmly and making a spring forward just as kobylin reached him landed a blow given with all his strength and the impetus of his spring under the russians chin and the man went backwards as if he had been shot  a roar of applause broke from the convicts mikail rushed forward but godfrey said to him  let us alone mikail this fellow has been a nuisance in the ward ever since i came it is just as well that he should have a lesson i shant do him any harm just leave us alone for a minute or two he wont want much more    illustration godfrey punishes kobylin in the convict prison  the russian rose slowly to his feet bewildered and half stupefied by the blow and fall he would probably have done nothing more but maddened by the taunts and jeers of the others he gathered himself together and renewed the attack but he in vain attempted to seize his active opponent godfrey eluded his furious rushes and before he could recover himself always succeeded in getting in two or three straight blows and at last met him as in his first rush and knocked him off his feet  by this time kobylin had had enough of it and sat on the floor bewildered and crestfallen everything that a russian peasant does not understand savours to him of magic and that he kobylin should have been thus vanquished by a mere lad seemed altogether beyond nature he could not understand how it was that he had been unable to grasp his foe or how that like a stroke of lightning these blows had shot into his face even the jeering and laughter of his companions failed to stir him the russian peasant is accustomed to be beaten and is humble to those who are his masters kobylin rose slowly to his feet  you have beaten me he said humbly i do not know how forgive me i was wrong i am ignorant and did not know  say no more about it godfrey replied we have had a quarrel and there is an end of it there need be no malice we are all prisoners here together and it is not right that one should bully others because he happens to be a little stronger there are other things besides strength you behaved badly and you have been punished let us smoke our pipes and think no more about it  the sensation caused in the ward by the contest was prodigious and the victory of this lad was as incomprehensible to the others as to kobylin himself the rapidity with which the blows were delivered and the ease with which godfrey had evaded the rushes of his opponent seemed to them as to him almost magical and from that moment they regarded godfrey as being possessed of some strange power which placed him altogether apart from themselves osip and the other men of the same stamp warmly congratulated godfrey  what magic is this osip said taking him by the shoulders and looking with wonder at him i have been thinking you but a lad and yet that strong brute is as a child in your hands it is the miracle of david and goliath over again  it is simply skill against brute force osip i may tell you what i have not told anyone before since i came here that my mother was english i did not say so because as you may guess i feared that were it known and reported it might be traced who i was and then instead of being merely classed as a vagabond i should be sent back to the prison i escaped from and be put among another class of prisoners  i understand ivan of course i have all along felt sure you were a political prisoner and i thought perhaps you might have been a student in switzerland which would account for you having ideas different to other people  no i was sent for a time to a school in england and there i learned to box  so that is your english boxing osip said i have heard of it but i never thought it was anything like that why he never once touched you  if he had i should have got the worst of it godfrey laughed but there was nothing in it size and weight go for very little in boxing and a man knowing nothing about it has not the smallest chance against a fair boxer who is active on his legs  but you did not seem to be exerting yourself osip said you were as cool and as quiet as if you had been shovelling sand you even laughed when he rushed at you  that is the great point of boxing osip one learns to keep cool and to have ones wits about one for anyone who loses his temper has but a poor chance indeed against another who keeps cool moreover a man who can box well will always keep his head in all times of danger and difficulty it gives him nerve and selfconfidence and enables him at all times to protect the weak against the strong  just as you did now osip said well i would not have believed it if i had not seen it i am sure we all feel obliged to you for having taken down that fellow kobylin he and a few others have been a nuisance for some time you may be sure there will be no more trouble with them after the lesson you have given  lukas gratitude to godfrey was unbounded and from that time he would have done anything on his behalf while the respect with which he had before regarded him was redoubled therefore when one day godfrey said to him when the spring comes luka i mean to try to escape and i shall take you with me the tartar considered it to be a settled thing and was filled with a deep sense of gratitude that his companion should deem him worthy of sharing in his perils  winter set in in three weeks after godfrey reached kara and the work at the mine had to be abandoned as much employment as possible was made for the convicts some were sent out to aid in bringing in the trees that had been felled during the previous winter for firewood others sawed the wood up and split it into billets for the stoves other parties went out into the forest to fell trees for the next winters fires some were set to whitewash the houses a process that was done five times a year but in spite of all this there was not work for half the number the time hung very heavily on the hands of those who were unemployed godfrey was not of this number for as soon as the work at the mine terminated he received an order to work in the office as a clerk  he warmly appreciated this act of kindness on the part of the commandant it removed him from the constant companionship of the convicts which was now more unpleasant than before as during the long hours of idleness quarrels were frequent and the men became surly and discontented besides this he received regular pay for his work and this was of importance as it was necessary to start upon such an undertaking as he meditated with as large a store of money as possible he had since his arrival refused to join in any of the proposals for obtaining luxuries from outside the supply of food was ample for in addition to the bread and soup there was three or four times a week an allowance of meat and his daily earnings in the mines were sufficient to pay for tobacco and tea even the ten roubles he had handed over to mikail remained untouched  one reason why he was particularly glad at being promoted to the office was that he had observed upon the day when he first arrived a large map of siberia hanging upon the wall and although he had obtained from alexis and others a fair idea of the position of the towns and various convict settlements he knew nothing of the wild parts of the country through which he would have to pass and the inhabited portion formed but a small part indeed of the whole during the winter months he seized every opportunity when for a few minutes he happened to be alone in the office to study the map and to obtain as accurate an idea as possible of the ranges of mountains one day when the colonel was out and the other two clerks were engaged in taking an inventory of stores and he knew therefore that he had little chance of being interrupted he pushed a table against the wall and with a sheet of tracing paper took the outline of the northern coast from the mouth of the lena to norway specially marking the entrances to all rivers however small he also took a tracing giving the positions of the towns and rivers across the nearest line between the head of lake baikal and the nearest point of the angara river one of the great affluents of the yenesei  the winter passed slowly and uneventfully the cold was severe but he did not feel it the office being well warmed and the heat in the crowded prison far greater than was agreeable to him at christmas there were three days of festivity the people of kara and the peasants round all sent in gifts for the prisoners every one laid by a little money to buy special food for the occasion and vodka had been smuggled in the convicts of the different prisons were allowed to visit each other freely and although there was much drunkenness on christmas day there were no serious quarrels all were on their best behaviour but godfrey was glad when all was over and they returned to their ordinary occupations again for the thought of the last christmas he had spent in england brought the change in his circumstances home to him more strongly than ever and for once his buoyant spirits left him and he was profoundly depressed while all around him were cheerful and gay  nothing surprised godfrey more than the brutal indifference with which most of the prisoners talked of the crimes they had committed except perhaps the indifference with which these stories were listened to it seemed to him indeed that some of the convicts had almost a pride in their crimes and that they even went so far as to invent atrocities for the purpose of giving themselves a supremacy in ferocity over their fellows he noticed that those who were in for minor offences such as robbery with violence forgery embezzlement and military insubordination were comparatively reticent as to their offences and that it was those condemned for murder who were the most given to boasting about their exploits  one could almost wish he said one day to his friend osip that one had the strength of samson to bring the building down and destroy the whole of them  i am very glad you have not if you have really a fancy of that sort i have not the least desire to be finished off in that sudden way  but it is dreadful to listen to them godfrey said i cannot understand what the motive of government can be in sending thousands of such wretches out here instead of hanging them i can understand transporting people who have been convicted of minor offences as when their term is up they may do well and help to colonize the country but what can be hoped from such horrible ruffians as these they have the trouble of keeping them for years and even when they are let out no one can hope that they will turn out useful members of the community they probably take to their old trade and turn brigands  i dont think they do that some of those who escape soon after coming out might do so but not when they have been released they would not care then to run the risk of either being flogged to death by the plete or kept in prison for the rest of their lives running away is nothing i have heard of a man who had run away repeatedly being chained to a barrow which he had to take with him wherever he went indoors and out that is the worst i ever heard of for as for flogging with rods these fellows think very little of it they will often walk back in the autumn to the same prison they went from take their flogging and go to work as if nothing had happened they are never flogged with the plete for that sort of thing that is kept for murder or heading a mutiny in which some of the officials have been killed no the brigands are chiefly composed of longsentence men who have got away early and who perhaps have killed a cossack or a policeman who tried to arrest them or some peasant who will not supply them with food after that they dare not return and so join some band of brigands in order to be able to keep to the woods through the winter i think that very few of the men who have once served their time and been released ever come back again  during the winter the food although still ample was less than the allowance they had received while working the allowance of bread was reduced by a pound a day and upon wednesdays and fridays which were fast days no meat was issued except to those engaged in chopping up firewood or bringing in timber from the forest leather gloves were served out to all men working in the open air but in spite of this their hands were frequently frostbitten the evenings would have been long indeed to godfrey had it not been for his tartar instructor the two would sit on the bench in the angle of the room and would talk together in tartar eked out by russian the young fellows face was much more intelligent than those of the majority of his countrymen and there was a merry and goodtempered expression in his eyes they chatted about his home and his life there his mother had been an ostjak and he had spent some years among her tribe on the banks both of the obi and yenesei but had never been far north on either river he took his captivity easily his father and mother both died when he had been a child and when he was not with the ostjaks he had lived with his fathers brother who had he said droves of cattle and horses  if they would put me to work on a river he said i should not mind here one has plenty to eat and the work is not hard and there is a warm room to sleep in but i should like to be employed in cutting timber and taking it in rafts down the river to the sea i love the river and i can shoot all the ostjaks can shoot though shooting has brought me bad luck if i had not had my bow in my hand when that russian struck me i should not be here now it was all done in a moment you see i was on the road when his sledge came along the snow was fresh and soft and i did not hear it coming the horses swerved nearly upsetting the sledge and knocking me down in the snow then i got up and swore at the driver and then the russian who was angry because the sledge had nearly been upset jumped out caught the whip from the driver and struck me across the face it hurt me badly for my face was cold i had been in the wood shooting squirrels and i hardly know how it was but i fitted an arrow to the string and shot it was all over in a moment and there he lay on the snow with the arrow through his throat i was so frightened that i did not even try to run away and was stupid enough to let the driver hold me till some people came up and carried me off to prison so you see my shooting did me harm but it was hard to be sent here for life for a thing like that he was a bad man that russian he was an officer in one of the regiments there and a soldier who was in prison with me afterwards told me that there was great joy among the soldiers when he was killed  but it was very wrong luka to kill a man like that  yes but then you see i hadnt time to think i was almost mad with pain and it was all done in a minute i think it is very hard that i should be punished as much as i am when there are many here who have killed five or six people or more and some of them women and they have no worse punishment than i have look at kobylin he was a bandit first of all as i have heard him say over and over again he beat his wife to death because she scolded him for being drunk then he took to the woods the first he killed was a jew pedlar then he burnt down the house of the headman of a village because he had put the police on his track he killed him as he rushed out from the door and his wife and children were burnt alive he killed four or five others on the road and when he was betrayed as he was asleep in the hut he cut down with an axe two of the policemen who came to arrest him he is in for life but he is a great deal worse than i am is he not  then there is that little koshkin the man who is always walking about smiling to himself he was a clerk to a notary and he murdered his master and mistress and two servant women and got away with the money and lived on it for a year then he went into another family and did the same but this time the police got on his track and caught him nine lives he took altogether not in a passion or because they were cruel to him i heard him say that he was quite a favourite and how he used to sing to them and was trusted in every way no i say it isnt fair that i who did nothing but just pay a man for a blow should get as much as those two  it does seem rather hard on you but you see there cannot be a great variety of punishments you killed a man and so you had sentence for life they cant give more than that and if they were to give less there would be more murders than there are for every one would think that they could kill at least one person without being punished very heavily for it  i dont call mine murder at all luka said i would not kill a man for his money but this was just a fight whiz went his whip across my face and then whiz went my arrow  oh it is not so bad luka i grant if you had killed a man in cold blood i would have had nothing to do with you i could not be friends with a man who was a coldblooded murderer i could never give him my hand or travel with him or sleep by his side i dont feel that with you in the eye of the law you committed a murder and the law does not ask why it was done or care in what way it was done the law only says you killed the man and the punishment for that is imprisonment for life but i as a man can see that there is a great difference in the moral guilt and that acting as you did in a fit of passion suddenly and without premeditation and smarting under an assault it was what we should in england call manslaughter before i asked you to teach me when osip first said that he should recommend me to try you i saw by the badge on your coat that you were in for murder and if it had not been that he knew how it came about i would not have had anything to do with you even if i had been obliged to give up altogether my idea of learning your language  the starosta continued a steady friend to godfrey the lad acted as a sort of deputy to him and helped him to keep the accounts of the money he spent for the convicts and the balance due to them and once did him real service as mikails office was due to the vote of the prisoners his authority over them was but slight and although he was supported by a considerable majority of them there were some who constantly opposed him and at times openly defied his authority had mikail reported their conduct they would have been severely punished but they knew he was very averse to getting any one into trouble and that he preferred to settle things for himself he was undoubtedly the most powerful man in the ward and even the roughest characters feared to provoke him singly  on one occasion however after he had knocked down a man who had refused to obey his orders six or seven of his fellow convicts sprung on him godfrey osip and three or four of the better class of convicts rushed to his assistance and for a few minutes there was a fierce fight the rest of the prisoners looking on at the struggle but taking no active part one way or the other the assailants were eventually overpowered and nothing might have been said about the matter had it not been that one of mikails party was seriously injured having an arm broken and being severely kicked mikail was therefore obliged to report the matter and the whole of the men concerned in the attack upon him received a severe flogging  i should look out for those fellows mikail godfrey said or they may injure you if they have a chance  mikail however scoffed at the idea of danger  they have got it pretty severely now he said and the colonel told them that if there was any more insubordination he would give them the plete and they have a good deal too much regard for their lives to risk that you wont hear any more of it they know well enough that i would not have reported them if i had not been obliged to do so owing to boulkins arm being broken therefore it isnt fair having any grudge against me they have been flogged before most of them and by the time the soreness has passed off they will have forgotten it  godfrey did not feel so sure of that and determined to keep his eye upon the men he did not think they would openly assault the starosta but at night one of them might do him an injury relying upon the difficulty of proving under such circumstances who had been the assailant  the solitary candle that burned in the ward at night was placed well out of reach and protected by a wire frame it could not therefore be extinguished but the light it gave was so faint that except when passing just under the beam from which it hung it would be impossible to identify any one even at armslength two of those concerned in the attack on mikail were the men of whom luka had been speaking kobylin the bandit muttered and scowled whenever the starosta came near him and there could be little doubt that had he met him outside the prison walls he would have shown him no mercy koshkin on the other hand appeared to cherish no enmity  i have done wrong mikail he said half an hour after he had had his flogging and i have been punished for it it was not your fault it was mine these things will happen you know and there is no need for malice and he went about the ward smiling and rubbing his hands as usual and occasionally singing softly to himself as godfrey knew how submissive the russians are under punishment he would have thought this perfectly natural had he not heard from luka the mans history that was how he thought to himself the scoundrel smiled upon the master and mistress he had resolved to murder of the two i think there is more to be feared from him than from that villain kobylin who has certainly been civil enough to me since i gave him that thrashing i will keep my eye on the little fellow  of necessity the ward became quiet very soon after night set in the men talked and smoked for a short time but in an hour after the candle was lit the ward was generally perfectly quiet godfrey working as he did indoors was far less inclined for sleep than either the men who had been working in the forest or those who had been listlessly passing the day in enforced idleness and he generally lay awake for a long time either thinking of home and schooldays or in meditating over his plans for escape as soon as spring arrived and he now determined to keep awake still longer they are almost all asleep by seven oclock he said to himself if any of those fellows intend to do any harm to mikail they will probably do it by ten or eleven there will be no motive in putting it off longer and indeed the ward is quieter then than it is later for some of them when they wake light a pipe and have a smoke and many do so early in the morning so as to have their smoke before going to work  five evenings passed without anything happening and godfrey began to think that he had been needlessly anxious and that mikail must understand the ways of his own people better than he did the sixth evening had also passed off quietly and when godfrey thought that it must be nearly twelve oclock he was about to pull his blanket up over his ear and settle himself for sleep when he suddenly caught sight of a stooping figure coming along it was passing under the candle when he caught sight of it he did not feel quite sure that his eyes had not deceived him for it was but a momentary glance he caught of a dark object an inch or two above the level of the feet of the sleepers  godfrey noiselessly pushed down his blanket gathered his feet up in readiness for a spring and grasped one of his shoes which as usual he had placed behind the clothesbag that served as his pillow several of the sleepers were snoring loudly and intently as he listened he heard no footfall in a few seconds however a dark figure arose against the wall at the foot of the bench it stood there immovable for half a minute and then leaned over mikail placing one hand on the wall as if to enable him to stretch as far over as possible without touching the sleeper godfrey waited no longer but brought the shoe down with all his force on the mans head and then threw himself upon him pinning him down for a moment upon the top of mikail the latter woke with a shout of surprise followed by a sharp cry of pain godfrey clung to the man who as with a great effort he rose dragged him from the bed and the two rolled on the ground together mikails shout had awakened the whole ward and a sudden din arose mikail leapt from the bench and as he did so fell over the struggling figures on the ground  get hold of his hands mikail godfrey shouted he has got a knife and i cant hold him  but in the dark it was some time before the starosta could make out the figures on the floor suddenly godfrey felt mikails hand on his throat  thats me he gasped the hand was removed and a moment later he felt the struggles of his adversary cease and there was a choking sound  that is right mikail but dont kill him he said  at this moment the door at the end of the ward opened and two of the guard ran in with lanterns they shouted orders to the convicts to keep their places on the benches  this way mikail called there has been attempted murder i believe  the guards came up with the lanterns  what has happened to him one of them said bending over the man who was lying insensible on the ground  he is short of wind mikail said that is all that ails him i had to choke him off  but what is it all about  i dont know myself mikail said i was asleep when i felt a thump as if a cow had fallen on me then i felt a sharp stab on the hip two of them one after the other then the weight was lifted suddenly off and i jumped up as i put my feet on the ground i tumbled over ivan here andwho is it hold the lantern close to his faceah koshkin what is it ivan are you hurt  he ran his knife pretty deep into my leg once or twice godfrey said i got his arms pinned down but i could not keep him from moving his hands if we had lain quiet he would have hurt me seriously i expect but we were both struggling so he only got a chance to give me a dig now and then  but what is it all about ivan for i dont quite understand yet mikail asked  i told you mikail that fellow would do you a mischief you laughed at me but i was quite sure that that smiling manner of his was all put on i have lain awake for the last five nights to watch and tonight i just caught sight of something crawling along at the edge of the bench he stood up at your feet and leant over as i thought then and i know now to stab you but i flung myself on him and you know the rest of it  well you have saved my life there is no mistake about that and mikail lifted and laid him on the bench now he said to the guards you had better take that fellow out and put him in the guard cell the cold air will bring him round as soon as you get him out of this room you had better hold him tight when he does for he is a slippery customer when you have locked him up will one of you go round to the doctors this young fellow is bleeding fast and i fancy i have lost a good deal of blood myself  as soon as the soldiers had left the ward carrying koshkin between them mikail called osip and luka here he said get the lads things down from under his iron belt and try and stop the bleeding till the doctor comes i feel a bit faint myself or i would ask no one else to do it  in ten minutes the doctor arrived godfrey had three cuts about halfway between the hip and the knee  they are of no consequence except for the bleeding the doctor said has anyone got a piece of cord  there is a piece in my bag mikail replied the doctor took it and made a rough tourniquet above the wounds then drew the edges together put in two stitches in each and then strapped them up then he attended to mikail you have had a narrow escape he said the knife has struck on your hip bone and made a nasty gash and there is another just below it if the first wound had been two inches higher there would have been nothing to do but to bury you  well this is a nice business mikail said when the doctor had left to think of that little villain being so treacherous you were right and i was wrong ivan though how you guessed he was up to mischief is more than i can imagine  well you know the fellows history mikail and that he had murdered nine people he had lived among and who trusted him what could one expect from a villain like that  oh i know he is a bad one mikail said but i did not think he dare take the risk  i dont suppose he thought there was much risk mikail if i had been asleep he would have stabbed you to the heart and when we found you dead in the morning who was to know what prisoner had done it  well it was a lucky thought my putting you next to me young fellow i meant it for your good not for my own and now you see it has saved my life  a kind action always gets its reward mikailalways sooner or later in your case it has been sooner you see now i shall go off to sleep for i feel as drowsy as if i had been up for the last three nights     chapter x  preparations for flight   the next morning godfrey and mikail were by the doctors orders carried to the hospital and placed in a comfortable and wellarranged ward you wont have to be here many days the doctor said when he came round the ward i only had you brought here because the air is sweeter and better than it is in that room you were in an hour later the governor with a clerk came in mikail was first called upon for his statement which was written down by the clerk  had you any reason for supposing that the man had any special enmity against you the governor asked  only because of that flogging he had for the row in the ward last week sir  ah yes he was one of those who attacked you then and was flogged that accounts for it  then godfrey gave his account of what had happened  did you observe anything that made you specially watchful the governor asked  i thought perhaps one of them might try to take revenge on mikail sir one or two of them were very sullen and surly and would i thought do him harm if they had the chance but i suspected this man more than the others because he seemed so unnaturally pleasant and as i had heard him boasting about the things for which he is here i thought he was more dangerous than those who grumbled and threatened  the governor nodded yes he is a thoroughpaced villain you have done very well young man and i shall not forget it  five days later there was a stir in front of the hospital and mikail whose bed was by the side of the window raised himself on his elbow and looked out  it is a punishment parade he said i expect they are going to flog koshkin with the plete no governor of a prison is allowed to do that until the circumstances of the case have been sent to the governor of the province and the sentence receives his approval that is no doubt what has caused the delay all the prisoners are mustering  godfrey who was in the next bed managed to draw himself on to mikails and then to sit up so as to look out the whole of the convicts of that prison some eight hundred in number were drawn up forming three sides of a square in front of them four paces apart were a line of soldiers with fixed bayonets while behind was another line then koshkin stripped to the waist was brought forward and bound to a thick board having an iron leg so that when laid down the board inclined to an angle of about thirty degrees on this he was so strapped as to be perfectly immovable then a man approached with the dreaded whip and took his place on one side of the criminal the governor then entered the square he was attended by all the prison officials his face was very grave and stern and he walked along the lines scrutinizing closely each man as he passed him then he took his place in the centre of the square and held up his hand  this man he said has attempted to murder the starosta of his ward and is for this sentenced to fifty lashes let this be a lesson to all here  then he signalled to the executioner who brought down his lash with great force upon the bare back of the prisoner a terrible cry broke from koshkin two more blows were given and then the executioner moved to the other side and delivered another three blows in this way the lashes crossed each other at an angle godfrey could look no more but crawled back on to his own bed mikail continued looking out until the punishment was over  he has not bled he said he will die  how do you mean mikail  well that is how it is ivan it is as the executioner likes or as he is ordered he can according to the way he strikes cut the flesh or not each stroke if it bleeds the man seldom dies if it doesnt there is little chance for him there are several ways of flogging the prisoner and his friends generally bribe the executioner then he strikes with all his strength the first blow that is terrible but it seems to numb the flesh somehow and afterwards he does not strike so hard and the prisoner hardly feels the blows the worst is when he hits softly at first and then harder and harder then the man feels every blow to the end but they are obliged to hit hard if not they get flogged themselves i saw a case where the executioner had been well bribed and therefore hit gently and the prisoner was taken down and he was tied up in his place and got twenty lashes years ago they used the plete at all the prisons now they only use it at three prisons where the worst criminals are sent and this is one of them  a week later they were both discharged from the hospital and returned to the ward the first thing they heard on entering it was that koshkin had died the night before godfrey went back to his work in the office he was doubtful how he should be received in the ward but he found that except by kobylin and four or five others he was welcomed quite cordially  you have done us all a service osip said there was sure to have been trouble sooner or later and that flogging will cow these fellows for some time this is only the second there has been since i came herei mean of course at this prison besides mikail is a good fellow and we all like him and everyone would have been sorry if he had been killed  what is he in for i never asked before of course i see that he has the murderers badge on his back do you know how it happened i never heard him speak of it  yes he told us about it one evening that was before he became starosta some vodka had been smuggled in and he had more than was good for him and that opened his lips he had been a charcoalburner and having had the good fortune to escape the conscription he married she was a pretty girl and it seems that the son of a rich proprietor had taken a fancy to her and when the next years conscription came he managed by some unfair means to get mikails name put down again on the list such things can be done you know by a man with influence mikail ran away and took to the woods he was hunted for two or three months in vain then someone betrayed him and one morning he woke up in a hut he had built for himself and saw the place was surrounded by soldiers  with the officers was the man who had injured him mikail was mad with fury and rushing out with a big club he had cut he stretched the fellow dead on the groundand served him right however of course mikail was taken tried and condemned he had killed a nobles son and three weeks later was on his way to siberia his wife has followed him and is living now in a village two miles away another six months and mikail will have served his ten years which is the least time a murderer can serve before he gets leave to live outside the prison he is sure to get it then his conduct has been always good and no doubt this affair will count in his favour his wife came out two years after he was sent here she keeps herself by spinning and helping at a farm it has been a good thing for mikail for it has kept him straight if it had not been for that he would have taken to the woods long ago  i dont call that a murder godfrey said indignantly if i had been on the jury i would never have convicted him he was treated illegally and had the right to resist  i dont blame him very much myself osip said of course it would have been wiser to have submitted and then to have tried to get off serving but i dont suppose anyone would have listened to him if it hadnt been a noble he killed i have no doubt he would have got off  but you are noble yourself osip  yes but that does not give me any marked advantage at present of course it will make a difference when i get out my friends will send me money and i shall live at tobolsk and marry some wealthy goldminers daughter and be in the best society oh yes it is an advantage being noble born even in siberia  godfrey was quite touched with the joy that luka manifested when on his return from work he found him in the ward ah my master he exclaimed with tears in his eyes why did you not tell me that you were watching i would have kept awake all night and would have thrown myself on that dog it would have made no matter if he had killed me it would not have hurt me so much as it did to see you bleeding  you must not call me master godfrey said holding out his hand which the tartar seized and pressed to his forehead you and i are friends there are no masters here  godfrey learnt that every effort had been made by the authorities to discover how koshkin had obtained the knife but without success he must have bribed one of the guards to fetch it in for him but there was no tracing which had been concerned in the matter all the prisoners had been searched and their bags examined but no other weapons had been discovered godfrey did not hear a single word of pity for koshkin or of regret at his death indifference for others was one of the leading characteristics of the prisoners although living so long together they seldom appeared to form a friendship of any kind each man lived for and thought only of his own lot godfrey observed that it was very seldom that a prisoner shared any dainty he had purchased with another and it was only when three or four had clubbed together to get in a ham a young sucking pig or some vodka that they were seen to partake of it together  some of the prisoners indeed scarcely ever exchanged a word with the rest but moved about in moody silence paying no attention to what was going on around them some again were always quarrelling and seemed to take a delight in stirring up others by giving them unpleasant nicknames or by turning them into ridicule  i am glad indeed mikail godfrey said as he lay down beside the starosta that night that you were not seriously hurt i only heard today that you had a wife waiting for you outside  yes it is true mikail replied i never talk of her i dare not even let myself think of her it seems too great a happiness to be true and something may occur one never knows ah ivan if it had not been for you what news would have been taken to her think of it after her long journey out here after waiting ten years for me to hear that it was useless i tremble like a leaf when i think of it that night i lay awake all night and cried like a young child not for myself you know but for her she has taken a cottage already and is furnishing it with her savings she is allowed to write to me you know once every month at first it was every three months what happiness it was to me when my first five years was up and she could write once a month do you think i shall know her she will have changed much i tell myself that always and ii have changed much too but she will know me i am sure she will know me i tremble now at the thought of our meeting ivan but i ought not to talk so i ought not to speak to you of my happinessyou who have no friend waiting to see you  i like to hear you talk of your wife mikail my friends are a long way off indeed but i hope that i shall see them before very long  you think that you may be pardoned mikail asked  no i mean to escape  ah lad mikail said kindly i dont suppose there is ever a prisoner comes here who does not say to himself i will escape every spring there are thousands who take to the woods and scarce one of these but hopes never to see the inside of a prison again and yet they come back every one of them  but there have been escapes mikail therefore there is nothing impossible in it  there are twenty thousand convicts cross the frontier every year lad there is not one man makes his escape in five years  well i mean to be the man this five years mikail  i would not try if i were you were you in on a life sentence for murder or still worse as a political prisoner i would say try if you like for you would have nothing to lose but you have a good prospect now i am sure you must have been a political but now that you have been a wanderer you are so no longer you have won the governors goodwill and as soon as your time is up perhaps before you will be allowed to live outside the prison if you go away in the spring you will when you return as winter comes on forfeit all this and have to begin again when you come out there will be my little hut ready for you and such a welcome from my wife and me that you will forget how small and rough it is and there you will live with us till your five years are up and you can go anywhere you like in siberia  i thank you sincerely mikail and i should i am sure be as happy as an exile could be with you and your faithful wife but if i have to try afresh every year for twenty years i will break out and strive to escape you know that i am english by my mothers side i can tell you now that i am altogether english and i will gain england or die at any rate if it is to be done i will do it i have health and strength and determination i have learnt all that there is to be learnt as to the difficulties of the journey i have more to gain more to strive for than other prisoners even if they escape they cannot return home they must still be exiled from russia must earn their bread among strangers as they are earning it here i have a home awaiting mea father mother and sistersto whom i shall come back as one from the grave why man the difficulties are nothing in comparison to the reward a journey across asia is as nothing to the journeys many of my countrymen have made across africa here there is no fear of fever of savage tribes or savage beasts it is in comparison a mere pleasure excursion i may not succeed next time just as i did not succeed last year but succeed in the end i will  i believe you mikail said earnestly infected by godfreys enthusiasm did you not overthrow as if he were a babe kobylin whom everyone else feared yes if anyone can do it you can  at last the long winter was over the thaw came and the work at the mine was renewed godfrey was afraid that he might be still kept in the office and he spoke to mikail on the subject the latter spoke to one of the officials and told him that the prisoner ivan holstoff petitioned that he might be again put to work on the mine instead of being kept in the office as he felt his health suffering from the confinement two days later godfrey was called into the governors room  i hear that you have asked to go to the mine again lad  yes sir i like active work better than sitting indoors all day  the colonel looked at him keenly you are doing well here lad it will be a pity to have to begin over again i can guess what is in your thoughts think it over lad dont do anything rash but if and he hesitated if you are headstrong and foolish remember you will be better off here than elsewhere and that i am never very hard on runaways that will do you will go out again with the gang tomorrow  thank you sir godfrey said earnestly and with a bow returned to his work at the desk in the next room  on the following day work at the mine was resumed godfrey at once began his preparations for his flight and as a first step managed to conceal under a lump of rock a heavy hammer and a pick used in the work he had already laid in a stock of a dozen boxes of matches the next evening he said to mikail when they had lain down for the night  now mikail i want you to help me  so you really mean to go  yes my mind is quite made up i want you to get me in some things from outside  i will get you anything if you will tell me what you want  i want most of all two long knives  yes knives are useful mikail said but they are awkward things to get i dare not ask any of the people who trade here to get such a thing ah i know what i will do i am losing my head i will steal you two from the kitchen but that must be done the last thing for if knives were missed there would be a great search for them what is the next thing  i should like a coil of thirty or forty yards of fine rope and some string they are always useful things to have  that is so the convict assented  then i shall want some thread and needles  there is no difficulty about that i can buy them for you at the gate i dont know what excuse to make to get you the rope but i will think of something  i dont think there is anything else except that i should like these twenty roubles changed into kopecks  the man nodded when will you try  tomorrow it is dark now by the time we leave off work it will be easy to slip away then luka is going with me  that is good mikail said he will be very useful he is a good little fellow and will be faithful to you you had best keep steadily west and give yourself up at irkutsk it is a rough road working round by the north of lake baikal but you had better take that way it is safer than by the south but no doubt if you are careful you might go that way too then the summer after if you can get away again you can give up at tomsk once fairly away from here there is no fear of your being overtaken they never take the trouble to hunt the woods far they know it is of no use remember as long as you dont go too far from the road you will light upon cottages and little farmhouses where you can get something to eat but if you go too far into the woods you may starve there will be no berries except strawberries yet and strawberries are not much use to keep life together when you are travelling  oh by the by there is one more thing i want you to get for me if possible and that is fishhooks and line  that is difficult mikail said however a rouble or two will go a long way but you must put off your start for another two or three days the rope and the hooks will need time to get  it was indeed the fourth evening before mikail told godfrey that he had got everything except the knives i will manage to get these in the morning he said when i go into the kitchen and see about breakfast if i were you i would put on those two spare shirts over the one you wear and take your three spare pairs of stockings of course you will wind the rope round your waist i suppose you will buy bread from the others there are always plenty ready to sell you had better take enough for two or three days cut it in slices put them inside your upper shirt with the other things you take your belt will keep them safe dont try to slip away unless you see a really good opportunity it is no use being shot at besides with those irons on your legs they would soon overtake you better put it off for another time than to run any risk  godfrey at once informed luka that they were to try to escape on the following evening told him to put on his spare shirts at night gave him the matches and told him to stow away in the morning as much bread as he could carry the young tartar made no reply beyond a pleasant nod his confidence in his companion was unbounded the next morning while eating their breakfasts by the dim light of a candle mikail passed close to godfrey and slipped two long knives into his hand these he hid instantly inside his shirt  i have got the bread mikail said it was better for me to buy it than you i have put it under your bag  as it was quite dark in the corner of the room godfrey had no difficulty in cutting up the hunks of bread and concealing them without observation mikail strolled up while he was so engaged godfrey had already given him money for the various purchases and he now pressed a hundredrouble note into his hand and said  now mikail you must take this from me it is not a present to you but to your brave wife when you get out you will want to do your share towards making the house she has got for you comfortable till you get your free ticket you will still be working in the mines like the others and though you will get the same pay as free labourers then it will be some time before you can lay much by when your term is over you will want to take up a piece of land and farm and you must have money for this until your crops grow  i will not take it the man said huskily it is a hundred roubles i would not rob you you will want every kopeck you have the money would be a curse to me  i have five hundred still left mikail which will be ample for me you will grieve me if you refuse to take it it will be pleasant to me whether i am taken again or whether i escape to think that i have made one home happier for my stay here and that you and your brave wife in your comfortable home think sometimes of the young fellow you were kind to  if you wish it i will take it mikail said feodora and i will pray before the ikon to the saints morning and night to protect you wherever you may be  pray for me as godfrey bullen mikail that is my real name i am english and it is to england i shall make my way  godfrey bullen the man repeated four or five times over i shall not forget it feodora and i will teach it to our children if the good god should send us any  i should like to let you know if i get safely home godfrey said how can i write to you  i can receive letters when i am out of prison mikail said you know my name mikail stomoff put karoff that is the name of the village my wife lives atkaroff near kara if the letter does not come until my term is over and i have left i will leave word there where it can be forwarded to me  i hope that you will get it long before that mikail the journey is too long to do in one summer i shall winter somewhere in the north and i hope to be in england by the following autumn therefore if i have got safely away you may look for a letter before the christmas after next if it does not come by that time you will know that i have failed in my first attempt and then you will i hope get one a year later i shall of course be careful what i say in case it should be opened and read there will be nothing in it about your knowing that i intended to escape  we shall look for it godfrey bullen we shall look for it always and pray the good god to send it to us  the next morning when godfrey rose he wrung mikails hand warmly  god bless you the starosta said with tears in his eyes i shall not come near you again they would see that something was strange with me and when you were missing would guess that i knew you were going may all the saints preserve you  before they formed up to march to their work godfrey shook hands with his friend osip i am going to try on our way back tonight he said  goodbye and good luck to you osip replied i would go with you if i was in for life but i have lost two years already by running away and i dare not try again  during the day godfrey observed very carefully the spot where he had hidden the tools so that he might be able to find it in the dark piling three small stones one on the top of the other by the roadside at the point nearest to it when work was over he managed to fall in with luka at the rear of the line a cossack marched alongside of him  five roubles godfrey whispered if you will let us drop behind  five roubles was a large sum to the soldier the life of the guards was really harder than that of the prisoners except that they did no work for they had to mount guard at night when the convicts slept and their rations were much more scanty than those given to the working convicts and they were accustomed to eke out their scanty pay by taking small bribes for winking at various infractions of the prison rules the cossack at once held out his hand godfrey slipped five rouble notes into it they kept on till they reached a wood where beneath the shadow of the trees it was already perfectly dark  the cossack had stepped forward two or three paces and was walking by the next couple  now luka godfrey said and the two sprang off the path among the trees they waited two or three minutes then returned to the road and hurried back to the mine they had been the last party to start for the prison and the place was quite deserted it took them fully half an hour to find the tools the rings round their ankles were sufficiently loose to enable the pick to be inserted between them and the leg thrusting it in as far as it would go under the rivet it was comparatively easy work to break off the head with the hammer in ten minutes both were free leaving the chains and tools behind them they made their way out of the cutting and struck across the country and in an hour entered the forest it was too dark here to permit them to proceed farther they lay down and slept until day began to break and then continued their way up the rising ground until after four hours walking they were well among the mountains they found an open space by the side of a rivulet where the wild strawberries grew thickly and here they sat down and enjoyed a hearty meal of bread and strawberries  now we have got to keep along on this side of that range of mountains in front of us till we get to lake baikal godfrey said we will push on for a day or two and then we must find some cottages and get rid of these clothes what we want above all things luka are guns  yes or bows and arrows luka said  it would be as difficult to get them as guns they dont use them in these parts luka  i can make them luka said not as good as the ostjaks bows but good enough to kill with  that is satisfactory luka if i can get hold of a gun and you can make a bow and arrows we shall do very well  for four days they continued their journey through the forest gathering much fruit chiefly strawberries and raspberries and eating sparingly of their bread at night they lit fires for the evenings were still cold and slept soundly beside them on the fifth morning godfrey said we must turn south now luka our bread wont last more than two days at the outside and we must lay in a fresh supply we have kept as near west as we could and we know by the mountains that we cannot be far wrong still it may take us some time to find a village to godfreys satisfaction they arrived at the edge of the forest early in the afternoon  we cannot be very far from nertchinsk he said we must be careful here for there are lots of mines in the neighbourhood  after walking for another three or four hours several large buildings were seen among the trees in the valley and these it was certain belonged to one or other of the mines when it became dark they descended still farther and kept down until they came upon a road this they followed until about midnight they came upon a small village they found as they had hoped bread and other provisions upon several of the windowsills and thankfully stowing these away again struck off to the hills  this is capital godfrey said as after getting well into the forest they lighted a fire threw themselves down beside it and made a hearty meal if we could rely upon doing as well as this always i should not mind how long our journey lasted it is glorious to be out in these woods after that close prison  the tartar nodded the closeness of the air in the prison never troubled him but he was quite ready to agree to anything that godfrey might say good in summer he said but not very good in winter  no i expect not but we shall have to make the best of it luka for it is quite certain that we shall have to spend the winter out somewhere  we will make skin coats and keep ourselves warm luka said confidently make a good hut  yes that part of the thing seems simple enough godfrey agreed the difficulty will be in feeding ourselves but we need not bother about that now well we had better go off to sleep luka we have been tramping fully eighteen hours and i feel as tired as a dog  in a few minutes they were fast asleep but they were on their feet again at daybreak and journeyed steadily for the next three days always keeping near the edge of the forest on the fourth day they saw a small farmhouse lying not far from the edge of the wood  here is the place that we have been looking for for the last week godfrey said this is where we must manage to get clothes the question is how many men are there there not above two or three i should say but anyhow we must risk it  they waited until they saw lights in the cottage and guessed that the family had all returned from their work  now then luka come along you must look fierce you know and try to frighten them a bit but mind if they refuse and show fight we must go away without hurting them  luka looked up in surprise why that he asked you could beat that pig kobylin as if he were a child why not beat them and make them give  because i am not going to turn robber luka i know some of the runaways do turn robbers and murder peasants and travellers you know some of the men in the prison boasted of what they had done but that is not our way we are honest men though we have been shut up in prison i am willing to pay for what i want as long as i have money after that we shall see about it if these people wont sell we shall find others that will  they went quietly up to the house lifted the latch and walked in holding their long knives in their hands two men were seated at table three women and several children were near the fire there was a general exclamation of alarm as the two convicts entered  do not fear godfrey said loudly we do not wish to rob anyone we are not bandits we are ready to pay for what we require but that we must have  the men were both convicts who had long since served out their time what do you want one of them asked  we want clothes you need not be afraid of selling them to us if we were captured tomorrow which we dont mean to be we will swear to you that we will not say where we obtained them we are ready to pay the full value why should you not make an honest deal instead of forcing us to take life  we will sell them to you one of the men said after speaking a few words in a low tone to the other and then rising to his feet  sit down godfrey said sternly we want no tricks tell the women to fetch in the clothes  the man seeing that godfrey was determined abandoned his intention of seizing a club and making a fight for it and told one of the women to fetch some clothes down she returned in a minute or two with a large bundle  pick out two suits luka one for you and one for me luka was making a careful choice when godfrey said dont pick out the best luka i dont want sunday clothes but just strong serviceable suits they will be none the worse for a patch or two now he said to the men name a fair price for those clothes and i will pay you  the peasants had not in the slightest degree believed that the convicts were going to pay them and their faces lighted up they hesitated as to the price  come i will give you ten roubles i am sure that is more than they are worth to you now  very well the man said i am contented  godfrey placed a tenrouble note upon the table now he said we want a couple of hats two fairly good ones were brought down  is there nothing else the man asked ready enough to sell now that he saw that he was to be paid fair prices  we want some meat and bread ten pounds of each if you have got it  we have a pig we salted down the other day the man said we have no breadwe are going to bake tomorrow morning but you can have ten pounds of flour  that will do we want a small fryingpan a kettle and two tin mugs have you got any tea in the house  i have got about a pound  we will take it all we cant bother ourselves about sugar luka we must do without that every pound tells we have brought plenty of tobacco with us to last some time have you got a gun he asked the man suddenly  yes he said we have got two the wolves are troublesome sometimes in winter fetch the guns elizabeth  the guns were brought down one was a doublebarrel of german make the other a long singlebarrel how much do you want for this he asked taking up the former  i dont use it much the man said one will be enough for me i will take fifty roubles  no no godfrey said you value your goods too high money is not as plentiful with me as all that i cant go higher than twenty roubles and he laid the gun down again  i will take thirty the man said  after a good deal of bargaining godfrey obtained the gun a flask of powder and a bag of bullets and shot for twentyfive roubles then he paid for the other goods he had purchased luka made them into a bundle and lifted them all on to his shoulder then saying goodbye to the peasants they again started for the forest  we are set up now luka  yes indeed the tartar replied we could journey anywhere now we want but two or three blankets and some furs and we could travel to moscow  yes if we had one more thing luka  what is that  passports  yes we should want those but i daresay we could do without them  they enjoyed their suppers greatly that night frying some pork and then some doughcakes in the fat and washing it down with numerous cups of tea  the next thing will be for you to make a bow and arrows luka i did not buy the other gun for two reasons in the first place because we could not afford it and in the second because you said you liked a bow best  luka nodded i never shot with a gun he said a bow is just as good and makes no noise  that is true enough luka well i shall be a good deal more comfortable when we leave those convict clothes behind us of course we shall be just as liable to be seized and shut up as vagabonds when we cannot produce papers as if we were in our convict suits but there is something disgusting in being dressed up in clothing that tells every one you are a murderer or a robber and to know there is that patch between ones shoulders  luka was quite indifferent to any sentimental considerations still he admitted that it was an advantage to get rid of the convict garb in the morning they put on the peasants clothes as godfrey was about the same size as the man whose garments he had got the things fitted him fairly lukas were a good deal too large for him but as the russian peasants clothes always fit them loosely this mattered little the other things were divided into two bundles of equal weight  luka would willingly have carried the whole pointing out that godfrey had the gun and ammunition but the latter said  if you take the fryingpan and kettle and the two tin mugs that will make matters even luka  the two convict suits were left at the foot of the tree where they had slept godfrey first thought of throwing them on to the fire but changed his mind saying  some poor beggar whose clothes are worn out may come upon them and be glad of them some time during the summer we may just as well let them lie here now luka we must walk in good earnest we ought to be able to make fiveandthirty miles a day over a tolerably level country and at that rate we shall be a long way off before winter  the forests abounded with squirrels although luka assured him that they were excellent eating godfrey could not bring himself to shoot at the pretty creatures it would be a waste of powder and shot luka he said we have plenty of meat to go on with at present when it is gone it will be time enough to begin to think of shooting game besides there are numbers of mines about this country and the sound of a gun might bring out the cossacks     chapter xi  afloat   it was a pleasant journey through the forest with its thick and varied foliage that afforded a shade from the suns rays with patches of open ground here and there bright with flowers godfrey had enjoyed it at first but he enjoyed it still more after he had got rid of the convict badge he had now no fear of meeting anyone in the woods except charcoalburners or woodmen or escaped convicts like themselves by such they would not be suspected of being aught but what they seemedtwo peasants unless indeed a hat should fall off the first night after leaving the prison godfrey had done his best to obliterate the convict brand by singeing it off as he had done before  each day the air grew warmer and they could pick as they walked any quantity of raspberries and whortleberries luka always filled the kettle at each streamlet they came to as they could never tell how long they would be before they arrived at another and the supply rendered them independent and enabled them to camp whenever they took a fancy to a spot they walked steadily from sunrise to sunset and as they went at a good pace godfrey was sure that they were doing fully the thirtyfive miles a day he had calculated on although sundays had not been observed at the prison and the work went on those days as on others godfrey had not lost count and knew that it was on a monday evening that they had broken out and each sunday was used as a day of rest  we are travelling at a good pace luka he said and thirtyfive miles a day six days a week is quite enough so on sundays we will always choose a good camping ground by a stream wash our clothes and rest  they had little trouble about provisions at lonely houses they could always obtain them and there they were received very hospitably the peasants often refusing absolutely to accept money or at any rate giving freely of all the articles they themselves raised and taking pay only for tea and sugar which they themselves had to purchase when no such places could be met with they went down to villages at night and never failed to find bread and cakes on the windowsills though it was not often that meat was there for the peasants themselves obtained it but seldom godfrey had no fear of his money running short for a long time the six hundred roubles with which he arrived at kara had been increased by his earnings during the nine months he had been there he had spent but a few kopecks a week for tea and tobacco and his pay while he had been a clerk was a good deal larger than while he had been working in the mine luka too had saved every kopeck he had received from the day when godfrey told him that he would take him with him when he ran away he had even given up smoking and was with difficulty persuaded by godfrey to take some tobacco occasionally from him between them in the nine months they had laid by nearly a hundred roubles and had therefore after deducting the money given by godfrey to mikail and that paid for the gun and clothes over five hundred roubles for their journey  they were glad indeed when at last they saw the broad sheet of lake baikal they had for some time been bearing to the north of west and struck the lake some twenty miles from its head there were a good many small settlements round the lake a good deal of fishing being carried on upon it although the work was dangerous for terrible storms frequently swept down from the northern mountains and sent the boats flying into port the lake is one of the deepest in the world soundings in many places being over five thousand feet many rivers run into the lake the only outflow being by the angara baikal is peculiar as being the only freshwater lake in the world where seals are found about two thousand being killed annually the shores are in most places extremely steep precipices rising a thousand feet sheer up from the edge of the water with soundings of a hundred and fifty fathoms a few yards from their feet fish abound in the lake and sturgeon of large size are captured there  godfrey knew that there were guardhouses with cossacks on the road between the northern point of water and the steep mountains that rise almost directly from it he had specially studied the geography of this region and knew that after passing round the head of the lake there was a track across the hills by which they would after travelling a hundred and fifty miles strike the main road from irkutsk to yakutsk near the town of kirensk on the river lena from kirensk it would be but little more than a hundred miles to the nearest point on the angara which is one of the principal branches of the yenesei  to gain this river would be a great point the lena which was even nearer to the head of lake baikal also flowed into the arctic sea but its course was almost due north and it would be absolutely hopeless to endeavour to traverse the whole of the north coast of siberia the angara and the yenesei on the other hand flowed northwest and fell into the arctic sea near the western boundary of siberia and when they reached that point they would be but a short distance from russia it seemed to him that the only chance was by keeping by a river in the great ranges of mountains in the north of siberia there would be no means of obtaining food and to cross such a district would be certain death by the rivers on the other hand there would at least be no fear of losing their way the journey could be shortened by using a canoe if they could obtain one and if not a raft they would often find little native villages or huts by the banks and would be able to obtain fish from them besides they could themselves catch fish and might possibly even winter in some native village for all these reasons he had determined on making for the angara  buying a stock of dried fish at a little fishing village on the lake they walked to within a mile of its head there they slept for the night and started an hour before daybreak passed the cossack guardhouse unseen just as the daylight was stealing over the sky and then went along merrily  the road was not much used the great stream of traffic passing across lake baikal but was in fair condition and they made good progress along it long before that luka had after several attempts made a bow to his satisfaction it was formed of three or four strips of tough wood firmly bound together with waxed twine they having procured the string and the wax at a farmhouse on the way there was one advantage in taking this unfrequented route the road between irkutsk and tomsk was as godfrey had learned on his outward journey frequented by bands of brigands who had no hesitation in killing as well as plundering wayfarers here they were only likely to fall in with convicts who had escaped from irkutsk or from convoys along the road and were for the most part perfectly harmless seeking only to spend a summer holiday in freedom and knowing that when winter came on they would have to surrender themselves  of such men godfrey had no fear his gun and his companions bow and arrows rendered them too formidable to be meddled with and until they came down upon the main road there was no chance of their meeting police officers or cossacks no villages were passed on the journey and godfrey therefore had no longer any hesitation in shooting the squirrels that frisked about among the trees he found them as luka had said excellent eating although it required three or four of them to furnish anything like a meal he soon however gave over shooting for he found that luka was at least as certain with his bow as he was with the gun with the advantage that the blunt arrow did not spoil the skins these as luka told him were valuable and they would be able to exchange them for food the siberian squirrel furnishing a highlyprized fur  each day luka brought down at least a dozen of these little creatures and these with their dried fish and cakes made of flour afforded them excellent food on their way after four days walking across a lofty plateau they descended into a cultivated valley and before them rose the cupolas of kirensk while along the valley flowed the lena as yet but a small river although it would become a mighty flood before it reached the sea nearly four thousand miles away it would have to be crossed at kirensk and they sat down and held a long council as to how they had best get through the town they agreed that it must be done at night for in the daytime they certainly would have to produce passports  there will not be much chance of meeting a cossack or a policeman at one or two oclock in the morning luka and if there were any about we ought to be able to get past them in the dark  if one stops us i can settle him luka said tapping his knife  no no luka we wont have any bloodshed if we can help it though i do not mean to be taken if a fellow should stop us and ask any questions and try to arrest us i will knock him down and then we will make a bolt for it there is no moon now and it will be dark as pitch so that if we kick out his lantern he would be unable to follow us if he does you let fly one of your blunted arrows at him that will hit him quite hard enough though it wont do him any serious damage of course if there are several of them we must fight in earnest but it is very unlikely we shall meet with even two men together at that time of night  accordingly they went in among some trees and lay down and did not move until they heard the church bells of the distant town strike twelve then they resumed their journey keeping with difficulty along the road once in the valley it became broader and better kept at last they approached the bridge godfrey had had some fear that there might be a sentry posted here and was pleased to find it entirely deserted  we will take off our shoes here luka tie them with a piece of string and hang them round our necks we shall go noiselessly through the town then while if we go clattering along in those heavy shoes every policeman there may be in the streets will be on the lookout to see who we are  they passed however through the town without meeting either policeman or soldier the streets were absolutely deserted and the whole population seemed to be asleep once through the town they put on their shoes again followed the road for a short distance and then lay down under some trees to wait for daylight now that they were in the country they had no fear of being asked for passports and it was not until the sun was well up that they continued their journey four miles farther they came upon a village and went boldly into a small shop and purchased flour tea and such articles as they required just as they came out the village policeman came along  where do you come from he asked  i dont ask you where you come from godfrey replied we are quiet men and hunters we pay for what we get and harm no one who does not interfere with us see we have skins for sale if there is anyone in the village who will buy them  the man at the spiritshop at the end of the village will buy them the policeman said he gives a rouble a dozen for them  thank you and with a russian salutation they walked on  of course he suspects what we are godfrey said to his companion but there was no fear of his being too inquisitive the authorities do not really care to arrest the wanderers during the summer months as they know they will get them all when winter comes on besides in these villages all the people sympathize with us and as we are armed and not likely to be taken without a fight it is not probable that one man would care to venture his life in such a matter  on arrival at the spiritshop they went in  the policeman tells us you buy skins at a rouble for a dozen we have ten dozen  are they good and uninjured the man asked  they are there is not a hole in any of them  the man looked them through carefully  i will buy them he said do you want money or will you take some of it in vodka  we want money we do not drink in summer when we are hunting  the man handed over ten rouble notes and they passed out a minute later the policeman strolled in  wanderers he said with a wink the vodka seller shrugged his shoulders  i did not ask them he said they came to me with a good recommendation for they told me that you had sent them here so after that it was not for me to question them  i told them you bought skins the policeman said they seemed wellspoken fellows the one with the bow was a tartar or an ostjak i should say he may have been a yakute but i dont think so however it matters little to me if there was anything wrong they ought to have questioned them at kirensk they have got soldiers there why should i interfere with civil people especially when one has a gun and the other arrows  that was just my opinion the other said well here is a glass of vodka and i will take one with you they are good skins all shot with a blunt arrow  godfrey and his companion now took matters easily there was no motive for hurrying and they devoted themselves seriously to the chase  we must have skins for the winter luka said i can dress and sew them the squirrels are plentiful here and if we set snares we may catch some foxes we shall want some to make a complete suit with caps for each of us and skins to form bags for sleeping in but these last we can buy on the way the hunters in summer bring vast quantities of skins down to the rivers to be taken up to krasnoiarsk by steamer and you can get elk skins for a rouble or two which will do for sleeping bags but they are too thick for clothing unless they are very well prepared at any rate we will get as many squirrel skins as we can both for clothes and to exchange for commoner skins and high boots  it was three weeks after they had left kirensk before they struck the angara near karanchinskoe they had traversed a distance as the crow flies of some eight hundred miles since leaving kara but by the route they had travelled it was at least half as far again and they had been little over ten weeks on the journey luka had assured godfrey that they would have no difficulty in obtaining a boat  everywhere there are fishing people on the rivers he said there are tungusesthey are all over siberia there are the ostjaks on all the rivers there are my own people but they are more to the south near minusinsk and from there to kasan and seldom come far north in summer everyone fishes or hunts i could make you a boat with two or three skins of bullocks or horses or elk it only needs these and a framework of wood but we can buy one for three or four roubles a good one we want one strong and large and light for the river is terribly swift there are places where it runs nearly as fast as a horse can gallop  certainly we will get a goodsized one luka if the river runs so swiftly we shall have no paddling to do and therefore it will not matter at all about her being fast besides we shall want to carry a good load we will not land oftener than we can help and can sleep on board and it will be much more comfortable to have a boat that one can move about in without being afraid of capsizing her whatever it costs let us get a good boat  we will get one luka said confidently we shall find ostjaks huts all along the banks and at any of these if they have not a boat that will suit us they will make us one in two or three days  avoiding the town and passing through the villages at night they kept along down the river bank for four days the river was as wide as the thames at greenwich with a very rapid current they saw in some of the quiet reaches fishingboats at work some with nets others with lines and at night saw them spearing salmon and sturgeon by torchlight across the river they made out several of the yourts or summer tents of the ostjaks but it was not until the fourth day that they came upon a group of seven or eight of these tents on the river bank the men were all away fishing but the women came out to look at the strangers as luka spoke their dialect he had no difficulty in opening the conversation with them he told them that he and his companion wanted to go down the river to yeneseisk and wished to buy a boat a good one  the women said that some of the men would be in that evening and that the matter could be arranged  they will be glad to sell us a boat luka said to godfrey they are very poor the ostjaks they have nothing but their tents their boats and their clothes they live on the fish they catch but fish are so plentiful they can scarce get anything for them so they are very glad when they can sell anything for money  the ostjak men arrived just before it became dark they wore high flattopped fur caps a dress something like a long loose blouse and trousers of fine leather tucked into boots that came up to the knee most of them had bows and arrows in addition to their fishing gear godfrey felt no uneasiness among these men as he would have done among the buriats in the east for they were now at a distance from any convict settlements and these people would know nothing about the rewards offered to the natives in the neighbourhood of the mines for the arrest of prisoners a present of some tobacco of which godfrey had laid in a large stock put the ostjaks into an excellent temper fish were broiling over the fire when they returned and the two travellers joined them at their meal after this was over and pipes lighted the subject of the boat was discussed the ostjaks were perfectly ready to trade they said they would sell any of their six boats for three roubles and that if they did not think any of these large enough they would build them a larger one in three days for six roubles  godfrey had exchanged twenty roubles for kopecks at the first village they had passed after reaching the river as he knew that notes would be of no use among the native tribes and without bargaining he accepted the offer they made after passing the night stretched by the fire they went down with the men in the morning to inspect the boats they were larger than he had expected to find them as the fishing population often shift their quarters by the river and travel in boats taking their family tent and implements with them  what do you think luka  they are large enough luka said but they are not in very good condition i should say that farthest one would do very well but let us have a look at the state of the skins  the boat was hauled ashore and carefully examined three or four of the skins were found to be old and rotten the rest had evidently been renewed from time to time  we will take this if you will put in four good skins luka said to the owner  it will be six roubles if we put in fresh skins the ostjak said we will put in good skins and grease all the boat and then it will be the same as new the other skins were all new last year  no luka said you said you would build a whole boat larger than this for six roubles  the men talked together we will do it for five roubles they said at last and luka at once agreed to the terms  there was no time lost the ostjaks ordered the women to set about it at once and leaving the matter in their hands went off to their fishing godfrey asked them to take him with them leaving luka to see to the repairs of the boat the fishing implements were of the roughest kind the hooks were formed of fish bones bound together by fine gut the lines were twisted strips of skin strong gut attaching the hook to these lines the bait was small pieces of fat varied by strips of fish with the skin on them clumsy as the appliances were jack tench and other fish were caught in considerable numbers and among them two or three goodsized salmon the nets were of coarse mesh made of hemp which grows wild in many parts of siberia they were some ten feet in depth and some twenty yards long the upper ends were supported by floats made of bladders and the whole anchored across the stream by ropes at the extremities fastened to heavy stones in these nets a considerable quantity of fish were taken the fishing was over early for there had been a good supply taken on the previous day and as at this time of year they would not keep it was useless obtaining more  when they reached shore the common sorts of fish were thrown to the dogs a dozen of the best picked out and with these two of the men started at once for the nearest village where they would be sold for a few kopecks the rest were handed over to the women while the men proceeded to throw themselves down by the fire and smoke godfrey went to see how the women were getting on with the boat they had already made a great deal of progress the skins which had been chosen by luka from a pile in the hut were already prepared by having fat rubbed into them the hair was left on them as that would come inside the bad skins had been taken off the others cut to fit and now only required sewing into their places as a matter of course godfrey and luka took their meals with the ostjaks and greatly enjoyed the change of diet they gladdened the hearts of their hosts by producing a packet of tea of which a handful was poured into a pot of water boiling over the fire the liquor was drunk with delight by the ostjak men and women but godfrey could not touch it for some of the fish had already been boiled in the water which the ostjaks had not thought it necessary to change  at night he went out again with them in the boats for a short time to see them spear salmon a man holding a large torch made of strips of resinous wood stood in the bow of the boat and on either side of him stood an ostjak holding a long barbed spear in a short time there were swirls on the surface of the river these increased till the water round the boat seemed to boil the ostjaks were soon at work and in half an hour twenty fine salmon were lying in the bottom of the boat and then having caught as much as there was any chance of selling the natives they returned to their yourts the next morning the work on the boat was resumed and as all the women assisted it was finished in a very short time then melted fat was poured into the seams and the whole boat vigorously rubbed with the same by twelve oclock it was finished then there was a little fresh bargaining for two salmon spears a supply of torches half a dozen common fox skins and three large hides for stretching over the boat at night some of the lines and fishhooks were also bought and a few fish for present consumption then godfrey and luka took their places in the boat and bidding farewell to the ostjaks paddled out into stream  the boat was some twenty feet long and six feet wide in the centre it was almost flatbottomed and drew but two or three inches of water a flat stone had been placed on a layer of clay in the bottom and they had taken with them a bundle of firewood godfrey was in the highest spirits it was true that the real dangers of the journey had not yet begun but so far everything had gone very much better than he had anticipated he had not thought there would be any chance of recapture for he knew that unless they came into the towns the russians took no trouble about the escaped convicts all the convicts with whom he had spoken had agreed that there was little trouble in sustaining life in the forests during summer for that even if they could not obtain food from the peasants they had only to carry off a sheep at night from the folds  that is why the peasants are so ready to give one said i dont say that they are not sorry for us but the real reason is they know that if they did not give we should take and instead of being harmless wanderers as they call us we should be driven to become bandits  still godfrey had anticipated much greater difficulties than they had met with in fact up to the present time it had been simply a delightful tramp through the woods the next part of the journey would he expected be no less pleasant they had a large and comfortable boat well adapted for the navigation of the river there would be no difficulty as to food for fish could be obtained in any quantities and grain was he had heard from some of the tartar prisoners who knew that portion of the yenesei abundant and extraordinarily cheap  he seated himself in the stern of the boat with a paddle there was no occasion to steer for it mattered in no way whether the boat drove down the river bow or stern first but at present it was an amusement to keep her straight with an occasional stroke with the paddle luka sat on the floorboards at the bottom of the boat and set himself to work to manufacture from the squirrels skins two fur caps of the same pattern as those worn by the ostjaks godfrey had asked him to do so in order that they might be taken for members of that tribe by anyone looking at them from the villages on the banks as to the dress it did not signify as many of the more settled ostjaks had adopted the russian costume godfrey intended to fish as they drifted along but they had at present at least as much fish on board as they could consume while it was good luka as he worked sang a lugubrious native ditty while with his knife he trimmed the skins into shape having done this he proceeded to sew them together with great skill  why you are quite a tailor luka godfrey remarked  every one sews with us luka replied the women do most but in winter the boys help and sometimes the men to make rugs and robes of the skins of the beasts we have taken in the summer what do you say shall i leave these tails hanging down all round except just in front they often wear them so in winter  but it is not winter now luka  no it is not winter but you see the ostjaks and most of the russians wear their hair long quite down to the neck our hair is growing but at present it will only just lie down flat if i leave on these black tails round the caps at a little distance it will look like hair then if you like i can make two summer caps to put on when we land to buy anything  very well luka i think the idea is a good one the people do wear their hair long and our close crops might excite attention this is better than golddigging at kara isnt it  luka nodded no good for man always to work he said good to lie quiet sometimes  i dont know that i care about lying quiet generally luka but it is pleasant to do so in a boat i am keeping a lookout for wildfowl it would make a pleasant change to fish diet  not so far south as this the yenesei swarms with them in winter but in summer they go north just before the frost begins you can shoot as many as you like  that will be something to look forward to when does the weather begin to get cold and dry  where i lived the nights began to get cold at the end of september but we shall be far down the yenesei by that time and it will begin early in the month  we shall be a long way down godfrey said if we keep on at this pace we must be going past the banks eight or nine versts an hour  that is nothing it will be more than twice that some times the angara between the lake and irkutsk runs fifteen versts when i was taken east we saw barges each towed upstream by twenty horses and it took them sometimes four days sometimes six to make fortyfive versts  as they went along they passed several fishingboats but as they were keeping in the middle of the stream while the boats lay in the slacker water near the shore there was no conversation twice the ostjaks shouted to know where they were going but luka only replied by pointing down the stream the journey was singularly uneventful at night they lit a torch for a short time and generally speared sufficient fish for the next day but if not they cut a strip or two from the back of one they had caught baited three or four hooks and dropped them overboard and never failed in a short time to fill up their larder sometimes they grilled the fish over the fire sometimes fried them sometimes cut them up in pieces that would go into the kettle and boiled them occasionally when evening approached they paddled to the shore near a village and luka whose tartar face was in keeping with his dress went boldly in and purchased tobacco tea and flour and a large block of salt occasionally bringing off a joint of meat for which the price was only four kopecks or about a penny a pound five kopecks being worth about three halfpence according to the rate of exchange a hundred kopecks go to the rouble the silver rouble being worth from two and tenpence to three shillings and twopence the paper rouble about two shillings  at first godfrey had steered half the night and luka the other half but after the second night they gave this up as a waste of labour as the boat generally drifted along near the middle of the river and even had it floated inshore no harm would have been done the fox skins made them a soft bed and they spread a couple of the large skins over the boat and were perfectly warm and comfortable godfrey thought that on an average they did a hundred and twenty miles a day on the eighth day the river which had been widening gradually flowed into another and greater stream the yenesei hitherto they had been travelling almost due west but the yenesei ran north as they floated down they had had much conversation as to their plans it was now nearly the end of august and it would not be long before winter was upon them another month and the yenesei would be frozen and they would be obliged to winter the question was where should they do so    illustration spearing fish by torchlight  now they were on the yenesei luka was on his native river though his home was fully a thousand miles higher up godfrey had at first proposed that he should disembark here and make his way up the banks home but the offer filled luka with indignation  what are you going to do without me he asked you can talk a little tartar quite enough to get on among my people but how could you get on with the ostjaks besides even if i were to leave you and i would rather die than do that i could not go to my home for in my native village i should be at once arrested and sent back to the mines i might live among other tartars but what good would that be they would be strangers to me why should i leave you who have been more than a brother to me to go among strangers no wherever you go i shall go with you and when you get to your own land i shall be your servant you can beat me if you like but i will not leave you did you not for my sake strike down the man in the prison did you not take me with you and have you not brought me hither what could i have done alone if you are tired of me shoot me but as long as i live i will not leave you  godfrey hastened to assure luka that he had only spoken for his good that he was well aware that without him he should have little chance of getting through the winter and that nothing therefore was farther from his thoughts than to separate himself from him if he was willing to remain it was some time before luka was pacified but when he at last saw that godfrey had no intention whatever of leaving him behind if he were willing to go with him he recovered his spirits and entered into the discussion as to where they had better winter he had never been below the town of yeneseisk but he knew that the ostjaks were to be found fully a thousand miles below that town especially on the left bank of the river but below that and all along the right bank the tunguses and yuraks were the principal tribes it was finally agreed that they should keep on for at least eight hundred miles beyond yeneseisk and then haul up their boat and camp at some ostjak village and there remain through the winter  we will get at yeneseisk whatever you think the ostjak will prize mostknives and beads for the women and some cheap trinkets and lookingglasses some small hatchets too would probably be valued  yes luka said ostjaks have told me that their kindred far down the river were more like the people to the extreme north by the sea they are pagans there and not like us to the south they have reindeer which draw their sledges they are very poor and know nothing from them we can get furs but we can buy goatskins and sheepskins at yeneseisk  we shall have to depend upon them for food godfrey said  why we can get food for ourselves luka said somewhat indignantly when the cold begins before the river freezes we shall get great quantities of fish they will freeze hard and last till spring then too the river will be covered with birds we shall shoot as many as we can of these and freeze them too flour we must take with us but flour is very cheap at yeneseisk corn will not grow there but they bring it down in great boats from the upper river  but how do they get the boats back luka  they do not get them back they break them up for firewood firewood is dear at yeneseisk and they get much more for the barges for fires than it cost to build them in the forests higher up  then how do they do for fires among the ostjaks  i have heard they do not have wood fires they kill seals there are numbers of them farther down the river and from their fat they make oil for lamps and burn these we shall be in no hurry as we go down we will float near the banks and may kill some seals what are you thinking of for godfrey was looking rather serious  i was thinking luka that these things we are thinking of buying the things to trade with the ostjaks you know and the flour and tea and goatskins and so on will take a good deal of money we dont spend much now but when we get into russia we shall want money we cant beg our way right across the country  no luka said but we shall not be idle all the winter  how do you mean we shall not be idle luka  we must hunt that is what the ostjaks and tunguses do we must get skins of beaver sable ermine and black foxes and we must sell them at turukhansk there are russian traders there they do not live there in the winter but come down in the spring to buy the skins that have been taken in the winter  that sounds more cheerful godfrey said you had better get another flask of powder and some more bullets and shot for me luka and some better arrowheads for yourself  yes we shall want them more than anything we can do without flour but we cannot do without weapons  well you must do the buying luka they will take you for an ostjak from some village up the river who has come in to lay in his stock of provisions for the winter it is of no use my trying to pass here as a native though in russia i might be taken as a russian     chapter xii  winter   a few hours after entering the yenesei they saw on the right bank of the river which was now of great width the domes of the town they ran in to the shore a mile above it  i shall not land luka godfrey said i dont want to be questioned i shall put off and drop our anchor a quarter of a mile out and fish you must make two or three journeys if necessary  the things will not be heavy godfrey the flour is the only thing that will weigh much i will get someone to help me down with that  they had already gone over and over again the list of purchases to be made  i shall drop down a little nearer the town luka when i think it is about time for you to be coming back so you wont have so far to carry the things dont be more than three hours whether you have got anything or not or i shall begin to feel anxious about you  luka nodded and went off godfrey paddled the boat out a short distance let down the stone and began to fish he was under no real uneasiness as to the young tartar there was nothing about him to distinguish him from other natives and as these would be about this time arriving in considerable numbers at yeneseisk to sell the skins of the animals they had taken in the chase during the summer and to lay in stores for the winter it was unlikely in the extreme that anyone would even question him such indeed was the case there were numbers of natives in the stores of the russian traders and he made his purchases without any question whatever being asked he bought rather more hatchets knives and trinkets than they had agreed upon and two sacks of flour although he deemed the latter to be a luxury that they could very well dispense with altogether godfrey was just thinking of taking up his anchor and going down towards the town when he saw him returning accompanied by two natives carrying the sacks he pulled up his anchor and paddled to shore have you got everything luka he asked  everythingpowder shot and balls tea salt ten knives and eight axes beads four goatskins lookingglasses tobacco and flour and one by one he handed the articles as he named them into the boat  how much flour is there luka  two hundred pounds i have got more trinkets than we said they were very cheap they look like gold and silver and only cost ten kopecks apiece i have also brought two bottles of vodka  that is bad luka  the two only cost a rouble luka said calmly they may be very useful to us and i bought more tea and tobacco than we said  the men who had carried the flour had received a few kopecks for their trouble and had gone off as soon as they had laid down their burdens directly the things were handed into the boat luka stepped in and they pushed off into the stream  i have bought plenty of arrowheads and two steel spear heads and shafts  i wondered what those short poles were  they are of tough wood and the right length ten feet long they are good for sealhunting and for bears  well i think you have done capitally luka you have made the money go a long way i suppose you have spent the hundred roubles you took with you  i have four left i think i have done very well we have everything we shall want through the winter  well we are fairly off for the north now godfrey said in high spirits that everything was settled and that for eight months at least there would not be the slightest risk of meeting with a russian policeman or soldier hurrah for the north luka and for shooting and adventures  luka smiled it was rarely he laughed but he was always ready to smile when godfrey addressed him  the air feels brisk and cold today we shall soon have winter upon us  yes look there luka said pointing into the air ahead of them  what is it it looks like a long black streak  geese luka said it is a flight of wild geese from the north  as it approached godfrey saw that the tartar was right a solitary bird led the way two followed him closely then came rank after rank widening out till it was a broad band of fully fifty abreast line after line they followed in almost military array and extending in length fully a quarter of a mile  why there must be thirty or forty thousand of them there he exclaimed in amazement  you will see bigger flocks than that luka said why all the river from minusinsk down to turukhansk more than 2000 miles is wellnigh covered with birds we shall have no lack of meat presently  during the day many flights similar to those first seen passed overhead some larger some containing only a score or two birds the next day the numbers were still larger whole battalions coming along almost incessantly these were by no means confined to geese there were gulls and swans flocks of small birds of many kinds flights of wild ducksthe latter for the most part flying much lower than the geese which kept far overhead  we had better land tonight luka said they fly close after dark and the flocks will settle on the banks we will shoot them as they come overhead you may not see them well but they are so thick that you can hardly miss them  accordingly when evening came on they landed fastened the boat took a couple of sheepskins each to throw over their shoulders for even in these two days the cold had sensibly increased and lay down to await the coming of the birds all day long the air had been full of their cries but it had grown quieter now though occasionally they heard a sharp cry of the leader of a flock followed by a responsive note from the birds following him from time to time godfrey could hear the whirring sound of a multitude of wings as the flocks passed overhead these became louder as the time went on and he knew that they were flying lower he had loaded his gun with heavy shot and once or twice was disposed to fire but luka each time stopped him they are much too high yet they will come close down presently the stars were shining brightly and godfrey could make out the outlines of the geese as they passed overhead presently there was a sharp call a few hundred yards higher up the bank  this lot are coming low luka whispered they are probably going to settle to feed get ready now  godfrey lay with his gun pointed upwards a minute later he heard the rustling of wings which rose to a sound like a mighty wind and then some forty yards overhead a dark cloud of birds swept along across the sky godfrey fired one barrel waited a moment and then fired again with a loud cry of surprise and alarm the flock divided in two and almost instantly there were several heavy thuds on the ground close by  hurrah we have got some of them godfrey said and leaping up they ran to collect the fallen birds there were five of them that is grand he exclaimed in delight  will you shoot some more luka asked  no we have as many as we can eat luka for the next three days at least it would be a waste of powder and shot to kill more and worse still it would be a waste of life it is right to kill what we require as food but to my mind there is nothing more wicked than taking life merely for amusement i consider that we should well deserve any misfortune that might happen to us if we were to kill any one of gods creatures wantonly one of our best poets has written      he prayeth best who loveth best       all things both great and small     for the dear god who loveth us       he made and loveth all  it makes me furious sometimes luka when i read books of what is called sport and find men boasting of killing numerous creatures merely for the pleasure of killing them i feel that nothing would give me greater pleasure than to flog such brutes  luka did not much understand this outburst of indignation but as usual he grunted an assent and carrying the birds they returned to the boat  it is freezing tonight the tartar said as they stepped in i will lay the geese in the bow beyond the cover they will be frozen by the morning  godfrey was glad of the wrapping of warm furs that night and even when he shook them off and looked out at sunrise it was still so chilly that after he had leaned over the side of the boat as usual and sluiced his head with water he was glad to take a paddle and work hard for a bit to keep himself warm  get the fire alight luka and the kettle on he said and cut up one of those geese how are you going to get the feathers off i suppose you will have to pluck them and singe them  it would take much too long that we can spare the feathers this time  so saying with his knife he made a slight incision down the breastbone and then proceeded to tear off the skin bit by bit feathers and all  that is a quick way godfrey said though it doesnt improve the birds appearance but that is a trifle never mind the bread we shall have to do without that before long and i feel as hungry as a hunter  in a very few minutes the fire was blazing and portions of the goose frizzling over it and in twenty minutes the meal was ready godfrey thought he had never eaten anything nicer and the meat being much less rich than that of tame geese he did very well without bread for the next three days they made no pause floating down night and day the stream varying in speed from five to ten miles an hour at points where the stream was most rapid they paddled in towards the bank to avoid the waves raised by the river in its course the light boat always floated easily over these but she needed to be kept with her head to them and godfrey was afraid that a moments carelessness might bring her broadside on to them and therefore preferred to glide along at a somewhat slower rate near the shore  the river was now a mile and a half wide to the left the country was flat but on the right they could see hills rising far above each other one or two small trading stations were seen on the right bank but upon the left they passed only a few clusters of ostjak yourts on the right great pine forests came down in places to within a short distance of the river but these were rarely seen on the left on the fifth day after leaving yeneseisk they saw a small trading station on the right bank this godfrey who had got the geography of the river by heart judged to be peslovska because it was one of the few trading stations which was not situated at a point where a tributary stream ran into the yenesei  we are far enough down now luka he said we are not more than two hundred miles from turukhansk we will land at the next ostjak huts we come to and see if they are disposed to be friendly with us  they will be friendly luka said confidently why not they are peaceable people and they know that did they touch strangers they would be punished there are russian soldiers at turukhansk the ostjaks are very poor you have things to give them and you want nothing of them  twenty miles further they saw a group of seven huts on the left bank ahead of them and paddling in landed close to them three or four canoes much smaller than their own lay there and as they climbed the lofty bank some of the ostjaks came out from their huts  what do you want one of them asked abruptly  i am travelling with this gentleman who has come from a far distant country to hunt and to shoot game here in winter we would like to live beside your village and to hunt with you you see he has a gun he has many things as presents and it will be well for the village where he settles here is some tobacco for all and luka handed a small roll of tobacco to each of the men we have also some presents for the women and he produced two or three lookingglasses and some rows of large blue and red beads the women who were listening in the huts at once came out  it is good an old man who seemed to be the leader of the ostjaks said why should not the stranger live here with us and hunt with us if he chooses he will be welcome let us help the strangers  the whole of the ostjaks at once set to work godfrey chose a piece of level ground twenty or thirty yards lower down than the huts he and luka aided by some of the men carried the various articles out of the boat while they were doing this the women stuck some poles in the ground round the circle godfrey had traced and lashed them together in the middle with some strips of hide the three large skins were placed against this on the northern side then the women paused  you had better buy some more large skins if they have got them luka say that you will give a knife for hides enough to finish the huts with  the knives were large ones with rough handles and strong blades and when luka took one out from a bundle and said to the chief we will give this knife for enough skins to finish the hut he gave an order to his wife and she and two of the other women at once brought some elk hides from a pile lying by the side of his tent a few stitches here and there with the needle made of a sharp fishbone with a thread of twisted gut fastened the corners of the hides together and in half an hour the tent was complete the goatskins were spread on the ground the fox and other skins were made into two piles one on each side of the tent and all the goods stored inside  this is splendid godfrey said here we are as snug as if we were born ostjaks i had no idea they would have made us so comfortable we will give them a cup of tea all round luka as a reward for their labours we dont care for sugar but the two pounds you bought at yeneseisk will come in useful now they will think a lot more of it if it is sweet see if they have got a big kettle that little thing of ours will only hold a couple of quarts  upon inquiry the chief produced a cauldron which he exhibited with great pride it had evidently been used for melting down blubber luka carried it down to the waters edge and then scrubbed it with sand until it was tolerably clean then he rubbed it with wisps of coarse grass filled it with water and stood it on a fire that the ostjaks had made from driftwood picked up from the shore in half an hour the water boiled he put in two or three handfuls of tea and half a pound of sugar let it boil for another minute or two and then took the pot off the fire then he invited the ostjaks to dip in their cups in each of the huts they had a few tin mugs for the expense and risk of carriage of crockery rendered the prices prohibitive and even the tin mugs were prized as among their most precious possessions luka and godfrey also dipped in their cups as an act of civility but the latter made a wry face when it approached his lips for the odour of the blubber was very strong and he took an opportunity when none of the ostjaks were looking to pour the contents of the tin upon the ground beside him but to the ostjaks the smell and flavour of blubber was no drawback and men and women sat round the fire drinking the sweet liquor with great enjoyment and evidently highly contented at the coming of this stranger among them  while they were partaking of it godfrey heard a sound behind and looking round saw a boy driving in several reindeer he was delighted at the sight not only because it promised hunting expeditions but because they might aid to carry them across the frozen steppes to the obi before the frost broke up talking with the ostjaks luka found that as the temperature had been below freezingpoint all day they intended to commence fishing in earnest the next morning the position of the huts had been specially selected for that purpose the river made a sharp bend just above them and the point threw the current across to the opposite bank forming almost a backwater at the spot where the huts stood it seemed strange to godfrey as he lay down that night to be without the gentle motion of the boat to which he had been so long accustomed and he lay awake for some time not forgetting before he went to sleep to thank god for the wonderful success that had so far attended him and to pray for a continuance of his protection  as soon as it was light the boats all put off and anchoring a short distance out were soon engaged in fishing godfrey put down four lines each with six of the hooks mikail had purchased for him before starting from kara these were baited with strips of fish and he and luka were soon busy at work hauling in the fish they were mostly jack or tench and by the evening they had caught nearly a hundred when they rowed to shore they found that they had been far more successful than any of the ostjaks this being due to the superiority of their hooks over the fishbone contrivances of the natives following the example of the ostjaks they laid the fish in lines in front of their tent to freeze during the night  after boiling their kettle frying a couple of fish and taking supper they lighted two torches and again went out returning before midnight with twentyfive salmon averaging fifteen pounds each by the morning the fish were all frozen as hard as pieces of wood and were then laid in a pile for four days this work continued with equal success and by the end of that time they had a pile of fish six feet square and three feet high making godfrey calculated nearly a ton of fish they had observed that some of the ostjaks had each morning brought in several wild geese and swans and luka learnt from them that there was a large marsh a mile away in which large flights of geese settled every night accompanied by two of the ostjaks they started late in the evening for the spot when they came near the marsh they could hear a low chattering noise as the birds fed on the aquatic grasses sometimes they heard cries in the air answered by calls from the feeding birds and followed speedily by a great rustling of wings as fresh flocks alighted  godfrey and luka had brought with them some foxskins and sat wrapped up in them but in spite of that they felt the cold as they waited hour after hour godfrey dozed off several times and at last slept for three or four hours he was awakened by a touch from luka and a low warning to keep silence the morning was breaking he found that the ostjaks had built a sort of shelter of bushes which had the effect of breaking the force of the north wind and of hiding them from the waterfowl raising his head cautiously he saw before him a sheet of shallow water this was absolutely covered with geese a few swans being seen here and there luka had warned him not to fire until the ostjaks had shot all their arrows as the sound of his gun would at once scare the whole flock the edge of the water was about forty yards away the ostjaks and luka had both made holes through the bushes in front of them so as to be able to shoot without exposing their heads moving gently godfrey found a spot where he could see through the boughs the natives were just ready to shoot there were three swans close to the edge of the water and the bows twanged almost together  although he knew how marvellous was the shooting of the ostjaks he was nevertheless surprised at seeing that each of the birds was struck in the head and was thus killed instantly without the slightest noise being made  again and again they shot and each arrow brought down its bird lukas third arrow was less successful it wounded a bird on the neck and with loud cries of pain and alarm it flew flapping across the pool in an instant the whole mass of birds rose on the wing circling round and round with loud cries the natives lying on their backs shot arrow after arrow into the air in each case transfixing a goose each had twelve arrows and when they were exhausted luka said now godfrey you can fire  godfrey waited until a number of birds flew in a mass over him and then discharged both barrels five geese fell and then the whole vast flock flew away to the north leaving the lagoon entirely deserted save by the floating bodies of their dead companions  arrow better than gun luka said as he rose gun kill but frighten all away arrow keep on killing  that is true enough luka there is no doubt the bow is the best for this sort of work but i shall manage better another time  the birds were picked up twelve had fallen to each of the ostjaks luka had eleven and godfrey five it was a heavy burden to carry back to the huts godfrey and lukas shares of the birds were laid by the pile of fish with the exception of one which luka proceeded to skin and hang up while godfrey saw to the fire and put on the kettle  when they had finished breakfast godfrey said we will take three or four hours sleep now luka and then i am going down to have a look at that marsh they accordingly started at midday godfrey made a detour round the lagoon and a hundred yards beyond it on the opposite side found a clump of bushes that he thought would suit his purpose with lukas assistance he cleared a spot in the middle large enough for them to lie down on and then returned to camp they took their next meal early and then taking some furs to make themselves comfortable again started round the lagoon it was just sunset when they got there and spreading two or three foxskins on the ground and throwing two over their shoulders they waited  it was scarcely dusk when the first flock of geese passed close over their heads on their way to the lagoon luka discharged two arrows and then godfrey fired his two barrels into them several fell but the flock scattered with wild screams but after circling round and round for some time settled in the lagoon a quarter of an hour passed and then another flock came along all night the flocks continued to arrive at short intervals and from each godfrey brought down several lukas arrows were soon exhausted but godfrey continued firing until morning began to break then they got up to see the result of the nights shooting luka although seldom excited gave a shout of pleasure the ground around them was thickly strewn with geese many were only wounded but luka with a short heavy stick soon put them out of their pain although not without several sharp chases then they collected and counted the birds there were eightyfour in all  another nights shooting luka and our larder will be full  each taking up six geese which was as much as they could carry they returned to the tents and then set out again accompanied by all the boys and girls of the village and this time the whole of the geese were carried to the hut  it is an awful pity godfrey said as he looked at the great pile that we havent got anything we could use for holding the feathers well we will have them picked anyhow we can make a thick layer of them under the skins for the present when it gets downright cold we can nestle in among them somehow  accordingly the children were set to work to pluck the birds which were then left out to freeze in the same way as the fish that night and the next day they rested and then had another nights shooting the amount of success was as great as that which had attended the first  we have plenty now to last us well on into the spring godfrey said as he looked at the great pile what is to be done next luka  pour water over them and the fish and let them freeze  do they keep better that way luka  yes not get so dry  the ostjaks had been astounded at the success of their visitors both in fishing and shooting godfrey now had a conversation with their chief and offered to shoot a supply of geese for the natives if they would furnish him and his companion with a complete outfit of furs for the winter this the chief at once agreed to as they had a large supply of foxes skins in camp and these with the exception of the rarer sorts were practically worthless for the purpose of exchange  godfrey made the chief another offer to give him a hatchet two knives and six fishhooks if he would supply them with as much seals flesh as they might require during the winter and with blubber for lamps the ostjaks had already killed a good many seals but the pursuit of them required time and patience and godfrey wanted to ensure a supply for the winter although luka told him they would have plenty of opportunities of getting seals then accordingly for the next ten days the shooting was continued at night godfrey and luka sleeping during the day and leaving it to the young ostjaks to collect and bring in the birds  the cold daily increased and godfrey began to feel much the want of warmer clothing however on the eighth day the ostjaks brought in two suits they were the joint work of the women of the village as the ostjaks were greatly pleased at the quantity of food coming in daily which ensured them a sufficiency of meat throughout the winter in addition to their own stock of fish the work was well done for each a closelyfitting shirt had been made of the squirrel skins they had brought down with them with the fur inside the trousers were of red foxskin with the hair outside the upper garment was a long capote of the same fur reaching down to the ankles and furnished with a hood covering the head and face with the exception of an opening from the eyes down to the mouth in addition to these was given to each as a present a pair of ostjak boots these were large and loose they were made of goatskins rendered perfectly supple by grease and rubbing and with the hair inside they came up to the thighs and had a thick sole made of layers of elkhide there was also for each a pair of socks of squirrels skin with the hair inside and a pair of fingerless gloves of double skin the fur being both inside and out except in the palm which was of single skin with the fur inside  well if it is cold enough to require all that godfrey said it will be cold indeed but it will be awful walking about with it surely one can never want all those furs  but in time godfrey found that they were none too many for at turukhansk the thermometer in winter sometimes sinks to 60 degrees below zero for a time however he found no occasion to use the capote the fur shirt trousers and boots being amply sufficient while the fur cap with the hanging tails kept his neck and ears perfectly warm already the ice was thick on the still reach of the river beside which the huts stood although beyond the shelter of the point the yenesei still swept along the lagoon had been frozen over for some days in spite of the water being kept almost perpetually in motion by the flocks of waterfowl and the ground was as hard as iron the ostjaks were now for some days employed in patching up their huts and preparing them to withstand the cold of winter  an immense pile of firewood had been collected on the shore for boughs of trees and driftwood brought down by the river often came into the backwater and these were always drawn ashore however busied the men might be at the time in fishing all through the summer every scrap of wood that came within reach had been landed and the result was a great pile that would they calculated with the blubber they had stored be sufficient to last them through the winter  what will they do if fuel should run short godfrey asked luka  they will cross the frozen river with their sledges to the forests they would either take their huts down and establish themselves there or would cut wood fill their sledges and bring it over i have been talking to them on the other side there are many russian villages for the postroad is on that side in summer the carriages are drawn by horses in winter they have reindeer these people are very poor the skins that they make their clothes with are all poor the animals were torn by the dogs or injuredthat is why they could not sell them those red foxskins would have been worth two roubles each if they had been good but the merchants will give nothing for those that are injured they say it does not pay for the carriage so they were glad to make them up for us  what do they do with the reindeer  they milk them in summer and in winter they let them to the owners of the poststations of course when they move they use them themselves  what we want luka godfrey said after sitting quiet for some time is more money if we had that we might hire sledges and reindeer as soon as the snow gets on the ground and travel west but of course there is no tempting these poor people to make such a journey without money to pay them well  they will go hunting presently luka said you might get some good furs and sell them  yes but i dont see why i should no doubt many of the russian peasants in the villages have guns and if they dont get skins why should i  a great many skins come down every year the tartar said black fox is worth money fifteen twenty roubles ermine is worth money lots of them in the woods  well we must hope for the best if we can but get enough for them to take us across to the obi we ought to be able to coast round in a canoe to archangel but i dont think we could do it from this river in one season the ice does not break up till june and begins to form again in october we can only rely upon three open months i doubt whether we could get in that time from the yenesei however it is of no use our bothering ourselves about that now  another fortnight and the frost was so severe that the ice extended almost across the river and a heavy fall of snow covered everything as soon as it was deep enough godfrey and luka followed the example of the ostjaks and raised a high wall of it encircling the tent to keep off the bitter north wind then the weather changed again the wind set in from the south and drenching rains fell at the end of two or three days the ice on the river had disappeared but it was not long before winter set in more bitterly than before the ground became covered with the snow to a depth of upwards of three feet and the river froze right across the wall round the tent was rebuilt godfrey fashioning wooden shovels from some planks he found among the driftwood the ostjaks took to their snowshoes and godfrey fashioned for himself and luka two pairs of runners such as he had seen in use near st petersburg  these were about five feet long by as many inches wide and slightly turned up at each end a strap was nailed across under which the foot went the ends were turned up by damping the wood and holding it over the fire a string being fastened tightly from end to end so as to keep the wood bent when they were completed they practised with them steadily and found that as soon as the surface of the snow hardened they could get along upon them at a good pace on level ground completely distancing the ostjaks on their broader snowshoes the ostjaks evidently admired them greatly but were too much wedded to their own customs to adopt them  godfrey was so warmly clad that he felt the cold but little his eyes however suffered from the glare of the snow and he at once adopted spectacles which were made for him by the ostjaks they were the shape of goggles and made of skin with the hair on narrow slits being cut in them these slits being partly covered with the hair and so shielding the eyes from the glare of the snow they were fastened on by leathern straps tied at the back of the head the ostjaks themselves seldom wore them but they were used by samoyedes a kindred tribe dwelling generally farther north though many of them at times came down even as far as yeneseisk  early in november the ostjaks prepared for a hunting expedition the men since they were confined to their huts by the snow had been busy in manufacturing traps of various kinds and getting the sledges into order on a large sledge which was to be drawn by three reindeer was placed the skins necessary for forming a tent on these were piled a store of provisions which were chopped out from the frozen masses by hatchets on the smaller sledges were placed the traps and a quantity of the coarser kinds of frozen fish as food for the dogs it had been settled that godfrey and luka should accompany them they had contributed liberally from their store of geese and fish and added to the load on the reindeer sledge their kettle fryingpan and a parcel of tea and tobacco when all was ready the three reindeer were harnessed to the large sledge one to each of the three small sledges and soon after daybreak on the 5th of november they started the ostjaks being anxious to be off for the weather again showed signs of breaking and it might be another month before the river was permanently frozen for the winter six ostjaks including the chief formed with godfrey and luka the hunting party the others remained behind to look after the rest of the reindeer as it was necessary to keep a space clear from snow to enable them to get at the grass they would too continue the fishing keeping holes broken in the ice and catching fish by torchlight the men walked with the sledges which only went at a walking pace  across the river the route was easy the surface of the snow being crisp and hard but it was hard work mounting the opposite bank which was exceedingly steep the reindeer pulled well and at difficult points the men aided them a short distance from the bank they crossed the postroad and in another halfhour were in the forest  godfrey had already been told that they would travel for several days before they began to hunt as the villagers with their guns scared the wild animals from the forests in their neighbourhoods there was no difficulty in travelling through the forest for the pinetrees stood generally at some distance apart and there was but little growth of underwood all day they kept steadily on when evening came they cut some young poles erected their tent and lit a fire in the centre by this time godfrey had become accustomed to the smoke which escaped from the top of the tent by a hole  a couple of geese were cut up and broiled over the flame and some cakes baked in the fryingpan their pipes were lighted and they lay down in a circle with their feet to the fire for three more days the journey was continued then as several tracks had been seen in the snow they halted and prepared for the hunt the method was simple the men scattered in several directions and when they struck upon a recent track followed it up each man took with him a dog a certain amount of provisions a box of matches from godfreys store and a large skin to wrap himself in at night sometimes as godfrey found the track had to be followed a long distance before they came up to the animal which always travelled in zigzag courses hunting about for white mice and other prey sometimes it was found to have taken to a hole and then a trap was set to catch it when it came out the animals were principally ermine but one or two sable which are considerably larger with much more valuable skins and some martens were taken all belong to the weasel family the upper part of the ermine being brown in summer but like most animals in or near the arctic zone changing into a pure white in winter with the exception of the tail which remains black as in summer the ermine is but little larger than the english ferret while the sable and marten are the size of large polecats when the ostjaks came up with them they either knocked them on the head with a club or shot them through the head they were then carefully skinned the bodies being thrown to the dogs for food  it had been agreed that the animals caught should be divided but godfrey felt that he was doing but little for he was unable to shoot them as this would have damaged their skins however he aided in tracking them down and in setting traps when he traced them to a hole and once or twice he came up with and killed one with a club occasionally he shot a squirrelthe little animals coming out from their nests in holes in the trees at the sound of footsteps their curiosity costing them dear after remaining four days at this spot the tent was pulled down and packed up and they advanced another two days journey into the forest     chapter xiii  hunting   at the end of a fortnight one of the ostjaks started with the large sledge for the huts taking with him all the skins that had been collected these had mounted up to a considerable number the ostjaks considering their luck to have been extraordinary and putting it down in a great degree to their white companion for whom they began to have an almost superstitious respect since the way he had supplied their village with food for the winter seemed to them almost miraculous the reindeer with the light sledge would accomplish the return journey in two days with ease although the distance had taken them five days on their way out it was to return with a fresh supply of provisions especially for the dogs the night after the sledge had left the dogs barked fiercely for some time they slept in the tent some of the ostjaks made pillows of them others allowed them to lie upon them and they helped to keep the tent warm the din when they began barking was prodigious  what is it all about godfrey shouted in lukas ear  i think it must be a bear luka shouted back  why dont they let the dogs out  they would drive the bears away and it is too dark to see to shoot them in the morning they will follow their track  the dogs presently ceased barking and with low growls lay down again as soon as it was light the ostjaks turned out and found great footmarks round the tent before starting from the huts godfrey had exchanged the heads of their fishingspears for the iron spearheads they had purchased loading his gun with ball godfrey with luka and four of the ostjaks started in pursuit taking six of the dogs and a sledge with them on his long runners he would soon have left the ostjaks behind but luka translated their warning that they must all keep together for as there were two bears it would be dangerous to attack them in lesser numbers  in about an hour they arrived at a dense thicket and it was evident that this was the lair of the bears until they took up their permanent winter quarters in a hollow tree the dogs were urged to attack them but could not be persuaded to enter far confining themselves to barking fiercely how are we going to get at them godfrey asked  the ostjaks consulted together and then they collected some dry pine needles and twigs and two of them went to the windward side of the thicket and made a fire upon which as soon as it was fairly alight they threw some dead leaves mixed with snow  if they were to light the bushes themselves it would drive them out quicker than that smoke godfrey said  not good not good luka said earnestly once catch fire big flame run through forest burn miles and miles  i did not think of that godfrey said that would be a foolish trick  however the smoke had the desired effect and in a minute or two two bears burst out on the other side growling angrily the dogs rushed at them barking loudly but taking care to keep at a safe distance from their paws the bears both raised themselves on their haunches the ostjak bows twanged and godfrey fired one of the bears rolled over the other charged at his assailants godfrey fired his second barrel then dropping his gun and grasping his spear stood ready to meet the charge but the bear did not reach him for as it rose on its hindlegs the ostjaks and luka again shot their arrows and the bear rolled over dead the two animals were placed on the sledge the reindeer harnessed and the ostjaks taking ropes to aid it with its heavy burden they returned to the tent  they had scarcely reached it when one of the other hunters returned with news that they had come upon the track of an elk the bears were at once dragged into the tent the entrance securely fastened to prevent a passing wolf or ounce from tearing them then taking with them this time all the dogs and the three sledges they started and in half an hour came to where the chief and his remaining followers were awaiting them  they came along here yesterday afternoon the chief said to luka there is one big stag and one young one and three females  after three hours walking they came to a spot where the snow was much trampled and there were marks of animals having lain down  that is where they slept the chief said they are travelling south but they will probably stop to feed before they have gone far we may catch them then he ordered one of the men to stop with the sledges and the rest proceeded onwards    illustration godfrey brings down an elk  not a word was spoken now and as they went they took the greatest pains not to brush against any branch or twig  the ostjaks were now walking their fastest and godfrey had to exert himself to keep up with them their footfall was so light as to be scarce audible after two hours travelling they saw an opening among the trees and here some young pines were growing thickly the chief pointed significantly towards them and godfrey understood that the animals would probably be feeding there they now went slowly and the chief whispered orders that they were to make a circle round the opening and close round on the other side as noiselessly as possible he himself would enter the thicket from the side on which he now was the crackling of the pine twigs would drive them out on the other side very quietly they worked round and took up their stations each standing behind a firtree and then waited  they could hear the stamping of heavy hoofs and the occasional breaking of twigs presently there was a louder and more continuous sound of breaking bushes and then with a sudden rush a great elk followed by four others burst out of the thicket as they came along the ostjaks stepped out from their hidingplaces and let fly their deadly arrows the leading elk came close to the tree behind which godfrey was standing and as it passed he fired both barrels hitting it just behind the shoulder the elk ran a few paces and then fell three out of the other four had been brought down by the ostjak arrows the young male escaped the satisfaction of the ostjaks was great for here in addition to the value of the skins was food for themselves and the dogs for some time to come  a man was at once sent back for the sledges while waiting for these the rest set out on various tracks of ermine they had passed on the way and three of these and a marten were killed before the sledges came up the big elk was placed on one sledge one of the females on each of the others the fourth was skinned cut up and divided among the three sledges lightly as the sledges ran over the snow the men were all obliged to harness themselves to ropes to assist the deer and it was late in the evening before they arrived at the hut the fire was lighted at once godfrey undertook the cooking while the rest skinned the bears and elk cut them up and hung up the carcasses on boughs beyond the reach of the dogs these had a grand feast off the offal while the men were regaling themselves with fresh elk steaks  for two months the hunting was continued with much success then the ostjaks said they would return home godfrey however was anxious to continue hunting he had a small tent that had been made for him and luka and the ostjak leader offered to leave one of the sledges with six dogs that had been trained to draught work as soon as the ostjaks had started on their return journey the tent a store of provisions and furs were packed in the sledge and a fresh start made as they had been in their present position for over a week as they went along two of the poles were arranged so that they made a deep groove in the snow by which they could find their way back to the startingpoint two days journey took them into a hilly country they established themselves in a sheltered valley and made that the centre from which they hunted  they were now twelve days journey from the yenesei and well beyond the range of ordinary hunting parties they had soon reason to congratulate themselves on entering the more mountainous country for here the game was much more abundant than it had been before the dogs had by this time become attached to them for godfrey was fond of animals and had petted them in a manner to which they were quite unaccustomed from their ostjak masters one of them especially a young dog had taken regularly to accompany godfrey when hunting and he found the animal of the greatest utility as it was able to follow the back track with undeviating certainty this was of importance for there was but a short twilight each twentyfour hours the sun being below the horizon except for an hour or two at noon and they were obliged to carry torches while following the tracks of the smaller animals  ermines were found in considerable numbers and in the first week four fine sables were killed as well as two martens and a bear the latter was specially prized they had brought a fortnights provisions for themselves and the dogs but they were anxious to eke these stores out as long as possible as they could no longer depend upon getting fresh supplies from home the bodies of the ermines were but a mouthful for one of the dogs while the sables and martens gave them a mouthful all round the bear however contained a large quantity of excellent food and setting aside the hams for their own consumption they hung up the rest of the meat on a tree to serve out gradually among the dogs they soon found however that they need be under no anxiety as to food as foxes abounded principally red though two of the valuable black foxes fell to godfreys gun they found many paths in the woods completely trodden down by animals here they used the ostjak method of catching them putting up a screen of branches across the track looking at these objects with suspicion the animals invariably refused to try either to jump over or crawl through them but went round at one end or the other here accordingly traps were fixed and many animals were taken  intense as the cold was godfrey felt it even less than he had anticipated the widespreading woods broke the force of the winds and while they could sometimes see the tops of the trees swaying beneath its force they scarcely felt a breath below luka knew nothing of the esquimaux fashion of making snowhuts and said he had never heard of it among the ostjaks or samoyedes at each of the halts however godfrey piled the snow high over the low tent of reindeerskin which he had got the women to make for him according to his own plan it resembled a tent dabri or shelter tent seven feet long and as much wide was permanently closed at one end and had flaps crossing each other at the entrance instead of depending entirely upon the two uprights and the ridgepole between them godfrey when erecting it put eight or ten poles on each side stretching from the ridge out to the side of the tent so as to support the skin under the snow they piled over it  the bottom was covered with a thick mat of furs the sides were lined with them and others were hung across the entrance so that the cold was effectually kept out a large fire was kept burning in front of the tent and from this from time to time red embers were taken out and placed in a cookingpot inside at night two or three lamps fed by oil melted down from the fat of the animals they killed were kept alight and in this way lying snugly in their sleepingbags they felt perfectly warm and comfortable although the temperature outside was from forty to fifty degrees below zero the dogs slept outside with the exception of the one of which godfrey had made a special pet it being allowed to share the tent with them a high bank of snow was erected on each side of the entrance to the tent this served further to break the force of the wind and to retain and reflect back the heat of the fire the dogs therefore being provided with a good supply of meat from the proceeds of the chase did very well  one afternoon the sky was very thick and overcast and luka said he thought that they were going to have snow  in that case luka godfrey said we will set to work to make things comfortable if there is a heavy fall we might be almost buried here ordinarily it is sheltered but if there is a wind and i can see that it is blowing now it might drift very deep in this hollow and we might find ourselves completely snowed up i think the tent is strong enough to stand any pressure but it does not contain much air we will cut down some strong poles and lay them side by side across the snow walls in front of the tent the smoke will find its way out through them and if a deep snow comes on it will save the dogs from being snowed up besides it will give us a lot of additional air which we may want two or three hours will do it the time wont be thrown away anyhow for the branches we cut off and the poles themselves will do for firewood  the snowflakes began to fall just as they finished the workthe result being a sort of flatroofed shelter with snow walls ten feet long and six feet high in front of the tent a large quantity of firewood was piled up at the entrance to the shelter  that is a capital idea luka godfrey said as they retired into the tent we can sit with the entrance of the tent open now if we like and get the benefit of the fire outside for the air having to pass close by it on its way to us gets comparatively warm  when they went out to build up the fire for the last time before lying down snow was falling steadily and was already deep in front of the entrance to the shelter the dogs had been well fed and lay thickly clustered round the fire evidently greatly contented with the unusual luxury of a roof over them godfrey crawled into the tent again closed the flaps hung up a skin before them and getting into his sleepingbag lay there comfortably smoking his pipe and talking to luka  we are as snug here as if we were in a palace luka but i should not like to be caught out in the woods tonight have you ever heard of any of the ostjaks or samoyedes being frozen to death  couldnt be frozen if they had a hatchet and matches with them he replied can always chop down branches and make a hut and a fire in the middle to keep it warm then snow comes and covers it up and keeps out the wind out on the plains a man might get frozen if stupid but he ought never to be if he knew what to do he should look for a hollow where the snow had drifted deep then make a hole in the side of the drift and crawl in he ought to be quite warm there if furs are good but they do not often get lost they never go very far from huts when snow in the sky directly it comes on they would make for home can always get along in snowshoes  the isvostchiks are often frozen in st petersburg in their sledges at night godfrey said  they cant build huts in a town luka remarked they cant find snow deep enough to get into town not good in winter  are there many wolves here luka do they often attack people  no there is plenty of game in the woods in russia the game now so i hear is scarce so the wolves must take to eating men but here there is plenty of game and so they do not often attack people i have heard of hunters going out and never coming back again then people say wolves eat them but not often so may be killed by elk or hurt by a falling tree or climb hills and fall down i do not think it is often the wolves wolves great cowards  i am glad to hear it luka i have heard them howl sometimes at night and wondered whether they would come this way  not come here luka said decidedly we keep plenty of big fire all beasts afraid of fire then we have got dogs and guns much easier for wolves to attack elk but even that they seldom do unless it is wounded or has injured itself  well i think i will go off to sleep my pipe is out and the hot tea has made me sleepy  after sleeping for some hours godfrey awoke with a strange feeling of oppression outside he could hear the dogs whimpering  wake up luka he said it is very close in here i fancy the snow must have drifted very deep and covered us up completely let us get up and see about it  it was quite dark outside except that the embers of the fire threw a dull red light on the snow the shelter seemed but half its former dimensions the snow had drifted in at its entrance and lay in a bank piled up to the roof  bring your spear luka and mine and shove them up between these poles we must make a few holes up through the snow if we can to let a little air in  the spears were pushed up and then worked a little to and fro to try to enlarge the hole they were eight feet long but godfrey did not feel at all sure that they penetrated through the cover of snow however when they had made a dozen of these holes there was a distinct change in the air  they have gone nearly through if not quite and anyhow they are near enough to the surface for the air to find its way out now we had better set to work at once to dig a passage out that is one advantage of this shelter there is a place to throw the snow back into  going down on their hands and knees they soon scraped the snow away until they reached the entrance to the shelter here the snow weighted by the pressure above was much denser and harder and they could cut out blocks with their hatchets  now godfrey said we must make a tunnel sloping upwards it must be as steep as it can so that we are able to climb up making steps to give us foothold i will begin for we only just want it wide enough for one i will hand the blocks down to you as i cut them and you pile them regularly along the sides here as we fill the shelter up you must drive the dogs back into the tent we shall want every inch of room for the snow before we get out  for hours they worked steadily taking it by turns to cut and to pile the last four feet were much more difficult than the first the snow being lighter and less packed falling in upon them as they dug once luka was completely buried and godfrey had to haul him back by the legs the atmosphere inside however improved as they got upwards being able to penetrate between the particles of the light snow it was six hours before they both struggled out followed by the dogs in an impetuous rush it took them another couple of hours to clear away and beat down the snow sufficiently to make an easy entrance to the shelter a fire was lighted outside and a meal cooked for the lamps were quite sufficient to keep the tent sufficiently warm and they would have been wellnigh stifled with smoke had they attempted to light the fire in the shelter the snow was still falling and drifting and the sky showed no signs of change  the entrance will fill up again by tomorrow luka said and we shall have more trouble than ever to get out  we must provide against that luka we must build a sort of roof over the entrance here and then we shall only have to start from this point again let us set to work and chop down some poles at once  after three hours more work a cover was built over the entrance and roofed with pine branches so as to prevent the snow from drifting in  now luka there is one more job and unfortunately a long one but we must do that we must get the snow that we have packed in the shelter below out of the way for if by any chance this passage fell through we should have nowhere to pile the snow besides we may have another passage as deep as the present one to dig tomorrow for the snow is drifting down in clouds it has deepened a couple of feet since we began to make the roof over the entrance  luka who was always ready to work set to cheerfully but the short twilight had faded into deep darkness before the work was completed  if we had had a couple of good shovels with us luka we should have made short work of this godfrey said as they retired below into their tent we could do as much work in an hour as one can in five with these tools it is heartbreaking to shovel out snow with a hatchet i am as tired as a dog this is harder work than the goldmines at kara by a long way  yes luka said but there is no man with a gun  no that makes a difference luka this is free work and the other isnt not that one can call it exactly free when we have no choice but to do it  for another four days the snow continued to fall but as the wind had dropped and the snow no longer drifted their work each morning was comparatively easy  i wish it would stop godfrey said for we begin to want food for the dogs our stock of dried fish has been exhausted since we were shut up there is half a deer hanging to a branch of that tree close to the tent but it is eight or ten feet below the snow and as we cant calculate the exact position now it would be a big job to try to get at it there was however no change in the aspect of the weather on the following morning and luka announced that beyond the tea and a handful or two of flour there was nothing whatever for breakfast while the dogs had fasted on the previous day  well luka there is nothing to do but to try and get at that venison i have been thinking that it will be easiest to try from below it is much quicker work chopping out the solid snow than it is trying to make a hole in that loose stuff at the surface the tree was just about in a line with the front of the tent wasnt it and we hung the deer on a branch that stretched out nearly as far as the tent i should say we hung it about halfway along that branch and not above twelve feet from the tent  luka agreed as to the position  very well then as we know exactly the direction and as the distance is but twelve feet it ought not to take us very long to chop out a passage just big enough and high enough for one to crawl through when we get near the place where we think it is we must make the tunnel a good bit higher for the bottom of the meat was quite five feet from the ground so that it should be well out of reach of the dogs now will you go first or shall i  i will begin luka said we must make the passage wide enough to push the snow past us as we get it down  certainly we must luka make it pretty wide at the bottom and make the top arched so as to stand the pressure from above  it was easy enough work at first but became more difficult every foot they advanced as the one behind had to crawl backward each time with the snow that the one at work passed back to him at last the tunnel was driven twelve feet long and the last four feet it had been given an upward direction by which means less snow had to be removed than would have been the case had the bottom remained level with the ground and the height been increased  we are a good twelve feet in now luka and certainly high enough which way do you think we had better try  luka replied by calling one of the dogs and taking it with him to the end of the tunnel the animal at once began to snuff about eagerly and then to scratch violently to the right  that will do luka said pushing it back past him and taking its place he had driven but a foot in the direction in which the dog was scratching when the hatchet struck something hard it required some care to dig round the meat and make a hole large enough for luka to stand up beside it and cut the cord by which it hung the dogs yelped with joy when he dragged it back to the other end of the passage the fire was made now in the passage under the roof they had made at the end of the first days work for outside the snow fell so fast that it damped the fire greatly and as the smoke made its way out through the entrance it was no inconvenience to them below a goodsized piece of raw meat was chopped off and given to each of the dogs the ramrod was thrust through another large piece and held by luka over the fire and then godfrey carried the rest of the joint outside and placed it in the fork of a tree  it smells good luka he said as he returned to the fire i wish it would attract a bear  luka shook his head bears are asleep godfrey they are hunted in summer and sometimes they may be found in the early part of the winter but never when the snow is deep they would die of hunger there might be wolves but we dont want them wolf skins fetch very little and their flesh is only good for the dogs we dont want wolves but we must be on our guard in such weather as this food is very scarce they might come and attack us yesterday i heard howls once or twice i think when we have done breakfast it will be better to take that meat down below  why they wouldnt smell it as much as this cooked meat luka  no i was not thinking of that but if they come we may want it  you mean they might besiege us luka  yes shut us up here wolves very patient wait a long time when they scent food  well we will have the dogs sleep up here for the future they will act as sentries and there is none too much air down there that reminds me i will cut a long pole or two fasten them together and try and drive them down through the snow to the roof of the shelter below  luka shook his head you might drive it down five or six feet but you would never get it down to the roof and if you did you could never pull it up again  i dont know luka i once saw them driving down some bars in tough clay when they were making a railway cutting at home i think we might do it in the same way  godfrey after breakfast cut a pole chopping it off just below where two or three small branches had shot from it leaving a bulge this bulge he shaped and smoothed very carefully with his knife so that it was in the form of a pegtop  there he said you see it is thicker here than it is anywhere else so that the hole it makes will be a little larger than the pole itself and instead of the snow holding the pole all the way down it will touch it only on this shoulder  this succeeded admirably it was six feet long they had cleared away the loose snow to a depth of eighteen inches and both holding it were able to force the pole down as much more then they hammered it with a billet of wood until only a foot showed then they spliced another to it and working it up and down jumped it in until they could again use the mallet and at last struck on something solid which could only be one of the beams forming the roof of the hut godfrey went below and soon discovered the spot where the pole came down and with his knife managed to clear away the snow round it then he went up and assisted luka to withdraw the pole which left a hole of about three inches in diameter  that is a capital chimney he said now we will throw a few fir branches over it to prevent the dogs treading here and shutting it up i think the air looks rather lighter luka and that the storm is nearly over there is a howl again i am afraid that we are going to have trouble with the wolves is there anything we can do  luka shook his head we might get up into trees he said we should be safe there but then we should lose the dogs  that would never do luka we should have to haul the sledge back a hundred and fifty miles no ill tell you what we will do we will cut down some young trees and block up our tunnel with beams leaving three or four inches between each to fire through or use our spears  that is a very good plan luka said we should be quite safe then  it took them some hours work to carry out the idea the middle of the tunnel was closed by a row of pointed stakes some four inches in diameter driven deep into the snow and reaching up to the roof of the shelter an opening of a foot wide was left in the middle another stake being placed beside it in readiness to fill it up if required the operation was completed by the light of the fire as it was pitch dark by the time it was done then another meal was cooked and eaten and the brands carried below where at the bottom of the descent the fire was now kindled the dogs had for some time been growling angrily in the upper passage and the fire was no sooner alight below than they broke into a chorus of fierce barking  we had better bring them down here luka and fill up the opening i think the wolves must be gathering in numbers  going up again they sent the dogs down firmly lashed two crossbars to the others and to these lashed the pole they had left in readiness thus completing the grating across the tunnel as they worked the smoke from the fire below curled up round them a few months before godfrey would have found it almost insupportable but by this time he had like the natives become so accustomed to it that it affected him very little still he said to luka you had better break off the hot ends of the sticks so as to have a red fire only for the present the smoke makes my eyes water so that i can scarcely see now the sooner those fellows come to get their first lesson the better  kneeling by the grating with his gun in his hand and his spear beside him godfrey gazed out and could presently distinguish the outline of a number of moving figures  i can see their eyes at the entrance he said shall i give them a shot or will you send an arrow into them  you fire luka replied bow makes no noise gun will frighten them besides i have only twenty arrows and they would get broken better keep them till there is need  godfrey levelled his gun which was charged with buckshot and fired both barrels terrific yells and howls followed and the opening was clear in a moment though godfrey could see two or three dark figures on the snow there was a sound of whimpering and snarling and then of a fierce fight outside    illustration the slaughtered wolves  they are killing and eating the wounded luka said when they have done that they will come again let them get close up next time  in a few minutes the entrance to the tunnel was darkened again and then cleared the dead wolves had been pulled away another quarter of an hour and the animals reappeared as all was silent they gradually approached godfrey could hear their panting and presently heard a noise against the bars a moment later there was a rush and an outburst of snarling growls then he and luka drove their spears again and again between the bars yells of pain following each stroke the animals in front were unable to retreat and the others behind crowded in upon them maddened with the smell of blood and all trying to get first at their prey they quarrelled and fought among themselves while their cries and growls were answered by the furious barking of the dogs in the shelter below  in two or three minutes godfrey who had reloaded his gun fired both barrels into the mass and at the flash and sound the wolves again fled this time they did not venture to reenter the passage occasionally one showed itself and was instantly shot by godfrey or luka who took turns on watch throughout the night as soon as the dim light broke they removed the bar and issued out with the dogs a dozen wolves lay dead outside the bars seven were scattered round the entrance godfrey shot two more who were lurking under the trees while luka sent an arrow through another  there are plenty of them about still godfrey said let us get three or four of the dead ones upon a branch out of their reach as food for the dogs drag the rest away from the entrance to the tunnel and bring the others up from below that will give them with the three we have shot now enough for a big meal then i should think they would move off  this was accordingly done and they went below and cooked breakfast while the dogs feasted on a dead wolf then they lay down for three hours sleep when they went up again the dead wolves had disappeared only a few bones and the bloodmarked snow showing where they had lain godfrey fired a couple of shots to scare away any that might be lingering in the neighbourhood and then replacing the bars they went out hunting and from that time heard no farther of the wolves  they continued their hunting shifting their camp occasionally until it was time to rejoin the ostjaks and then travelled east they struck the river some thirty miles below the camp crossed at once and travelled up the other side until they arrived at the huts they were heartily welcomed by the natives and remained there for three days to rest the dogs they were very glad of getting a supply of fish again these the ostjaks had in abundance as they kept their frozen piles for food when the keenness of the wind rendered the cold so bitter that they were forced to remain in their huts at other times they fished by torchlight at holes that they kept broken in the ice spearing the fish which were attracted by the light the ostjaks were surprised at the large number of skins some of them of the most valuable kind that godfrey had brought back and were impatient for a fresh start they were this time absent for only six weeks returning at the beginning of may the hunt was marked by no adventure they did fairly well but were not fortunate in securing any skins of the black fox and but few of the sable  upon their return the furs that had been taken during the two hunts with the ostjaks were fairly divided and godfrey added his and lukas shares to those they had themselves obtained there were over fifty in all including three black foxes six sables and ten martens the rest being of inferior value then a list was made of the necessaries that luka was to purchase at turukhansk these included ten pounds of brick tea some copper nails if he could obtain them a store of ammunition some more fishhooks the largest kettle he could buy a fryingpan a few pounds of sugar ten pounds of salt some stout sheeting thirty yards of duck canvas three blocks a coil or two of rope needles and twine a saw a couple of chisels and some other tools  you must make the best bargain you can for the skins luka i have no idea how much they are worth  the ostjaks were however able to tell them the prices the traders pay for the skins of each animal provided that they were fine specimens and in good condition the black foxes were worth from fifty to a hundred roubles the sables from thirty to fifty the martens some ten roubles less the other skins were worth from fifteen to thirty roubles  luka took the sledge and a reindeer and started alone having gone over the list of things required again and again until godfrey was convinced that he was perfect he took his sleepingbag but no tent he calculated that he should be away five days as it would take him two to drive to turukhansk and a day there to make his purchases  on the fifth evening he returned with everything he had been ordered to get and a few other things that he thought would be useful he had obtained in all six hundred and fifty roubles as the result of their six months hunting and of these had expended a hundred and seventy roubles  we are well set up for money now luka godfrey said as he added the notes to those he before possessed i have still four hundred roubles out of what i received from the buriat so we have now nearly nine hundred which will be enough to pay our way to england from any point we may land at     chapter xiv  the breakup of winter   spring was rapidly approaching now occasionally for a day or two southerly winds set in and rain fell in torrents then again the arctic currents prevailed and everything was frozen as hard as before flocks of geese passed over flying north but returned again when the cold set in afresh small birds too in great numbers made their appearance crowding on patches of ground that the sun and rain had cleared of snow fluttering round the tents in flocks picking up scraps of food that had been thrown out and keeping the dogs in a state of perpetual excitement the ostjaks said that the breakup of the ice might come any day or it might be delayed for another month it depended less upon the weather here than on that higher up it is not the sun or the rain that breaks up the ice but the rise of the river from the snow melting a thousand miles higher up and all over the country drained by the rivers running into the yenesei  the women were now making a canoe under godfreys instructions he had often gone out in canoes on the severn and on the sea when staying at wateringplaces there the craft that had done them such good service before would not do for their present undertaking they required a boat which should be fairly fast seaworthy and yet light for it might be necessary to carry it considerable distances it was necessary that its dimensions should exceed those of an english canoe for it must carry a considerable amount of food although of course he meant to depend chiefly on the fishinglines and gun it was made fiveandtwenty feet long and three feet wide the central compartment was thirteen feet long this was covered in at the sides and ends leaving an opening for them to sit and paddle fifteen inches wide and five feet long underneath the covered parts provisions furs cooking utensils c could be stowed away on both sides leaving room for them to lie down at full length in the centre  the two end compartments were entirely covered in but had openings over which a cover was lashed and could if necessary be used for holding stores but godfrey did not intend to put anything here except temporarily as it was important that the canoe should be as buoyant and light as possible the frame of the boat was built of the tough and elastic wood of which the ostjaks made their bows it was very light the ribs being bound to the longitudinal pieces by fine gut it was built as nearly as godfrey could lay them out on the lines of an english cruising canoe the deck strips were similarly lashed and when the framework was completed godfrey tested its strength by dropping it three feet to the ground rolling it over and over and trying it in a variety of ways  when fully satisfied with it the work of putting on the cover commenced this was made of very soft and welltanned reindeer hide stretched as tightly as possible and then rubbed with seal oil the keel of the boat had been made very strong as the rigidity of the whole craft depended upon this it had been made flat and the skins had been taken over it when it was finished a false keel six inches in depth in the centre tapering away to nothing at the ends was fixed underneath this keel was also made of tough wood a little more than a quarter of an inch thick but widening suddenly to over an inch where it touched the boat in order that it might be securely fixed with screws to the keel inside  the boat was provided with a light mast which could be stepped or unstepped at pleasure and there were two stays of twisted leather one fastening to each side of the boat an iron ring with a cord travelled up and down the mast the halliard running through a small block as luka had been able to obtain a sheave at turukhansk the sail was a lug made of sheeting oiled and the boat carried beside a triangular sail of very much smaller dimensions and stouter cloth for heavy weather she also carried a small mizzen mast and sail in rough weather the cockpit could be completely covered with a light apron with openings where the rowers sat with a sort of collar which could be lashed tightly round their waists the edges of this apron could be lashed down over the gunwale round the cockpit when completed the canoe itself with its mast and sails weighed but sixty pounds and could be carried with ease by one person on his shoulder  the ostjaks greatly admired the craft which was entirely different from anything they had ever seen the false keel puzzled them greatly and godfreys explanations even when aided by luka failed altogether in making them understand that it would have the effect of enabling the craft to sail near the wind without drifting to leeward the additional draught of water was no inconvenience whatever in a craft designed for the sea and it added materially to the strength of the canoe on the 15th of may it was freezing hard the natives going down to the waters edge in the morning reported a sudden rise of three feet in the river it continued to rise all day and by nightfall was fifteen feet above its former level  in the evening the north wind dropped suddenly and an hour later it sprang up from the south and by midnight a torrent of rain was falling godfrey could hear sounds like the reports of cannon above the pattering of the rain on the skins and knew that it must be the ice breaking in the morning when he looked out the whole mass of ice seemed to be moving black cracks showed everywhere across the white surface the river had during the night risen another twenty feet by midday the scene was a wild one indeed no longer was the surface smooth hurrying along at the rate of fifteen miles an hour the great masses of ice were dashed against each other by the force of the current  two miles lower down the river narrowed suddenly and here a block was formed some of the pieces of ice were thrust down others climbed over them thrusting themselves one on the top of the other till a ridge thirty or forty feet high was formed from bank to bank at times this gave way and then the whole was whirled down the stream while another ridge at once commenced to form godfrey walked down to the point and stood for hours looking at the scene the great blocks of ice six or eight feet thick seemed almost to be endowed with vitality as they climbed one above the other until thrust off the crest of the ridge by the pressure of those behind them the din was prodigious a crackling rustling roaring sound with sharp explosions and deep muffled booming the whole air seemed to quiver with sound and the loudest shout would have been inaudible a yard or two away below the ridge the river so long as the barrier stood was comparatively clear but from time to time great masses of ice that had been sunk by the pressure and swept along under the ridge came to the surface with a surge that lifted one end high out of the water reminding godfrey of the spring of some enormous fish then the ice would come down with a mighty splash and hasten away reeling and rocking on the rapid current entranced by this mighty conflict of the forces of nature godfrey stood there until seven or eight oclock in the evening  it would be light for three hours yet for the sun now only sank for a short time below the horizon the rain was still falling heavily when he returned to his hut the river had risen another thirty feet since the evening before and the height of the bank had decreased from a hundred feet to about thirty for two more days it rained incessantly the river had now risen to its highwater mark ten feet below the bank godfrey asked the ostjaks if there was no fear of its overflowing but they told him that there was no cause for uneasiness for that at its present point it overflowed at many places both above and below them and extended over a vast tract of country and that at every additional foot it would spread so widely that it would speedily begin to fall again the ridge had now ceased to form although the river was still packed with floating masses  in another two days the ostjaks chief said the ice will be all gone except a few blocks much of the ice above is carried out by the floods and left to melt on the land as the water lowers but even without that the river at its present rate would soon carry it all down  this godfrey could well imagine for at the rate of fifteen miles an hour over three hundred and sixty miles of the river would have been emptying daily at the end of another three days but few blocks of ice were visible and godfrey now began to make preparations for his start first the canoe was to be tried she was taken down and placed in the water and the sides under the halfdecks were filled in with frozen geese and fish from the pile which was still but little affected by the thaw  when she was thus brought down to nearly the weight she would have to carry godfrey and luka took their places in her dipped their paddles in the stream shot out and paddled about for some time in the still water behind the shelter of the point godfrey found to his satisfaction that she paddled easily quite answering to his expectations then luka who had already practised the manoeuvre on shore stepped the masts fastened the stays and hoisted the sails there was a light breeze from the south and the boat ran rapidly along before it till it was again abreast of the village then she was put about and made short tacks in the deadwater godfrey found that she stood stiffly up to the canvas and as far as he could see made little or no leeway then he returned to the village the ostjaks who seldom made use of sails and then only when dead before the wind were perfectly astounded alike at the rapidity with which the boat glided through the water and at the ease with which she came about and were astonished beyond measure at seeing her make a zigzag progress in the teeth of the wind  early the next morning the rest of the preparations were completed the tea tobacco cooking utensils and other necessaries were stowed away under the deck astern of godfrey together with twenty pounds of fat this had been carefully set aside for the purpose when animals were killed and cut up it had been melted down in the chiefs large pot and poured into a tin drinkingmug in which four strands of unravelled cord had been placed to act as wicks the tin was dipped in ice water and in a few minutes the fat solidified then the tin was dipped again this time in hot water and the short fat candle with its four wicks then came easily out and the process was repeated these candles weighed just about a pound each godfrey collected fat enough to make fifty but being afraid of overburdening the canoe he decided that twenty must suffice believing that he would be able to pick up driftwood as they coasted along  a store of pinewood torches was lashed on the deck on each side of the mast forward of luka the fishing spears hatchets and other articles for trade stowed away the furs and their winter garments laid thickly at the bottom of the boat they took with them jack godfreys favourite dog and then bestowing all the rest of their possessions on the ostjaks they took a hearty farewell of them stepped on board and started they had at the last moment decided to take their old boat also with them this was fastened by a towrope behind the canoe it was filled with frozen provisions having been first lined with rough furs others were laid closely over them in this way godfrey calculated that they would remain frozen for a long time the rest of the store of flour and a stock of firewood were added  as to the extra weight of towing the canoe it was immaterial as until they reached the mouth of the river there would be no occasion for paddling and beyond that the stock of provisions could be transferred to their own canoe to take the place of those used up on the way and the craft could then be cast adrift as there was a light breeze however the sail was hoisted rather because it gave them steerage way than for any increase to their speed as soon as the canoe shot out into the rougher water in the full force of the stream godfrey was still more delighted with the boat the empty compartments fore and aft rendering her exceedingly buoyant she had been built with somewhat higher sides than the canoes godfrey had seen at home and rose a good deal towards the ends and she floated as lightly as a cork on the surface of the water that afternoon they passed turukhansk below this the river widened out in the evening they lowered the sail as they did not wish to run the risk of striking either the shore or a piece of ice that might have got delayed on its journey all night they hurried on lying snugly in the bottom of the boat with the apron closed overhead  in the morning they found they were not far from the left bank and that the river now was more than four miles wide the sail was again hoisted and breakfast made after which they got out their lines and hooks baited and dropped them into the water during the course of the day they caught several fish and picked up a considerable quantity of floating wood which they stowed in the large canoe  i think luka godfrey said that instead of letting our old boat go we may as well keep it for a time as long as there is wind it makes no great difference to our speed though of course it would be heavy if we were paddling if we had bad weather we could land and turn it bottom upwards and there would be a hut ready made for us this canoe is all right for sleeping in when the water is smooth but with its deep keel we could not sleep in it ashore  luka was as usual quite of godfreys opinion after this they made the old boat their kitchen for there was but little room in the canoe for cooking purposes and it was moreover a relief to get into the roomy craft where they could move about as they pleased as driftwood was abundant they made their fires entirely of this keeping their candles for the time when they might have to leave their storeboat behind them on the third day the river widened out greatly they could no longer see the right bank and godfrey concluded that they were now in the gulf of yenesei  the weather is going to change luka said the next morning the wind will soon be coming from the north going to blow hard  in that case luka the sooner we are ashore the better the current now is nothing like so swift as it was i dont think we are going past the land at more than three miles an hour but that would be quite enough if the wind comes from the north to knock up a nasty sea in no time let us get our paddles out there is not a breath of wind  in half an hour they reached the shore but had to coast along for some time before they found a place free of rocks  this will do luka we are not a minute too soon those puffs just now were so strong that we made no way against them now then jump out and get the canoe high and dry  they had retained their long boots and stepped out into water up to their knees then they lifted the canoe and carried it ashore  it is heavier than it was when we put it in luka said  i should think so what with the furs and provisions candles and one thing and another there must be a hundred and fifty pounds weight in her there put her down here luka and let us get the other up we must take the things out first quick man the wind is getting up fast isnt it cold we shall want our fur jackets on directly the firewood and provisions were carried up some distance above the waters edge and then the boat was lifted and placed beside them a thick sleet had now set in and the wind was blowing with tremendous gusts  now then look about luka and see if you can find a sheltered nook i will pile stones into the well of the canoe so as to anchor her safely if she were to be rolled over and over her skin would soon be cut to pieces  before he had finished this luka returned good place here he said good shelter  well finish this job first luka this is much more important than our getting wet  as soon as it was done they went to the large canoe and lifting it carried it away to the place luka had founda ridge of rock running back at a right angle from the shore with a perpendicular face some twelve feet high at one point there was a deep cleft in it some eight feet wide at the mouth and narrowing gradually in  capital luka we shall be as snug as possible here now turn her over and take her in  the cleft was so deep that the stern of the boat was when she was laid down bow foremost fully fifteen feet inside the entrance  now it may blow as much as it likes godfrey said it wont hurt us here now do you go and get some of the firewood i will fetch some skins from the canoe and the sails  after getting out some provisions the cooking utensils and a couple of the candles godfrey returned to the boat then he made another journey for some more skins and the two sails by this time the wind was blowing so fiercely that he could scarcely stagger along with his load the sea was covered with white heads and the waves were breaking noisily against the rocks luka had already brought up plenty of firewood and had thrown a large skin over the furs containing the frozen fish and piled stones on it to prevent its being blown away  now where will you put the fire he asked if you put it inside it would burn the boat if you put it outside it would be no good to us  i quite see that luka we must make ourselves comfortable for this storm may last for days for anything i know we must prop this end of the boat up so that we can sit upright under it with something to spare we must pile up some stones a couple of feet high under each gunwale in a quarter of an hour this was done the sail was then laid over the boat the ends being kept down by stones  that is snug godfrey said now we will put the mizzen over forward so as to keep the wind out right along there were four feet of head room at the entrance to the boat tent and in front of this the fire was soon lit one of the pine torches being cut up to start it with the skins were laid upon the ground and taking off their wet coats they put on fur jackets now we can see about breakfast luka  luka had run down and filled the kettle while godfrey was fastening down the sail this was placed on the fire and as soon as it began to burn clear some of the fish they had caught the day before were laid on the glowing embers together with two legs of a goose  the thing we are going to have most trouble about luka is fresh water godfrey said as they ate their breakfast luka looked surprised when we once get beyond the stream of the yenesei he went on the water will be salt  salt luka repeated  yes too salt to make tea with we shall be all right for a time no doubt what with the melting snow and the rains we have had there are sure to be lots of little streams running into the sea but when the land dries we shall be in a bad way  luka looked serious this was altogether beyond his experience  of course if we can get plenty of fresh fish we shall get on fairly as we shant require much to drink we will look about the rivers when i can get at the map i know there is a small one called the gida running in just between the mouths of the yenesei and obi and there is the kara on farther and then the petchora as far as i can remember that is all that were marked but of course there may be lots of little streams that were not put down there is one thing if we find that we generally get wind and can keep the big boat with us we could make her carry water as well as fuel she would hold any quantity for half a dozen barrels would not sink her above an inch we should certainly get out of the difficulty that way it gave me quite a fright at first i felt so sure that i had thought of everything and there i never for a moment thought about the sea being salt how it is blowing outside it is lucky indeed you have found such a snug corner luka for if we had been out in the open we could only have piled stones in the boat to prevent it blowing away and lain at full length underneath her which would be all well enough for one night but would be a frightful nuisance if it had to go on for three or four days  so sheltered were they indeed that they scarce felt the wind that was howling above them and were as comfortable beneath their boat as they had been in their hut by the river side  when it is as rough as this in the gulf luka it will be tremendous out at sea  luka had never seen waves higher than those in some of the rapids of the upper river and he was astonished at the whiteheaded waves and at the showers of spray they sent up as they struck the rocks  are the waves ever much bigger than this he asked  bigger i should think so out in the open sea one of the waves would make a hundred of these  then they must break the vessels to pieces godfrey  no they are built very stout and strong and very big they get broken to pieces if the sea drives them against rocks and sometimes in very great storms get so beaten by the waves that the planks open and the water runs in and they sink  i should not like to go to sea if the waves were like that luka said thoughtfully this is terrible why if we had not come ashore in time the boat would have sunk  she would have made a good fight for it luka with the apron tied in round us we could stand a very heavy sea so long as we keep her head to the waves the water might wash over us but it could not get in and even if it did fill the space where we sleep the compartments at the ends are quite buoyant enough to keep her up  what would you do if you were out in what you call a great sea godfrey  i should lash the mast and the sail and our paddles and the firewood together fasten our mooring rope to them and throw them overboard that would keep us head to seabecause these things would all float in the water and the wind would not get hold of them they call a contrivance like that a floating anchor then we would both lie down in the bottom button the flaps over the holes in the cover and lie there as snugly as possible you see our weight would be down quite low in the boat then and that would keep her steady oh we should get on capitally if there were plenty of room for us to drift  how far have we to go now  i cant exactly tell you i wish i knew from the long jagged cape which is the northern point of land on the western side of the gulf of yenesei and forms the separation between it and the mouth of the gulf of obi to waigatz straits between the mainland and waigatz island which lies south of the island called nova zembla is about two hundred and fifty miles in a straight line but i should think it is quite three times that if we have to follow all the ins and outs of the shore from there to archangel if we go in to archangel is about three hundred and fifty miles more cutting across everything if we had a current with us like the stream of the yenesei we should make very short work of it but unfortunately there is nothing of that sort paddling steadily we might go three miles an hoursay a hundred miles in three days if we had wind that would help us of course we should go a great deal faster because we should paddle and sail too  but if we dont go to the place you call archangel where should we go  we should keep far north of it luka and sailing in a straight line nearly due west should strike the northern coast of norway somewhere or other i should say from what i saw of it on the map it would be five hundred miles from waigatz but that would be madness for us to attempt we might get caught in terrible storms we might get into fogs and as we have no compass there we should lie not knowing which way to go no we must stick to the land till we get to the mouth of the white sea with a favourable wind we should get across that in a day and then go on coasting again till we get beyond the russian frontier then at the first village we come to we land find out all about the distances and arrange to get taken in reindeer sledges to some regular settlement  what sort of people are they there luka asked  they are the same sort of people as the samoyedes i dont know that they are just the same anyhow they speak the same sort of language well you know the northern ostjaks we stayed with speak nearly the same as the samoyedes you could hardly get on with them at first because their talk was so different to that of the southern ostjaks but you got to speak it quite easily at last so i have no doubt you will be able to make any natives you may meet whether they are samoyedes or anything else understand you without difficulty  what is it jack what are you whining about he asked the dog who having made a hearty meal had been lying down between them while they were talking but who now sat up snuffing and whining uneasily  it may be either a fox or a bear luka said making his way farther back into the hut and returning with his bow and arrows godfreys gun and the two spears  i hope it is a bear godfrey said as he removed the charges of shot and rammed down bullets in their place we dont want any more skins unless it happens to be a black fox which would be worth having but a supply of bear meat would come in very handy  the dogs whine presently changed into an angry growl  bear sure enough i expect he knows of this place and has come here for shelter he had much better have left it alone it is lucky for us that the fire has burnt low it would have scared him if it had been blazing lie down jack  lying perfectly still they presently heard a sharp snuffing noise and a minute or two later a bear came round a corner of the rock astonished at the sight of the white object the animal sat up on its haunches  now luka exclaimed and discharged his arrow at the same moment that godfrey had pulled his trigger the arrow struck the bear in the throat and such was the force with which it was sent that the head showed at the back of the neck godfreys bullet struck it in the chest and the bear at once rolled over thinking it was killed he crawled from under the boat and ran forward but the animal suddenly rose to its feet running up alongside he placed the muzzle close to its ear and pulled the other trigger    illustration luka faces the bear  it is dead now luka he shouted as he bent over it at the same moment he heard a cry of warning and was simultaneously struck a heavy blow which stretched him on the ground beside the bear it flashed through his mind that his assailant was the female bear he had heard from the ostjaks that the best plan if attacked by an enraged bear was to sham death and he therefore lay without moving a muscle as he was struck down he heard the twang of lukas bow and jacks sharp barking close to his ear then with a deep angry growl the bear left him and rushed towards the tent godfrey at once sprang to his feet he had not brought his spear with him as he crawled out but he sprang to the fire and dragged out a brand luka had discharged another arrow and jack was harassing the bear by snapping at its hindlegs in terror for the safety of the canoe rather than that of luka who could he knew well defend himself godfrey leapt forward and struck the bear across the nose with the brand with a roar of fury it turned upon him but as it did so it exposed its side to luka who discharged another arrow behind its shoulder it rolled over and over but again gained its feet the pause however had given luka time to emerge from under the boat with his spear in his hand and running up he thrust it right through the body and the bear fell over dead then he ran to godfrey  are you hurt he asked  i am hurt a bit luka for i felt a sharp pain as the beast knocked me over but i do not think it can be much it was very lucky that we put our fur jackets on again if it hadnt been for that i expect he would have regularly laid open my shoulder  he took off his coat the bears claws had penetrated through the skin and had scored three gashes on his shoulder but these luka said were of no great depth and beyond making his arm stiff for paddling for a day or two would matter little  they at once set about skinning the two bears put the four hams carefully aside cut off most of the meat gave jack another hearty meal and then retired again to their shelter  my heart was in my mouth when i saw him rushing at the tent if he had struck the boat or thrown his weight upon it it would have been a terrible business  i was afraid too luka said i was just going to shoot again when you struck him on the nose and so gave me a chance of hitting him in a vital spot if it hadnt been for your blow i should hardly have stopped him he was so close that even if i wounded him mortally he would have come down on the boat  well it is fortunate it has ended so luka it will be a lesson to me when i shoot a bear next to look out for its mate and also not to leave my spear behind me or to advance towards a bear i think dead until i have loaded my gun again  for two days longer they had to remain in their shelter but the third morning when they awoke the wind had died away and the sun was shining brightly as there was still some sea on godfrey determined to stay another day and explore the coast a little leaving luka to look after the boats and goods in case any more bears might be in the neighbourhood he started with jack he was amazed at the quantity of birds that he met withthrushes wagtails warblers chifchaffs fieldfares and redpoles rose at every step the air quivered with the song of innumerable larks which mingled with those of the willowwarblers snipe in considerable numbers sprang up and darted off with a sharp cry from almost under his feet plovers circled round and round ducks of various kinds passed between the shore and as godfrey supposed inland swamps or lakes martins in great numbers darted hither and thither hawking for insects occasionally birds which he supposed to be grouse rose with a loud whirr  short as was the time since the snow had cleared off the ground spring had come in with marvellous rapidity the grass was already wellnigh kneedeep and flowers of various kinds were in full bloom where the ground was comparatively bare of grass it was studded with the yellow blossoms of wild heartsease and amongst some stunted aldertrees godfrey found a dwarf rose already in bud and wild onions and wild rhubarb in flower then he came upon a broad expanse of a shrub that looked to him like a rhododendron with a flower with a strong aromatic scent several times he heard the call of a cuckoo on a patch of sand there were some wild anemones in blossom godfrey pulled a bulb of wild onion cut off a slice and tasted it it was similar in flavour to the cultivated plant but very sharp and acrid however he set to work and pulled up several dozen bulbs they were small not exceeding the size of a radish but they would be very valuable as one of them chopped fine would be sufficient to give a savour to a whole goose  turning to the right and coming down upon the shore he saw that the edge of the water was fringed with seagulls of various kinds picking up tiny fish as the waves broke in sandy coves or scuttling into the water and making sudden dips and dives into it farther out flocks of black ducks were feeding while two or three pairs of swans passed overhead going north presently he saw three or four native huts ahead some reindeer were grazing near them and three boats were hauled upon the shore these were doubtless samoyedes as soon as he caught sight of them he turned he had heard that the samoyedes although more friendly than the tunguses with strangers were much less to be depended upon than the ostjaks and as he had no faith in being able to explain what he was doing there with his comparatively limited command of the ostjak language he thought it better to return at once to luka he found when he reached the tent that the tartar was beginning to feel anxious for he had been four hours absent as they had abundance of food and had no occasion to trade with the natives at present they decided not to pay a visit to them  as soon as dinner had been cooked they set to work to get everything in readiness for a start the stores were taken out of the canoe and she was carried down to within a few feet of the water the tent was dismantled and the boat also carried down then they devoted themselves for the rest of the afternoon to collecting more driftwood for the water was again falling and the highest level it had reached was strewn with debris as there was now no practical distinction between night and day they lay down and slept for four or five hours then put the large canoe into the water and placed the firewood in her with the stock of flour frozen meat and the bears flesh then with the kettle and fryingpan they baled eight or ten buckets of water into her for godfrey did not know how soon the river would become brackish they spread the bearskin over all then having carefully repacked the canoe they put her also into the water stepped the mast took their places in her hoisted the sail and with the boat in tow started north again  the wind was from the south and with the assistance of the current they went along rapidly but nevertheless the paddles were got to work as now that they were fairly on their way again every mile gained was of importance they kept about a mile from shore so as to take advantage of the current in twenty minutes the native encampment was passed they saw no one moving about there and supposed that they must all be asleep for the sun was low down on the horizon godfreys watch was still going but as he had had no opportunity of comparing it with any other timepiece for just a year he could only consider it to be an approximate guide once a month or so he had made a point of setting it this he did by sticking up a pole and measuring the shadow it cast knowing that this would be at its shortest at twelve oclock by this means he calculated that he was never more than half an hour wrong  the shore continued very flat and once or twice they saw sandbanks stretching out a considerable distance sometimes both paddled sometimes godfrey steered only and luka laid in his paddle three times in the course of the day the big canoe was pulled up and luka went on board and cooked a meal the flat slab on which they lit their fire having been raised three or four inches above the bottom to keep it out of the water hitherto godfrey had done all the steering when the boat was under sail but he now instructed luka little teaching was indeed needed as the steering was done with the paddle and luka was accustomed to keeping the boat straight when paddling he was however nervous with the sail which was boomed straight out with a light spar godfrey had cut for the purpose however as the wind was dead aft there was no fear of this jibing so long as the boats course was kept true this was rendered all the more easy by the steady drag of the boat astern  twelve hours after starting godfrey told luka to lie down and sleep as he intended that so long as they had favourable winds they should continue their voyage without stopping there was no occasion for going ashore the bears flesh would last them as long as it kept good and they had plenty of water on board for at least a fortnight in a few minutes luka was sound asleep jack lay on the deck in front of him sometimes sleeping sometimes waking up and giving a sharp bark in reply to the cry of a seagull passing overhead or a flock of black ducks skimming along close to the surface of the water within fifty yards of the boat     chapter xv  coasting   the current was now losing its power and godfrey dipping his hand into the water and then putting it to his lips found that it was distinctly brackish and congratulated himself upon having laid in a stock of water when he did after luka had slept for six hours godfrey roused him  now luka you must take my place and steer move very carefully else we shall capsize her that is it now if there is any change you lean forward and touch me i shall wake in a moment if the sail should shift over to the other side all you have got to do is to shift this sheet to its fastening on that side with this light wind jibing does not matter at all but if the wind freshens wake me at once  for a quarter of an hour godfrey watched to see that luka steered steadily then he worked himself down in the cockpit and closed his eyes it did not seem to him that he had been asleep long when luka touched him  i would not have woke you luka said but the land seems going right away from us  godfrey sat up so it is luka i should not be surprised if that is the extreme northern point of course it may be only a deep bay but at any rate we must see he looked at his watch why i have been asleep nearly seven hours now luka you had better haul the boat alongside and see about cooking we forgot to try those onions yesterday cut one up small and put it in the pan with the meat by the by you had better tie a piece of cord to those four bears hams and let them tow overboard for two or three hours the water must be quite salt now and when you take them out we will rub a little fresh salt into them they ought to keep well then  as soon as luka had got into the boatjack jumping in with him as he always made a point of superintending the cooking operationsgodfrey took his place in the stern jibed the sail which had before been on the port quarter over to starboard brought her head somewhat to the north of west and hauled in the sheet lying over till the water nearly touched her gunwale the light little craft would have gone speedily along had it not been for the drag of the boat astern this however towed lightly for she was loaded with but a very small proportion of the weight she would carry godfrey judged by the objects on the shore that they could not be going along less than three miles an hour in six hours the land trended away due south and he knew that they had now reached the first of the two deep bays they would have to pass before reaching the northern extremity of the cape he kept on his course and an hour later with the exception of the low coast nearly astern no land was to be seen luka who was paddling steadily looked round he had such implicit confidence in his companion that he was quite sure the boat was keeping the right course but he had a vague sense of uneasiness at seeing nothing but sea around him  how do you know which way to go he asked  i know that by keeping on the same way we were going past the last land we shall strike the coast again on the other side of this bay i think it is twenty or thirty miles across i can tell the way by the wind in the first place and in the second place by the position of the sun you see it is over my right shoulder at present there is the mark of my shadow on the side i have got to keep it about there making some allowance for the change in the position of the sun  luka understood this but suppose the wind was to change he said  i should know it by the position of the sun you see at present it comes nearly due south and is blowing almost straight towards the sun but if it were very cloudy or at night when i could not see the sun i should not be able to tell then after holding on till i felt sure that we were well past the mouth of this bay i should put her about on the other tack and should be sure to come upon the land sooner or later anyhow even in the darkest night we should know if the wind had gone round to the north as it would be so much colder besides there is never a great shift of wind like that without knowing it the one wind is sure to drop and there would be something like a dead calm before the other set in anyhow with a bright sun and a steady wind like this we cannot go wrong and you will see land ahead in seven or eight hours  it was less than six hours when godfrey saw the low land ahead and they were presently coasting along it again with the wind free for they were now running but little to the west of north thirty miles farther there was another break in the coast  that was a firstrate map i made the tracing from godfrey said the coastline is most accurately marked now we have another run of about the same distance as the last then there is about fifty miles almost due north then we shall be round this other cape  they made the passage safely across although it took them longer than the first for the wind dropped lighter and they had both to use their paddles  we have just done it in time luka and that is all if we had been half an hour later there would be nothing for it but to anchor look at that white cloud on the water that is a fog we are only just in time i am heading for that cove paddle hard luka or it will be on us now before we get there  they had just entered the cove which was forty or fifty feet wide and ran as many yards into the land when the fog rolled over them  it is like a wet blanket godfrey said it is thirty or forty degrees colder than it was a minute back paddle very slowly and carefully now luka and dip your paddle deeply in i want to go as far up this creek as i can but i dont want to run ashore  very gently they paddled on until godfrey felt the ground at a depth of about three feet that will do nicely he said now i will drop the anchor over  the anchor was one of ostjak manufacture it consisted of a long flat narrow stone weighing about six pounds to each of the flat sides were lashed two pieces of fir about an inch and a half in diameter they projected a few inches below the stone and were cut off just below a branch of about an inch in diameter and eight or ten inches long these branches when growing bent downwards and slanted at an angle closely resembling that of the fluke of an anchor with the upright the whole therefore was an excellent imitation of an anchor with four flukes two on each side the stone serving as a weight this was thrown out of the bow of the canoe and a couple of fathoms of line let out then godfrey hauled up the larger boat and fastened it alongside they could just make out the outline of the shore about fifteen feet on either side of them  we must take to our fur jackets again luka my teeth are chattering and after working as hard as we have been doing for the last three or four hours it wont do to get a chill i am as hungry as a hunter we had breakfast at five oclock by my watch and it is three now  luka soon lit the fire in the boat the provisions in the canoe had been finished two days before as they had been obliged to throw overboard what they had not eaten owing to its having become unfit for use the food however wrapped up in furs in the boat was still solidly frozen they cut a couple of fish out of the mass and placed them in the fryingpan stuck a wooden skewer through some pieces of bears meat and held them in the flame and hung the bears hams as they did each time they cooked in the smoke of the fire  we must try to get some more fish next time we set sail luka i am sure we passed through several shoals of fish by the swirling of the water  it was thirtysix hours before the fog cleared off swept away by a southwesterly wind as they had nothing to do but to eat and sleep during this time they got up their anchor and hoisted their sail the moment the fog cleared off and in eighteen hours reached the sharp point of the cape rounding this godfrey said  now luka we are at the mouth of the gulf of obi it is nearly two hundred miles according to this map to the opposite side and we darent try to make that besides the wind has been getting more to the west and would be right in our teeth for you see by this tracing the opposite point of land is a good bit to the south of west there is nothing for it but for us to keep along this shore for something like a hundred and fifty miles we can lay our course well with this wind the gulf wont be more than eighty miles wide there and we can strike across and coast down the opposite bank it seems a long way round but we shall do it as quickly as we should beating right across in the teeth of this wind i doubt if we could do that at all with this craft behind us  fortunately the wind was not high or they could not have ventured out as a heavy swell would have set in from the other side of the gulf they kept their course within half a mile of the shore  what are those black things on that low point godfrey asked i can hear them barking they must be tremendously big dogs if they are dogs  they are seals luka said they go right up the rivers in summer and the samoyedes and yuruks kill great numbers on the coast they eat the flesh and sell the teeth for ivory  well we dont want them at present godfrey said but if we fall short of food we will see whether we can kill some at present the great thing is to get on  night and day the canoe kept on her way except when godfrey was asleep luka did not steer for he did not like the management of the sail especially now that the boat at times heeled over a great deal with the beam wind he himself took his sleep by fits and starts two or three hours at a time and except when cooking paddled away assiduously twice godfrey was lucky enough to bring down some ducks when a flock swept past the boat within shot they had too a supply of fresh fish for godfrey now always had two lines out towing astern with some white geese feathers fastened to the hooks as bait ordinarily they caught nothing but they passed through several large shoals of fish and at these times they pulled them out as fast as they could haul in and let go the lines sometimes bringing in three or four at a time as there were six hooks on each line these fish were herrings and they formed a welcome change luka had never seen one before for although they penetrate for some distance up the great rivers they never ascend to the upper waters jack too benefited greatly for of late he had been kept on somewhat short rations as they had now been reduced to the four halfcured bears hams and a comparatively small stock of frozen food  on the fifth day after rounding the cape the wind which had been gradually getting lighter dropped altogether and for the next two days both of them worked steadily with their paddles  we must have made a good two hundred miles godfrey said and we could safely venture to strike across in such quiet weather as this but there is a river marked on the chart as coming in somewhere here and i want to find it if i can there is water enough for another week but it begins to taste horribly of skin and besides that it has a considerable mixture of ashes i am sure we must be very close to it indeed according to my calculation of two hundred miles we ought to have passed it already anyhow we will keep on until we get there  godfrey was not far out for late in the day they saw an opening of some fifty yards wide in the bank they at once made for it and entering it paddled along as near the bank as they could go to avoid the current godfrey tasted the water from time to time and after paddling for two hours pronounced it perfectly sweet  we will land here luka i am sure we both want to stretch our limbs a bit and have a rest look about for a good place to land the banks are too steep to be able to get the big canoe up but we can carry the otherit is light enough now  they presently found a place where a portion of the bank had fallen in and left a gap here they landed moored the large canoe to the shore and carried the other up the bank an exclamation of pleasure broke from godfrey at the wide expanse of bright green dotted with flowers jack was exuberant in his delight circling round and round like a wild thing barking loudly and occasionally throwing himself down to roll the two paddles were driven firmly into the ground the sail unlaced from the yard which was lashed to the paddles as a ridgepole over which the sail was thrown the furs were taken out of the boat and spread in the tent  we will have a cup of tea luka and then turn in for twelve hours sleep i am sure we deserve it  after a long rest they woke thoroughly refreshed then while luka was lighting a fire godfrey went down to the river stripped and had a short swim the water being too cold to permit his stopping more than two or three minutes in it when they had had breakfast he said  now luka do you go down to the boat take the firewood out and then sluice the boat thoroughly with water and get it perfectly clean by the time you have done that i shall be back and we will then lift her out of the water and turn her bottom upwards to dry thoroughly then we will melt down some of that bear fat we saved and give her a thorough rubbing with it but we will leave that job until tomorrow it will take fourandtwenty hours for her to dry i am going out with my gun to see what i can shoot the whole place seems full of birds though they are mostly small ones still i might come across something better you had better keep jack with you  godfreys expedition was not a very successful one he brought back four grouse and a dozen small birds which he had killed with a single shot firing into the thick of a flock that flew by overhead the grouse were roasted for dinner and godfrey found to his satisfaction that luka had baked a pile of cakes this being the first time they had tasted bread for a fortnight as it demanded more time and attention than they could spare to it in the boat luka told him that several flights of black duck had passed up the river while he had been at work at the boat and volunteered to grease the boat next day if godfrey would try to get a shot at them  it will be of no use my trying to shoot them on the river godfrey said as i should have no means of picking them up and i can tell you i found the water too cold this morning to care about stripping and swimming out for them i will have another try on the plain i saw four or five deer today but only the first passed within shot and as i had not a bullet in the gun he got off without my firing at him i will try tomorrow if i cant stalk one  accordingly the next day godfrey set out after an hours walking he saw three deer he worked round very cautiously so as to get a clump of bushes between him and them and then crawled up to it and looked through they were a hundred and fifty yards away and he had no confidence in his gun at that distance he stood for some time thinking and then remembered he had read that on the american plains the deer were often decoyed into coming close up to the hunter by working upon their curiosity he drew his ramrod out from his gun put the cap he worewhich was the fur one with tailson to the end of it pushed this through the bushes and began to wave it to and fro the deer caught sight of it immediately and stood staring at it for a minute or two ready to bound away should the strange object seem to threaten danger as nothing came of it they began to move towards it slowly and with hesitation until they gathered in a group at a distance of not more than fifty yards  godfrey while waving the cap with one hand was holding his gun in readiness with the other feeling sure that he could not miss the mark now he gently lowered the cap and raised his gun to his shoulder slight as was the movement it startled the deer but as they turned to fly he fired both barrels at the shoulder of the one nearest to him and had the satisfaction of seeing it fall while its companions dashed away over the plain he ran up to the fallen animal and found that it was already dead both bullets having struck it in the region of the heart he proceeded to cut off the head and the lower part of the legs opened and cleaned it and was then able to lift it on to his shoulder as he neared the tent jack came tearing along to meet him with loud barks of welcome  yes i have got food for you for some time jack though it does not seem to me that you do much to earn it  luka was at work greasing the boat godfrey called him up on to the bank  we must try and do something to preserve the meat luka  shall we rub it with salt godfrey  we can spare some salt but not much it would never do to be left without that we can do well enough without bread but we cant do without salt  smoke it well luka said  we might try that but i am afraid those hams are beginning to go  not smoke enough godfrey  no i suppose not  they must have plenty lots of smoke  well there is plenty of wood to make smoke with  we must keep it close luka said we ought to smoke it for two days  we can keep it close enough by cutting some poles and making a circular tent with the sail it will spoil its whiteness but that is of no great consequence you had better leave the boat for the present luka and come with me and cut poles and boughs for the fire  taking hatchets they started out and presently cut eight poles ten feet long  now which is the best wood for smoking it with  pine makes the best smoke next to oak  there are plenty of stunted pines about and i should think some of this aromatic shrub with it would be good i will make up two big bundles of that and we will take them and the poles back first then we will cut some pine boughs  as all these were obtained within a few hundred yards of the camp they had soon materials for their fire the poles were then stuck in a circle and lashed together at the top the sail taken down and wrapped round it it was not large enough but by adding the stormsail and the hide of the deer the covering was made complete then a number of sticks were tied from pole to pole across it the deerflesh was then cut up into strips of about a foot long three or four inches wide and half an inch thick and these were hung over the sticks until the whole of the deer was so disposed of the three remaining bears hams were also hung up and a fire of the pinewood was then with some difficulty lighted and some of the sweetsmelling shrub laid on it godfrey who had undertaken this part of the business while luka went back to the boat crawled out from the tent almost blinded  by jove he said as he closed the aperture if it is as bad as that now that it is only just lighted the meat ought to be smoked as dry as a chip by tomorrow  godfrey had nothing to do now but to watch the smoke rising from the opening at the top of the tent opening the entrance a little whenever it slackened drawing the sticks together with the iron ramrod and throwing on a fresh armful of the fuel having finished greasing the boat luka did the same to the canoe they spent the next twentyfour hours in alternately sleeping collecting driftwood on the riverbank and attending to the fire which had to be watched carefully and some dry splinters added from time to time to get the green wood to keep alight every hour or two a piece of meat was taken out and examined and in thirty hours from the time of lighting the fire luka pronounced that it was done the strips had shrivelled to half their former thickness and were almost black in colour  they will give us plenty of work for our teeth luka godfrey said they look almost like shoeleather but perhaps they will be better than they look i once tasted some smoked reindeer tonguesat least they called them reindeer tongues but i do not suppose they wereand they were firstrate now there is nothing more to do let us get ready for another start  the sail was taken off and the poles chopped into fivefeet lengths  we will lay them in the bottom of the boat luka four longways and four crossways as there are sixteen of them that will make the top line five or six inches above the floor then we will lay our firewood on them in that way it wont get wet with the water and what is quite as important it wont dirty the water  this was done the flour and deers flesh were stowed on similar platforms fore and aft of the firewood and covered with skins some twelve buckets of water were then baled in what remained of the frozen provisions was inspected but it was agreed that as it had already melted a good deal it would not be eatable much longer and as they had food enough to last for some time it was of no use keeping it it was therefore broken up jack was allowed to eat as much as he wanted and the rest was left when everything was packed the canoe was carried down and placed in the water and they took their places jack jumped on board and a fresh start was made  as soon as they emerged from the small river they struck out straight from the land the wind was light and from the north and both took their paddles their four days rest had done them good and the canoe under the influence of sail and oar went fast through the water  twentyfour hours ought to take us across godfrey said the gulf looks from eighty to ninety miles across at the point where the river runs into it we must head rather to the south for there is sure to be a current out in the middle as the obi is a big river  it was however thirty hours before they reached the opposite shoregodfrey accounting for the difference on the supposition that the stream must have been a good deal stronger than they expected and must have drifted them down a long way they found indeed that even inshore they were passing the land at a rate of nearly two miles an hour  that is all the better luka for with this north wind our sail will be no good to us we may as well get it down at once and stow it the shores are muddy i see so we shall not hurt the canoe if we should drift up against it that is a comfort for we can both go to sleep i am sure after thirty hours paddling with only two or three long easies we deserve a rest first of all we must have a meal one does not know whether to call it dinner or supper when there is no night and we sleep just when we are tired  they had caught eight or ten fish as they came across passing through a great shoal of herrings in half an hour the kettle was boiling over the fire the fish were hissing and crackling in the fryingpan over it and a strip of deers flesh with the ramrod run through it was frizzling it was pronounced excellent there was a slight aromatic bitterness that gave a zest and flavour to it and the flesh inside was by no means so tough as godfrey had expected to find it when all three of the voyagers had satisfied their hunger the brands were as usual extinguished the embers thrown overboard then returning to the canoe they lay down and were in a very few minutes fast asleep they slept for six hours and when they woke the land was no longer in sight  it is lucky there is no fog godfrey said and that we have the sun to act as a compass we cant be many miles out we wont make straight for shore luka we will head about northwest so as to edge in gradually there must be a good deal of current here and it will be helping us along  in an hour the low line of coast was visible and they then headed still more to the north  there must be a good threemileanhour current here godfrey observed presently we are going along firstrate past the shore it took us over five days to come up at this rate we shall go down in two  they paddled steadily for twelve hours stopping once only to cook a meal then they went close inshore again had supper and slept when they woke they found they were still within a mile of the shore and the current was now taking them along no more than a mile an hour  the gulf must be wide here luka i dont think we should gain anything by going out four or five miles farther so we will keep about as we are we ought to be at the point by the end of todays work we were two hundred miles up i expect we drifted down fiveandtwenty miles in crossing and we must have passed the land at a good five miles an hour yesterday so that we ought not to be more than thirty or forty miles from the point for this peninsula does not go as far north as the other by twenty or thirty miles  after eight hours paddling they found themselves at the mouth of a deep bay  that is all right godfrey said examining his tracing that land on the farther side of the bay is the northern point of the gulf we will paddle across there and anchor by the shore for tonight tomorrow we shall have a long paddle for it is seventy or eighty miles nearly due west to a sheltered bay that lies just this side of cape golovina once round that we have nearly four hundred miles to go nearly due south into kara bay this long tongue of land we are working round is called the yamal peninsula once fairly down into kara bay we shall leave siberia behind us and the land will be russia  they struck across the bay and landed under shelter of the cape the land was higher here than any they had before met and after their sleep godfrey took his gun accompanied by jack and ascended the hill  it is rum he said to himself as he gazed over the wide expanse of sea to the north that this should be one sheet of ice in the winter i do not like the look of those clouds away to the north i think we are going to have either a fog or a gale we wont make a move till we see this coast seems rocky and it wont do to make along it unless we have settled weather  he returned and told luka and then wandered away again as he had seen that birds were very plentiful and he returned in three hours to the boat with a dozen grouse six ptarmigan and a capercailzie godfrey was now a good shot and the birds never having been disturbed by the approach of man were so tame that he had no difficulty whatever in making a bag as he went down to the boat he congratulated himself that they had not made a start for the sky was now overcast and the wind was already blowing strongly  we will have some bread today luka these birds deserve something to eat with them and our flour is holding out well we have not eaten above twenty pounds since we started i wish we had some yeast or something to make it rise by the by i have an idea dont mix that till i come back luka  here as when he landed on the yenesei he had seen numbers of rough nests on the ground the birds being so tame that they often did not fly off even when he passed quite close to them he returned to a spot where he had seen these nests quite thick and had no difficulty in collecting a large number of little eggs of a great variety of colour  i expect about two out of every three are bad he said we shall have to break them singly to find out the good ones fancy making a cake of sparrows eggs  upon breaking them he found that not more than one in five was good still there were quite enough for the purpose the fryingpan was used as a basin and in this he made a sort of batter of eggs and flour by the time he had done this four of the grouse were nearly roasted he poured the batter into the empty kettle melted some deers fat in the pan and then poured in the batter again then he washed out and filled the kettle and placed it upon the fire  now by the time the water is boiling luka the batter and the grouse will be cooked that is what we call a yorkshire pudding at home it will go splendidly with the birds  the pudding turned out really good and they enjoyed the meal immensely jack having the bones of the four birds for his share together with the solitary fish they had caught the day before by the time they had finished they were glad to get up their tent which they pitched with the entrance close to the fire for even in the sheltered spot where they were fierce gusts of cold wind swept down upon them the canvas of the tent was fastened down by heavy stones placed upon it the furs brought in and everything made snug for three days the storm raged  it is a nuisance losing so much time godfrey said it was somewhere about the middle of june when we started and there are only three months of open weather here every day is of importance i shant so much mind when we get to the mouth of the petchora for i heard from one of the russians in the prison that canoes often go as far as that from archangel to trade so i shall feel when i get there that we are getting into civilized regions it is about four hundred miles from kara bay so that we have a good eight hundred miles to travel before we get there we can certainly paddle forty miles a day by sticking to it steadily but allowing for another stoppage of four days and we cant allow less than that that will be a fortnight how long have we been now luka there is nothing to count time from  luka shook his head  well it is somewhere above three weeks godfrey went on so that by the time we get to the mouth of the petchora it will be the last week in july that will give us a couple of months but i fancy we cant count much on the weather in september still if the canoes go from archangel to petchora and back we ought to be able to do it from petchora for the distance from there to archangel is a good deal less than from the mouth of the yenesei to the petchora there is one thing if the weather gets very bad on the way or we get laid up by bad weather for a long time on the way to petchora we can go up the river i hear to a place called ust zlyma and from there go overland to archangel it is about two hundred or two hundred and fifty miles across and we could walk that in ten days i am quite sure that we should not be suspected of being anything but what we look and at archangel there is sure to be a british consul and he would put us up to the best plan of getting out of the country however there will be plenty of time to see about that as we get on  the wind fell on the morning of the fourth day but it would be some hours before the sea would have gone down sufficiently for them to make a start godfrey again went out shooting this time accompanied by luka  godfrey was as fortunate as he had been before shooting three capercailzie and nineteen grouse while luka brought down with his arrows four capercailzie which he found sitting on stunted trees on their way back to the boat they collected a great quantity of eggs and came upon a rabbit warren  do not shoot luka said as godfrey cocked his gun it will frighten them all into their holes if you will go on with the dog i will lie down here and will bring you as many rabbits as i can carry  two hours later he came down to the tent with two dozen rabbits he had shot after cooking two of them and giving one to jack as his share they packed up all their belongings and again took to the canoe they used their paddles until round the cape and then heading westward hoisted their sail for what wind there was was still from the north and the help it afforded was sufficient greatly to reduce the labour of paddling they kept steadily on one or other taking occasional snatches of sleep but with this exception and that of the time spent by luka in cooking they continued to paddle until forty hours after starting they reached cape golovina passing between it and beloc island they did not make the halt they had intended under shelter of the cape for the weather was fine and godfrey wanted to take advantage of the north wind as long as it lasted once round the cape they headed nearly due south and the wind freshening a little drove them along merrily and they were able to cease paddling and to take a fair proportion of sleep alternately  luka was now getting more accustomed to the management of the sail and no longer feared an occasional jibe and night and dayif it could be called night when the sun never setthey continued their voyage along the coast of the yamal peninsula at the end of the fourth day the wind freshened so much that the large sail was taken down and the legofmutton sail substituted for it but as the wind continued to rise and the sea to get up fast godfrey began to look out for some spot into which to run for shelter the coast was very indented and broken and in two hours they passed the mouth of a deep bay into which the boat was at once directed and was presently moored under the shelter of its northern bank  she is a splendid seaboat godfrey said if it wasnt for the boat in tow i should not mind what weather i was out in her  their stay was of short duration for in a few hours the wind sank again i dont think it is done yet godfrey said when they were beyond the shelter of the bay i fancy it will blow up again presently still we may as well push on i think it is rather more from the east than it was  for the next twentyfour hours however there was no very marked change in the force of the wind but it had now veered round to the northeast  we are getting well down now godfrey said we have been sailing for five days and we have certainly been running a good three miles an hour from the time we rounded the cape so we are three hundred and fifty miles down i should say we must be entering kara bay  very bad weather coming luka said looking back  godfrey turned round a heavy black cloud was sweeping up with a misty line below it  by jove you are right that is a big squall and no mistake there is no bay to run to here luka and we could not get there in time if there was we must do as i talked about quick lower the sail down there is not a moment to lose no wait until i bring her up head to the wind now then down with it now unstep the mast lash that and the boom the other sail and its spar together that is the way and with their joint efforts the work was accomplished in a couple of minutes now then fasten this rope to your end luka i will tie the other end to mine that is right it is long enough to make a good big angle now fasten the headrope to the middle be sure it is put in the middle luka that is right now launch it overboard  the work was done as quickly as it is described and in three minutes from the time the mast was lowered the canoe was riding to the floating anchor  now then luka on with the apron  shall we sit up  no we will lie down cover up the holes and lash them carefully when we are in it is going to be a drencher and it is of no use our getting wet through to begin with we could not do anything with the paddles  they had scarcely made themselves snug when with a roar a deluge of rain fell on the deck and cover and a moment later even this sound was partly deadened by the howl of the wind although their heads were close together godfrey felt that it would be utterly useless to make any remark he felt under no uneasiness for with their weight well down and anchored head to sea he felt sure that the light canoe would ride over anything like a cork bottle the motion of the boat rapidly increased but she herself rode lightly over the waves as these increased the jerking of the boat behind at her rope became more and more violent and the canoe quivered from end to end with the shocks  this will never do godfrey said to himself the boat will pull the stern out of her it will be an awful loss to cut her adrift but it cant be helped  he unlashed the fastenings of the cover of the circular hole above him reached his hand forward and got hold of lukas paddle and passed it with his own out through the hole then he sat up himself confident as he felt in the canoe he was almost frightened at the wild aspect of the sea the wind was literally howling driving the rain before it with a force that stung godfreys neck as it struck it he got out a strip of deerskin lashing of which there was a supply always close at hand under the deck lashed the paddles together and then leaning aft lashed them at the centre firmly to the towrope then with some difficulty he got out his knife and cut the rope close to its fastening the paddles flew overboard and the boat drifted rapidly astern the drag of the paddles being as godfrey observed with satisfaction sufficient to keep her head to wind then he wriggled himself down underneath the apron again and lashed down the cover of the hole     chapter xvi  a samoyede encampment   the action of the canoe was altogether changed as soon as it was released from the strain of the boat behind there was no more tugging and jarring but she rose and fell on the waves almost imperceptibly  well jack old fellow what do you think of it godfrey said to the dog as it nestled up close to him here we are now out in a regular storm it is lucky we have plenty of searoom jack i reckon it is seventy or eighty miles across to the other side of the gulf and i dont suppose she can drag those spars through the water much more than a mile an hour so we have plenty of time before us we must both put away as much time in sleep as we can we have lost almost all our provisions old boy and our water which was of still more consequence it is very lucky i always made a rule of having the kettle filled and put on board here after each meal and of keeping a dozen pounds of meat here i thought we might be obliged to cast the boat adrift suddenly well if we have luck we may find it again we shall both drift in the same line and there is no reason why she shouldnt live through it the stock of firewood has gone down and she has not got above a couple of hundred pounds weight in her altogether i am afraid she will take enough salt water on board to spoil our supply of fresh but i think we are drifting pretty straight for the kara river i calculated that it lay dead to leeward of us when the wind went to the northwest  it was a considerable time before godfrey went off to sleep owing to the rapid changes of the angle at which he was lying sometimes his head was two or three feet higher than his feet and directly afterwards the position was exactly reversed the rolling was but slight and this he scarcely felt being too tightly packed in along with the furs and the dog to move much but at last the noise of the water and the roar of the wind lulled him to sleep he woke once and then went off again and his watch told him that he had been altogether asleep twelve hours when he next woke he felt at once that the motion was slighter than it had been and that the wind had greatly abated  are you asleep luka he shouted  i am not asleep now luka replied drowsily  the storm is pretty nearly over i will get the cover off and look round and then we will see if we cant boil some water and have some tea we have never used any of those candles yet this will be a good opportunity to try them  unlashing and removing the cover godfrey sat up and looked round the gale had broken black clouds were hurrying past overhead but there were patches of blue sky the sea was still very heavy but it was rarely that the canoe dipped her nose under a wave so lightly did she rise and fall over them  in a few hours we shall have our sail up again luka he said as the tartar thrust his head up through his opening it was but for a moment he instantly dived under again and replaced the cover appalled at the sea which was infinitely rougher than anything he had ever before witnessed  it looks pretty bad doesnt it godfrey said laughing as he too resumed his position of shelter  it is terrible luka said  i expect it has been worse at any rate as you can see we have got through it without taking a drop of water on board thanks to the floating anchor now i will pass the kettle forward to you be very careful with it for it is all the water we have  all the water why what has become of the boat luka exclaimed  i had to cut her adrift half an hour after the squall struck us did not you hear me look out when i took your paddle  i felt you take the paddle but there was too much noise to hear anything and i was too frightened to listen i thought that surely we should go to the bottom why did you cut her loose  because she was tugging so hard she would have pulled us to pieces and it was better to let her go than to risk that she will have drifted the same way we have done only she will have gone three times as fast for she was a good deal higher out of water and the paddles which i fastened on to her headrope wont have anything like the hold on the water that our spars have we will keep in the same direction when we get our sails up and if she has lived through it we shall very likely find her ashore somewhere along the coast now be sure you lash that kettle securely to the deckbeam luka put it as near one side as you can get it then there will be room for you to lie alongside and watch it but stop before you fasten it pour out half a mugful of water for jack he doesnt like tea and there will be nothing but tea for him after we have once made it  the candle was lighted and fixed under the kettle but the four wicks gave out such an odour that godfrey was glad to sit up again and remain outside until a nudge from luka told him that the tea was ready they ate with it some slices of raw bears ham luka offered to cook it but godfrey had had the candle put out the moment he got under the cover and would not hear of its being lighted again  it is not at all bad raw he said they eat raw ham in germany and that last smoking it got was almost as good as cooking it i expect the sea will have gone down in a few hours and then we can have a regular meal but if you were to light that smelly thing again now it would make me ill now jack i will light my pipe and look out again and you shall come out too for a breath of fresh air i will hold you tight and see that you dont go over  in twelve hours the sea had almost gone down the floating anchor was hauled up and unlashed the masts were stepped the large sail hoisted and free from the dead weight that had hitherto checked her speed the little craft sped along gaily before the gentle wind godfrey keeping her as near as possible dead before it on the chance that they might catch sight of the boat  if we drifted a mile an hour and she drifted three he said she would have gained fourandtwenty miles while we were asleep and perhaps since then she has been gaining a mile an hour so she is from thirtyfive to forty miles ahead of us and must be quite halfway across the gulf anyhow we need not begin to look out yet we are going about four knots an hour i should think and i dont suppose she is going more than one in about ten hours we must begin to look about for her  before the end of that time the sea had gone quite down and the wind had fallen so light that godfrey thought they were scarce making three knots an hour i hope it wont fall altogether he said for as we have no paddles it would be awkward for us  two of the bottom boards will do for paddles  yes i know that luka i am steering with one of them but they would do very little good for they are so thin that they would break off directly we put any strength on to them  godfrey occasionally stood up and looked round but could see no signs of the boat and indeed could hardly have done so unless he had passed within a couple of miles at most of her  the wind may have changed a little he said though i dont think it has done so anyhow i will head a little more to the south so as to be sure that we shall strike the shore to the east both of the kara river and the point she is likely to drift to  four hours later they made out land ahead of them some six miles away as they guessed and holding on reached it in two hours and a halfs time they stepped out as soon as they got into shallow water carried the canoe ashore drank a mug of cold tea and ate some raw meat and then lay down for a long sleep when they woke they collected some driftwood and lighting a fire cooked some meat  what are you going to do godfrey luka asked are you going to set out at once to look for the boat  no we had better wait for a few hours she may not have drifted to the shore yet though i do not think she can be far off still it is as well to give her plenty of time at any rate we can shoot some birds so the time wont be lost  having made a fair bag and been absent from the canoe for five hours they returned and after cutting up a capercailzie and grilling it over the fire they got the boat into the water and started  they had sailed about eight miles to the west when luka exclaimed there is something there by the shore close to that point it may be the boat it may be a rock  it was another quarter of an hour before godfrey was able to assure himself that it was really the boat thank god for that luka he exclaimed we have reason to thank him for a great many things i do so every hour and i hope you do so too but finding the boat again safe seems to me the greatest blessing we have had yet i dont know what we should have done without it  another quarter of an hour brought them to the point the boat lay just afloat bumping on the sand as each little wave lifted and left her they sprang out of the canoe into shallow water and threw out the anchor and then waded to the boat she had about four inches of water in her but was entirely uninjured  hurrah godfrey shouted she is as good as ever now luka get everything out of her as soon as you can then we can turn her over and empty her put the things in again and be off at once we have got no time to lose for you must remember there is not much more than a quart of cold tea left in the kettle i am sure the kara river cant be very far off but i cant say whether it is three miles or thirty  in half an hour they were again afloat and working their paddles to assist the sail two hours later luka said huts on that point ahead of us  so there are godfrey said six or eight of them and a lot of cattle  reindeer luka corrected samoyede village  why there must be hundreds of them godfrey said in surprise  yes the ostjaks told me in our old camp that many of the samoyedes had five hundred and some of them a thousand reindeer they keep them just as we do cattle their wealth is counted by their reindeer they make their clothes of its skin its milk and flesh are their chief food it draws their sledges and when they want money they can sell some of them  did you ask how much they can be sold for  yes the ostjaks said that they were worth here two or three roubles each  then if there are many of these encampments along the shore luka we need not trouble about food and if anything happens to our boat we can make a couple of sledges buy four reindeer and start by land  then we should have to wait until winter luka said  yes that would be a nuisance but it would not be so very long to wait i had no idea reindeer were so cheap if i had i think instead of spending the winter hunting i would have bought some reindeer and started to drive still it would have been a terrible journey and perhaps we have done better as it is well shall we land what do you think  we dont want anything luka said the samoyedes are generally friendly they are not like the tunguses and yuraks but you see there are but two of us and we have hatchets and knives and other things they value if we wanted anything i should say let us land but as we dont it would be better to go on  you are right luka i dont suppose there would be any risk of being robbed still it is just as well not to run even the smallest chance of trouble when everything is going on so well  on passing the point on which the encampment was situated they saw a wide opening the kara godfrey exclaimed joyously we will cross to the other side and coast up on that shore till the water becomes fresh  it required four hours sailing and paddling before they got beyond the influence of the sea then they landed shot and hunted for a couple of days took in a fresh supply of water and started again  we have passed the line of the ural mountains now godfrey said the kara rises in that range we may almost consider ourselves in russia  one morning luka woke godfrey soon after he had lain down for his turn of sleep  fog coming he said  godfrey sat up and looked round that it is luka we must head for shore directly he seized his paddle but the fog cloud had drifted rapidly down upon them and before they were halfway to shore drifts of white cloud floated past them on the water and five minutes later they were surrounded by a dense white wall so thick that even the canoe towing behind was invisible they ceased paddling  there is nothing to do but to wait godfrey said get your fur coat on it is bitterly cold there is one comfort what wind there is is towards the shore and we shall drift that way  i cant feel any wind at all luka said  no it is very slight but there must have been some to bring this fog down from the north we were not more than half a mile from the shore when it closed in upon us if we only drift fifty yards an hour we shall be there in time let us have a cup of tea and then we will rig up the cover and turn in we have a lot of sleep to make up for there is one comfort there is no chance of our being run down  godfrey saw by his watch when he woke that he had been asleep for four hours and he sat up and looked round the fog was as thick as before the movement woke luka and he too sat up  listen luka godfrey exclaimed as he was about to speak i heard a bird chirp the sound was repeated it is over there godfrey said hurrah we shall soon be ashore and they seized their paddles  after rowing for a minute or two they stopped and again listened there it is again godfrey said right ahead paddle gently luka we shant see the shore until we are on it and we must not risk running head on to a rock presently something dark appeared just in front of the canoe  hold water godfrey exclaimed and as they stopped her way the boat drifted quietly against a rock they brought her broadside to it and stepped out  that is a comfort the fog can last for a week now let us get the canoe ashore we can moor the boat the water is as smooth as glass and there is no risk whatever of her damaging herself bring an armful of firewood ashore he went on as they laid the canoe down gently on a flat rock i will look about for a place for the tent  do not go far or you will lose yourself  i will take care of that i wont go beyond speaking distance  godfrey soon found a patch of sand large enough for the tent and this was soon erected and a fire lit jack as usual indulged in a wild scamper but returned to godfreys whistle dont go too far jack or you will be losing your way too  the fog did not clear off for another fortyeight hours but when at the end of that time they looked out of their tent the sky was clear and the birds were singing gaily the ground rose almost perpendicularly behind them to a height of from twenty to thirty feet it was rocky with some deep indentations  we will do some shooting luka but as there may be some natives near we will hide the canoe it is no use running any risks we will stow the tent and get everything packed before we start and then we shall be able to set out when we return  the canoe was packed and carried some fifty yards along the shore and then laid behind a great boulder that had fallen at the mouth of a cleft in the rock  shall we pull up the boat luka asked  no i dont think that is worth while there is nothing there worth stealing the natives have got plenty of fish of their own no doubt and driftwood too now let us be off  the birds were scarcer than usual and they wandered a long distance before they had made up anything like their usual bag  we have been eight hours out godfrey said looking at his watch we may as well have a meal before we start back it will take us two or three hours to get to the boat again there will be no loss of time it takes no longer cooking here than it would there and we may as well carry the birds inside as out  they were engaged in eating their meal when jack suddenly gave an angry growl and looking up they saw a party of a dozen samoyedes with bows and arrows at a distance of fifty yards behind them they sprang to their feet  shall i shoot luka asked  no no luka their intentions may be friendly besides though we might kill three or four of them they would riddle us with arrows we had best meet them as friends  when the samoyedes came up luka gave them the ordinary salutation of friendship  where come from the man who seemed to be the leader of the natives asked suspiciously  a long way from the east luka said pointing in that direction  who are you  ostjak luka said knowing that the samoyedes would have heard of that tribe but would know nothing of his own  who this the native asked pointing to godfrey  a friend of ostjaks luka said come to hunt and shoot i come with him  this samoyede country the native said not want ostjaks here  we do no harm luka said we go west far along not want samoyede country buy milk of samoyedes good friends  the samoyedes talked together and then the leader said come without any appearance of hesitation godfrey and luka set off with the natives their language though differing from that of the northern ostjaks was sufficiently alike for them to be able to understand each other  do you think they mean to be friendly godfrey asked in russian  i dont know luka replied perhaps not made up their minds yet  they are going down to the coast that is a comfort luka they are going to the west of our boats i suppose they have an encampment there i expect they heard my gun and have been following us at a distance until they saw us sit down  must have seen them luka said  only one may have been following us and may have sent the others back to fetch up the rest from their tents well it does not matter now they have got us if they ask where we came from as i expect they will you had better tell them luka we came in a boat they will guess it without our telling and will very likely look for it it is better to make no concealment  two hours walking brought them to a little valley in the middle of which ran a small stream they followed it down for half a mile and then at a sudden turn they saw the sea in front of them a cluster of ten samoyede yourts and a herd of reindeer feeding on the slope behind them a number of women and children and five or six old men came out to look at them as they approached  sit down and let us talk the leader said as they reached the village and set the example by seating himself by a large fire godfrey and luka at once did the same  the ostjak and his friend have come very far he said  a long distance luka replied we have travelled many days and are going to the petchora  have you reindeer did you walk all the way  no we have no reindeer we came in a boat you will find it along the shore  how far  about an hours walk i should say  the samoyede gave an order and two of the men at once left the circle got into a canoe and paddled away  the strangers will stay here for a day or two we have plenty of milk and fish  luka nodded we are in no hurry to go on we have plenty of time to reach the petchora before the winter sets in  the samoyede spoke to one of the women and she set to work to clear out one of the tents the chief got up and walked away and the conference was evidently over three hours later they saw the canoe reappear at the mouth of the river with the boat towing behind it the samoyedes gathered on the shore to examine it evidently surprised at its form and size which differed entirely from their own which were little craft capable of holding two at most they tasted the water at the bottom of the boat and found it to be fresh the stove for cooking spoke for itself and as there was firewood meat flour and some rough furs there seemed all that was necessary for a journey when they returned the chief asked luka  is that ostjak canoe  yes but it is built much larger than our canoes generally are as it was for long journey  presently the women brought a large bowl of reindeer milk and some fried fish as they were eating four of the men who were standing behind suddenly threw themselves upon godfrey and luka while the others closed in and in a minute they were securely bound hand and foot godfrey made no struggle for he felt that it would be useless and might result in his being shot or stabbed the hatchets and knives were taken from their belts and they were then carried to the tent and thrown down jack had fought fiercely biting several of the natives until he was struck with a spear in the shoulder by the chief when he limped off uttering piercing yells  what do you think they mean to do with us luka godfrey asked will they hand us over to the russians do you think cowardly blackguards i wish now we had fought at first  no wont hand us to russians too far off they dont think of that they have taken us for the sake of our hatchets and knives and of your gun perhaps they will keep us to work for them perhaps they will cut our throats  it is not a pleasant lookout either way still if they keep us we are safe to get away before long we must hope for the best i wonder they havent taken my ammunition and the other things  not know about pockets luka said they would have taken them if they had  two or three hours later the samoyedes came in and carefully examined the captives lashings their hands were tied behind them with reindeer thongs which were so tightly bound that they almost cut into the skin and their feet were equally firmly lashed in a few minutes the sound of talk ceased and the camp became quiet  i suppose it is their bedtime godfrey said if the fools do not set a guard over us we shall soon be free  how is that luka asked  we will gnaw through one of the thongs of course there can be no difficulty about that we will give them an hour to get to sleep and then we will set to work what is that ah jack is it you as the dog crept in between them with low whines poor old chap you did your best i cant pat you now roll yourself to the door and look out luka  there are three of them sitting by a fire but it will be darker presently and they will not see usfor although it could scarcely be called night the sun now dipped for an hour or two below the horizon at midnight  well see or not see we will go luka if we are to be killed it shall be making a fight for it and not having our throats cut like sheep now i think you are more accustomed to chewing tough food than i am so i will roll over on my face and do you set to work and bite through the thong  lukas sharp teeth cut through the twisted hide in five minutes it was a quarter of an hour more before godfreys hands recovered their usual feeling as soon as they were efficient he unfastened the thongs round his companions wrists and those round their feet  now then luka put your head out and see if you can see my gun  gun sure to be in chiefs tent luka said he looked out cant see gun my bow and arrows are lying on ground by chiefs tent  very well then you had better crawl round and fetch them first that will be something to begin a fight with anyhow here i will slit open the tent behind with my knife then you can crawl along past the others till you get to the chiefs tent without those fellows at the fires seeing you i am more afraid of those beastly dogs giving the alarm than of the men  godfrey cut a slit with his pocketknife in the reindeerskin covering and then luka crawled out he lay flat on his stomach and dragged himself along looking as godfrey thought in the twilight just like the seals he had seen crawling over the rocks he passed three of the yourts and then turned off in four or five minutes he reappeared with his bow and quiver of arrows and two native spears he crawled back as carefully as he had gone  give me the knife godfrey  godfrey handed it to him you are not going to kill anyone luka if they attack us of course we shall shoot them down in selfdefence but i would not have anyone killed in cold blood on any account  the tartar shook his head i am not going to kill anyone i looked into the tent the gun is leaning by the side of the chief women and children are lying all round couldnt get in i will cut a slit in skin and take gun  it will be firstrate if you can manage that luka we can make a good fight of it if you can manage to get the gun  godfrey was able to watch lukas proceedings now he stopped behind the fourth tent placed his ear against the skin and listened intently then he inserted the blade in the skin two feet above the ground and very quietly with a sawing motion cut downwards then he began at the top again and made a horizontal cut four or five inches long and then cut again down to the ground removing the flap of skin he peered into the tent then he inserted his arm a moment later he withdrew it with the gun and then returned to godfrey the latters first step was to charge the gun for he had fired two shots while luka was cooking the meal before they were surprised  now luka which do you think we had better do make for the canoes or go off on foot  we want big canoe luka said cant well do without it we had better go to that  i think so too godfrey said if we can once get on board we can beat them off of course there is more risk of being discovered that way but i think we had better chance it  they kept along for some distance on the side of the hill and then when about a hundred yards from the huts crawled down to the river crept back along the bank until they reached the boat which was hauled up with the native canoes on shore  how are we to get it down luka godfrey whispered if we stand up to carry it down those fellows by the fire who are not twenty yards away must see us if we try to push it down we are safe to make a noise  wait a moment give me knife again luka said and having obtained it he went along the line of canoes cutting and slicing the skins from end to end then he returned to godfrey  they cant follow now he said once on board we are safe  i have been thinking luka our best plan will be to lie down one on each side and to hoist her up as well as we can and move her forward inch by inch  luka nodded and they separated to carry out their plan when jack decided the matter by leaping on board and sending the paddles with a rattle to the bottom of the boat  jump up luka and in with her  as they sprang up there was a shout from the three natives by the fire which was answered by the fierce barking of two or three score of dogs after a moments hesitation two of the natives rushed back to their yourts for their bows while the third who happened to have his close at hand fitted an arrow and discharged it hastily as they were running the boat down it missed its mark and before he could shoot again the boat was in the water and they had sprang on board the native ran down to the edge with his bow bent but lukas bow twanged and the man fell back with an arrow through his body they seized the paddles and drove the boat twenty yards into the stream when the whole of the samoyedes rushed down to the bank and began to discharge their arrows    illustration godfrey and luka escaping from the samoyedes  lie flat down luka godfrey said setting the example the stream will take us  there was a great jabber of voices on the bank  the chief is telling them to take to their canoes luka said laughing you will hear some shouts directly the water wont begin to come in through the slits till they put their weight in the canoes  godfrey lifted his head for a moment and saw five or six of the natives on the bank abreast of him standing in readiness to shoot quickly as he withdrew it again two arrows struck the boat within a few inches of the point where he had looked over  luka he said we must get a little further out i am afraid the stream might set us in towards the bank i will put my cap upon a piece of firewood and hoist it up they will shoot at it and the moment they do we must both spring up and give two or three strong strokes to take her further out  lying flat on his back at the bottom of the boat godfrey raised his cap almost instantaneously there were three or four sharp taps on the side of the boat and one arrow passed through it but an inch above his chest in a moment he sat upright with a paddle in his hand and a couple of sharp strokes sent the boat out into the centre of the current at this moment they heard a series of yells and splashes lucky for them luka laughed i made the slits so big if they had got out farther they would all have been drowned these people are not able to swim  no i should think not godfrey said they dont look as if water had ever touched them from the day they were born we are safe now in ten minutes we shall be clear of the river and have only got to paddle back and fetch our canoe  we may have to fight yet luka said sure to follow us the meat and flour is all gone i expect they gave it to their dogs that is what made them sleep so sound they will know that we shall have to land somewhere to get food and think they will have us then they will mend canoes very quick and some of them will come after us  it will be worse for them if they do godfrey said with my gun and your bow we could keep a score of canoes at a distance still as you say we may have trouble in getting our canoe however we must have that if we have to fight the whole tribe for it  godfrey looked up from time to time he could do so safely now for they were fifty yards from the bank and there was time for him to withdraw his head before an arrow could reach him the natives however had ceased to follow the boat having doubtless run back when they heard their companions cries godfrey thought it as well not to take to the paddles until they were well out of the river lest one might have run on and hidden himself in a clump of bushes as soon as they were out of the river they took up the paddles and rowed straight out for a distance of a couple of miles how long will they be in patching up their canoes luka  they will do it in an hour luka said the women will sew the slits together and the men melt fat and smear over  very well then we had better turn now and make for the place where the canoe is hid they wont expect us to land so soon and most of the men will be waiting to follow with the canoes if only four or five follow us along the bank we can manage them easily enough fortunately the canoe is light enough for one of us to carry it down to the water while you are doing that i can keep them off this boat paddles a lot heavier than the other luka  luka grunted in assent  do you think you will know the place where you hid the canoe godfrey asked presently  let us go close in to see luka said we went ashore in fog i dont know how it looks from the sea the coast is all alike here we must keep very close  how far along do you think it is luka  it cant be much more than an hour to paddle luka replied the samoyedes were away three hours to fetch the boat and they were in no hurry and had to tow her back with their canoe  for half an hour they kept the boat parallel with the land and then inclined towards the shore presently luka said there are six men walking along on bank  well there wont be six left to walk back godfrey replied grimly if they interfere with us now luka it is nearly an hour since we turned we will go in within a hundred yards of the shore those bows of theirs are not like yours they wont carry more than forty or fifty yards now i will just give those gentlemen a hint that they had better keep away from the edge of the cliff and so saying he laid down his paddle and took up his gun and fired he aimed high as he wished to frighten and not hurt the natives instantly disappeared from the edge now luka do you keep on paddling i will watch the top of the bank and if one of them shows his head i will fire they wont suspect we have any idea of landing and will probably keep a bit back all we want is time to land and climb the bank keep inshore now so that next time i fire i may be able to send the bullet pretty close this gun is not much use at more than fifty yards distance  only once did godfrey see a head above the bank and the instant he did so he fired  that will show them we are keeping a sharp lookout i dont think they will come near for some little time now i daresay they are puzzling themselves first why we are coming this way and secondly why we are keeping so close  there is the place where we had tent luka exclaimed suddenly do you see the ashes of the fire  that is it sure enough now run ashore and dash up the bank  as soon as the canoe touched the shore they leapt out and ran up the bank not twenty yards away were the samoyedes godfrey uttered a shout and raised his gun to his shoulder and the natives with a yell ran off at full speed  now luka do you go and get the canoe in the water be careful if you find it heavy for you with the stores on board take them out there is no occasion for hurry those fellows wont venture within range of my gun again they will keep at a distance and send up word to the tents that we have landed so take your time over it if you were to make a slip and damage the canoe it would be fatal to us  the natives stopped at a distance of a quarter of a mile and then as godfrey expected one of them started at a run back towards the village in ten minutes godfrey heard a shout from below and looking round saw the canoe safely by the side of the boat he ran down and took his place in her and they paddled out towing the boat behind them     chapter xvii  a sea fight   as soon as they had reached a distance of two or three hundred yards from the shore godfrey ceased paddling now we can talk matters over luka there is no occasion for hurry now if these fellows in the canoes are disposed to fight we cant prevent them they will certainly be out of the river before we could get back there and even if we did pass first they could easily overtake us for those light craft of theirs would go two feet to our one unless we had wind for our sail so we may as well take things easy and decidedly the first thing to do is to wash and dress jacks wound and then to get some tea and something to eat we have had nothing since we were caught yesterday between twelve and one oclock  what a lucky thing it was we hid the canoe luka he went on as the tartar pulled the boat up alongside the canoe and began to prepare to light a fire the chances are we should not have been able to get her off as well as the boat and even if we had they would have taken out all our stores the meat we might replace but the loss of the tea and tobacco and above all of the matches would have been terrible besides they would have got our spare hatchets and knives the fishhooks and lines and all our furs we dont want the furs for warmth now but it would make a deal of difference to our comfort if we had to sleep on hard boards i do not know how to feel thankful enough that we hid the canoe away  we could not have gone without our things luka said we would have fought them all and killed them rather than lose our tea and tobacco  godfrey laughed at his companions earnestness  i think that would have been paying too dearly for them luka still we should have missed them badly  just as they had finished their meal they saw some black spots ahead of them close inshore i should not be surprised if they have been picking up those fellows who followed us luka no doubt the man who ran back would tell them they could do nothing against our arms but i dont think they will dare attack us in our boat even if they have got all the men there there were only twelve at first not counting the old men who were in their camp when we were brought there you shot one of them so there are only eleven even if they have got on board those who followed us i have always heard that they are plucky little fellows but i do not think they would be fools enough to attack us on the water i feel sure they cant have any intention of doing so i expect their original idea was to hover about us night and day and then when we went ashore to get food to steal the boat and hunt us down now they find we have got a second boat they will see that it is a longer job than they expected for they will guess that our real valuables are on board the boat we hid and that we may have enough provisions here to last for some time  the canoes as they approached them sheered off to a distance of a quarter of a mile and then gathered together evidently in consultation then they turned and paddled rapidly back again soon leaving the canoe and boat far behind  i wonder what they are up to now godfrey said some mischief i have no doubt  perhaps more yourts on farther they might send on a man with fast reindeer a long way ahead so that they might attack us with forty or fifty canoes  so they might luka that would be very awkward and we should be afraid of landing anywhere they may pass the news on from camp to camp for any number of miles yes that is a very serious business the only thing i see for it is to make right out beyond sight of land and then push on as fast as we can fortunately they dont know anything about our sail and as they left us so fast just now they will reckon that we cannot make much more than two miles an hour while when we get the wind we can go six if we help with the paddles we may as well keep on as we are at present as if determined to keep near the land till at any rate we are some distance past the mouth of the river there is not likely to be another of their camps for some distance along for of course they would always be near a river as they must have water for themselves and their reindeer  paddling quietly they continued on their course until they had passed the mouth of the river when they had gone half a mile they saw nine canoes each containing one man come out from the river and follow them  they mean to stick to us godfrey said uneasily im afraid we are going to have a lot of trouble with them luka  after paddling for another two hours they turned their heads seaward the canoes did the same in four hours more the land had almost disappeared but the clump of canoes still maintained their position behind them  it is of no use going out any further luka we are a long way out of sight of any one on shore now now let us head west again an hour later one of the canoes left the group and paddled rapidly towards the land  that is what their game is godfrey said they have sent off to tell their friends ashore the course we are taking and do what we will they will keep them informed of it we may have a fleet of canoes out at any moment after us do you think we could leave them behind if we were to cast off the boat  luka shook his head decidedly no their canoes are very small paddle quick much quicker than we could  she is very fast luka  yes but too many things on board if we threw over everythingfood and kettles and dog and furswe might go as fast as they could but even then i think they would beat us  well we wont try that anyhow luka i would rather risk a fight than that i dont see anything to do but to wait for the wind it is not often calm like this long and we have had it three or four days already if we do get a wind we can certainly beat them by cutting loose the boat  beat them anyhow luka said with wind and paddles they might keep up with us rowing very hard for a bit but men tire wind never tires we sure to beat them at last i think we shall have wind before very long  i hope so luka and not too much of it well as we cant get away from them by paddling luka we may as well lower our lines we have only got two or three days provisions on board and we may just as well lay in a stock while we can  the hooks were baited with pieces of meat and lowered and the paddles laid in scarcely were the lines out when godfrey felt a fierce tug hulloa he exclaimed i have got something bigger than usual he hauled up and gave a shout of satisfaction as he pulled a cod of fully ten pounds weight from the water five minutes later luka caught one of equal size  that will do luka i will throw mine into the boat and we will keep yours on board now we have got among cod there is no fear of our not getting plenty of food i know they catch enormous quantities off the northern coast of norway and it is evident that they come as far as these waters it is some time since we tried this deepsea fishing which accounts for our not having caught any before  are they good fish luka asked i have never seen any like them  firstrate luka especially if we had some oyster sauce to eat with them as we havent we must do without they are capital and they are not full of bones like the herrings now we will paddle on again you leave that fish alone jack you shall have some of it for supper  there is a dark line on the water over there luka said presently wind coming  that is a comfort luka  half an hour later the breeze came up to them shall i get up the sail godfrey  godfrey did not reply for a minute or two yes i think we may as well luka whether we go fast or slow these fellows will be able to send word on shore and we may as well tire them a bit  the sails were hoisted godfrey took the sheet and laid in his paddle the wind may freshen he said and it would not do to fasten the sheet  luka who seemed tireless continued paddling and the boats went through the water at a considerably faster pace than before the effect on their pursuers was at once visible instead of paddling in a leisurely manner in a close group the paddles could be seen to flash faster and faster  they have to row pretty hard to keep up with us now luka said looking over his shoulder at them up to now they felt comfortable think everything right and quite sure to catch us presently now they begin to see it is not so easy after all they maintained their relative positions till the sun was near the horizon  it is ten oclock luka the sun will set in half an hour you lay your paddle in and get us a cup of tea and a bit of that dry meat you had better boil the kettle over one of the candles then you lie down to sleep for four hours after that i will take a turn we are a deal better off than those fellows behind they must keep on paddling all night and as they only have one man in each boat there is no relief for them  luka did as he was ordered after drinking his tea godfrey lighted his pipe and luka lay down godfrey did not feel very sleepy although he had not closed his eyes the night before but they had had a long bout of sleep when compelled to keep their tent by the fog and the excitement of the chase kept him up now as it grew dusk he could see that the canoes drew closer but he had no hope in any case of giving them the slip for it was never perfectly dark when four hours later he woke luka the sky was brightening again  more wind come presently the tartar said looking at the sky  i wont lie down just yet luka it will be quite light in half an hour and i want to have a good look towards the shore before i go to sleep  luka at once took the paddle the wind was perceptibly freshening and the canoe was slipping fast through the water  now luka godfrey said presently stand up and have a look round be careful how you do it it would not do to capsize her now  two minutes later luka exclaimed i see them a whole lot of canoes twenty or thirty over there and he pointed towards the shore but somewhat ahead of them  sit down luka and i will stand up and have a look yes it is as much as they will do to cut us off they did not calculate on our coming along so fast i will luff up a little more and we shall pass ahead of them however hard they paddle  so saying he sat down hauled in the sheet and headed nearer to the wind the fellows behind wont see them for some time he said the canoes must be four miles away at least and i dont suppose they could see each other more than half that distance being so low in the water if we had just a little more wind we should do it nicely  half an hour later the sheet was eased again and the boat resumed her former course as godfrey saw that he should pass well ahead of the canoes coming out from the shore and she moved faster with the wind abeam than she did closehauled even while sitting down the canoes could be seen now the natives were paddling their hardest and the light craft danced over the surface of the water which was now beginning to be ruffled by the breeze  half an hour later they joined the pursuers astern and their yells could be heard although they were half a mile away godfrey counted them as he passed ahead of the fleet and there were thirtythree canoes each with two paddlers  the yourts must be thick along the coasts here luka they must have gathered up all those canoes from at least half a dozen camps now i will lend you a hand  he eased the sheet still further so that the boat should heel over less and fastened it in a loose knot which could be slipped in an instant then he betook himself to his paddle  those fellows behind have had a long row out against the wind and have no doubt been working their hardest ever since they caught sight of our sail a sternchase is a long chase i fancy the wind has freshened a little but it is very little  occasionally he looked back over his shoulder  they are gaining slowly luka but they are a good half mile behind us still and it will take them two or three hours to pick that up i am quite sure now that if we cut the boat adrift we can forge ahead hand over hand but that must be a last resource it is almost a matter of life and death to be able to keep it with us still it is a satisfaction to know that if the worse comes to the worst we can get away from them  jack fully entered into the excitement of the chase taking his seat on the covering near the stern and barking defiance at their pursuers another hours paddling and the space between the canoe and the natives was lessened by half  now luka i will send them a couple of bullets as a reminder that we have got weapons  laying in his paddle he took his gun turned round and knelt looking astern and fired both barrels at the fleet of canoes he had not taken any particular aim for the gun was of little use at a distance exceeding a hundred yards and the motion of the canoe would have prevented anything like accuracy of shooting even with a rifle he intended to frighten rather than to hurt and gave the gun a considerable elevation he saw however the men in one of the canoes cease paddling and drop behind the rest and could make out that one of its occupants was doing something  i hit one of the canoes luka i fancy they are trying to patch up the hole he loaded the gun again this time with his largestsized shot laid it down and resumed his paddle  i have put in buckshot this time luka i dont want to kill any of the poor beggars and the shot will spread i have put in double charges so as to give them a good dose as they come up small shot would be of no use it would not get through those thick leather coats of theirs now then let us send her along  the wind was certainly freshening for it was not until another four or five miles had been traversed that the canoes had crept up to within a hundred yards distance at last godfrey felt it was time to fire again and waiting till the canoes were within about seventy yards distance he fired both barrels slightly shifting his aim between each shot a series of yells arose from the canoes four or five of them at once dropped behind  paddle your hardest luka while i load again the beggars are coming up fast now  the natives with yells of fury were sending their canoes through the foaming water and were but fifty yards away when he again fired this time five or six of the natives dropped their paddles and two of the canoes were upset a volley of arrows fell thickly round the boat and one or two spears skimmed along the water close to it godfrey seized his paddle again  head towards the shore luka he said and as the boat headed round he slackened the sheet and so brought the wind nearly dead aft the boat was on an even keel now and they could feel by the lessened strain on the paddles that her speed was considerably increased in two or three minutes godfrey looked round the canoes were a hundred yards behind  we are gaining on them luka  another ten minutes and the interval was more than doubled  they are beginning to get tired godfrey said we are going a good deal faster of course now we have got the wind astern but i do not think they are going as fast as they did and i expect that last dose of buckshot took the heart out of them a good deal they had reckoned that we should be only able to fire once or twice before they came up and that i should use bullets but that handful of buckshot evidently peppered a good many of them and they know if they come up they will have four more barrels at least among them i think the fighting is all over now  another hour and the canoes were a mile astern and the land was now but four or five miles away godfrey thought that he could safely resume his course west especially as the wind had distinctly freshened  i will lay in my paddle now luka i must give all my attention to the sail i expect they will give it up they will think when they see me cease paddling that we know we can get away from them whenever we like  godfreys surmise turned out correct the natives did not attempt to follow but held on their course straight for the land paddling slowly now they were in two divisions five or six of the canoes being a good deal astern of the others those with single rowers that had followed them so long having dropped behind to pick up the occupants of the canoes that had capsized in several of the canoes in this division godfrey could make out that only one man was paddling and guessed that the other was more or less disabled by the shot  i dont think we shall be troubled any more by them he said they will be a couple of hours before they reach land by which time we shall be out of sight and even reindeer will hardly take the news along the shore with all its deep indentations as quickly as we shall sail besides i fancy they will come to the conclusion that the game is not worth the candle now lay in your paddle and let us have breakfast comfortably it is just twelve oclock  day after day they coasted along passed through waigatz straits between the island of that name and the mainland then touched at four islands lying across the mouth of a large and deep bay and then held on until they reached the mouth of the petchora the distance to this point from the kara river was godfrey calculated about three hundred and fifty miles it took them fifteen days to cover that distance as they stopped and spent a day shooting several times for they were not fortunate along here in catching many fish as they went on passing one of the islands godfrey shot a seal the flesh of which they found was by no means bad  the weather continued very fine but there was so little wind that during the whole distance they did not once put up their sail but depended entirely upon their paddles upon one of their shooting expeditions godfrey had the good luck to shoot a very fine black fox they had had their meal and were stretched at full length by the fire luka had gone off to sleep godfrey was almost dozing when he heard a slight rustle in the grass and opening his eyes saw a black fox standing at a distance of ten paces it had evidently been attracted by the smell of some fish they had been frying and stood with its nose in the air sniffing godfreys gun was lying beside him the lefthand barrel he always kept loaded with ball his hands stole quietly to it and as he grasped it he sat up and fired a snap shot at the fox as it turned and darted away to his surprise as well as delight it rolled over  there is a piece of luck luka he said as the latter sprang to his feet bow in hand at the report that is a pure fluke for i fired without raising the gun or taking the least aim  luka examined the fox it is one of the largest i ever saw he said and the fur is in splendid condition  its skin will come in handy luka we must put in and replenish our stores at droinik at the mouth of the petchora we are running very short of tea and tobacco we have been very extravagant lately and we have had no flour since those scamps robbed us it is very lucky jack was so sound asleep i often scold you jack for being such a sleepy little beggar but for once it is lucky for if you had heard the fox coming he would have been off without my getting a shot at him  accordingly when they reached the mouth of the petchora they landed three miles from droinik and luka taking the foxskin and those of other smaller animals they had shot during their excursions went into the town and returned with four pounds of tea as much tobacco forty pounds of flour two large tin kettles each capable of holding a gallon of water to carry an extra supply and sixty silver roubles  i am heartily glad you are back luka for i have been nearly eaten alive the mosquitoes are awfulworse i think than at any place we have landed  they had indeed entirely given up sleeping ashore since their forced stay on the gulf of obi always pushing off two or three hundred yards from the shore and anchoring for the mosquitoes were terrible and upon their hunting expeditions they always smeared their faces necks and hands thickly over with bears fat but even with this they suffered severely nowhere indeed are mosquitoes so great a scourge as along the shores of the arctic sea  they had already determined that they would at any rate make for the kanin peninsula and would then be guided by the weather if it still remained calm and quiet they would sail across the entrance to the white sea and coast along until they reached the frontier of norway which would be about four hundred miles from the point of the kanin peninsula if the weather showed signs of changing they would go up the white sea to archangel which would be about the same distance  two days paddling took them to the western mouth of the bay the course from here lay due west to kolgueff island nearly two hundred miles away godfrey did not hesitate to strike for it as it was seventy or eighty miles saved and there was no risk of missing it four long days paddling took them there and an equal time brought them to the western point of the kanin peninsula the weather continued still and clear the sea was as smooth as glass and there were no signs of change but september had begun and every hour was of importance they therefore determined now to abandon the boat which made a considerable difference in their speed  our candles will do for cooking we have still forty pounds of dried flesh and twenty of flour and we may expect to get a few fish anyhow our three kettles will hold two gallons and a half of water enough to last us seven or eight days in three days at most we ought to strike the coast again and we are sure to find some streams running down to the sea in a very short time so we will risk it we know that the two of us can send her along a good five miles an hour  accordingly the dried meat and flour were transferred to the canoe the kettles were filled up with fresh water and after taking a long drink and letting jack lap as much as he could take they took their seats in the canoe again threw off the towrope and started due west  accustomed as they now were to the work and their muscles hardened by exercise they sent the boat rapidly through the water  we mustnt exert ourselves too much luka godfrey said after the first quarter of an hour a long slow stroke is the one to send her along and we can keep that up for any time we must do our very best till we sight the coast again after the way she behaved in that storm i am not afraid of wind but i am horribly afraid of fog if we had but a compass it would not matter to us one way or other but if a fog came down when we are a good way off the land there would be nothing to do but to lay in our paddles and wait even if it lasted for a fortnight still as long as there is no change of weather there does not seem any reason why a fog should set in but i shall not feel happy till we have got the land alongside of us  for three days the paddles were kept going each taking alternately six hours sleep and working together for twelve jack having nothing to do was the most uneasy of the party sometimes lying down with his nose between his paws sometimes getting up and giving a series of short impatient barks early on the second day they were fortunate in passing through a large shoal of herrings godfrey laid in his paddles and attended to the lines and in half an hour had fortyfive fish after that they paid no further attention to fishing being now amply supplied with food the herrings too required less water than the dried meat they fried them over the candles and whenever their mouths were parched they chewed a piece of raw herring and found great relief from it jack was allowed two raw herrings a day with that and a very small allowance of water he did very well on the third day a light southerly wind sprang up and they at once hoisted their sail and found that it eased their labour materially  i should think we ought to see the land tonight luka three days at eighty miles a day is two hundred and forty miles if we dont see it by evening we must head a little more to the south of course we cannot depend very accurately on our steering and we may have been going a trifle north of west all this time but it is all right for the coast we are making for keeps on trending north and we are certain to hit it sooner or later  at six oclock they had a meal which luka had been cooking and then godfrey said now i will have my six hours sleep he stood up to change places and let luka come astern to steer when he exclaimed look is that a cloud ahead of us or is it land  land luka said after gazing at it attentively it is high land  all idea of sleep was given up godfrey seized his paddle again and in four hours they were within a mile of the land it differed widely from the low coast they had so long been passing steep hills rose from the very edge of the shore clad in many places with pine forests they were not long before they found a suitable place to land and soon had the canoe ashore and the tent erected for the nights were already becoming unpleasantly cold luka went into the woods and soon returned with some dried branches and a quantity of pine cones godfrey cut three sticks and made a tripod from which the small kettle was suspended and fish and meat were soon grilling over the fire as soon as the kettle boiled a handful of tea was dropped into it and it was taken off the fire the three companions made an excellent meal then luka and godfrey lighted their pipes and sat smoking by the fire for half an hour and then lay down in the tent for a sound sleep  when godfrey woke he found that luka was already up he had stirred up the embers put on fresh wood filled the kettle and hung it over the fire and had then evidently sauntered off into the wood godfrey after the luxury of a rapid bathe began to prepare breakfast and by the time it was ready luka came down with a dozen squirrels he had shot  lots of them in the wood he said if stop here three or four days get lots of skins  i dont think they would be much good to us luka though those you shot will be useful for food but i have been obliged to stand with my head over the smoke of the fire to keep off these rascally mosquitoes and my face was so swelled with their bites when i woke that i could hardly see out of my eyes till i bathed my face with cold water the sooner we are off the better if we dont want to be eaten alive  accordingly as soon as the meal was finished they packed up and continued their voyage after eight hours paddling they came upon the mouth of a river  this must be the seriberka godfrey said that is the only river marked in the map anywhere about here we will paddle a mile or two up and fill our kettles if it is that river we shall come upon an island a few miles off the coast in another twenty or thirty miles see luka how near we are getting to the end of the map we are not very much more than a hundred miles from this line that is the division between russia and norway once we land on the other side of that line we are free  in seven or eight hours after leaving the river godfrey said there is kildina island luka we will land over there instead of upon this shore there may be some laplanders about and there is a russian place called kola about twenty miles up a river a little way past the island and the natives might take us there if they came upon us for they would not understand either ostjak or the samoyede dialect and i dont suppose they would talk russian anyhow we may as well be on the safe side after coming seven or eight thousand miles we wont run any risk of a failure in the last hundred i dont much like the look of the sky away to the north i fancy we are going to have a storm thank god it did not come two days earlier  they landed on the island hauled up the boat then godfrey took some time in finding a hollow where they could light a fire without risk of its being seen on the mainland as if there were lapps there they might cross in their canoes to see who had made it they had no trouble in collecting plenty of driftwood along the shore and carefully choosing the driest so as to avoid making a great smoke they lit a fire and erected the tent to leeward of it so that the smoke might blow through it and so keep out their enemies the mosquitoes godfreys prediction about the weather was speedily verified the wind got up very rapidly and in two hours was blowing a gale from the north  no fear of canoes coming across luka said  no fear at all i dont suppose there was any real risk of it in any case but i feel more nervous now than i have done all the time at any rate the storm has made it perfectly safe there will soon be a sea on that no canoe could face  for three days the storm raged and they were glad to resume their fur jackets jack lay coiled up in the furs in the tent and nothing could persuade him to move except for breakfast and dinner they waited twelve hours after the gale ceased to allow the sea to go down and then started again hoisting their sail as there was enough wind to help them     chapter xviii  home again   godfrey felt in wild spirits as they hoisted their sail for the end of the journey was close at hand and unless some altogether unforeseen misfortune were to befall them they would have accomplished an undertaking that had been deemed almost impossible they kept well out from land increasing the distance as they sailed west until they were some ten miles out for the map showed that some fiveandtwenty miles from the point where they had camped a rocky peninsula jutted out in three hours they could make out its outline for the land was bold and high and it took them another four hours before they were abreast of its eastern point cape navalok then they coasted along the peninsula until they arrived at cape kekour its western point they had now been paddling nearly twelve hours for godfrey was too impatient to be content with the sail only just before they arrived at the cape luka seeing a good place for landing suggested a halt  no no godfrey said we will not risk another landing we have been marvellously fortunate up to now and it would be folly to run even the slightest risk when we are so near the end of our journey we will keep on there are only thirty or forty more miles to go and then we shall enter the voranger fiord then we shall be in norway think of that luka we can snap our fingers at the russians and tell everyone we meet that we have escaped from their prisons  who shall we meet luka asked  ah that is more than i can tell you the sooner we meet some one the better norway is not like this country we have been passing along it is all covered with great mountains and forests i dont know anything about the coast but i fancy it is tremendously rocky and we should have a poor chance there if caught in another storm from the north there are laplanders who are people just like the samoyedes and who have got reindeer if we find any of them as i hope we shall we ought to be all right we have got a hundred silver roubles and if you show a man money and make signs you want to go somewhere and dont much care where he is pretty safe to take you now you take a sleep luka i will steer there is no occasion to paddle the wind is taking us along nearly three miles an hour and time is no particular object to us now you get three hours then i will take three and then we will set to with the paddles again  eight hours later they could make out high land on the starboard bow and knew that they were approaching the entrance to the fiord they had not taken to their paddles again for the wind had freshened and they were going fast through the water luka cooked a meal and as it was growing dark the land closed in on both sides to a distance of about eight miles  an hour later they saw lights on their right hand hurrah godfrey exclaimed there is a village there we wont land tonight we might find it difficult to get a place to sleep in one night longer on board wont do us any harm thank god we are fairly out of russia at last and shall land as free men in the morning  they drew in towards the shore a mile or so above the lights and paddled cautiously on until close to the land there they dropped their anchor overboard and wearied out by their long row were speedily sound asleep  it was broad daylight when they woke godfrey when he sat up gave a loud cheer which set jack off barking wildly look godfrey shouted it is a town and there are two steamboats lying there thank god our troubles are all over you had better get breakfast luka it is of no use going ashore till people are awake  breakfast over the anchor was at once pulled up and in a quarter of an hour they were alongside a quay their appearance was so similar to that of the lapps that they themselves would have attracted but little notice but the canoe was so different in its appearance to those used by these people that several persons stood on the little quay watching them as they came alongside their surprise at the boat was increased when godfrey came up on to the quay no laplander or finn of his height had ever been seen and moreover his face and hands were clean they addressed him in a language that he did not understand he replied first in english then in russian apparently they recognized the latter language and one of them motioned to godfrey to follow him  you wait here till i come back luka i daresay the people are honest enough but i dont want any of our furs or things stolen now that we have got to the end of our journey  he then followed his conductor to a large house in the principal street where he went in to a sort of office and spoke to a man sitting there then he went out and in a minute returned with a gentleman  do you speak english sir godfrey said  i speak it a little the gentleman replied in surprise at hearing the language from one who looked like a laplander  do you speak russian better godfrey next asked  yes he replied in that language i know russian well and who are you  i am an englishman i was resident in st petersburg when i was seized and condemned to exile in siberia as a nihilist although i was perfectly innocent of the charge i was taken to the mines of kara in the east of siberia but made my escape descended the yenesei and have coasted from there in a canoe  the man looked at him incredulously  i am not surprised that you doubt my story godfrey said if you will come down with me to the wharf you will see the canoe in which i made the journey i built it on the yenesei i have with me a tartar who escaped with me and shared my fortunes  the merchant put on his hat and walked down to the wharf  it is a strange craft he said though i have seen some at christiania similar in form but smaller built of wood that englishmen have brought over and is it possible that you have sailed from the mouth of the yenesei in her  there has been no great difficulty about it godfrey said we have kept near the coast and have generally landed when bad weather came on i have a gun and with that and fishing there has been no difficulty about food the journey has been a long one it is seventeen months since i left kara i am provided with russian money sir and shall be glad if you can tell me what is my best way of getting back to england  it is fortunate indeed that you did not arrive here two days later for the last steamer will sail for hamburg tomorrow she touches at many ports on her way but i dont know that you can do better than go to hamburg whence there is a steamer nearly every day to england if you had been two days later you would have lost her for the season is just over and you would then have had to travel by land and river down to tornea on the gulf of bothnia but come up with me to my house i am the agent here for the steamer what are you going to do with your canoe  i shall take her home with me just as she stands godfrey said  and the tartar  yes the tartar and the dog  very well stay here for ten minutes he said to luka i will send a man down to help you up with the canoe we may as well put it in my yard he went on as he started back with godfrey the people are as honest as the day but they might be pulling it about and examining it and it is just as well to stow it away safe well this is a wonderful escape of yours during the twenty years i have been here it has never happened before  i wonder it has not been done many times godfrey said canoes go from archangel to the petchora which is quite halfway to the mouth of the obi and there is no more difficulty between the petchora and the yenesei than there is on this side the first thing to do now is to get some clothes  the first thing to do i think is to get some breakfast the trader said  i have already had some breakfast on board godfrey said but i daresay i can eat another  i will warrant you can your breakfast was probably of the roughest  it was godfrey admitted i have not eaten a piece of real bread for more than a year we havent had much of anything made of flour since we started in the canoe in june but one gets to do without bread very well  i have not asked you your name yet the trader said  it is godfrey bullen my father is head of a firm in london that does a good deal of trade with russia he was living in st petersburg a good many years that is how it is that i speak the language  i was wondering how it was that you spoke it so well now then let me introduce you to my wife and family this is an english gentleman wife he said in his own language to a pleasantlooking lady he does not look like it but when i tell you that he has made his escape from siberia in a canoe it will account for it  godfrey found that his early meal had in no way abated his appetite the breakfast was an excellent one but he confined himself to bread and butter and thought he had never tasted anything so good in his life he learned that his host was an importer of goods of all kinds and did the principal trade at vads√∂ besides supplying all the villages on the fiord  if you had been here a few days earlier he said you would have found a countryman of yours a mr clarke who almost monopolizes the whaling trade here he owns three steamers and has a great meltingdown establishment i myself send great quantities of cod to hamburg by steamer most of the boats here work for me  after breakfast godfrey gave his host a sketch of his adventures  it has been a wonderful journey his host said when he concluded i have heard of one or two cases where men have made their way to archangel and thence by land to our frontier but i never heard of anyone attempting it by sea before it was a perilous journey indeed and required a knowledge of canoeing which no russian prisoner would be likely to have then you were certainly fortunate in having a companion with you who was at home with those ostjaks still as you brought him with you for that purpose that was forethought rather than luck  which is the first port at which the steamer will stop that i can send a telegram from  the merchant laughed if you go downstairs into the office and go through the door to your left hand you will find yourself in a telegraph office  really  yes really we have had the telegraph here for some little time  godfrey rushed downstairs and sent off a telegram as follows  have just arrived here made my escape from prison at kara in siberia seventeen months on the way am in firstrate health start tomorrow by steamer to hamburg hope all are well have plenty of money  he directed it to his fathers office so that the news might be broken gradually to his mother in the afternoon the answer came  thank god for his mercies all well i shall cross to hamburg to meet you  while godfrey was being made much of by the merchant and his family and indeed by many of their acquaintances who upon hearing the news came in to see him and inquire into the wonderful voyage luka was no less a centre of attraction to the fishermen and was so generously treated that long before it became dark he was obliged to be assisted in a state of inebriation to a pallet that had been prepared for him godfrey was annoyed when he heard it but as his host said after being eighteen months and for aught i know eighteen months before that without touching liquor very little would be likely to produce an effect upon him i daresay it is his talking as much as the spirit that has turned his head besides you know the lower class of russians and tartars are all fond of spirits  i shall not be angry with him in the morning godfrey said because i do think that it is pardonable but i shall talk seriously to him about it and tell him that if he is coming home to england with me he must give up spirits he has done without them so long that it cant be any hardship  what are you going to do with him  i have not the most remote idea godfrey laughed if he likes to return to his people i daresay my father would be able through the russian embassy to get a pardon for him and permission to go back but i dont think he has any notion of that he lost his parents when he was a child and i never heard him express the slightest desire to go back again he has attached himself to me heart and soul and i think looks upon it as a settled thing that he will be always with me i dont know in what capacity still i suppose something will be found for him  the steamer was to start at nine oclock on the following morning and by that hour godfrey luka and jack were on board and the canoe carefully stowed on deck both had obtained a complete fitout from the merchants stores and although godfreys garments would scarcely have passed muster in london they did very well for the voyage luka was greatly amused at his own appearance in european garb though godfrey thought he looked much better in his ostjak costume  we will rig him out fresh when i get him home he said to the merchant i dont know what he looks like now in that greatcoat and billycock hat  the merchant stayed on board until the last moment as soon as he got into his boat the paddles began to revolve and the steamer started on her way she was ten days on her voyage ascending many of the fiords landing or taking on board cargo or passengers  godfrey enjoyed the voyage greatly the scenery was magnificent and eagerly as he desired to be at home he was almost sorry when the end approached it had been so strange to have nothing to do but to sit and watch the shore to eat and to sleep luka had been very penitent over his little excess at vads√∂ and had solemnly promised godfrey to abstain from spirits in future and he too enjoyed the voyage in his way eating enormously and drinking vast quantities of tea and coffee godfrey had sent off one or two telegrams from the ports at which he touched so that his father might be able to judge when the ship was likely to arrive and when one morning early the vessel steamed up to the wharf at hamburg godfrey saw him waiting there it was a joyful meeting indeed and it was not until they were alone together at an hotel luka being left downstairs in charge of the canoe that they were enabled to begin to talk  did you know what had become of me father  yes my boy petrovytch telegraphed to me that you had been missing three days and i at once went over to st petersburg he thought that you had fallen into bad hands and had been murdered and thrown into the neva but remembering that you had got into that silly scrape before with the police i thought it possible that coming as your absence did directly after the affair at the winter palace suspicion had fallen on you again i went to the head of the police he declined to give me any information then i set the embassy at work and they found out that you had been arrested with some desperate nihilists at last they obtained a sight of the records of the courtmartial before which you had been tried and told me that the case was so strong against you that nothing could be done indeed had it not been for your youth and the fact that you were a british subject you would certainly have been executed i tried everything but i found it absolutely useless the embassy recommended me to let the matter drop for the present and in time perhaps when the nihilist scare passed off it might be possible to interest some minister or other in your favour and obtain a reversion of your sentence then a few months later came the assassination of the czar and of course that rendered it more hopeless than ever and all we could hope for was that in the course of years we might again move in the matter of course it has been a terrible business for us all but we wont talk about that now thank god it is over and that you have returned to us but what madness godfrey to mix yourself up with these people  indeed father i was perfectly innocent though i cannot blame the courtmartial for finding me guilty and he then gave his father the details of his connection with the two nihilists akim soushiloff and petroff stepanoff and of the circumstances of his arrest in their room  i am very glad to hear that godfrey not that it makes any actual matter now but because after the warning i had given you to avoid the society of any people holding extreme opinions it seemed to me you must have showed an incredible amount of wilfulness and folly in getting yourself mixed up with these desperate conspirators i am heartily glad to find that i was mistaken and that except as regards that foolish business at the theatre you have really not been to blame in the matter and have been altogether a victim of circumstances now tell me how you got away and first who is that queerlooking little fellow with your canoe  he is my comrade and friend father he escaped from prison with me and is devoted to me but for him i should have had no chance whatever of making my way through all the difficulties of the journey and he then gave his father an outline of their adventures from the time of their leaving kara  when he had finished mr bullen went downstairs and saw luka and shook hands with him heartily telling him in russian that he had heard from godfrey how much he owed to him and assuring him that he need have no fear for the future  two days later the party arrived at home there is no occasion to say anything as to the joy of that meeting the three years of hardship and roughing it had converted the careless schoolboy into a powerful young fellow his spirits were as high and he was as full of fun as of old but the experience he had gone through had strengthened his character had given him selfreliance and confidence and had as his father and mother soon saw had a very beneficial effect in forming his character  two or three days after his arrival godfrey wrote to mikail it was a very guarded letter because he knew that it would be opened by the prison authorities but it thanked him for the kindness he had shown to him while in prison and expressed a hope that now that he would have obtained partial freedom and would be united to his wife he would succeed and prosper he inclosed a fivehundredrouble note from his father as a present in return for the kindness he had shown him and he also inclosed a directed envelope so that he could acknowledge the receipt of the letter  an answer written by the priest of the villagefor mikail was unable to writecame at the end of five months it was expressed in the most grateful terms he had been released four months after godfrey left and the governor had as a reward for his good conduct allowed him to work for a farmer instead of in the mines he said that he was perfectly happy and that as he should now be able to purchase a small farm for himself he should be sure to do well i have a boy he said who was born three months ago we have christened him godfrey in memory of the night when you saved my life at the risk of your own  luka was for some time a difficulty he absolutely refused to return to russia and was for a time established as doorkeeper at the office but in the spring after godfreys return the latter took him down with him to a house mr bullen had just purchased near richmond luka was so delighted with the country that he was established there and became a sort of general factotum assisting in the garden stables or house wherever he could make himself useful and being in special charge of a sailing boat that godfrey keeps on the river he had picked up a good deal of english from godfrey on their travels and soon came to speak it fairly and being regarded as a friend by all the family he is in every way perfectly contented with his lot four years after godfreys return a clerk one day came into the office with the news that a gentleman wished to speak to him and godfrey was astounded at the entry of alexis  i have come the russian said you told me to come and i have done so  i am delighted to see you alexis i had thought of you as married and settled among the buriats  i did marry alexis said but three years afterwards i lost my wife what was i to do i could not remain all my life a wandering shepherd afraid ever to enter a town or to speak with a civilized being so i sold my flocks and herds you know my wife owned a third of those of the buriat he was a rich man and bought most of them and for the rest i found other purchasers then he negotiated for me with one of the tea merchants and i managed to go as a driver with one of his caravans to pekin  and what do you mean to do alexis i can still keep my promise and make a berth for you here in the office  i thank you my friend alexis said but i shall return to my profession i am a doctor you know and have my russian diplomas i shall learn your language and study in your hospitals for a time then i shall set up here i believe you have many russians in your poorer districts and as besides i speak german i should be able to obtain a sufficient practice moreover i have brought with me orders on a bank here for five thousand pounds which i paid into their branch at hongkong i will get you to invest that for me and you will see that it will give me an income sufficient for all my wants  alexis carried out his plans and has now a large although not very remunerative practice among the russian and german colony in the east end of london he married the daughter of a clergyman there and remains fast friends with godfrey who has now set up an establishment of his own of which luka is majordomo and special guardian and playmate to godfreys little boys  godfrey has not returned to russia but is his fathers right hand in the london business at the same time he is free to visit st petersburg did he wish to do so as mr bullen drew up a full statement of his case and this having been forwarded by the russian ambassador with a strong recommendation on his part a reversal of the sentence of the courtmartial was obtained and a full pardon granted to him it is not probable however that he will again set foot on russian soil his experiences as a prisoner in siberia having been as he says ample for a lifetime   the end
