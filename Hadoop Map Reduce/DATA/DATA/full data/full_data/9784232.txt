9784232	hilda wade  a woman with tenacity of purpose   by grant allen   1899     publishers note  in putting before the public the last work by mr grant allen the publishers desire to express their deep regret at the authors unexpected and lamented deatha regret in which they are sure to be joined by the many thousand readers whom he did so much to entertain a man of curiously varied and comprehensive knowledge and with the most charming personality a writer who treating of a wide variety of subjects touched nothing which he did not make distinctive he filled a place which no man living can exactly occupy the last chapter of this volume had been roughly sketched by mr allen before his final illness and his anxiety when debarred from work to see it finished was relieved by the considerate kindness of his friend and neighbour dr conan doyle who hearing of his trouble talked it over with him gathered his ideas and finally wrote it out for him in the form in which it now appearsa beautiful and pathetic act of friendship which it is a pleasure to record     hilda wade    chapter i  the episode of the patient who disappointed her doctor   hilda wades gift was so unique so extraordinary that i must illustrate it i think before i attempt to describe it but first let me say a word of explanation about the master  i have never met anyone who impressed me so much with a sense of greatness as professor sebastian and this was not due to his scientific eminence alone the mans strength and keenness struck me quite as forcibly as his vast attainments when he first came to st nathaniels hospital an eager fieryeyed physiologist well past the prime of life and began to preach with all the electric force of his vivid personality that the one thing on earth worth a young mans doing was to work in his laboratory attend his lectures study disease and be a scientific doctor dozens of us were infected by his contagious enthusiasm he proclaimed the gospel of germs and the germ of his own zeal flew abroad in the hospital it ran through the wards as if it were typhoid fever within a few months half the students were converted from lukewarm observers of medical routine into flaming apostles of the new methods  the greatest authority in europe on comparative anatomy now that huxley was taken from us he had devoted his later days to the pursuit of medicine proper to which he brought a mind stored with luminous analogies from the lower animals his very appearance held one tall thin erect with an ascetic profile not unlike cardinal mannings he represented that abstract form of asceticism which consists in absolute selfsacrifice to a mental ideas not that which consists in religious abnegation three years of travel in africa had tanned his skin for life his long white hair straight and silvery as it fell just curled in one wavelike inward sweep where it turned and rested on the stooping shoulders his pale face was cleanshaven save for a thin and wiry grizzled moustache which cast into stronger relief the deepset hawklike eyes and the acute intense intellectual features in some respects his countenance reminded me often of dr martineaus in others it recalled the knifelike edge unturnable of his great predecessor professor owen wherever he went men turned to stare at him in paris they took him for the head of the english socialists in russia they declared he was a nihilist emissary and they were not far wrongin essence for sebastians stern sharp face was above all things the face of a man absorbed and engrossed by one overpowering pursuit in lifethe sacred thirst of knowledge which had swallowed up his entire nature  he was what he lookedthe most singleminded person i have ever come across and when i say singleminded i mean just that and no more he had an end to attainthe advancement of science and he went straight towards the end looking neither to the right nor to the left for anyone an american millionaire once remarked to him of some ingenious appliance he was describing why if you were to perfect that apparatus professor and take out a patent for it i reckon youd make as much money as i have made sebastian withered him with a glance i have no time to waste he replied on making money  so when hilda wade told me on the first day i met her that she wished to become a nurse at nathaniels to be near sebastian i was not at all astonished i took her at her word everybody who meant business in any branch of the medical art however humble desired to be close to our rare teacherto drink in his large thought to profit by his clear insight his wide experience the man of nathaniels was revolutionising practice and those who wished to feel themselves abreast of the modern movement were naturally anxious to cast in their lot with him i did not wonder therefore that hilda wade who herself possessed in so large a measure the deepest feminine giftintuitionshould seek a place under the famous professor who represented the other side of the same endowment in its masculine embodimentinstinct of diagnosis  hilda wade herself i will not formally introduce to you you will learn to know her as i proceed with my story  i was sebastians assistant and my recommendation soon procured hilda wade the post she so strangely coveted before she had been long at nathaniels however it began to dawn upon me that her reasons for desiring to attend upon our revered master were not wholly and solely scientific sebastian it is true recognised her value as a nurse from the first he not only allowed that she was a good assistant but he also admitted that her subtle knowledge of temperament sometimes enabled her closely to approach his own reasoned scientific analysis of a case and its probable development most women he said to me once are quick at reading the passing emotion they can judge with astounding correctness from a shadow on ones face a catch in ones breath a movement of ones hands how their words or deeds are affecting us we cannot conceal our feelings from them but underlying character they do not judge so well as fleeting expression not what mrs jones is in herself but what mrs jones is now thinking and feelingthere lies their great success as psychologists most men on the contrary guide their life by definite factsby signs by symptoms by observed data medicine itself is built upon a collection of such reasoned facts but this woman nurse wade to a certain extent stands intermediate mentally between the two sexes she recognises temperamentthe fixed form of character and what it is likely to doin a degree which i have never seen equalled elsewhere to that extent and within proper limits of supervision i acknowledge her faculty as a valuable adjunct to a scientific practitioner  still though sebastian started with a predisposition in favour of hilda wadea pretty girl appeals to most of usi could see from the beginning that hilda wade was by no means enthusiastic for sebastian like the rest of the hospital  he is extraordinarily able she would say when i gushed to her about our master but that was the most i could ever extort from her in the way of praise though she admitted intellectually sebastians gigantic mind she would never commit herself to anything that sounded like personal admiration to call him the prince of physiologists did not satisfy me on that head i wanted her to exclaim i adore him i worship him he is glorious wonderful  i was also aware from an early date that in an unobtrusive way hilda wade was watching sebastian watching him quietly with those wistful earnest eyes as a cat watches a mousehole watching him with mute inquiry as if she expected each moment to see him do something different from what the rest of us expected of him slowly i gathered that hilda wade in the most literal sense had come to nathaniels as she herself expressed it to be near sebastian  gentle and lovable as she was in every other aspect towards sebastian she seemed like a lynxeyed detective she had some object in view i thought almost as abstract as his ownsome object to which as i judged she was devoting her life quite as singlemindedly as sebastian himself had devoted his to the advancement of science  why did she become a nurse at all i asked once of her friend mrs mallet she has plenty of money and seems well enough off to live without working  oh dear yes mrs mallet answered she is independent quite has a tidy little income of her ownsix or seven hundred a yearand she could choose her own society but she went in for this mission fad early she didnt intend to marry she said so she would like to have some work to do in life girls suffer like that nowadays in her case the malady took the form of nursing  as a rule i ventured to interpose when a pretty girl says she doesnt intend to marry her remark is premature it only means  oh yes i know every girl says it tis a stock property in the popular masque of maiden modesty but with hilda it is different and the difference isthat hilda means it  you are right i answered i believe she means it yet i know one man at least for i admired her immensely  mrs mallet shook her head and smiled it is no use dr cumberledge she answered hilda will never marry never that is to say till she has attained some mysterious object she seems to have in view about which she never speaks to anyonenot even to me but i have somehow guessed it  and it is  oh i have not guessed what it is i am no oedipus i have merely guessed that it exists but whatever it may be hildas life is bounded by it she became a nurse to carry it out i feel confident from the very beginning i gather a part of her scheme was to go to st nathaniels she was always bothering us to give her introductions to dr sebastian and when she met you at my brother hugos it was a preconcerted arrangement she asked to sit next you and meant to induce you to use your influence on her behalf with the professor she was dying to get there  it is very odd i mused but therewomen are inexplicable  and hilda is in that matter the very quintessence of woman even i who have known her for years dont pretend to understand her  a few months later sebastian began his great researches on his new anaesthetic it was a wonderful set of researches it promised so well all nats as we familiarly and affectionately styled st nathaniels was in a fever of excitement over the drug for a twelvemonth  the professor obtained his first hint of the new body by a mere accident his friend the deputy prosector of the zoological society had mixed a draught for a sick raccoon at the gardens and by some mistake in a bottle had mixed it wrongly i purposely refrain from mentioning the ingredients as they are drugs which can be easily obtained in isolation at any chemists though when compounded they form one of the most dangerous and difficult to detect of organic poisons i do not desire to play into the hands of wouldbe criminals the compound on which the deputy prosector had thus accidentally lighted sent the raccoon to sleep in the most extraordinary manner indeed the raccoon slept for thirtysix hours on end all attempts to awake him by pulling his tail or tweaking his hair being quite unavailing this was a novelty in narcotics so sebastian was asked to come and look at the slumbering brute he suggested the attempt to perform an operation on the somnolent raccoon by removing under the influence of the drug an internal growth which was considered the probable cause of his illness a surgeon was called in the growth was found and removed and the raccoon to everybodys surprise continued to slumber peacefully on his straw for five hours afterwards at the end of that time he awoke and stretched himself as if nothing had happened and though he was of course very weak from loss of blood he immediately displayed a most royal hunger he ate up all the maize that was offered him for breakfast and proceeded to manifest a desire for more by most unequivocal symptoms  sebastian was overjoyed he now felt sure he had discovered a drug which would supersede chloroforma drug more lasting in its immediate effects and yet far less harmful in its ultimate results on the balance of the system a name being wanted for it he christened it lethodyne it was the best painluller yet invented  for the next few weeks at nats we heard of nothing but lethodyne patients recovered and patients died but their deaths or recoveries were as dross to lethodyne an anaesthetic that might revolutionise surgery and even medicine a royal road through disease with no trouble to the doctor and no pain to the patient lethodyne held the field we were all of us for the moment intoxicated with lethodyne  sebastians observations on the new agent occupied several months he had begun with the raccoon he went on of course with those poor scapegoats of physiology domestic rabbits not that in this particular case any painful experiments were in contemplation the professor tried the drug on a dozen or more quite healthy young animalswith the strange result that they dozed off quietly and never woke up again this nonplussed sebastian he experimented once more on another raccoon with a smaller dose the raccoon fell asleep and slept like a top for fifteen hours at the end of which time he woke up as if nothing out of the common had happened sebastian fell back upon rabbits again with smaller and smaller doses it was no good the rabbits all died with great unanimity until the dose was so diminished that it did not send them off to sleep at all there was no middle course apparently to the rabbit kind lethodyne was either fatal or else inoperative so it proved to sheep the new drug killed or did nothing  i will not trouble you with all the details of sebastians further researches the curious will find them discussed at length in volume 237 of the philosophical transactions see also comptes rendus de lacademie de medecine tome 49 pp 72 and sequel i will restrict myself here to that part of the inquiry which immediately refers to hilda wades history  if i were you she said to the professor one morning when he was most astonished at his contradictory results i would test it on a hawk if i dare venture on a suggestion i believe you will find that hawks recover  the deuce they do sebastian cried however he had such confidence in nurse wades judgment that he bought a couple of hawks and tried the treatment on them both birds took considerable doses and after a period of insensibility extending to several hours woke up in the end quite bright and lively  i see your principle the professor broke out it depends upon diet carnivores and birds of prey can take lethodyne with impunity herbivores and fruiteaters cannot recover and die of it man therefore being partly carnivorous will doubtless be able more or less to stand it  hilda wade smiled her sphinxlike smile not quite that i fancy she answered it will kill cats i feel sure at least most domesticated ones but it will not kill weasels yet both are carnivores  that young woman knows too much sebastian muttered to me looking after her as she glided noiselessly with her gentle tread down the long white corridor we shall have to suppress her cumberledge but ill wager my life shes right for all that i wonder now how the dickens she guessed it  intuition i answered  he pouted his under lip above the upper one with a dubious acquiescence inference i call it he retorted all womans socalled intuition is in fact just rapid and halfunconscious inference  he was so full of the subject however and so utterly carried away by his scientific ardour that i regret to say he gave a strong dose of lethodyne at once to each of the matrons petted and pampered persian cats which lounged about her room and were the delight of the convalescents they were two peculiarly lazy sultanas of catsmere jewels of the haremoriental beauties that loved to bask in the sun or curl themselves up on the rug before the fire and dawdle away their lives in congenial idleness strange to say hildas prophecy came true zuleika settled herself down comfortably in the professors easy chair and fell into a sound sleep from which there was no awaking while roxana met fate on the tigerskin she loved coiled up in a circle and passed from this life of dreams without knowing it into one where dreaming is not sebastian noted the facts with a quiet gleam of satisfaction in his watchful eye and explained afterwards with curt glibness to the angry matron that her favourites had been canonised in the roll of science as painless martyrs to the advancement of physiology  the weasels on the other hand with an equal dose woke up after six hours as lively as crickets it was clear that carnivorous tastes were not the whole solution for roxana was famed as a notable mouser  your principle sebastian asked our sibyl in his brief quick way  hildas cheek wore a glow of pardonable triumph the great teacher had deigned to ask her assistance i judged by the analogy of indian hemp she answered this is clearly a similar but much stronger narcotic now whenever i have given indian hemp by your direction to people of sluggish or even of merely bustling temperament i have noticed that small doses produce serious effects and that the afterresults are most undesirable but when you have prescribed the hemp for nervous overstrung imaginative people i have observed that they can stand large amounts of the tincture without evil results and that the aftereffects pass off rapidly i who am mercurial in temperament for example can take any amount of indian hemp without being made ill by it while ten drops will send some slow and torpid rustics mad drunk with excitementdrive them into homicidal mania  sebastian nodded his head he needed no more explanation you have hit it he said i see it at a glance the old antithesis all men and all animals fall roughly speaking into two great divisions of type the impassioned and the unimpassioned the vivid and the phlegmatic i catch your drift now lethodyne is poison to phlegmatic patients who have not active power enough to wake up from it unhurt it is relatively harmless to the vivid and impassioned who can be put asleep by it indeed for a few hours more or less but are alive enough to live on through the coma and reassert their vitality after it  i recognised as he spoke that this explanation was correct the dull rabbits the sleepy persian cats and the silly sheep had died outright of lethodyne the cunning inquisitive raccoon the quick hawk and the active intensenatured weasels all most eager wary and alert animals full of keenness and passion had recovered quickly  dare we try it on a human subject i asked tentatively  hilda wade answered at once with that unerring rapidity of hers yes certainly on a fewthe right persons i for one am not afraid to try it  you i cried feeling suddenly aware how much i thought of her oh not you please nurse wade some other life less valuable  sebastian stared at me coldly nurse wade volunteers he said it is in the cause of science who dares dissuade her that tooth of yours ah yes quite sufficient excuse you wanted it out nurse wade wellsdinton shall operate  without a moments hesitation hilda wade sat down in an easy chair and took a measured dose of the new anaesthetic proportioned to the average difference in weight between raccoons and humanity my face displayed my anxiety i suppose for she turned to me smiling with quiet confidence i know my own constitution she said with a reassuring glance that went straight to my heart i do not in the least fear  as for sebastian he administered the drug to her as unconcernedly as if she were a rabbit sebastians scientific coolness and calmness have long been the admiration of younger practitioners  wellsdinton gave one wrench the tooth came out as though the patient were a block of marble there was not a cry or a movement such as one notes when nitrous oxide is administered hilda wade was to all appearance a mass of lifeless flesh we stood round and watched i was trembling with terror even on sebastians pale face usually so unmoved save by the watchful eagerness of scientific curiosity i saw signs of anxiety  after four hours of profound slumberbreath hovering as it seemed between life and deathshe began to come to again in half an hour more she was wide awake she opened her eyes and asked for a glass of hock with beef essence or oysters  that evening by six oclock she was quite well and able to go about her duties as usual  sebastian is a wonderful man i said to her as i entered her ward on my rounds at night his coolness astonishes me do you know he watched you all the time you were lying asleep there as if nothing were the matter  coolness she inquired in a quiet voice or cruelty  cruelty i echoed aghast sebastian cruel oh nurse wade what an idea why he has spent his whole life in striving against all odds to alleviate pain he is the apostle of philanthropy  of philanthropy or of science to alleviate pain or to learn the whole truth about the human body  come come now i cried you analyse too far i will not let even you put me out of conceit with sebastian her face flushed at that even you i almost fancied she began to like me he is the enthusiasm of my life just consider how much he has done for humanity  she looked me through searchingly i will not destroy your illusion she answered after a pause it is a noble and generous one but is it not largely based on an ascetic face long white hair and a moustache that hides the cruel corners of the mouth for the corners are cruel some day i will show you them cut off the long hair shave the grizzled moustacheand what then will remain she drew a profile hastily just that and she showed it me twas a face like robespierres grown harder and older and lined with observation i recognised that it was in fact the essence of sebastian  next day as it turned out the professor himself insisted upon testing lethodyne in his own person all nats strove to dissuade him your life is so precious sirthe advancement of science but the professor was adamantine  science can only be advanced if men of science will take their lives in their hands he answered sternly besides nurse wade has tried am i to lag behind a woman in my devotion to the cause of physiological knowledge  let him try hilda wade murmured to me he is quite right it will not hurt him i have told him already he has just the proper temperament to stand the drug such people are rare he is one of them  we administered the dose trembling sebastian took it like a man and dropped off instantly for lethodyne is at least as instantaneous in its operation as nitrous oxide  he lay long asleep hilda and i watched him  after he had lain for some minutes senseless like a log on the couch where we had placed him hilda stooped over him quietly and lifted up the ends of the grizzled moustache then she pointed one accusing finger at his lips i told you so she murmured with a note of demonstration  there is certainly something rather stern or even ruthless about the set of the face and the firm ending of the lips i admitted reluctantly  that is why god gave men moustaches she mused in a low voice to hide the cruel corners of their mouths  not always cruel i cried  sometimes cruel sometimes cunning sometimes sensuous but nine times out of ten best masked by moustaches  you have a bad opinion of our sex i exclaimed  providence knew best she answered it gave you moustaches that was in order that we women might be spared from always seeing you as you are besides i said nine times out of ten there are exceptionssuch exceptions  on second thought i did not feel sure that i could quarrel with her estimate  the experiment was that time once more successful sebastian woke up from the comatose state after eight hours not quite as fresh as hilda wade perhaps but still tolerably alive less alert however and complaining of dull headache he was not hungry hilda wade shook her head at that it will be of use only in a very few cases she said to me regretfully and those few will need to be carefully picked by an acute observer i see resistance to the coma is even more than i thought a matter of temperament why so impassioned a man as the professor himself cannot entirely recover with more sluggish temperaments we shall have deeper difficulty  would you call him impassioned i asked most people think him so cold and stern  she shook her head he is a snowcapped volcano she answered the fires of his life burn bright below the exterior alone is cold and placid  however starting from that time sebastian began a course of experiments on patients giving infinitesimal doses at first and venturing slowly on somewhat larger quantities but only in his own case and hildas could the result be called quite satisfactory one dull and heavy drinksodden navvy to whom he administered no more than onetenth of a grain was drowsy for a week and listless long after while a fat washerwoman from west ham who took only twotenths fell so fast asleep and snored so stertorously that we feared she was going to doze off into eternity after the fashion of the rabbits mothers of large families we noted stood the drug very ill on pale young girls of the consumptive tendency its effect was not marked but only a patient here and there of exceptionally imaginative and vivid temperament seemed able to endure it sebastian was discouraged he saw the anaesthetic was not destined to fulfil his first enthusiastic humanitarian expectations one day while the investigation was just at this stage a case was admitted into the observationcots in which hilda wade took a particular interest the patient was a young girl named isabel huntleytall dark and slender a markedly quick and imaginative type with large black eyes which clearly bespoke a passionate nature though distinctly hysterical she was pretty and pleasing her rich dark hair was as copious as it was beautiful she held herself erect and had a finely poised head from the first moment she arrived i could see nurse wade was strongly drawn towards her their souls sympathised number fourteenthat is our impersonal way of describing caseswas constantly on hildas lips i like the girl she said once she is a lady in fibre  and a tobaccotrimmer by trade sebastian added sarcastically  as usual hildas was the truer description it went deeper  number fourteens ailment was a rare and peculiar one into which i need not enter here with professional precision i have described the case fully for my brother practitioners in my paper in the fourth volume of sebastians medical miscellanies it will be enough for my present purpose to say in brief that the lesion consisted of an internal growth which is always dangerous and most often fatal but which nevertheless is of such a character that if it be once happily eradicated by supremely good surgery it never tends to recur and leaves the patient as strong and well as ever sebastian was of course delighted with the splendid opportunity thus afforded him it is a beautiful case he cried with professional enthusiasm beautiful beautiful i never saw one so deadly or so malignant before we are indeed in lucks way only a miracle can save her life cumberledge we must proceed to perform the miracle  sebastian loved such cases they formed his ideal he did not greatly admire the artificial prolongation of diseased and unwholesome lives which could never be of much use to their owners or anyone else but when a chance occurred for restoring to perfect health a valuable existence which might otherwise be extinguished before its time he positively revelled in his beneficent calling what nobler object can a man propose to himself he used to say than to raise good men and true from the dead as it were and return them whole and sound to the family that depends upon them why i had fifty times rather cure an honest coalheaver of a wound in his leg than give ten years more lease of life to a gouty lord diseased from top to toe who expects to find a month of carlsbad or homburg once every year make up for eleven months of overeating overdrinking vulgar debauchery and underthinking he had no sympathy with men who lived the lives of swine his heart was with the workers  of course hilda wade soon suggested that as an operation was absolutely necessary number fourteen would be a splendid subject on whom to test once more the effects of lethodyne sebastian with his head on one side surveying the patient promptly coincided nervous diathesis he observed very vivid fancy twitches her hands the right way quick pulse rapid perceptions no meaningless unrest but deep vitality i dont doubt shell stand it  we explained to number fourteen the gravity of the case and also the tentative character of the operation under lethodyne at first she shrank from taking it no no she said let me die quietly but hilda like the angel of mercy that she was whispered in the girls ear if it succeeds you will get quite well andyou can marry arthur  the patients dark face flushed crimson  ah arthur she cried dear arthur i can bear anything you choose to do to mefor arthur  how soon you find these things out i cried to hilda a few minutes later a mere man would never have thought of that and who is arthur  a sailoron a ship that trades with the south seas i hope he is worthy of her fretting over arthurs absence has aggravated the case he is homewardbound now she is worrying herself to death for fear she should not live to say goodbye to him  she will live to marry him i answered with confidence like her own if you say she can stand it  the lethodyneoh yes thats all right but the operation itself is so extremely dangerous though dr sebastian says he has called in the best surgeon in london for all such cases they are rare he tells meand nielsen has performed on six three of them successfully  we gave the girl the drug she took it trembling and went off at once holding hildas hand with a pale smile on her face which persisted there somewhat weirdly all through the operation the work of removing the growth was long and ghastly even for us who were well seasoned to such sights but at the end nielsen expressed himself as perfectly satisfied a very neat piece of work sebastian exclaimed looking on i congratulate you nielsen i never saw anything done cleaner or better  a successful operation certainly the great surgeon admitted with just pride in the masters commendation  and the patient hilda asked wavering  oh the patient the patient will die nielsen replied in an unconcerned voice wiping his spotless instruments  that is not my idea of the medical art i cried shocked at his callousness an operation is only successful if  he regarded me with lofty scorn a certain percentage of losses he interrupted calmly is inevitable of course in all surgical operations we are obliged to average it how could i preserve my precision and accuracy of hand if i were always bothered by sentimental considerations of the patients safety  hilda wade looked up at me with a sympathetic glance we will pull her through yet she murmured in her soft voice if care and skill can do itmy care and your skill this is now our patient dr cumberledge  it needed care and skill we watched her for hours and she showed no sign or gleam of recovery her sleep was deeper than either sebastians or hildas had been she had taken a big dose so as to secure immobility the question now was would she recover at all from it hour after hour we waited and watched and not a sign of movement only the same deep slow hampered breathing the same feeble jerky pulse the same deathly pallor on the dark cheeks the same corpselike rigidity of limb and muscle  at last our patient stirred faintly as in a dream her breath faltered we bent over her was it death or was she beginning to recover  very slowly a faint trace of colour came back to her cheeks her heavy eyes half opened they stared first with a white stare her arms dropped by her side her mouth relaxed its ghastly smile we held our breath she was coming to again  but her coming to was slowvery very slow her pulse was still weak her heart pumped feebly we feared she might sink from inanition at any moment hilda wade knelt on the floor by the girls side and held a spoonful of beef essence coaxingly to her lips number fourteen gasped drew a long slow breath then gulped and swallowed it after that she lay back with her mouth open looking like a corpse hilda pressed another spoonful of the soft jelly upon her but the girl waved it away with one trembling hand let me die she cried let me die i feel dead already  hilda held her face close isabel she whisperedand i recognised in her tone the vast moral difference between isabel and number fourteenisabel you must take it for arthurs sake i say you must take it  the girls hand quivered as it lay on the white coverlet for arthurs sake she murmured lifting her eyelids dreamily for arthurs sake yes nurse dear  call me hilda please hilda  the girls face lighted up again yes hilda dear she answered in an unearthly voice like one raised from the dead i will call you what you will angel of light you have been so good to me  she opened her lips with an effort and slowly swallowed another spoonful then she fell back exhausted but her pulse improved within twenty minutes i mentioned the matter with enthusiasm to sebastian later it is very nice in its way he answered but it is not nursing  i thought to myself that that was just what it was but i did not say so sebastian was a man who thought meanly of women a doctor like a priest he used to declare should keep himself unmarried his bride is medicine and he disliked to see what he called philandering going on in his hospital it may have been on that account that i avoided speaking much of hilda wade thenceforth before him  he looked in casually next day to see the patient she will die he said with perfect assurance as we passed down the ward together operation has taken too much out of her  still she has great recuperative powers hilda answered they all have in her family professor you may perhaps remember joseph huntley who occupied number sixtyseven in the accident ward some nine months sincecompound fracture of the arma dark nervous engineers assistantvery hard to restrainwell he was her brother he caught typhoid fever in the hospital and you commented at the time on his strange vitality then there was her cousin again ellen stubbs we had her for stubborn chronic laryngitisa very bad caseanyone else would have diedyielded at once to your treatment and made i recollect a splendid convalescence  what a memory you have sebastian cried admiring against his will it is simply marvellous i never saw anyone like you in my life except once he was a man a doctor a colleague of minedead long ago why he mused and gazed hard at her hilda shrank before his gaze this is curious he went on slowly at last very curious youwhy you resemble him  do i hilda replied with forced calm raising her eyes to his their glances met that moment i saw each had recognised something and from that day forth i was instinctively aware that a duel was being waged between sebastian and hildaa duel between the two ablest and most singular personalities i had ever met a duel of life and deaththough i did not fully understand its purport till much much later  every day after that the poor wasted girl in number fourteen grew feebler and fainter her temperature rose her heart throbbed weakly she seemed to be fading away sebastian shook his head lethodyne is a failure he said with a mournful regret one cannot trust it the case might have recovered from the operation or recovered from the drug but she could not recover from both together yet the operation would have been impossible without the drug and the drug is useless except for the operation  it was a great disappointment to him he hid himself in his room as was his wont when disappointed and went on with his old work at his beloved microbes  i have one hope still hilda murmured to me by the bedside when our patient was at her worst if one contingency occurs i believe we may save her  what is that i asked  she shook her head waywardly you must wait and see she answered if it comes off i will tell you if not let it swell the limbo of lost inspirations  next morning early however she came up to me with a radiant face holding a newspaper in her hand well it has happened she cried rejoicing we shall save poor isabel number fourteen i mean our way is clear dr cumberledge  i followed her blindly to the bedside little guessing what she could mean she knelt down at the head of the cot the girls eyes were closed i touched her cheek she was in a high fever temperature i asked  a hundred and three  i shook my head every symptom of fatal relapse i could not imagine what card hilda held in reserve but i stood there waiting  she whispered in the girls ear arthurs ship is sighted off the lizard  the patient opened her eyes slowly and rolled them for a moment as if she did not understand  too late i cried too late she is deliriousinsensible  hilda repeated the words slowly but very distinctly do you hear dear arthurs ship it is sighted arthurs ship at the lizard  the girls lips moved arthur arthur arthurs ship a deep sigh she clenched her hands he is coming hilda nodded and smiled holding her breath with suspense  up the channel now he will be at southampton tonight arthur at southampton it is here in the papers i have telegraphed to him to hurry on at once to see you  she struggled up for a second a smile flitted across the worn face then she fell back wearily  i thought all was over her eyes stared white but ten minutes later she opened her lids again arthur is coming she murmured arthur coming  yes dear now sleep he is coming  all through that day and the next night she was restless and agitated but still her pulse improved a little next morning she was again a trifle better temperature fallinga hundred and one point three at ten oclock hilda came in to her radiant  well isabel dear she cried bending down and touching her cheek kissing is forbidden by the rules of the house arthur has come he is here down below i have seen him  seen him the girl gasped  yes seen him talked with him such a nice manly fellow and such an honest good face he is longing for you to get well he says he has come home this time to marry you  the wan lips quivered he will never marry me  yes yes he willif you will take this jelly look herehe wrote these words to you before my very eyes dear love to my isa if you are good and will sleep he may see youtomorrow  the girl opened her lips and ate the jelly greedily she ate as much as she was desired in three minutes more her head had fallen like a childs upon her pillow and she was sleeping peacefully    i went up to sebastians room quite excited with the news he was busy among his bacilli they were his hobby his pets well what do you think professor i cried that patient of nurse wades  he gazed up at me abstractedly his brow contracting yes yes i know he interrupted the girl in fourteen i have discounted her case long ago she has ceased to interest me dead of course nothing else was possible  i laughed a quick little laugh of triumph no sir not dead recovering she has fallen just now into a normal sleep her breathing is natural  he wheeled his revolving chair away from the germs and fixed me with his keen eyes recovering he echoed impossible rallying you mean a mere flicker i know my trade she must die this evening  forgive my persistence i replied buther temperature has gone down to ninetynine and a trifle  he pushed away the bacilli in the nearest watchglass quite angrily to ninetynine he exclaimed knitting his brows cumberledge this is disgraceful a most disappointing case a most provoking patient  but surely sir i cried  dont talk to me boy dont attempt to apologise for her such conduct is unpardonable she ought to have died it was her clear duty i said she would die and she should have known better than to fly in the face of the faculty her recovery is an insult to medical science what is the staff about nurse wade should have prevented it  still sir i exclaimed trying to touch him on a tender spot the anaesthetic you know such a triumph for lethodyne this case shows clearly that on certain constitutions it may be used with advantage under certain conditions  he snapped his fingers lethodyne pooh i have lost interest in it impracticable it is not fitted for the human species  why so number fourteen proves  he interrupted me with an impatient wave of his hand then he rose and paced up and down the room testily after a pause he spoke again the weak point of lethodyne is this nobody can be trusted to say when it may be usedexcept nurse wadewhich is not science  for the first time in my life i had a glimmering idea that i distrusted sebastian hilda wade was rightthe man was cruel but i had never observed his cruelty beforebecause his devotion to science had blinded me to it    chapter ii  the episode of the gentleman who had failed for everything   one day about those times i went round to call on my aunt lady tepping and lest you accuse me of the vulgar desire to flaunt my fine relations in your face i hasten to add that my poor dear old aunt is a very ordinary specimen of the common army widow her husband sir malcolm a crusty old gentleman of the ancient school was knighted in burma or thereabouts for a successful raid upon naked natives on something that is called the shan frontier when he had grown grey in the service of his queen and country besides earning himself incidentally a very decent pension he acquired gout and went to his long rest in kensal green cemetery he left his wife with one daughter and the only pretence to a title in our otherwise blameless family  my cousin daphne is a very pretty girl with those quiet sedate manners which often develop later in life into genuine selfrespect and real depth of character fools do not admire her they accuse her of being heavy but she can do without fools she has a fine strongly built figure an upright carriage a large and broad forehead a firm chin and features which though wellmarked and wellmoulded are yet delicate in outline and sensitive in expression very young men seldom take to daphne she lacks the desired inanity but she has mind repose and womanly tenderness indeed if she had not been my cousin i almost think i might once have been tempted to fall in love with her  when i reached gloucester terrace on this particular afternoon i found hilda wade there before me she had lunched at my aunts in fact it was her day out at st nathaniels and she had come round to spend it with daphne tepping i had introduced her to the house some time before and she and my cousin had struck up a close acquaintance immediately their temperaments were sympathetic daphne admired hildas depth and reserve while hilda admired daphnes grave grace and selfcontrol her perfect freedom from current affectations she neither giggled nor aped ibsenism  a third person stood back in the room when i entereda tall and somewhat jerrybuilt young man with a rather long and solemn face like an early stage in the evolution of a don quixote i took a good look at him there was something about his air that impressed me as both lugubrious and humorous and in this i was right for i learned later that he was one of those rare people who can sing a comic song with immense success while preserving a sour countenance like a puritan preachers his eyes were a little sunken his fingers long and nervous but i fancied he looked a good fellow at heart for all that though foolishly impulsive he was a punctilious gentleman i felt sure his face and manner grew upon one rapidly  daphne rose as i entered and waved the stranger forward with an imperious little wave i imagined indeed that i detected in the gesture a faint touch of halfunconscious proprietorship goodmorning hubert she said taking my hand but turning towards the tall young man i dont think you know mr cecil holsworthy  i have heard you speak of him i answered drinking him in with my glance i added internally not half good enough for you  hildas eyes met mine and read my thought they flashed back word in the language of eyes i do not agree with you  daphne meanwhile was watching me closely i could see she was anxious to discover what impression her friend mr holsworthy was making on me till then i had no idea she was fond of anyone in particular but the way her glance wandered from him to me and from me to hilda showed clearly that she thought much of this gawky visitor  we sat and talked together we four for some time i found the young man with the lugubrious countenance improved immensely on closer acquaintance his talk was clever he turned out to be the son of a politician high in office in the canadian government and he had been educated at oxford the father i gathered was rich but he himself was making an income of nothing a year just then as a briefless barrister and he was hesitating whether to accept a post of secretary that had been offered him in the colony or to continue his negative career at the inner temple for the honour and glory of it  now which would you advise me miss tepping he inquired after we had discussed the matter some minutes  daphnes face flushed up it is so hard to decide she answered to decide to your best advantage i mean of course for naturally all your english friends would wish to keep you as long as possible in england  no do you think so the gawky young man jerked out with evident pleasure now thats awfully kind of you do you know if you tell me i ought to stay in england ive half a mind ill cable over this very day and refuse the appointment  daphne flushed once more oh please dont she exclaimed looking frightened i shall be quite distressed if a stray word of mine should debar you from accepting a good offer of a secretaryship  why your least wish the young man beganthen checked himself hastilymust be always important he went on in a different voice to everyone of your acquaintance  daphne rose hurriedly look here hilda she said a little tremulously biting her lip i have to go out into westbourne grove to get those gloves for tonight and a spray for my hair will you excuse me for half an hour  holsworthy rose too maynt i go with you he asked eagerly  oh if you like how very kind of you daphne answered her cheek a blush rose hubert will you come too and you hilda  it was one of those invitations which are given to be refused i did not need hildas warning glance to tell me that my company would be quite superfluous i felt those two were best left together  its no use though dr cumberledge hilda put in as soon as they were gone he wont propose though he has had every encouragement i dont know whats the matter but ive been watching them both for weeks and somehow things seem never to get any forwarder  you think hes in love with her i asked  in love with her well you have eyes in your head i know where could they have been looking hes madly in lovea very good kind of love too he genuinely admires and respects and appreciates all daphnes sweet and charming qualities  then what do you suppose is the matter  i have an inkling of the truth i imagine mr cecil must have let himself in for a prior attachment  if so why does he hang about daphne  becausehe cant help himself hes a good fellow and a chivalrous fellow he admires your cousin but he must have got himself into some foolish entanglement elsewhere which he is too honourable to break off while at the same time hes far too much impressed by daphnes fine qualities to be able to keep away from her its the ordinary case of love versus duty  is he well off could he afford to marry daphne  oh his fathers very rich he has plenty of money a canadian millionaire they say that makes it all the likelier that some undesirable young woman somewhere may have managed to get hold of him just the sort of romantic impressionable hobbledehoy such women angle for  i drummed my fingers on the table presently hilda spoke again why dont you try to get to know him and find out precisely whats the matter  i know whats the matternow youve told me i answered its as clear as day daphne is very much smitten with him too im sorry for daphne well ill take your advice ill try to have some talk with him  do please i feel sure i have hit upon it he has got himself engaged in a hurry to some girl he doesnt really care about and he is far too much of a gentleman to break it off though hes in love quite another way with daphne  just at that moment the door opened and my aunt entered  why wheres daphne she cried looking about her and arranging her black lace shawl  she has just run out into westbourne grove to get some gloves and a flower for the fete this evening hilda answered then she added significantly mr holsworthy has gone with her  what that boys been here again  yes lady tepping he called to see daphne  my aunt turned to me with an aggrieved tone it is a peculiarity of my auntsi have met it elsewherethat if she is angry with jones and jones is not present she assumes a tone of injured asperity on his account towards brown or smith or any other innocent person whom she happens to be addressing now this is really too bad hubert she burst out as if i were the culprit disgraceful abominable im sure i cant make out what the young fellow means by it here he comes dangling after daphne every day and all day longand never once says whether he means anything by it or not in my young days such conduct as that would not have been considered respectable  i nodded and beamed benignly  well why dont you answer me my aunt went on warming up do you mean to tell me you think his behaviour respectful to a nice girl in daphnes position  my dear aunt i answered you confound the persons i am not mr holsworthy i decline responsibility for him i meet him here in your house for the first time this morning  then that shows how often you come to see your relations hubert my aunt burst out obliquely the mans been here to my certain knowledge every day this six weeks  really aunt fanny i said you must recollect that a professional man  oh yes thats the way lay it all down to your profession do hubert though i know you were at the thorntons on saturdaysaw it in the papersthe morning postamong the guests were sir edward and lady burnes professor sebastian dr hubert cumberledge and so forth and so forth you think you can conceal these things but you cant i get to know them  conceal them my dearest aunt why i danced twice with daphne  daphne yes daphne they all run after daphne my aunt exclaimed altering the venue once more but theres no respect for age left i expect to be neglected however thats neither here nor there the point is this youre the one man now living in the family you ought to behave like a brother to daphne why dont you board this holsworthy person and ask him his intentions  goodness gracious i cried most excellent of aunts that epoch has gone past the late lamented queen anne is now dead its no use asking the young man of today to explain his intentions he will refer you to the works of the scandinavian dramatists  my aunt was speechless she could only gurgle out the words well i can safely say that of all the monstrous behaviour then language failed her and she relapsed into silence  however when daphne and young holsworthy returned i had as much talk with him as i could and when he left the house i left also  which way are you walking i asked as we turned out into the street  towards my rooms in the temple  oh im going back to st nathaniels i continued if youll allow me ill walk part way with you  how very kind of you  we strode side by side a little distance in silence then a thought seemed to strike the lugubrious young man what a charming girl your cousin is he exclaimed abruptly  you seem to think so i answered smiling  he flushed a little the lantern jaw grew longer i admire her of course he answered who doesnt she is so extraordinarily handsome  well not exactly handsome i replied with more critical and kinsmanlike deliberation pretty if you will and decidedly pleasing and attractive in manner  he looked me up and down as if he found me a person singularly deficient in taste and appreciation ah but then you are her cousin he said at last with a compassionate tone that makes a difference  i quite see all daphnes strong points i answered still smiling for i could perceive he was very far gone she is goodlooking and she is clever  clever he echoed profound she has a most unusual intellect she stands alone  like her mothers silk dresses i murmured half under my breath  he took no notice of my flippant remark but went on with his rhapsody such depth such penetration and then how sympathetic why even to a mere casual acquaintance like myself she is so kind so discerning  are you such a casual acquaintance i inquired with a smile it might have shocked aunt fanny to hear me but that is the way we ask a young man his intentions nowadays  he stopped short and hesitated oh quite casual he replied almost stammering most casual i assure you i have never ventured to do myself the honour of supposing that that miss tepping could possibly care for me  there is such a thing as being too modest and unassuming i answered it sometimes leads to unintentional cruelty  no do you think so he cried his face falling all at once i should blame myself bitterly if that were so dr cumberledge you are her cousin do you gather that i have acted in such a way as toto lead miss tepping to suppose i felt any affection for her  i laughed in his face my dear boy i answered laying one hand on his shoulder may i say the plain truth a blind bat could see you are madly in love with her  his mouth twitched thats very serious he answered gravely very serious  it is i responded with my best paternal manner gazing blankly in front of me  he stopped short again look here he said facing me are you busy no then come back with me to my rooms andill make a clean breast of it  by all means i assented when one is youngand foolishi have often noticed as a medical man that a drachm of clean breast is a magnificent prescription  he walked back by my side talking all the way of daphnes many adorable qualities he exhausted the dictionary for laudatory adjectives by the time i reached his door it was not his fault if i had not learned that the angelic hierarchy were not in the running with my pretty cousin for graces and virtues i felt that faith hope and charity ought to resign at once in favour of miss daphne tepping promoted  he took me into his comfortably furnished roomsthe luxurious rooms of a rich young bachelor with taste as well as moneyand offered me a partaga now i have long observed in the course of my practice that a choice cigar assists a man in taking a philosophic outlook on the question under discussion so i accepted the partaga he sat down opposite me and pointed to a photograph in the centre of his mantlepiece i am engaged to that lady he put in shortly  so i anticipated i answered lighting up  he started and looked surprised why what made you guess it he inquired  i smiled the calm smile of superior agei was some eight years or so his senior my dear fellow i murmured what else could prevent you from proposing to daphnewhen you are so undeniably in love with her  a great deal he answered for example the sense of my own utter unworthiness  ones own unworthiness i replied though doubtless realpf pfis a barrier that most of us can readily get over when our admiration for a particular lady waxes strong enough so this is the prior attachment i took the portrait down and scanned it  unfortunately yes what do you think of her  i scrutinised the features seems a nice enough little thing i answered it was an innocent face i admit very frank and girlish  he leaned forward eagerly thats just it a nice enough little thing nothing in the world to be said against her while daphnemiss tepping i mean his silence was ecstatic  i examined the photograph still more closely it displayed a lady of twenty or thereabouts with a weak face small vacant features a feeble chin a goodhumoured simple mouth and a wealth of golden hair that seemed to strike a keynote  in the theatrical profession i inquired at last looking up  he hesitated well not exactly he answered  i pursed my lips and blew a ring musichall stage i went on dubiously  he nodded but a girl is not necessarily any the less a lady because she sings at a musichall he added with warmth displaying an evident desire to be just to his betrothed however much he admired daphne  certainly not i admitted a lady is a lady no occupation can in itself unladify her but on the musichall stage the odds one must admit are on the whole against her  now there you show prejudice  one may be quite unprejudiced i answered and yet allow that connection with the musichalls does not as such afford clear proof that a girl is a compound of all the virtues  i think shes a good girl he retorted slowly  then why do you want to throw her over i inquired  i dont thats just it on the contrary i mean to keep my word and marry her  in order to keep your word i suggested  he nodded precisely it is a point of honour  thats a poor ground of marriage i went on mind i dont want for a moment to influence you as daphnes cousin i want to get at the truth of the situation i dont even know what daphne thinks of you but you promised me a clean breast be a man and bare it  he bared it instantly i thought i was in love with this girl you see he went on till i saw miss tepping  that makes a difference i admitted  and i couldnt bear to break her heart  heaven forbid i cried it is the one unpardonable sin better anything than that then i grew practical fathers consent  my fathers is it likely he expects me to marry into some distinguished english family  i hummed a moment well out with it i exclaimed pointing my cigar at him  he leaned back in his chair and told me the whole story a pretty girl golden hair introduced to her by a friend nice simple little thing mind and heart above the irregular stage on to which she had been driven by poverty alone father dead mother in reduced circumstances to keep the home together poor sissie decided  precisely so i murmured knocking off my ash the usual selfsacrifice case quite normal everything en regle  you dont mean to say you doubt it he cried flushing up and evidently regarding me as a hopeless cynic i do assure you dr cumberledge the poor childthough miles of course below miss teppings levelis as innocent and as good  as a flower in may oh yes i dont doubt it how did you come to propose to her though  he reddened a little well it was almost accidental he said sheepishly i called there one evening and her mother had a headache and went up to bed and when we two were left alone sissie talked a great deal about her future and how hard her life was and after a while she broke down and began to cry and then  i cut him short with a wave of my hand you need say no more i put in with a sympathetic face we have all been there  we paused a moment while i puffed smoke at the photograph again well i said at last her face looks to me really simple and nice it is a good face do you see her often  oh no shes on tour  in the provinces  myes just at present at scarborough  but she writes to you  every day  would you think it an unpardonable impertinence if i made bold to ask whether it would be possible for you to show me a specimen of her letters  he unlocked a drawer and took out three or four then he read one through carefully i dont think he said in a deliberative voice it would be a serious breach of confidence in me to let you look through this one theres really nothing in it you knowjust the ordinary average everyday loveletter  i glanced through the little note he was right the conventional hearts and darts epistle it sounded nice enough longing to see you again so lonely in this place your dear sweet letter looking forward to the time your everdevoted sissie  that seems straight i answered however i am not quite sure will you allow me to take it away with the photograph i know i am asking much i want to show it to a lady in whose tact and discrimination i have the greatest confidence  what daphne  i smiled no not daphne i answered our friend miss wade she has extraordinary insight  i could trust anything to miss wade she is true as steel  you are right i answered that shows that you too are a judge of character  he hesitated i feel a brute he cried to go on writing every day to sissie montagueand yet calling every day to see miss tepping but stilli do it  i grasped his hand my dear fellow i said nearly ninety per cent of men after allare human  i took both letter and photograph back with me to nathaniels when i had gone my rounds that night i carried them into hilda wades room and told her the story her face grew grave we must be just she said at last daphne is deeply in love with him but even for daphnes sake we must not take anything for granted against the other lady  i produced the photograph what do you make of that i asked i think it an honest face myself i may tell you  she scrutinised it long and closely with a magnifier then she put her head on one side and mused very deliberately madeline shaw gave me her photograph the other day and said to me as she gave it i do so like these modern portraits they show one what might have been  you mean they are so much touched up  exactly that as it stands is a sweet innocent facean honest girls facealmost babyish in its transparency but the innocence has all been put into it by the photographer  you think so  i know it look here at those lines just visible on the cheek they disappear nowhere at impossible angles and the corners of that mouth they couldnt go so with that nose and those puckers the thing is not real it has been atrociously edited part is natures part the photographers part even possibly paint and powder  but the underlying face  is a minxs  i handed her the letter this next i asked fixing my eyes on her as she looked  she read it through for a minute or two she examined it the letter is right enough she answered after a second reading though its guileless simplicity is perhaps under the circumstances just a leetle overdone but the handwritingthe handwriting is duplicity itself a cunning serpentine hand no openness or honesty in it depend upon it that girl is playing a double game  you believe then there is character in handwriting  undoubtedly when we know the character we can see it in the writing the difficulty is to see it and read it before we know it and i have practised a little at that there is character in all we do of courseour walk our cough the very wave of our hands the only secret is not all of us have always skill to see it here however i feel pretty sure the curls of the gs and the tails of the yshow full they are of wile of low underhand trickery  i looked at them as she pointed that is true i exclaimed i see it when you show it lines meant for effect no straightness or directness in them  hilda reflected a moment poor daphne she murmured i would do anything to help her ill tell what might be a good plan her face brightened my holiday comes next week ill run down to scarboroughits as nice a place for a holiday as anyand ill observe this young lady it can do no harmand good may come of it  how kind of you i cried but you are always all kindness  hilda went to scarborough and came back again for a week before going on to bruges where she proposed to spend the greater part of her holidays she stopped a night or two in town to report progress and finding another nurse ill promised to fill her place till a substitute was forthcoming  well dr cumberledge she said when she saw me alone i was right i have found out a fact or two about daphnes rival  you have seen her i asked  seen her i have stopped for a week in the same house a very nice lodginghouse on the spa front too the girls well enough off the poverty plea fails she goes about in good rooms and carries a mother with her  thats well i answered that looks all right  oh yes shes quite presentable has the manners of a lady whenever she chooses but the chief point is this she laid her letters every day on the table in the passage outside her door for postlaid them all in a row so that when one claimed ones own one couldnt help seeing them  well that was open and aboveboard i continued beginning to fear we had hastily misjudged miss sissie montague  very opentoo much so in fact for i was obliged to note the fact that she wrote two letters regularly every day of her lifeto my two mashes she explained one afternoon to a young man who was with her as she laid them on the table one of them was always addressed to cecil holsworthy esq  and the other  wasnt  did you note the name i asked interested  yes here it is she handed me a slip of paper  i read it reginald nettlecraft esq 427 staples inn london  what reggie nettlecraft i cried amused why he was a very little boy at charterhouse when i was a big one he afterwards went to oxford and got sent down from christ church for the part he took in burning a greek bust in tom quadan antique greek bustafter a bump supper  just the sort of man i should have expected hilda answered with a suppressed smile i have a sort of inkling that miss montague likes him best he is nearer her type but she thinks cecil holsworthy the better match has mr nettlecraft money  not a penny i should say an allowance from his father perhaps who is a lincolnshire parson but otherwise nothing  then in my opinion the young lady is playing for mr holsworthys money failing which she will decline upon mr nettlecrafts heart  we talked it all over in the end i said abruptly nurse wade you have seen miss montague or whatever she calls herself i have not i wont condemn her unheard i have half a mind to run down one day next week to scarborough and have a look at her  do that will suffice you can judge then for yourself whether or not i am mistaken  i went and what is more i heard miss sissie sing at her halla pretty domestic song most childish and charming she impressed me not unfavourably in spite of what hilda said her peachblossom cheek might have been art but looked like nature she had an open face a baby smile and there was a frank girlishness about her dress and manner that took my fancy after all i thought to myself even hilda wade is fallible  so that evening when her turn was over i made up my mind to go round and call upon her i had told cecil holsworthy my intentions beforehand and it rather shocked him he was too much of a gentleman to wish to spy upon the girl he had promised to marry however in my case there need be no such scruples i found the house and asked for miss montague as i mounted the stairs to the drawingroom floor i heard a sound of voicesthe murmur of laughter idiotic guffaws suppressed giggles the masculine and feminine varieties of tomfoolery  youd make a splendid woman of business you would a young man was saying i gathered from his drawl that he belonged to that subspecies of the human race which is known as the chappie  wouldnt i just a girls voice answered tittering i recognised it as sissies you ought to see me at it why my brother set up a place once for mending bicycles and i used to stand about at the door as if i had just returned from a ride and when fellows came in with a nut loose or something id begin talking with them while bertie tightened it then when they werent looking id dab the business end of a darningneedle so just plump into their tires and of course as soon as they went off they were back again in a minute to get a puncture mended i call that business  a roar of laughter greeted the recital of this brilliant incident in a commercial career as it subsided i entered there were two men in the room besides miss montague and her mother and a second young lady  excuse this late call i said quietly bowing but i have only one night in scarborough miss montague and i wanted to see you im a friend of mr holsworthys i told him id look you up and this is my sole opportunity  i felt rather than saw that miss montague darted a quick glance of hidden meaning at her friends the chappies their faces in response ceased to snigger and grew instantly sober  she took my card then in her alternative manner as the perfect lady she presented me to her mother dr cumberledge mamma she said in a faintly warning voice a friend of mr holsworthys  the old lady half rose let me see she said staring at me which is mr holsworthy sissis it cecil or reggie  one of the chappies burst into a fatuous laugh once more at this remark now youre giving away the whole show mrs montague he exclaimed with a chuckle a look from miss sissie immediately checked him  i am bound to admit however that after these untoward incidents of the first minute miss montague and her friends behaved throughout with distinguished propriety her manners were perfecti may even say demure she asked about cecil with charming naivete she was frank and girlish lots of innocent fun in her no doubtshe sang us a comic song in excellent taste which is a severe testbut not a suspicion of doubledealing if i had not overheard those few words as i came up the stairs i think i should have gone away believing the poor girl an injured child of nature  as it was i went back to london the very next day determined to renew my slight acquaintance with reggie nettlecraft  fortunately i had a good excuse for going to visit him i had been asked to collect among old carthusians for one of those endless testimonials which pursue one through life and are perhaps the worst nemesis which follows the crime of having wasted ones youth at a public school a testimonial for a retiring master or professional cricketer or washerwoman or something and in the course of my duties as collector it was quite natural that i should call upon all my fellowvictims so i went to his rooms in staples inn and reintroduced myself  reggie nettlecraft had grown up into an unwholesome spotty indeterminate young man with a speckled necktie and cuffs of which he was inordinately proud and which he insisted on flashing every second minute he was also evidently selfsatisfied which was odd for i have seldom seen anyone who afforded less cause for rational satisfaction hullo he said when i told him my name so its you is it cumberledge he glanced at my card st nathaniels hospital what rot why blow me tight if you havent turned sawbones  that is my profession i answered unashamed and you  oh i dont have any luck you know old man they turned me out of oxford because i had too much sense of humour for the authorities therebeastly set of old fogeys objected to my chucking oyster shells at the tutors windowsgood old english custom fast becoming obsolete then i crammed for the army but bless your heart a gentleman has no chance for the army nowadays a pack of blooming cads with what they call intellect read up for the exams and dont give us a lookin i call it sheer piffle then the guvnor set me on electrical engineeringelectrical engineerings played out i put no stock in it besides its such beastly fag and then you get your hands dirty so now im reading for the bar and if only my coach can put me up to tips enough to dodge the examiners i expect to be called some time next summer  and when you have failed for everything i inquired just to test his sense of humour  he swallowed it like a roach oh when ive failed for everything i shall stick up to the guvnor hang it all a gentleman cant be expected to earn his own livelihood englands going to the dogs thats where it is no snug little sinecures left for chaps like you and me all this beastly competition and no respect for the feelings of gentlemen either why would you believe it cumbergroundwe used to call you cumberground at charterhouse i remember or was it fig treei happened to get a bit lively in the haymarket last week after a rattling good supper and the chap at the police courtold cove with a squintpositively proposed to send me to prison without the option of a fineill trouble you for thatsend me to prison justfor knocking down a common brute of a bobby theres no mistake about it englands not a country now for a gentleman to live in  then why not mark your sense of the fact by leaving it i inquired with a smile  he shook his head what emigrate no thank you im not taking any none of your colonies for me if you please i shall stick to the old ship im too much attached to the empire  and yet imperialists i said generally gush over the coloniesthe empire on which the sun never sets  the empire in leicester squire he responded gazing at me with unspoken contempt have a whiskyandsoda old chap what no never drink between meals well you do surprise me i suppose that comes of being a sawbones dont it  possibly i answered we respect our livers then i went on to the ostensible reason of my visitthe charterhouse testimonial he slapped his thighs metaphorically by way of suggesting the depleted condition of his pockets stony broke cumberledge he murmured stony broke honour bright unless bluebird pulls off the prince of waless stakes i really dont know how im to pay the benchers  its quite unimportant i answered i was asked to ask you and i have asked you  so i twig my dear fellow sorry to have to say no but ill tell you what i can do for you i can put you upon a straight thing  i glanced at the mantelpiece i see you have a photograph of miss sissie montague i broke in casually taking it down and examining it with an autograph too reggie from sissie you are a friend of hers  a friend of hers ill trouble you she is a clinker sissie is you should see that girl smoke i give you my word of honour cumberledge she can consume cigarettes against any fellow i know in london hang it all a girl like that you knowwell one cant help admiring her ever seen her  oh yes i know her i called on her in fact night before last at scarborough  he whistled a moment then broke into an imbecile laugh my gum he cried this is a start this is you dont mean to tell me you are the other johnnie  what other johnnie i asked feeling we were getting near it  he leaned back and laughed again well you know that girl sissie shes a clever one she is he went on after a minute staring at me shes a regular clinker got two strings to her bow thats where the trouble comes in me and another fellow she likes me for love and the other fellow for money now dont you come and tell me that you are the other fellow  i have certainly never aspired to the young ladys hand i answered cautiously but dont you know your rivals name then  thats sissies blooming cleverness shes a caulker sissie is you dont take a rise out of sissie in a hurry she knows that if i knew who the other bloke was id blow upon her little game to him and put him off her and i would sep me taters for im nuts on that girl i tell you cumberledge she is a clinker  you seem to me admirably adapted for one another i answered truthfully i had not the slightest compunction in handing reggie nettlecraft over to sissie nor in handing sissie over to reggie nettlecraft  adapted for one another thats just it there you hit the right nail plump on the cocoanut cumberground but sissies an artful one she is shes playing for the other johnnie hes got the dibs you know and sissie wants the dibs even more than she wants yours truly  got what i inquired not quite catching the phrase  the dibs old man the chink the oof the ready rhino he rolls in it she says i cant find out the chaps name but i know his guvnors something or other in the millionaire trade somewhere across in america  she writes to you i think  thats so every blooming day but how the dummy did you come to know it  she lays letters addressed to you on the hall table at her lodgings in scarborough  the dickens she does careless little beggar yes she writes to mepages shes awfully gone on me really shed marry me if it wasnt for the johnnie with the dibs she doesnt care for him she wants his money he dresses badly dont you see and after all the clothes make the man id like to get at him id spoil his pretty face for him and he assumed a playfully pugilistic attitude  you really want to get rid of this other fellow i asked seeing my chance  get rid of him why of course chuck him into the river some nice dark night if i could once get a look at him  as a preliminary step would you mind letting me see one of miss montagues letters i inquired  he drew a long breath theyre a bit affectionate you know he murmured stroking his beardless chin in hesitation shes a hot un sissie is she pitches it pretty warm on the affectionstop i can tell you but if you really think you can give the other johnnie a cut on the head with her letterswell in the interests of true love which never does run smooth i dont mind letting you have a squint as my friend at one of her charming billydoos  he took a bundle from a drawer ran his eye over one or two with a maudlin air and then selected a specimen not wholly unsuitable for publication theres one in the eye for c he said chuckling what would c say to that i wonder she always calls him c you know its so jolly noncommitting she says i only wish that beastly old bore c were at halifaxwhich is where he comes from and then i would fly at once to my own dear reggie but hang it all reggie boy whats the good of true love if you havent got the dibs i must have my comforts love in a cottage is all very well in its way but whos to pay for the fizz reggie thats her refinement dont you see sissies awfully refined she was brought up with the tastes and habits of a lady  clearly so i answered both her literary style and her liking for champagne abundantly demonstrate it his acute sense of humour did not enable him to detect the irony of my observation i doubt if it extended much beyond oyster shells he handed me the letter i read it through with equal amusement and gratification if miss sissie had written it on purpose in order to open cecil holsworthys eyes she couldnt have managed the matter better or more effectually it breathed ardent love tempered by a determination to sell her charms in the best and highest matrimonial market  now i know this man c i said when i had finished and i want to ask whether you will let me show him miss montagues letter it would set him against the girl who as a matter of fact is wholly unwori mean totally unfitted for him  let you show it to him like a bird why sissie promised me herself that if she couldnt bring that solemn ass c up to the scratch by christmas shed chuck him and marry me its here in writing and he handed me another gem of epistolary literature  you have no compunctions i asked again after reading it  not a blessed compunction to my name  then neither have i i answered  i felt they both deserved it sissie was a minx as hilda rightly judged while as for nettlecraftwell if a public school and an english university leave a man a cad a cad he will be and there is nothing more to be said about it  i went straight off with the letters to cecil holsworthy he read them through half incredulously at first he was too honestnatured himself to believe in the possibility of such doubledealingthat one could have innocent eyes and golden hair and yet be a trickster he read them twice then he compared them word for word with the simple affection and childlike tone of his own last letter received from the same lady her versatility of style would have done honour to a practised literary craftsman at last he handed them back to me do you think he said on the evidence of these i should be doing wrong in breaking with her  wrong in breaking with her i exclaimed you would be doing wrong if you didntwrong to yourself wrong to your family wrong if i may venture to say so to daphne wrong even in the long run to the girl herself for she is not fitted for you and she is fitted for reggie nettlecraft now do as i bid you sit down at once and write her a letter from my dictation  he sat down and wrote much relieved that i took the responsibility off his shoulders   dear miss montague i began the inclosed letters have come into my hands without my seeking it after reading them i feel that i have absolutely no right to stand between you and the man of your real choice it would not be kind or wise of me to do so i release you at once and consider myself released you may therefore regard our engagement as irrevocably cancelled  faithfully yours  cecil holsworthy   nothing more than that he asked looking up and biting his pen not a word of regret or apology  not a word i answered you are really too lenient  i made him take it out and post it before he could invent conscientious scruples then he turned to me irresolutely what shall i do next he asked with a comical air of doubt  i smiled my dear fellow that is a matter for your own consideration  butdo you think she will laugh at me  miss montague  no daphne  i am not in not in daphnes confidence i answered i dont know how she feels but on the face of it i think i can venture to assure you that at least she wont laugh at you  he grasped my hand hard you dont mean to say so he cried well thats really very kind of her a girl of daphnes high type and i who feel myself so utterly unworthy of her  we are all unworthy of a good womans love i answered but thank heaven the good women dont seem to realise it  that evening about ten my new friend came back in a hurry to my rooms at st nathaniels nurse wade was standing there giving her report for the night when he entered his face looked some inches shorter and broader than usual his eyes beamed his mouth was radiant  well you wont believe it dr cumberledge he began but  yes i do believe it i answered i know it i have read it already  read it he cried where  i waved my hand towards his face in a special edition of the evening papers i answered smiling daphne has accepted you  he sank into an easy chair beside himself with rapture yes yes that angel thanks to you she has accepted me  thanks to miss wade i said correcting him it is really all her doing if she had not seen through the photograph to the face and through the face to the woman and the base little heart of her we might never have found her out  he turned to hilda with eyes all gratitude you have given me the dearest and best girl on earth he cried seizing both her hands  and i have given daphne a husband who will love and appreciate her hilda answered flushing  you see i said maliciously i told you they never find us out holsworthy  as for reggie nettlecraft and his wife i should like to add that they are getting on quite as well as could be expected reggie has joined his sissie on the musichall stage and all those who have witnessed his immensely popular performance of the drunken gentleman before the bow street police court acknowledge without reserve that after failing for everything he has dropped at last into his true vocation his impersonation of the part is said to be nature itself i see no reason to doubt it    chapter iii  the episode of the wife who did her duty   to make you understand my next yarn i must go back to the date of my introduction to hilda  it is witchcraft i said the first time i saw her at le geyts luncheonparty  she smiled a smile which was bewitching indeed but by no means witchlikea frank open smile with just a touch of natural feminine triumph in it no not witchcraft she answered helping herself with her dainty fingers to a burnt almond from the venetian glass dishnot witchcraftmemory aided perhaps by some native quickness of perception though i say it myself i never met anyone i think whose memory goes quite as far as mine does  you dont mean quite as far back i cried jesting for she looked about twentyfour and had cheeks like a ripe nectarine just as pink and just as softly downy  she smiled again showing a row of semitransparent teeth with a gleam in the depths of them she was certainly most attractive she had that indefinable incommunicable unanalysable personal quality which we know as charm no not as far back she repeated though indeed i often seem to remember things that happened before i was born like queen elizabeths visit to kenilworth i recollect so vividly all that i have heard or read about them but as far in extent i mean i never let anything drop out of my memory as this case shows you i can recall even quite unimportant and casual bits of knowledge when any chance clue happens to bring them back to me  she had certainly astonished me the occasion for my astonishment was the fact that when i handed her my card dr hubert ford cumberledge st nathaniels hospital she had glanced at it for a second and exclaimed without sensible pause or break oh then of course youre half welsh as i am  the instantaneous and apparent inconsecutiveness of her inference took me aback well myes i am half welsh i replied my mother came from carnarvonshire but why then and of course i fail to perceive your train of reasoning  she laughed a sunny little laugh like one well accustomed to receive such inquiries fancy asking a woman to give you the train of reasoning for her intuitions she cried merrily that shows dr cumberledge that you are a mere mana man of science perhaps but not a psychologist it also suggests that you are a confirmed bachelor a married man accepts intuitions without expecting them to be based on reasoning well just this once i will stretch a point to enlighten you if i recollect right your mother died about three years ago  you are quite correct then you knew my mother  oh dear me no i never even met her why then  her look was mischievous but unless i mistake i think she came from hendre coed near bangor  wales is a village i exclaimed catching my breath every welsh person seems to know all about every other  my new acquaintance smiled again when she smiled she was irresistible a laughing face protruding from a cloud of diaphanous drapery now shall i tell you how i came to know that she asked poising a glace cherry on her dessert fork in front of her shall i explain my trick like the conjurers  conjurers never explain anything i answered they say so you see thats how its donewith a swift whisk of the handand leave you as much in the dark as ever dont explain like the conjurers but tell me how you guessed it  she shut her eyes and seemed to turn her glance inward  about three years ago she began slowly like one who reconstructs with an effort a halfforgotten scene i saw a notice in the timesbirths deaths and marriageson the 27th of octoberwas it the 27th the keen brown eyes opened again for a second and flashed inquiry into mine  quite right i answered nodding  i thought so on the 27th of october at brynmor bournemouth emily olwen josephine widow of the late thomas cumberledge sometime colonel of the 7th bengal regiment of foot and daughter of iolo gwyn ford esq jp of hendre coed near bangor am i correct she lifted her dark eyelashes once more and flooded me  you are quite correct i answered surprised and that is really all that you knew of my mother  absolutely all the moment i saw your card i thought to myself in a breath ford cumberledge what do i know of those two names i have some link between them ah yes found mrs cumberledge wife of colonel thomas cumberledge of the 7th bengals was a miss ford daughter of a mr ford of bangor that came to me like a lightninggleam then i said to myself again dr hubert ford cumberledge must be their son so there you have the train of reasoning women can reasonsometimes i had to think twice though before i could recall the exact words of the times notice  and can you do the same with everyone  everyone oh come now that is expecting too much i have not read marked learned and inwardly digested everyones family announcements i dont pretend to be the peerage the clergy list and the london directory rolled into one i remembered your family all the more vividly no doubt because of the pretty and unusual old welsh names olwen and iolo gwyn ford which fixed themselves on my memory by their mere beauty everything about wales always attracts me my welsh side is uppermost but i have hundredsoh thousandsof such facts stored and pigeonholed in my memory if anybody else cares to try me she glanced round the table perhaps we may be able to test my power that way  two or three of the company accepted her challenge giving the full names of their sisters or brothers and in three cases out of five my witch was able to supply either the notice of their marriage or some other like published circumstance in the instance of charlie vere it is true she went wrong just at first though only in a single small particular it was not charlie himself who was gazetted to a sublieutenancy in the warwickshire regiment but his brother walter however the moment she was told of this slip she corrected herself at once and added like lightning ah yes how stupid of me i have mixed up the names charles cassilis vere got an appointment on the same day in the rhodesian mounted police didnt he which was in point of fact quite accurate  but i am forgetting that all this time i have not even now introduced my witch to you  hilda wade when i first saw her was one of the prettiest cheeriest and most graceful girls i have ever meta dusky blonde browneyed brownhaired with a creamy waxen whiteness of skin that was yet warm and peachdowny and i wish to insist from the outset upon the plain fact that there was nothing uncanny about her in spite of her singular faculty of insight which sometimes seemed to illogical people almost weird or eerie she was in the main a bright welleducated sensible winsome lawntennisplaying english girl her vivacious spirits rose superior to her surroundings which were often sad enough but she was above all things wholesome unaffected and sparklinga gleam of sunshine she laid no claim to supernatural powers she held no dealings with familiar spirits she was simply a girl of strong personal charm endowed with an astounding memory and a rare measure of feminine intuition her memory she told me she shared with her father and all her fathers family they were famous for their prodigious faculty in that respect her impulsive temperament and quick instincts on the other hand descended to her she thought from her mother and her welsh ancestry  externally she seemed thus at first sight little more than the ordinary pretty lighthearted english girl with a taste for field sports especially riding and a native love of the country but at times one caught in the brightened colour of her lustrous brown eyes certain curious undercurrents of depth of reserve and of a questioning wistfulness which made you suspect the presence of profounder elements in her nature from the earliest moment of our acquaintance indeed i can say with truth that hilda wade interested me immensely i felt drawn her face had that strange quality of compelling attention for which we have as yet no english name but which everybody recognises you could not ignore her she stood out she was the sort of girl one was constrained to notice  it was le geyts first luncheonparty since his second marriage bigbearded genial he beamed round on us jubilant he was proud of his wife and proud of his recent qcship the new mrs le geyt sat at the head of the table handsome capable selfpossessed a vivid vigorous woman and a model hostess though still quite young she was large and commanding everybody was impressed by her such a good mother to those poor motherless children all the ladies declared in a chorus of applause and indeed she had the face of a splendid manager  i said as much in an undertone over the ices to miss wade who sat beside methough i ought not to have discussed them at their own table hugo le geyt seems to have made an excellent choice i murmured maisie and ettie will be lucky indeed to be taken care of by such a competent stepmother dont you think so  my witch glanced up at her hostess with a piercing dart of the keen brown eyes held her wineglass half raised and then electrified me by uttering in the same low voice audible to me alone but quite clearly and unhesitatingly these astounding words  i think before twelve mouths are out mr le geyt will have murdered her  for a minute i could not answer so startling was the effect of this confident prediction one does not expect to be told such things at lunch over the port and peaches about ones dearest friends beside their own mahogany and the assured air of unfaltering conviction with which hilda wade said it to a complete stranger took my breath away why did she think so at all and if she thought so why choose me as the recipient of her singular confidences  i gasped and wondered  what makes you fancy anything so unlikely i asked aside at last behind the babel of voices you quite alarm me  she rolled a mouthful of apricot ice reflectively on her tongue and then murmured in a similar aside dont ask me now some other time will do but i mean what i say believe me i do not speak at random  she was quite right of course to continue would have been equally rude and foolish i had perforce to bottle up my curiosity for the moment and wait till my sibyl was in the mood for interpreting  after lunch we adjourned to the drawingroom almost at once hilda wade flitted up with her brisk step to the corner where i was sitting oh dr cumberledge she began as if nothing odd had occurred before i was so glad to meet you and have a chance of talking to you because i do so want to get a nurses place at st nathaniels  a nurses place i exclaimed a little surprised surveying her dress of palest and softest indian muslin for she looked to me far too much of a butterfly for such serious work do you really mean it or are you one of the ten thousand modern young ladies who are in quest of a mission without understanding that missions are unpleasant nursing i can tell you is not all crimped cap and becoming uniform  i know that she answered growing grave i ought to know it i am a nurse already at st georges hospital  you are a nurse and at st georges yet you want to change to nathaniels why st georges is in a much nicer part of london and the patients there come on an average from a much better class than ours in smithfield  i know that too but sebastian is at st nathanielsand i want to be near sebastian  professor sebastian i cried my face lighting up with a gleam of enthusiasm at our great teachers name ah if it is to be under sebastian that you desire i can see you mean business i know now you are in earnest  in earnest she echoed that strange deeper shade coming over her face as she spoke while her tone altered yes i think i am in earnest it is my object in life to be near sebastianto watch him and observe him i mean to succeed but i have given you my confidence perhaps too hastily and i must implore you not to mention my wish to him  you may trust me implicitly i answered  oh yes i saw that she put in with a quick gesture of course i saw by your face you were a man of honoura man one could trust or i would not have spoken to you butyou promise me  i promise you i replied naturally flattered she was delicately pretty and her quaint oracular air so incongruous with the dainty face and the fluffy brown hair piqued me not a little that special mysterious commodity of charm seemed to pervade all she did and said so i added and i will mention to sebastian that you wish for a nurses place at nathaniels as you have had experience and can be recommended i suppose by le geyts sister with whom she had come no doubt you can secure an early vacancy  thanks so much she answered with that delicious smile it had an infantile simplicity about it which contrasted most piquantly with her prophetic manner  only i went on assuming a confidential tone you really must tell me why you said that just now about hugo le geyt recollect your delphian utterances have gravely astonished and disquieted me hugo is one of my oldest and dearest friends and i want to know why you have formed this sudden bad opinion of him  not of him but of her she answered to my surprise taking a small norwegian dagger from the whatnot and playing with it to distract attention  come come now i cried drawing back you are trying to mystify me this is deliberate seermongery you are presuming on your powers but i am not the sort of man to be caught by horoscopes i decline to believe it  she turned on me with a meaning glance those truthful eyes fixed me i am going from here straight to my hospital she murmured with a quiet air of knowledgetalking i mean to say like one who really knows this room is not the place to discuss this matter is it if you will walk back to st georges with me i think i can make you see and feel that i am speaking not at haphazard but from observation and experience  her confidence roused my most vivid curiosity when she left i left with her the le geyts lived in one of those new streets of large houses on campden hill so that our way eastward lay naturally through kensington gardens  it was a sunny june day when light pierced even through the smoke of london and the shrubberies breathed the breath of white lilacs now what did you mean by that enigmatical saying i asked my new cassandra as we strolled down the scentladen path womans intuition is all very well in its way but a mere man may be excused if he asks for evidence  she stopped short as i spoke and gazed full into my eyes her hand fingered her parasol handle i meant what i said she answered with emphasis within one year mr le geyt will have murdered his wife you may take my word for it  le geyt i cried never i know the man so well a big goodnatured kindly schoolboy he is the gentlest and best of mortals le geyt a murderer impossible  her eyes were far away has it never occurred to you she asked slowly with her pythoness air that there are murders and murdersmurders which depend in the main upon the murderer and also murders which depend in the main upon the victim  the victim what do you mean  well there are brutal men who commit murder out of sheer brutalitythe ruffians of the slums and there are sordid men who commit murder for sordid moneythe insurers who want to forestall their policies the poisoners who want to inherit property but have you ever realised that there are also murderers who become so by accident through their victims idiosyncrasy i thought all the time while i was watching mrs le geyt that woman is of the sort predestined to be murdered and when you asked me i told you so i may have been imprudent still i saw it and i said it  but this is second sight i cried drawing away do you pretend to prevision  no not second sight nothing uncanny nothing supernatural but prevision yes prevision based not on omens or auguries but on solid facton what i have seen and noticed  explain yourself oh prophetess  she let the point of her parasol make a curved trail on the gravel and followed its serpentine wavings with her eyes you know our house surgeon she asked at last looking up of a sudden  what travers oh intimately  then come to my ward and see after you have seen you will perhaps believe me  nothing that i could say would get any further explanation out of her just then you would laugh at me if i told you she persisted you wont laugh when you have seen it  we walked on in silence as far as hyde park corner there my sphinx tripped lightly up the steps of st georges hospital get mr traverss leave she said with a nod and a bright smile to visit nurse wades ward then come up to me there in five minutes  i explained to my friend the house surgeon that i wished to see certain cases in the accident ward of which i had heard he smiled a restrained smilenurse wade no doubt but of course gave me permission to go up and look at them stop a minute he added and ill come with you when we got there my witch had already changed her dress and was waiting for us demurely in the neat dovecoloured gown and smooth white apron of the hospital nurses she looked even prettier and more meaningful so than in her ethereal outside summercloud muslin  come over to this bed she said at once to travers and myself without the least air of mystery i will show you what i mean by it  nurse wade has remarkable insight travers whispered to me as we went  i can believe it i answered  look at this woman she went on aside in a low voiceno not the first bed the one beyond it number 60 i dont want the patient to know you are watching her do you observe anything odd about her appearance  she is somewhat the same type i began as mrs  before i could get out the words le geyt her warning eye and puckering forehead had stopped me as the lady we were discussing she interposed with a quiet wave of one hand yes in some points very much so you notice in particular her scanty hairso thin and poorthough she is young and goodlooking  it is certainly rather a feeble crop for a woman of her age i admitted and pale at that and washy  precisely its done up behind about as big as a nutmeg now observe the contour of her back as she sits up there it is curiously curved isnt it  very i replied not exactly a stoop nor yet quite a hunch but certainly an odd spinal configuration  like our friends once more  like our friends exactly  hilda wade looked away lest she should attract the patients attention well that woman was brought in here halfdead assaulted by her husband she went on with a note of unobtrusive demonstration  we get a great many such cases travers put in with true medical unconcern very interesting cases and nurse wade has pointed out to me the singular fact that in almost all instances the patients resemble one another physically  incredible i cried i can understand that there might well be a type of men who assault their wives but not surely a type of women who get assaulted  that is because you know less about it than nurse wade travers answered with an annoying smile of superior knowledge  our instructress moved on to another bed laying one gentle hand as she passed on a patients forehead the patient glanced gratitude that one again she said once more half indicating a cot at a little distance number 74 she has much the same thin hairsparse weak and colourless she has much the same curved back and much the same aggressive selfassertive features looks capable doesnt she a born housewife well she too was knocked down and kicked halfdead the other night by her husband  it is certainly odd i answered how very much they both recall  our friend at lunch yes extraordinary see here she pulled out a pencil and drew the quick outline of a face in her notebook that is what is central and essential to the type they have this sort of profile women with faces like that always get assaulted  travers glanced over her shoulder quite true he assented with his bourgeois nod nurse wade in her time has shown me dozens of them round dozens bakers dozens they all belong to that species in fact when a woman of this type is brought in to us wounded now i ask at once husband and the invariable answer comes pat well yes sir we had some words together the effect of words my dear fellow is something truly surprising  they can pierce like a dagger i mused  and leave an open wound behind that requires dressing travers added unsuspecting practical man travers  but why do they get assaultedthe women of this type i asked still bewildered  number 87 has her mother just come to see her my sorceress interposed shes an assault case brought in last night badly kicked and bruised about the head and shoulders speak to the mother shell explain it all to you  travers and i moved over to the cot her hand scarcely indicated well your daughter looks pretty comfortable this afternoon in spite of the little fuss travers began tentatively  yus shes a bit tidy thanky the mother answered smoothing her soiled black gown grown green with long service shell git on naow please gord but joe most did for er  how did it all happen travers asked in a jaunty tone to draw her out  well it was like this sir yer see my daughter shes a lidy as keeps erself to erself as the sayin is an olds er ead up she keeps up a proper pride an minds er ouse an er little uns she aint no gadabaht but she ave a tongue she ave the mother lowered her voice cautiously lest the lidy should hear i dont deny it that she ave a tongue at times through myself avin suffered from it and when she do go on lord bless you why there aint no stoppin of er  oh she has a tongue has she travers replied surveying the case critically well you know she looks like it  so she do sir so she do an joe es a man as wouldnt urt a bibynot when es sober joe wouldnt but ed bin aht thats where it is an e cum ome lite a bit fresh through avin bin at the friendly lead an my daughter yer see she up an give it to im my word she did give it to im an joe es a peaceable man when e aint a bit fresh es more like a friend to er than an usband joe is but e lost is temper that time as yer may say by reason o bein fresh an e knocked er abaht a little an knocked er teeth aht so we brought er to the orspital  the injured woman raised herself up in bed with a vindictive scowl displaying as she did so the same whalelike curved back as in the other cases but weve sent im to the lockup she continued the scowl giving way fast to a radiant joy of victory as she contemplated her triumph an wots more i ad the last word of im an ell git six month for this the neighbours says an when he comes aht again my gord wont e ketch it  you look capable of punishing him for it i answered and as i spoke i shuddered for i saw her expression was precisely the expression mrs le geyts face had worn for a passing second when her husband accidentally trod on her dress as we left the diningroom  my witch moved away we followed well what do you say to it now she asked gliding among the beds with noiseless feet and ministering fingers  say to it i answered that it is wonderful wonderful you have quite convinced me  you would think so travers put in if you had been in this ward as often as i have and observed their faces its a dead certainty sooner or later that type of woman is cocksure to be assaulted  in a certain rank of life perhaps i answered still loth to believe it but not surely in ours gentlemen do not knock down their wives and kick their teeth out  my sibyl smiled no there class tells she admitted they take longer about it and suffer more provocation they curb their tempers but in the end one day they are goaded beyond endurance and thena convenient knifea rusty old sworda pair of scissorsanything that comes handy like that dagger this morning one wild blowhalf unpremeditatedand the thing is done twelve good men and true will find it wilful murder  i felt really perturbed but can we do nothing i cried to warn poor hugo  nothing i fear she answered after all character must work itself out in its interactions with character he has married that woman and he must take the consequences does not each of us in life suffer perforce the nemesis of his own temperament  then is there not also a type of men who assault their wives  that is the odd part of itno all kinds good and bad quick and slow can be driven to it at last the quicktempered stab or kick the slow devise some deliberate means of ridding themselves of their burden  but surely we might caution le geyt of his danger  it is useless he would not believe us we cannot be at his elbow to hold back his hand when the bad moment comes nobody will be there as a matter of fact for women of this temperamentborn naggers in short since thats what it comes towhen they are also ladies graceful and gracious as she is never nag at all before outsiders to the world they are bland everybody says what charming talkers they are angels abroad devils at home as the proverb puts it some night she will provoke him when they are alone till she has reached his utmost limit of enduranceand then she drew one hand across her dovelike throat it will be all finished  you think so  i am sure of it we human beings go straight like sheep to our natural destiny  butthat is fatalism  no not fatalism insight into temperament fatalists believe that your life is arranged for you beforehand from without willynilly you must act so i only believe that in this jostling world your life is mostly determined by your own character in its interaction with the characters of those who surround you temperament works itself out it is your own acts and deeds that make up fate for you    for some months after this meeting neither hilda wade nor i saw anything more of the le geyts they left town for scotland at the end of the season and when all the grouse had been duly slaughtered and all the salmon duly hooked they went on to leicestershire for the opening of foxhunting so it was not till after christmas that they returned to campden hill meanwhile i had spoken to dr sebastian about miss wade and on my recommendation he had found her a vacancy at our hospital a most intelligent girl cumberledge he remarked to me with a rare burst of approvalfor the professor was always criticalafter she had been at work for some weeks at st nathaniels i am glad you introduced her here a nurse with brains is such a valuable accessoryunless of course she takes to thinking but nurse wade never thinks she is a useful instrumentdoes what shes told and carries out ones orders implicitly  she knows enough to know when she doesnt know i answered which is really the rarest kind of knowledge  unrecorded among young doctors the professor retorted with his sardonic smile they think they understand the human body from top to toe when in realitywell they might do the measles  early in january i was invited again to lunch with the le geyts hilda wade was invited too the moment we entered the house we were both of us aware that some grim change had come over it le geyt met us in the hall in his old genial style it is true but still with a certain reserve a curious veiled timidity which we had not known in him big and goodhumoured as he was with kindly eyes beneath the shaggy eyebrows he seemed strangely subdued now the boyish buoyancy had gone out of him he spoke rather lower than was his natural key and welcomed us warmly though less effusively than of old an irreproachable housemaid in a spotless cap ushered us into the transfigured drawingroom mrs le geyt in a pretty cloth dress neatly tailormade rose to meet us beaming the vapid smile of the perfect hostessthat impartial smile which falls like the rain from heaven on good and bad indifferently so charmed to see you again dr cumberledge she bubbled out with a cheerful airshe was always cheerful mechanically cheerful from a sense of duty it is such a pleasure to meet dear hugos old friends and miss wade too how delightful you look so well miss wade oh youre both at st nathaniels now arent you so you can come together what a privilege for you dr cumberledge to have such a clever assistantor rather fellowworker it must be a great life yours miss wade such a sphere of usefulness if we can only feel we are doing goodthat is the main matter for my own part i like to be mixed up with every good work thats going on in my neighbourhood im the soupkitchen you know and im visitor at the workhouse and im the dorcas society and the mutual improvement class and the prevention of cruelty to animals and to children and im sure i dont know how much else so that what with all that and what with dear hugo and the darling childrenshe glanced affectionately at maisie and ettie who sat bolt upright very mute and still in their best and stiffest frocks on two stools in the corneri can hardly find time for my social duties  oh dear mrs le geyt one of her visitors said with effusion from beneath a nodding bonnetshe was the wife of a rural dean from staffordshireeverybody is agreed that your social duties are performed to a marvel they are the envy of kensington we all of us wonder indeed how one woman can find time for all of it  our hostess looked pleased well yes she answered gazing down at her fawncoloured dress with a halfsuppressed smile of selfsatisfaction i flatter myself i can get through about as much work in a day as anybody her eye wandered round her rooms with a modest air of placid selfapproval which was almost comic everything in them was as wellkept and as wellpolished as good servants thoroughly drilled could make it not a stain or a speck anywhere a miracle of neatness indeed when i carelessly drew the norwegian dagger from its scabbard as we waited for lunch and found that it stuck in the sheath i almost started to discover that rust could intrude into that orderly household  i recollected then how hilda wade had pointed out to me during those six months at st nathaniels that the women whose husbands assaulted them were almost always notable housewives as they say in americagood souls who prided themselves not a little on their skill in management they were capable practical mothers of families with a boundless belief in themselves a sincere desire to do their duty as far as they understood it and a habit of impressing their virtues upon others which was quite beyond all human endurance placidity was their note provoking placidity i felt sure it must have been of a woman of this type that the famous phrase was coinedelle a toutes les vertuset elle est insupportable  clara dear the husband said shall we go in to lunch  you dear stupid boy are we not all waiting for you to give your arm to lady maitland  the lunch was perfect and it was perfectly served the silver glowed the linen was marked with h c le g in a most artistic monogram i noticed that the table decorations were extremely pretty somebody complimented our hostess upon them mrs le geyt nodded and smiledi arranged them dear hugo in his blundering waythe big darlingforgot to get me the orchids i had ordered so i had to make shift with what few things our own wee conservatory afforded still with a little taste and a little ingenuity she surveyed her handiwork with just pride and left the rest to our imaginations  only you ought to explain clara le geyt began in a deprecatory tone  now you darling old bear we wont harp on that twicetold tale again clara interrupted with a knowing smile point da rechauffes let us leave one anothers misdeeds and one anothers explanations for their proper spherethe family circle the orchids did not turn up that is the point and i managed to make shift with the plumbago and the geraniums maisie my sweet not that pudding if you please too rich for you darling i know your digestive capacities better than you do i have told you fifty times it doesnt agree with you a small slice of the other one  yes mamma maisie answered with a cowed and cowering air i felt sure she would have murmured yes mamma in the selfsame tone if the second mrs le geyt had ordered her to hang herself  i saw you out in the park yesterday on your bicycle ettie le geyts sister mrs mallet put in but do you know dear i didnt think your jacket was half warm enough  mamma doesnt like me to wear a warmer one the child answered with a visible shudder of recollection though i should love to aunt lina  my precious ettie what nonsensefor a violent exercise like bicycling where one gets so hot so unbecomingly hot youd be simply stifled darling i caught a darted glance which accompanied the words and which made ettie recoil into the recesses of her pudding  but yesterday was so cold clara mrs mallet went on actually venturing to oppose the infallible authority a nipping morning and such a flimsy coat might not the dear child be allowed to judge for herself in a matter purely of her own feelings  mrs le geyt with just the shadow of a shrug was all sweet reasonableness she smiled more suavely than ever surely lina she remonstrated in her frankest and most convincing tone i must know best what is good for dear ettie when i have been watching her daily for more than six months past and taking the greatest pains to understand both her constitution and her disposition she needs hardening ettie does hardening dont you agree with me hugo  le geyt shuffled uneasily in his chair big man as he was with his great black beard and manly bearing i could see he was afraid to differ from her overtly wellmperhaps clara he began peering from under the shaggy eyebrows it would be best for a delicate child like ettie  mrs le geyt smiled a compassionate smile ah i forgot she cooed sweetly dear hugo never can understand the upbringing of children it is a sense denied him we women knowwith a sage nod they were wild little savages when i took them in hand firstwerent you maisie do you remember dear how you broke the lookingglass in the boudoir like an untamed young monkey talking of monkeys mr cotswould have you seen those delightful clever amusing french pictures at that place in suffolk street theres a man therea parisiani forget his honoured nameleblanc or lenoir or lebrun or somethingbut hes a most humorous artist and he paints monkeys and storks and all sorts of queer beasties almost as quaintly and expressively as you do mind i say almost for i never will allow that any frenchman could do anything quite so good quite so funnily mockhuman as your marabouts and professors  what a charming hostess mrs le geyt makes the painter observed to me after lunch such tact such discrimination and what a devoted stepmother  she is one of the local secretaries of the society for the prevention of cruelty to children i said drily  and charity begins at home hilda wade added in a significant aside  we walked home together as far as stanhope gate our sense of doom oppressed us and yet i said turning to her as we left the doorstep i dont doubt mrs le geyt really believes she is a model stepmother  of course she believes it my witch answered she has no more doubt about that than about anything else doubts are not in her line she does everything exactly as it ought to be donewho should know if not sheand therefore she is never afraid of criticism hardening indeed that poor slender tender shrinking little ettie a frail exotic she would harden her into a skeleton if she had her way nothings much harder than a skeleton i suppose except mrs le geyts manner of training one  i should be sorry to think i broke in that that sweet little floating thistledown of a child i once knew was to be done to death by her  oh as for that she will not be done to death hilda answered in her confident way mrs le geyt wont live long enough  i started you think not  i dont think i am sure of it we are at the fifth act now i watched mr le geyt closely all through lunch and im more confident than ever that the end is coming he is temporarily crushed but he is like steam in a boiler seething seething seething one day she will sit on the safetyvalve and the explosion will come when it comesshe raised aloft one quick hand in the air as if striking a dagger homegoodbye to her  for the next few months i saw much of le geyt and the more i saw of him the more i saw that my witchs prognosis was essentially correct they never quarrelled but mrs le geyt in her unobtrusive way held a quiet hand over her husband which became increasingly apparent in the midst of her fancywork those busy fingers were never idle she kept her eyes well fixed on him now and again i saw him glance at his motherless girls with what looked like a tender protecting regret especially when clara had been most openly drilling them but he dared not interfere she was crushing their spirit as she was crushing their fathersand all bear in mind for the best of motives she had their interest at heart she wanted to do what was right for them her manner to him and to them was always honeysweetin all externals yet one could somehow feel it was the velvet glove that masked the iron hand not cruel not harsh even but severely irresistibly unflinchingly crushing ettie my dear get your brown hat at once whats that going to rain i did not ask you my child for your opinion on the weather my own suffices a headache oh nonsense headaches are caused by want of exercise nothing so good for a touch of headache as a nice brisk walk in kensington gardens maisie dont hold your sisters hand like that it is imitation sympathy you are aiding and abetting her in setting my wishes at naught now no long faces what i require is cheerful obedience  a bland autocratic martinet smiling inexorable poor pale ettie grew thinner and wanner under her law daily while maisies temper naturally docile was being spoiled before ones eyes by persistent needless thwarting  as spring came on however i began to hope that things were really mending le geyt looked brighter some of his own careless happygolucky self came back again at intervals he told me once with a wistful sigh that he thought of sending the children to school in the countryit would be better for them he said and would take a little work off dear claras shoulders for never even to me was he disloyal to clara i encouraged him in the idea he went on to say that the great difficulty in the way was clara she was so conscientious she thought it her duty to look after the children herself and couldnt bear to delegate any part of that duty to others besides she had such an excellent opinion of the kensington high school  when i told hilda wade of this she set her teeth together and answered at once that settles it the end is very near he will insist upon their going to save them from that womans ruthless kindness and she will refuse to give up any part of what she calls her duty he will reason with her he will plead for his children she will be adamant not angryit is never the way of that temperament to get angryjust calmly sedately and insupportably provoking when she goes too far he will flare up at last some taunt will rouse him the explosion will come and the children will go to their aunt lina whom they dote upon when all is said and done it is the poor man i pity  you said within twelve months  that was a bow drawn at a venture it may be a little sooner it may be a little later butnext week or next monthit is coming it is coming    june smiled upon us once more and on the afternoon of the 13th the anniversary of our first lunch together at the le geyts i was up at my work in the accident ward at st nathaniels well the ides of june have come sister wade i said when i met her parodying caesar  but not yet gone she answered and a profound sense of foreboding spread over her speaking face as she uttered the words  her oracle disquieted me why i dined there last night i cried and all seemed exceptionally well  the calm before the storm perhaps she murmured  just at that moment i heard a boy crying in the street pall mall gazette ere yare speshul edishun shocking tragedy at the westend orful murder ere yare spechul globe pall mall extry speshul  a weird tremor broke over me i walked down into the street and bought a paper there it stared me in the face on the middle page tragedy at campden hill wellknown barrister murders his wife sensational details  i looked closer and read it was as i feared the le geyts after i left their house the night before husband and wife must have quarrelled no doubt over the question of the childrens schooling and at some provoking word as it seemed hugo must have snatched up a knifea little ornamental norwegian dagger the report said which happened to lie close by on the cabinet in the drawingroom and plunged it into his wifes heart the unhappy lady died instantaneously by all appearances and the dastardly crime was not discovered by the servants till eight oclock this morning mr le geyt is missing  i rushed up with the news to nurse wade who was at work in the accident ward she turned pale but bent over her patient and said nothing  it is fearful to think i groaned out at last for us who know allthat poor le geyt will be hanged for it hanged for attempting to protect his children  he will not be hanged my witch answered with the same unquestioning confidence as ever  why not i asked astonished once more at this bold prediction  she went on bandaging the arm of the patient whom she was attending because he will commit suicide she replied without moving a muscle  how do you know that  she stuck a steel safetypin with deft fingers into the roll of lint when i have finished my days work she answered slowly still continuing the bandage i may perhaps find time to tell you    chapter iv  the episode of the man who would not commit suicide   after my poor friend le geyt had murdered his wife in a sudden access of uncontrollable anger under the deepest provocation the police naturally began to inquire for him it is a way they have the police are no respecters of persons neither do they pry into the question of motives they are but poor casuists a murder is for them a murder and a murderer a murderer it is not their habit to divide and distinguish between case and case with hilda wades analytical accuracy  as soon as my duties at st nathaniels permitted me on the evening of the discovery i rushed round to mrs mallets le geyts sister i had been detained at the hospital for some hours however watching a critical case and by the time i reached great stanhope street i found hilda wade in her nurses dress there before me sebastian it seemed had given her leave out for the evening she was a supernumerary nurse attached to his own observationcots as special attendant for scientific purposes and she could generally get an hour or so whenever she required it  mrs mallet had been in the breakfastroom with hilda before i arrived but as i reached the house she rushed upstairs to wash her red eyes and compose herself a little before the strain of meeting me so i had the opportunity for a few words alone first with my prophetic companion  you said just now at nathaniels i burst out that le geyt would not be hanged he would commit suicide what did you mean by that what reason had you for thinking so  hilda sank into a chair by the open window pulled a flower abstractedly from the vase at her side and began picking it to pieces floret after floret with twitching fingers she was deeply moved well consider his family history she burst out at last looking up at me with her large brown eyes as she reached the last petal heredity counts and after such a disaster  she said disaster not crime i noted mentally the reservation implied in the word  heredity counts i answered oh yes it counts much but what about le geyts family history i could not recall any instance of suicide among his forbears  wellhis mothers father was general faskally you know she replied after a pause in her strange oblique manner mr le geyt is general faskallys eldest grandson  exactly i broke in with a mans desire for solid fact in place of vague intuition but i fail to see quite what that has to do with it  the general was killed in india during the mutiny  i remember of coursekilled bravely fighting  yes but it was on a forlorn hope for which he volunteered and in the course of which he is said to have walked straight into an almost obvious ambuscade of the enemys  now my dear miss wadei always dropped the title of nurse by request when once we were well clear of nathanielsi have every confidence you are aware in your memory and your insight but i do confess i fail to see what bearing this incident can have on poor hugos chances of being hanged or committing suicide  she picked a second flower and once more pulled out petal after petal as she reached the last again she answered slowly you must have forgotten the circumstances it was no mere accident general faskally had made a serious strategical blunder at jhansi he had sacrificed the lives of his subordinates needlessly he could not bear to face the survivors in the course of the retreat he volunteered to go on this forlorn hope which might equally well have been led by an officer of lower rank and he was permitted to do so by sir colin in command as a means of retrieving his lost military character he carried his point but he carried it recklessly taking care to be shot through the heart himself in the first onslaught that was virtual suicidehonourable suicide to avoid disgrace at a moment of supreme remorse and horror  you are right i admitted after a minutes consideration i see it nowthough i should never have thought of it  that is the use of being a woman she answered  i waited a second once more and mused still that is only one doubtful case i objected  there was another you must remember his uncle alfred  alfred le geyt  no he died in his bed quietly alfred faskally  what a memory you have i cried astonished why that was before our timein the days of the chartist riots  she smiled a certain curious sibylline smile of hers her earnest face looked prettier than ever i told you i could remember many things that happened before i was born she answered this is one of them  you remember it directly  how impossible have i not often explained to you that i am no diviner i read no book of fate i call no spirits from the vasty deep i simply remember with exceptional clearness what i read and hear and i have many times heard the story about alfred faskally  so have ibut i forget it  unfortunately i cant forget that is a sort of disease with me he was a special constable in the chartist riots and being a very strong and powerful man like his nephew hugo he used his truncheonhis special constables baton or whatever you call itwith excessive force upon a starveling london tailor in the mob near charing cross the man was hit on the foreheadbadly hit so that he died almost immediately of concussion of the brain a woman rushed out of the crowd at once seized the dying man laid his head on her lap and shrieked out in a wildly despairing voice that he was her husband and the father of thirteen children alfred faskally who never meant to kill the man or even to hurt him but who was laying about him roundly without realising the terrific force of his blows was so horrified at what he had done when he heard the womans cry that he rushed off straight to waterloo bridge in an agony of remorse andflung himself over he was drowned instantly  i recall the story now i answered but do you know as it was told me i think they said the mob threw faskally over in their desire for vengeance  that is the official account as told by the le geyts and the faskallys they like to have it believed their kinsman was murdered not that he committed suicide but my grandfatheri started during the twelve months that i had been brought into daily relations with hilda wade that was the first time i had heard her mention any member of her own family except once her mothermy grandfather who knew him well and who was present in the crowd at the time assured me many times that alfred faskally really jumped over of his own accord not pursued by the mob and that his last horrified words as he leaped were i never meant it i never meant it however the family have always had luck in their suicides the jury believed the throwingover story and found a verdict of wilful murder against some person or persons unknown  luck in their suicides what a curious phrase and you say always were there other cases then  constructively yes one of the le geyts you must recollect went down with his ship just like his uncle the general in india when he might have quitted her it is believed he had given a mistaken order you remember of course he was navigating lieutenant another marcus was said to have shot himself by accident while cleaning his gunafter a quarrel with his wife but you have heard all about it the wrong was on my side he moaned you know when they picked him up dying in the gunroom and one of the faskally girls his cousin of whom his wife was jealousthat beautiful lindabecame a catholic and went into a convent at once on marcuss death which after all in such cases is merely a religious and moral way of committing suicidei mean for a woman who takes the veil just to cut herself off from the world and who has no vocation as i hear she had not  she filled me with amazement that is true i exclaimed when one comes to think of it it shows the same temperament in fibre but i should never have thought of it  no well i believe it is true for all that in every case one sees they choose much the same way of meeting a reverse a blunder an unpremeditated crime the brave way is to go through with it and face the music letting what will come the cowardly way is to hide ones head incontinently in a river a noose or a convent cell  le geyt is not a coward i interposed with warmth  no not a cowarda manly spirited greathearted gentlemanbut still not quite of the bravest type he lacks one element the le geyts have physical courageenough and to sparebut their moral courage fails them at a pinch they rush into suicide or its equivalent at critical moments out of pure boyish impulsiveness  a few minutes later mrs mallet came in she was not broken downon the contrary she was calmstoically tragically pitiably calm with that ghastly calmness which is more terrible by far than the most demonstrative grief her face though deadly white did not move a muscle not a tear was in her eyes even her bloodless hands hardly twitched at the folds of her hastily assumed black gown she clenched them after a minute when she had grasped mine silently i could see that the nails dug deep into the palms in her painful resolve to keep herself from collapsing  hilda wade with infinite sisterly tenderness led her over to a chair by the window in the summer twilight and took one quivering hand in hers i have been telling dr cumberledge lina about what i most fear for your dear brother darling and i think he agrees with me  mrs mallet turned to me with hollow eyes still preserving her tragic calm i am afraid of it too she said her drawn lips tremulous dr cumberledge we must get him back we must induce him to face it  and yet i answered slowly turning it over in my own mind he has run away at first why should he do that if he meansto commit suicide i hated to utter the words before that broken soul but there was no way out of it  hilda interrupted me with a quiet suggestion how do you know he has run away she asked are you not taking it for granted that if he meant suicide he would blow his brains out in his own house but surely that would not be the le geyt way they are gentlenatured folk they would never blow their brains out or cut their throats for all we know he may have made straight for waterloo bridgeshe framed her lips to the unspoken words unseen by mrs malletlike his uncle alfred  that is true i answered lipreading i never thought of that either  still i do not attach importance to this idea she went on i have some reason for thinking he has run away elsewhere and if so our first task must be to entice him back again  what are your reasons i asked humbly whatever they might be i knew enough of hilda wade by this time to know that she had probably good grounds for accepting them  oh they may wait for the present she answered other things are more pressing first let lina tell us what she thinks of most moment  mrs mallet braced herself up visibly to a distressing effort you have seen the body dr cumberledge she faltered  no dear mrs mallet i have not i came straight from nathaniels i have had no time to see it  dr sebastian has viewed it by my wishhe has been so kindand he will be present as representing the family at the postmortem he notes that the wound was inflicted with a daggera small ornamental norwegian dagger which always lay as i know on the little whatnot by the blue sofa  i nodded assent exactly i have seen it there  it was blunt and rustya mere toy knifenot at all the sort of weapon a man would make use of who designed to commit a deliberate murder the crime if there was a crime which we do not admit must therefore have been wholly unpremeditated  i bowed my head for us who knew hugo that goes without saying  she leaned forward eagerly dr sebastian has pointed out to me a line of defence which would probably succeedif we could only induce poor hugo to adopt it he has examined the blade and scabbard and finds that the dagger fits its sheath very tight so that it can only be withdrawn with considerable violence the blade sticks i nodded again it needs a hard pull to wrench it out he has also inspected the wound and assures me its character is such that it might have been selfinflicted she paused now and again and brought out her words with difficulty selfinflicted he suggests therefore that this may have happened it is admittedwill be admittedthe servants overheard itwe can make no reservation therea difference of opinion an altercation even took place between hugo and clara that eveningshe started suddenlywhy it was only last nightit seems like agesan altercation about the childrens schooling clara held strong views on the subject of the childrenher eyes blinked hardwhich hugo did not share we throw out the hint then that clara during the course of the disputewe must call it a disputeaccidentally took up this dagger and toyed with it you know her habit of toying when she had no knitting or needlework in the course of playing with it we suggest she tried to pull the knife out of its sheath failed held it up so point upward pulled again pulled harderwith a jerk at last the sheath came off the dagger sprang up it wounded clara fatally hugo knowing that they had disagreed knowing that the servants had heard and seeing her fall suddenly dead before him was seized with horrorthe le geyt impulsivenesslost his head rushed out fancied the accident would be mistaken for murder but why a qc dont you know recently married most attached to his wife it is plausible isnt it  so plausible i answered looking it straight in the face that it has but one weak point we might make a coroners jury or even a common jury accept it on sebastians expert evidence sebastian can work wonders but we could never make  hilda wade finished the sentence for me as i paused hugo le geyt consent to advance it  i lowered my head you have said it i answered  not for the childrens sake mrs mallet cried with clasped hands  not for the childrens sake even i answered consider for a moment mrs mallet is it true do you yourself believe it  she threw herself back in her chair with a dejected face oh as for that she cried wearily crossing her hands before you and hilda who know all what need to prevaricate how can i believe it we understand how it came about that woman that woman  the real wonder is hilda murmured soothing her white hand that he contained himself so long  well we all know hugo i went on as quietly as i was able and knowing hugo we know that he might be urged to commit this wild act in a fierce moment of indignationrighteous indignation on behalf of his motherless girls under tremendous provocation but we also know that having once committed it he would never stoop to disown it by a subterfuge  the heartbroken sister let her head drop faintly so hilda told me she murmured and what hilda says in these matters is almost always final  we debated the question for some minutes more then mrs mallet cried at last at any rate he has fled for the moment and his flight alone brings the worst suspicion upon him that is our chief point we must find out where he is and if he has gone right away we must bring him back to london  where do you think he has taken refuge  the police dr sebastian has ascertained are watching the railway stations and the ports for the continent  very like the police hilda exclaimed with more than a touch of contempt in her voice as if a clever manoftheworld like hugo le geyt would run away by rail or start off to the continent every englishman is noticeable on the continent it would be sheer madness  you think he has not gone there then i cried deeply interested  of course not that is the point i hinted at just now he has defended many persons accused of murder and he often spoke to me of their incredible folly when trying to escape in going by rail or in setting out from england for paris an englishman he used to say is least observed in his own country in this case i think i know where he has gone how he went there  where then  where comes last how first it is a question of inference  explain we know your powers  well i take it for granted that he killed herwe must not mince mattersabout twelve oclock for after that hour the servants told lina there was quiet in the drawingroom next i conjecture he went upstairs to change his clothes he could not go forth on the world in an evening suit and the housemaid says his black coat and trousers were lying as usual on a chair in his dressingroomwhich shows at least that he was not unduly flurried after that he put on another suit no doubtwhat suit i hope the police will not discover too soon for i suppose you must just accept the situation that we are conspiring to defeat the ends of justice  no no mrs mallet cried to bring him back voluntarily that he may face his trial like a man  yes dear that is quite right however the next thing of course would be that he would shave in whole or in part his big black beard was so very conspicuous he would certainly get rid of that before attempting to escape the servants being in bed he was not pressed for time he had the whole night before him so of course he shaved on the other hand the police you may be sure will circulate his photographwe must not shirk these pointsfor mrs mallet winced againwill circulate his photograph beard and all and that will really be one of our great safeguards for the bushy beard so masks the face that without it hugo would be scarcely recognisable i conclude therefore that he must have shorn himself before leaving home though naturally i did not make the police a present of the hint by getting lina to ask any questions in that direction of the housemaid  you are probably right i answered but would he have a razor  i was coming to that no certainly he would not he had not shaved for years and they kept no menservants which makes it difficult for him to borrow one from a sleeping man so what he would do would doubtless be to cut off his beard or part of it quite close with a pair of scissors and then get himself properly shaved next morning in the first country town he came to  the first country town  certainly that leads up to the next point we must try to be cool and collected she was quivering with suppressed emotion herself as she said it but her soothing hand still lay on mrs mallets the next thing ishe would leave london  but not by rail you say  he is an intelligent man and in the course of defending others has thought about this matter why expose himself to the needless risk and observation of a railway station no i saw at once what he would do beyond doubt he would cycle he always wondered it was not done oftener under similar circumstances  but has his bicycle gone  lina looked it has not i should have expected as much i told her to note that point very unobtrusively so as to avoid giving the police the clue she saw the machine in the outer hall as usual  he is too good a criminal lawyer to have dreamt of taking his own mrs mallet interposed with another effort  but where could he have hired or bought one at that time of night i exclaimed  nowherewithout exciting the gravest suspicion therefore i conclude he stopped in london for the night sleeping at an hotel without luggage and paying for his room in advance it is frequently done and if he arrived late very little notice would be taken of him big hotels about the strand i am told have always a dozen such casual bachelor guests every evening  and then  and then this morning he would buy a new bicyclea different make from his own at the nearest shop would rig himself out at some readymade tailors with a fresh tourist suitprobably an ostentatiously tweedy bicycling suit and with that in his luggagecarrier would make straight on his machine for the country he could change in some copse and bury his own clothes avoiding the blunders he has seen in others perhaps he might ride for the first twenty or thirty miles out of london to some minor sidestation and then go on by train towards his destination quitting the rail again at some unimportant point where the main west road crosses the great western or the southwestern line  great western or southwestern why those two in particular then you have settled in your own mind which direction he has taken  pretty well i judge by analogy lina your brother was brought up in the west country was he not  mrs mallet gave a weary nod in north devon she answered on the wild stretch of moor about hartland and clovelly  hilda wade seemed to collect herself now mr le geyt is essentially a celta celt in temperament she went on he comes by origin and ancestry from a rough heatherclad country he belongs to the moorland in other words his type is the mountaineers but a mountaineers instinct in similar circumstances iswhat why to fly straight to his native mountains in an agony of terror in an access of despair when all else fails he strikes a beeline for the hills he loves rationally or irrationally he seems to think he can hide there hugo le geyt with his frank boyish nature his great devonian frame is sure to have done so i know his mood he has made for the west country  you are right hilda mrs mallet exclaimed with conviction im quite sure from what i know of hugo that to go to the west would be his first impulse  and the le geyts are always governed by first impulses my characterreader added  she was quite correct from the time we two were at oxford togetheri as an undergraduate he as a doni had always noticed that marked trait in my dear old friends temperament  after a short pause hilda broke the silence again the sea again the sea the le geyts love the water was there any place on the sea where he went much as a boyany lonely place i mean in that north devon district  mrs mallet reflected a moment yes there was a little baya mere gap in high cliffs with some fishermens huts and a few yards of beachwhere he used to spend much of his holidays it was a weirdlooking break in a grim seawall of darkred rocks where the tide rose high rolling in from the atlantic  the very thing has he visited it since he grew up  to my knowledge never  hildas voice had a ring of certainty then that is where we shall find him dear we must look there first he is sure to revisit just such a solitary spot by the sea when trouble overtakes him  later in the evening as we were walking home towards nathaniels together i asked hilda why she had spoken throughout with such unwavering confidence oh it was simple enough she answered there were two things that helped me through which i didnt like to mention in detail before lina one was this the le geyts have all of them an instinctive horror of the sight of blood therefore they almost never commit suicide by shooting themselves or cutting their throats marcus who shot himself in the gunroom was an exception to both rules he never minded blood he could cut up a deer but hugo refused to be a doctor because he could not stand the sight of an operation and even as a sportsman he never liked to pick up or handle the game he had shot himself he said it sickened him he rushed from that room last night i feel sure in a physical horror at the deed he had done and by now he is as far as he can get from london the sight of his act drove him away not craven fear of an arrest if the le geyts kill themselvesa seafaring race on the wholetheir impulse is to trust to water  and the other thing  well that was about the mountaineers homing instinct i have often noticed it i could give you fifty instances only i didnt like to speak of them before lina there was williams for example the dolgelly man who killed a gamekeeper at petworth in a poaching affray he was taken on cader idris skulking among rocks a week later then there was that unhappy young fellow mackinnon who shot his sweetheart at leicester he made straight as the crow flies for his home in the isle of skye and there drowned himself in familiar waters lindner the tyrolese again who stabbed the american swindler at monte carlo was tracked after a few days to his native place st valentin in the zillerthal it is always so mountaineers in distress fly to their mountains it is a part of their nostalgia i know it from within too if i were in poor hugo legeyts place what do you think i would do why hide myself at once in the greenest recesses of our carnarvonshire mountains  what an extraordinary insight into character you have i cried you seem to divine what everybodys action will be under given circumstances  she paused and held her parasol half poised in her hand character determines action she said slowly at last that is the secret of the great novelists they put themselves behind and within their characters and so make us feel that every act of their personages is not only natural but evengiven the conditionsinevitable we recognise that their story is the sole logical outcome of the interaction of their dramatis personae now i am not a great novelist i cannot create and imagine characters and situations but i have something of the novelists gift i apply the same method to the real life of the people around me i try to throw myself into the person of others and to feel how their character will compel them to act in each set of circumstances to which they may expose themselves  in one word i said you are a psychologist  a psychologist she assented i suppose so and the policewell the police are not they are at best but bungling materialists they require a clue what need of a clue if you can interpret character  so certain was hilda wade of her conclusions indeed that mrs mallet begged me next day to take my holiday at oncewhich i could easily doand go down to the little bay in the hartland district of which she had spoken in search of hugo i consented she herself proposed to set out quietly for bideford where she could be within easy reach of me in order to hear of my success or failure while hilda wade whose summer vacation was to have begun in two days time offered to ask for an extra days leave so as to accompany her the brokenhearted sister accepted the offer and secrecy being above all things necessary we set off by different routes the two women by waterloo myself by paddington  we stopped that night at different hotels in bideford but next morning hilda rode out on her bicycle and accompanied me on mine for a mile or two along the tortuous way towards hartland take nothing for granted she said as we parted and be prepared to find poor hugo le geyts appearance greatly changed he has eluded the police and their clues so far therefore i imagine he must have largely altered his dress and exterior  i will find him i answered if he is anywhere within twenty miles of hartland  she waved her hand to me in farewell i rode on after she left me towards the high promontory in front the wildest and leastvisited part of north devon torrents of rain had fallen during the night the slimy cartruts and cattletracks on the moor were brimming with water it was a lowering day the clouds drifted low black peatbogs filled the hollows grey stone homesteads lonely and forbidding stood out here and there against the curved skyline even the high road was uneven and in places flooded for an hour i passed hardly a soul at last near a crossroad with a defaced fingerpost i descended from my machine and consulted my ordnance map on which mrs mallet had marked ominously with a cross of red rink the exact position of the little fishing hamlet where hugo used to spend his holidays i took the turning which seemed to me most likely to lead to it but the tracks were so confused and the run of the lanes so uncertainlet alone the map being some years out of datethat i soon felt i had lost my bearings by a little wayside inn half hidden in a deep combe with bog on every side i descended and asked for a bottle of gingerbeer for the day was hot and close in spite of the packed clouds as they were opening the bottle i inquired casually the way to the red gap bathingplace  the landlord gave me directions which confused me worse than ever ending at last with the concise remark an then zur two or dree more turns to the right an to the left ull bring ee right up alongzide o ut  i despaired of finding the way by these unintelligible sailingorders but just at that moment as luck would have it another cyclist flew pastthe first soul i had seen on the road that morning he was a man with the looseknit air of a shop assistant badly got up in a rather loud and obtrusive tourist suit of brown homespun with baggy knickerbockers and thin thread stockings i judged him a gentleman on the cheap at sight very stylish this suit complete only thirtyseven and sixpence the landlady glanced out at him with a friendly nod he turned and smiled at her but did not see me for i stood in the shade behind the halfopen door he had a short black moustache and a not unpleasing careless face his features i thought were better than his garments  however the stranger did not interest me just then i was far too full of more important matters why dont ee taake an vollow thik ther genleman zur the landlady said pointing one large red hand after him ur do go down to urd gap to zwim every marnin mr jan smith o oxford they do call un ee cant go wrong if ee do vollow un to the gap urs lodgin up to wold varmer moores an urs that vond o the zay the vishermen do tell me as wasnt never any genleman like un  i tossed off my gingerbeer jumped on to my machine and followed the retreating brown back of mr john smith of oxfordsurely a most noncommitting nameround sharp corners and over rutty lanes tiredeep in mud across the rustyred moor till all at once at a turn a gap of stormy sea appeared wedgeshape between two shelving rockwalls  it was a lonely spot rocks hemmed it in big breakers walled it the souwester roared through the gap i rode down among loose stones and waterworn channels in the solid grit very carefully but the man in brown had torn over the wild path with reckless haste zigzagging madly and was now on the little threecornered patch of beach undressing himself with a sort of careless glee and flinging his clothes down anyhow on the shingle beside him something about the action caught my eye that movement of the arm it was notit could not beno no not hugo  a very ordinary person and le geyt bore the stamp of a born gentleman  he stood up bare at last he flung out his arms as if to welcome the boisterous wind to his naked bosom then with a sudden burst of recognition the man stood revealed we had bathed together a hundred times in london and elsewhere the face the clad figure the dress all were different but the bodythe actual frame and make of the manthe wellknit limbs the splendid trunkno disguise could alter it was le geyt himselfbig powerful vigorous  that illmade suit those baggy knickerbockers the slouched cap the thin thread stockings had only distorted and hidden his figure now that i saw him as he was he came out the same bold and manly form as ever  he did not notice me he rushed down with a certain wild joy into the turbulent water and plunging in with a loud cry buffeted the huge waves with those strong curving arms of his the souwester was rising each breaker as it reared caught him on its crest and tumbled him over like a cork but like a cork he rose again he was swimming now arm over arm straight out seaward i saw the lifted hands between the crest and the trough for a moment i hesitated whether i ought to strip and follow him was he doing as so many others of his house had donecourting death from the water  but some strange hand restrained me who was i that i should stand between hugo le geyt and the ways of providence  the le geyts loved ever the ordeal by water  presently he turned again before he turned i had taken the opportunity to look hastily at his clothes hilda wade had surmised aright once more the outer suit was a cheap affair from a big readymade tailors in st martins laneturned out by the thousand the underclothing on the other hand was new and unmarked but fine in qualitybought no doubt at bideford an eerie sense of doom stole over me i felt the end was near i withdrew behind a big rock and waited there unseen till hugo had landed he began to dress again without troubling to dry himself i drew a deep breath of relief then this was not suicide  by the time he had pulled on his vest and drawers i came out suddenly from my ambush and faced him a fresh shock awaited me i could hardly believe my eyes it was not le geytno nor anything like him  nevertheless the man rose with a little cry and advanced half crouching towards me you are not hunting me downwith the police he exclaimed his neck held low and his forehead wrinkling  the voicethe voice was le geyts it was an unspeakable mystery hugo i cried dear hugohunting you downcould you imagine it  he raised his head strode forward and grasped my hand forgive me cumberledge he cried but a proscribed and hounded man if you knew what a relief it is to me to get out on the water  you forget all there  i forget itthe red horror  you meant just now to drown yourself  no if i had meant it i would have done it hubert for my childrens sake i will not commit suicide  then listen i cried i told him in a few words of his sisters schemesebastians defencethe plausibility of the explanationthe whole long story he gazed at me moodily yet it was not hugo  no no he said shortly and as he spoke it was he i have done it i have killed her i will not owe my life to a falsehood  not for the childrens sake  he dashed his hand down impatiently i have a better way for the children i will save them still hubert you are not afraid to speak to a murderer  dear hugoi know all and to know all is to forgive all  he grasped my hand once more know all he cried with a despairing gesture oh no no one knows all but myself not even the children but the children know much they will forgive me lina knows something she will forgive me you know a little you forgive me the world can never know it will brand my darlings as a murderers children  it was the act of a minute i interposed andthough she is dead poor lady and one must speak no ill of herwe can at least gather dimly for your childrens sake how deep was the provocation  he gazed at me fixedly his voice was like lead for the childrens sakeyes he answered as in a dream it was all for the children i have killed hermurdered hershe has paid her penalty and poor dead soul i will utter no word against herthe woman i have murdered but one thing i will say if omniscient justice sends me for this to eternal punishment i can endure it gladly like a man knowing that so i have redeemed my marians motherless girls from a deadly tyranny  it was the only sentence in which he ever alluded to her  i sat down by his side and watched him closely mechanically methodically he went on with his dressing the more he dressed the less could i believe it was hugo i had expected to find him closeshaven so did the police by their printed notices instead of that he had shaved his beard and whiskers but only trimmed his moustache trimmed it quite short so as to reveal the boyish corners of the moutha trick which entirely altered his rugged expression but that was not all what puzzled me most was the eyesthey were not hugos at first i could not imagine why by degrees the truth dawned upon me his eyebrows were naturally thick and shaggygreat overhanging growth interspersed with many of those stiff long hairs to which darwin called attention in certain men as surviving traits from a monkeylike ancestor in order to disguise himself hugo had pulled out all these coarser hairs leaving nothing on his brows but the soft and closely pressed coat of down which underlies the longer bristles in all such cases this had wholly altered the expression of the eyes which no longer looked out keenly from their cavernous penthouse but being deprived of their relief had acquired a much more ordinary and less individual aspect from a goodnatured but shaggy giant my old friend was transformed by his shaving and his costume into a wellfed and wellgrown but not very colossal commercial gentleman hugo was scarcely six feet high indeed though by his broad shoulders and bushy beard he had always impressed one with such a sense of size and now that the hirsuteness had been got rid of and the dress altered he hardly struck one as taller or bigger than the average of his fellows  we sat for some minutes and talked le geyt would not speak of clara and when i asked him his intentions he shook his head moodily i shall act for the best he saidwhat of best is leftto guard the dear children it was a terrible price to pay for their redemption but it was the only one possible and in a moment of wrath i paid it now i have to pay in turn myself i do not shirk it  you will come back to london then and stand your trial i asked eagerly  come back to london he cried with a face of white panic hitherto he had seemed to me rather relieved in expression than otherwise his countenance had lost its worn and anxious look he was no longer watching each moment over his childrens safety come back to london and face my trial why did you think hubert twas the court or the hanging i was shirking no no not that but itthe red horror i must get away from it to the seato the waterto wash away the stainas far from itthat red poolas possible  i answered nothing i left him to face his own remorse in silence  at last he rose to go and held one foot undecided on his bicycle  i leave myself in heavens hands he said as he lingered it will requite the ordeal is by water  so i judged i answered  tell lina this from me he went on still loitering that if she will trust me i will strive to do the best that remains for my darlings i will do it heaven helping she will know what tomorrow  he mounted his machine and sailed off my eyes followed him up the path with sad forebodings  all day long i loitered about the gap it consisted of two baysthe one i had already seen and another divided from it by a sawedge of rock in the further cove crouched a few low stone cottages a broadbottomed sailing boat lay there pulled up high on the beach about three oclock as i sat and watched two men began to launch it the sea ran high tide coming in the souwester still increasing in force to a gale at the signalstaff on the cliff the dangercone was hoisted white spray danced in air big black clouds rolled up seething from windward low thunder rumbling a storm threatened  one of the men was le geyt the other a fisherman  he jumped in and put off through the surf with an air of triumph he was a splendid sailor his boat leapt through the breakers and flew before the wind with a mere rag of canvas dangerous weather to be out i exclaimed to the fisherman who stood with hands buried in his pockets watching him  ay that ur be zur the man answered doant like the look o ut but thik there genleman ees one o oxford ee do tell me and theym a main venturesome lot they college volk ees off by isself droo the starm all so var as lundy  will he reach it i asked anxiously having my own idea on the subject  doant seem like ut zur do

must go their own voolhardy waay to perdition  it was the last i saw of le geyt alive next morning the lifeless body of the man who was wanted for the campden hill mystery was cast up by the waves on the shore of lundy the lord had decided  hugo had not miscalculated luck in their suicides hilda wade said and strange to say the luck of the le geyts stood him in good stead still by a miracle of fate his children were not branded as a murderers daughters sebastian gave evidence at the inquest on the wifes body selfinflicteda recoilaccidentali am sure of it his specialist knowledgehis assertive certainty combined with that arrogant masterful manner of his and his keen eagle eye overbore the jury awed by the great mans look they brought in a submissive verdict of death by misadventure the coroner thought it a most proper finding mrs mallet had made the most of the innate le geyt horror of blood the newspapers charitably surmised that the unhappy husband crazed by the instantaneous unexpectedness of his loss had wandered away like a madman to the scenes of his childhood and had there been drowned by accident while trying to cross a stormy sea to lundy under some wild impression that he would find his dead wife alive on the island nobody whispered murder everybody dwelt on the utter absence of motivea model husbandsuch a charming young wife and such a devoted stepmother we three alone knewwe three and the children  on the day when the jury brought in their verdict at the adjourned inquest on mrs le geyt hilda wade stood in the room trembling and whitefaced awaiting their decision when the foreman uttered the words death by misadventure she burst into tears of relief he did well she cried to me passionately he did well that poor father he placed his life in the hands of his maker asking only for mercy to his innocent children and mercy has been shown to him and to them he was taken gently in the way he wished it would have broken my heart for those two poor girls if the verdict had gone otherwise he knew how terrible a lot it is to be called a murderers daughter  i did not realise at the time with what profound depth of personal feeling she said it    chapter v  the episode of the needle that did not match   sebastian is a great man i said to hilda wade as i sat one afternoon over a cup of tea she had brewed for me in her own little sittingroom it is one of the alleviations of an hospital doctors lot that he may drink tea now and again with the sister of his ward whatever else you choose to think of him you must admit he is a very great man  i admired our famous professor and i admired hilda wade twas a matter of regret to me that my two admirations did not seem in return sufficiently to admire one another oh yes hilda answered pouring out my second cup he is a very great man i never denied that the greatest man on the whole i think that i have ever come across  and he has done splendid work for humanity i went on growing enthusiastic  splendid work yes splendid two lumps i believe he has done more i admit for medical science than any other man i ever met  i gazed at her with a curious glance then why dear lady do you keep telling me he is cruel i inquired toasting my feet on the fender it seems contradictory  she passed me the muffins and smiled her restrained smile  does the desire to do good to humanity in itself imply a benevolent disposition she answered obliquely  now you are talking in paradox surely if a man works all his life long for the good of mankind that shows he is devoured by sympathy for his species  and when your friend mr bates works all his life long at observing and classifying ladybirds i suppose that shows he is devoured by sympathy for the race of beetles  i laughed at her comical face she looked at me so quizzically but then i objected the cases are not parallel bates kills and collects his ladybirds sebastian cures and benefits humanity  hilda smiled her wise smile once more and fingered her apron are the cases so different as you suppose she went on with her quick glance is it not partly accident a man of science you see early in life takes up half by chance this that or the other particular form of study but what the study is in itself i fancy does not greatly matter do not mere circumstances as often as not determine it surely it is the temperament on the whole that tells the temperament that is or is not scientific  how do you mean you are so enigmatic  well in a family of the scientific temperament it seems to me one brother may happen to go in for butterfliesmay he notand another for geology or for submarine telegraphs now the man who happens to take up butterflies does not make a fortune out of his hobbythere is no money in butterflies so we say accordingly he is an unpractical person who cares nothing for business and who is only happy when he is out in the fields with a net chasing emperors and tortoiseshells but the man who happens to fancy submarine telegraphy most likely invents a lot of new improvements takes out dozens of patents finds money flow in upon him as he sits in his study and becomes at last a peer and a millionaire so then we say what a splendid business head he has got to be sure and how immensely he differs from his poor woolgathering brother the entomologist who can only invent new ways of hatching out wireworms yet all may really depend on the first chance direction which led one brother as a boy to buy a butterfly net and sent the other into the school laboratory to dabble with an electric wheel and a cheap battery  then you mean to say it is chance that has made sebastian  hilda shook her pretty head by no means dont be so stupid we both know sebastian has a wonderful brain whatever was the work he undertook with that brain in science he would carry it out consummately he is a born thinker it is like this dont you know she tried to arrange her thoughts the particular branch of science to which mr hiram maxims mind happens to have been directed was the making of machinegunsand he slays his thousands the particular branch to which sebastians mind happens to have been directed was medicineand he cures as many as mr maxim kills it is a turn of the hand that makes all the difference  i see i said the aim of medicine happens to be a benevolent one  quite so thats just what i mean the aim is benevolent and sebastian pursues that aim with the singleminded energy of a lofty gifted and devoted naturebut not a good one  not good  oh no to be quite frank he seems to me to pursue it ruthlessly cruelly unscrupulously he is a man of high ideals but without principle in that respect he reminds one of the great spirits of the italian renaissancebenvenuto cellini and so forthmen who could pore for hours with conscientious artistic care over the detail of a hem in a sculptured robe yet could steal out in the midst of their disinterested toil to plunge a knife in the back of a rival  sebastian would not do that i cried he is wholly free from the mean spirit of jealousy  no sebastian would not do that you are quite right there there is no tinge of meanness in the mans nature he likes to be first in the field but he would acclaim with delight another mans scientific triumphif another anticipated him for would it not mean a triumph for universal scienceand is not the advancement of science sebastians religion but he would do almost as much or more he would stab a man without remorse if he thought that by stabbing him he could advance knowledge  i recognised at once the truth of her diagnosis nurse wade i cried you are a wonderful woman i believe you are right buthow did you come to think of it  a cloud passed over her brow i have reason to know it she answered slowly then her voice changed take another muffin  i helped myself and paused i laid down my cup and gazed at her what a beautiful tender sympathetic face and yet how able she stirred the fire uneasily i looked and hesitated i had often wondered why i never dared ask hilda wade one question that was nearest my heart i think it must have been because i respected her so profoundly the deeper your admiration and respect for a woman the harder you find it in the end to ask her at last i almost made up my mind i cannot think i began what can have induced a girl like you with means and friends with brains andi drew back then i plumped it outbeauty to take to such a life as thisa life which seems in many ways so unworthy of you  she stirred the fire more pensively than ever and rearranged the muffindish on the little wroughtiron stand in font of the grate and yet she murmured looking down what life can be better than the service of ones kind you think it a great life for sebastian  sebastian he is a man that is different quite different but a woman especially you dear lady for whom one feels that nothing is quite high enough quite pure enough quite good enough i cannot imagine how  she checked me with one wave of her gracious hand her movements were always slow and dignified i have a plan in my life she answered earnestly her eyes meeting mine with a sincere frank gaze a plan to which i have resolved to sacrifice everything it absorbs my being till that plan is fulfilled i saw the tears were gathering fast on her lashes she suppressed them with an effort say no more she added faltering infirm of purpose i will not listen  i leant forward eagerly pressing my advantage the air was electric waves of emotion passed to and fro but surely i cried you do not mean to say  she waved me aside once more i will not put my hand to the plough and then look back she answered firmly dr cumberledge spare me i came to nathaniels for a purpose i told you at the time what that purpose wasin part to be near sebastian i want to be near him for an object i have at heart do not ask me to reveal it do not ask me to forego it i am a woman therefore weak but i need your aid help me instead of hindering me  hilda i cried leaning forward with quiverings of my heart i will help you in whatever way you will allow me but let me at any rate help you with the feeling that i am helping one who means in time  at that moment as unkindly fate would have it the door opened and sebastian entered  nurse wade he began in his iron voice glancing about him with stern eyes where are those needles i ordered for that operation we must be ready in time before nielsen comes cumberledge i shall want you  the golden opportunity had come and gone it was long before i found a similar occasion for speaking to hilda  every day after that the feeling deepened upon me that hilda was there to watch sebastian why i did not know but it was growing certain that a lifelong duel was in progress between these twoa duel of some strange and mysterious import  the first approach to a solution of the problem which i obtained came a week or two later sebastian was engaged in observing a case where certain unusual symptoms had suddenly supervened it was a case of some obscure affection of the heart i will not trouble you here with the particular details we all suspected a tendency to aneurism hilda wade was in attendance as she always was on sebastians observation cases we crowded round watching the professor himself leaned over the cot with some medicine for external application in a basin he gave it to hilda to hold i noticed that as she held it her fingers trembled and that her eyes were fixed harder than ever upon sebastian he turned round to his students now this he began in a very unconcerned voice as if the patient were a toad is a most unwonted turn for the disease to take it occurs very seldom in point of fact i have only observed the symptom once before and then it was fatal the patient in that instancehe paused dramaticallywas the notorious poisoner dr yorkebannerman  as he uttered the words hilda wades hands trembled more than ever and with a little scream she let the basin fall breaking it into fragments  sebastians keen eyes had transfixed her in a second how did you manage to do that he asked with quiet sarcasm but in a tone full of meaning  the basin was heavy hilda faltered my hands were tremblingand it somehow slipped through them i am not quite myself not quite well this afternoon i ought not to have attempted it  the professors deepset eyes peered out like gleaming lights from beneath their overhanging brows no you ought not to have attempted it he answered withering her with a glance you might have let the thing fall on the patient and killed him as it is cant you see you have agitated him with the flurry dont stand there holding your breath woman repair your mischief get a cloth and wipe it up and give me the bottle  with skilful haste he administered a little sal volatile and nux vomica to the swooning patient while hilda set about remedying the damage thats better sebastian said in a mollified tone when she had brought another basin there was a singular note of cloaked triumph in his voice now well begin again i was just saying gentlemen before this accident that i had seen only one case of this peculiar form of the tendency before and that case was the notorioushe kept his glittering eyes fixed harder on hilda than everthe notorious dr yorkebannerman  i was watching hilda too at the words she trembled violently all over once more but with an effort restrained herself their looks met in a searching glance hildas air was proud and fearless in sebastians i fancied i detected after a second just a tinge of wavering  you remember yorkebannermans case he went on he committed a murder  let me take the basin i cried for i saw hildas hands giving way a second time and i was anxious to spare her  no thank you she answered low but in a voice that was full of suppressed defiance i will wait and hear this out i prefer to stop here  as for sebastian he seemed now not to notice her though i was aware all the time of a sidelong glance of his eye parrotwise in her direction he committed a murder he went on by means of aconitinethen an almost unknown poison and after committing it his heart being already weak he was taken himself with symptoms of aneurism in a curious form essentially similar to these so that he died before the triala lucky escape for him  he paused rhetorically once more then he added in the same tone mental agitation and the terror of detection no doubt accelerated the fatal result in that instance he died at once from the shock of the arrest it was a natural conclusion here we may hope for a more successful issue  he spoke to the students of course but i could see for all that that he was keeping his falcon eye fixed hard on hildas face i glanced aside at her she never flinched for a second neither said anything directly to the other still by their eyes and mouths i knew some strange passage of arms had taken place between them sebastians tone was one of provocation of defiance i might almost say of challenge hildas air i took rather for the air of calm and resolute but assured resistance he expected her to answer she said nothing instead of that she went on holding the basin now with fingers that would not tremble every muscle was strained every tendon was strung i could see she held herself in with a will of iron  the rest of the episode passed off quietly sebastian having delivered his bolt began to think less of hilda and more of the patient he went on with his demonstration as for hilda she gradually relaxed her muscles and with a deepdrawn breath resumed her natural attitude the tension was over they had had their little skirmish whatever it might mean and had it out now they called a truce over the patients body  when the case had been disposed of and the students dismissed i went straight into the laboratory to get a few surgical instruments i had chanced to leave there for a minute or two i mislaid my clinical thermometer and began hunting for it behind a wooden partition in the corner of the room by the place for washing testtubes as i stooped down turning over the various objects about the tap in my search sebastians voice came to me he had paused outside the door and was speaking in his calm clear tone very low to hilda so now we understand one another nurse wade he said with a significant sneer i know whom i have to deal with  and i know too hilda answered in a voice of placid confidence  yet you are not afraid  it is not i who have cause for fear the accused may tremble not the prosecutor  what you threaten  no i do not threaten not in words i mean my presence here is in itself a threat but i make no other you know now unfortunately why i have come that makes my task harder but i will not give it up i will wait and conquer  sebastian answered nothing he strode into the laboratory alone tall grim unbending and let himself sink into his easy chair looking up with a singular and somewhat sinister smile at his bottles of microbes after a minute he stirred the fire and bent his head forward brooding he held it between his hands with his elbows on his knees and gazed moodily straight before him into the glowing caves of whitehot coal in the fireplace that sinister smile still played lambent around the corners of his grizzled moustaches  i moved noiselessly towards the door trying to pass behind him unnoticed but alert as ever his quick ears detected me with a sudden start he raised his head and glanced round what you here he cried taken aback for a second he appeared almost to lose his selfpossession  i came for my clinical i answered with an unconcerned air i have somehow managed to mislay it in the laboratory  my carefully casual tone seemed to reassure him he peered about him with knit brows cumberledge he asked at last in a suspicious voice did you hear that woman  the woman in 93 delirious  no no nurse wade  hear her i echoed i must candidly admit with intent to deceive when she broke the basin  his forehead relaxed oh it is nothing he muttered hastily a mere point of discipline she spoke to me just now and i thought her tone unbecoming in a subordinate like korah and his crew she takes too much upon her we must get rid of her cumberledge we must get rid of her she is a dangerous woman  she is the most intelligent nurse we have ever had in the place sir i objected stoutly  he nodded his head twice intelligentje vous laccorde but dangerousdangerous  then he turned to his papers sorting them out one by one with a preoccupied face and twitching fingers i recognised that he desired to be left alone so i quitted the laboratory  i cannot quite say why but ever since hilda wade first came to nathaniels my enthusiasm for sebastian had been cooling continuously admiring his greatness still i had doubts as to his goodness that day i felt i positively mistrusted him i wondered what his passage of arms with hilda might mean yet somehow i was shy of alluding to it before her  one thing however was clear to me nowthis great campaign that was being waged between the nurse and the professor had reference to the case of dr yorkebannerman  for a time nothing came of it the routine of the hospital went on as usual the patient with the suspected predisposition to aneurism kept fairly well for a week or two and then took a sudden turn for the worse presenting at times most unwonted symptoms he died unexpectedly sebastian who had watched him every hour regarded the matter as of prime importance im glad it happened here he said rubbing his hands a grand opportunity i wanted to catch an instance like this before that fellow in paris had time to anticipate me theyre all on the lookout von strahlendorff of vienna has been waiting for just such a patient for years so have i now fortune has favoured me lucky for us he died we shall find out everything  we held a postmortem of course the condition of the blood being what we most wished to observe and the autopsy revealed some unexpected details one remarkable feature consisted in a certain undescribed and impoverished state of the contained bodies which sebastian with his eager zeal for science desired his students to see and identify he said it was likely to throw much light on other illunderstood conditions of the brain and nervous system as well as on the peculiar faint odour of the insane now so well recognised in all large asylums in order to compare this abnormal state with the aspect of the healthy circulating medium he proposed to examine a little good living blood side by side with the morbid specimen under the microscope nurse wade was in attendance in the laboratory as usual the professor standing by the instrument with one hand on the brass screw had got the diseased drop ready arranged for our inspection beforehand and was gloating over it himself with scientific enthusiasm grey corpuscles you will observe he said almost entirely deficient red poor in number and irregular in outline plasma thin nuclei feeble a state of body which tells severely against the due rebuilding of the wasted tissues now compare with typical normal specimen he removed his eye from the microscope and wiped a glass slide with a clean cloth as he spoke nurse wade we know of old the purity and vigour of your circulating fluid you shall have the honour of advancing science once more hold up your finger  hilda held up her forefinger unhesitatingly she was used to such requests and indeed sebastian had acquired by long experience the faculty of pinching the fingertip so hard and pressing the point of a needle so dexterously into a minor vessel that he could draw at once a small drop of blood without the subject even feeling it  the professor nipped the last joint between his finger and thumb for a moment till it was black at the end then he turned to the saucer at his side which hilda herself had placed there and chose from it catlike with great deliberation and selective care a particular needle hildas eyes followed his every movement as closely and as fearlessly as ever sebastians hand was raised and he was just about to pierce the delicate white skin when with a sudden quick scream of terror she snatched her hand away hastily  the professor let the needle drop in his astonishment what did you do that for he cried with an angry dart of the keen eyes this is not the first time i have drawn your blood you knew i would not hurt you  hildas face had grown strangely pale but that was not all i believe i was the only person present who noticed one unobtrusive piece of sleightofhand which she hurriedly and skilfully executed when the needle slipped from sebastians hand she leant forward even as she screamed and caught it unobserved in the folds of her apron then her nimble fingers closed over it as if by magic and conveyed it with a rapid movement at once to her pocket i do not think even sebastian himself noticed the quick forward jerk of her eager hands which would have done honour to a conjurer he was too much taken aback by her unexpected behaviour to observe the needle  just as she caught it hilda answered his question in a somewhat flurried voice ii was afraid she broke out gasping one gets these little accesses of terror now and again ii feel rather weak i dont think i will volunteer to supply any more normal blood this morning  sebastians acute eyes read her through as so often with a trenchant dart he glanced from her to me i could see he began to suspect a confederacy that will do he went on with slow deliberateness better so nurse wade i dont know whats beginning to come over you you are losing your nervewhich is fatal in a nurse only the other day you let fall and broke a basin at a most critical moment and now you scream aloud on a trifling apprehension he paused and glanced around him mr callaghan he said turning to our tall redhaired irish student your blood is good normal and you are not hysterical he selected another needle with studious care give me your finger  as he picked out the needle i saw hilda lean forward again alert and watchful eyeing him with a piercing glance but after a seconds consideration she seemed to satisfy herself and fell back without a word i gathered that she was ready to interfere had occasion demanded but occasion did not demand and she held her peace quietly  the rest of the examination proceeded without a hitch for a minute or two it is true i fancied that sebastian betrayed a certain suppressed agitationa trifling lack of his accustomed perspicuity and his luminous exposition but after meandering for a while through a few vague sentences he soon recovered his wonted calm and as he went on with his demonstration throwing himself eagerly into the case his usual scientific enthusiasm came back to him undiminished he waxed eloquent after his fashion over the beautiful contrast between callaghans wholesome blood rich in the vivifying architectonic grey corpuscles which rebuild worn tissues and the effete impoverished unvitalised fluid which stagnated in the sluggish veins of the dead patient the carriers of oxygen had neglected their proper task the granules whose duty it was to bring elaborated foodstuffs to supply the waste of brain and nerve and muscle had forgotten their cunning the bricklayers of the bodily fabric had gone out on strike the weary scavengers had declined to remove the useless byproducts his vivid tongue his picturesque fancy ran away with him i had never heard him talk better or more incisively before one could feel sure as he spoke that the arteries of his own acute and teeming brain at that moment of exaltation were by no means deficient in those energetic and highly vital globules on whose reparative worth he so eloquently descanted sure the professor makes annywan see right inside wans own vascular system callaghan whispered aside to me in unfeigned admiration  the demonstration ended in impressive silence as we streamed out of the laboratory aglow with his electric fire sebastian held me back with a bent motion of his shrivelled forefinger i stayed behind unwillingly yes sir i said in an interrogative voice  the professors eyes were fixed intently on the ceiling his look was one of rapt inspiration i stood and waited cumberledge he said at last coming back to earth with a start i see it more plainly each day that goes we must get rid of that woman  of nurse wade i asked catching my breath  he roped the grizzled moustache and blinked the sunken eyes she has lost nerve he went on lost nerve entirely i shall suggest that she be dismissed her sudden failures of stamina are most embarrassing at critical junctures  very well sir i answered swallowing a lump in my throat to say the truth i was beginning to be afraid on hildas account that mornings events had thoroughly disquieted me  he seemed relieved at my unquestioning acquiescence she is a dangerous edgedtool thats the truth of it he went on still twirling his moustache with a preoccupied air and turning over his stock of needles when shes clothed and in her right mind she is a valuable accessorysharp and trenchant like a clean bright lancet but when she allows one of these causeless hysterical fits to override her tone she plays one false at oncelike a lancet that slips or grows dull and rusty he polished one of the needles on a soft square of new chamoisleather while he spoke as if to give point and illustration to his simile  i went out from him much perturbed the sebastian i had once admired and worshipped was beginning to pass from me in his place i found a very complex and inferior creation my idol had feet of clay i was loth to acknowledge it  i stalked along the corridor moodily towards my own room as i passed hilda wades door i saw it half ajar she stood a little within and beckoned me to enter  i passed in and closed the door behind me hilda looked at me with trustful eyes resolute still her face was yet that of a hunted creature thank heaven i have one friend here at least she said slowly seating herself you saw me catch and conceal the needle  yes i saw you  she drew it forth from her purse carefully but loosely wrapped up in a small tag of tissuepaper here it is she said displaying it now i want you to test it  in a culture i asked for i guessed her meaning  she nodded yes to see what that man has done to it  what do you suspect  she shrugged her graceful shoulders half imperceptibly  how should i know anything  i gazed at the needle closely what made you distrust it i inquired at last still eyeing it  she opened a drawer and took out several others see here she said handing me one these are the needles i keep in antiseptic woolthe needles with which i always supply the professor you observe their shapethe common surgical patterns now look at this needle with which the professor was just going to prick my finger you can see for yourself at once it is of bluer steel and of a different manufacture  that is quite true i answered examining it with my pocket lens which i always carry i see the difference but how did you detect it  from his face partly but partly too from the needle itself i had my suspicions and i was watching him closely just as he raised the thing in his hand half concealing it so and showing only the point i caught the blue gleam of the steel as the light glanced off it it was not the kind i knew then i withdrew my hand at once feeling sure he meant mischief  that was wonderfully quick of you  quick well yes thank heaven my mind works fast my perceptions are rapid otherwise she looked grave one second more and it would have been too late the man might have killed me  you think it is poisoned then  hilda shook her head with confident dissent poisoned oh no he is wiser now fifteen years ago he used poison but science has made gigantic strides since then he would not needlessly expose himself today to the risks of the poisoner  fifteen years ago he used poison  she nodded with the air of one who knows i am not speaking at random she answered i say what i know some day i will explain for the present it is enough to tell you i know it  and what do you suspect now i asked the weird sense of her strange power deepening on me every second  she held up the incriminated needle again  do you see this groove she asked pointing to it with the tip of another  i examined it once more at the light with the lens a longitudinal groove apparently ground into one side of the needle lengthwise by means of a small grindingstone and emery powder ran for a quarter of an inch above the point this groove seemed to me to have been produced by an amateur though he must have been one accustomed to delicate microscopic manipulation for the edges under the lens showed slightly rough like the surface of a file on a small scale not smooth and polished as a needlemaker would have left them i said so to hilda  you are quite right she answered that is just what it shows i feel sure sebastian made that groove himself he could have bought grooved needles it is true such as they sometimes use for retaining small quantities of lymphs and medicines but we had none in stock and to buy them would be to manufacture evidence against himself in case of detection besides the rough jagged edge would hold the material he wished to inject all the better while its sawlike points would tear the flesh imperceptibly but minutely and so serve his purpose  which was  try the needle and judge for yourself i prefer you should find out you can tell me tomorrow  it was quick of you to detect it i cried still turning the suspicious object over the difference is so slight  yes but you tell me my eyes are as sharp as the needle besides i had reason to doubt and sebastian himself gave me the clue by selecting his instrument with too great deliberation he had put it there with the rest but it lay a little apart and as he picked it up gingerly i began to doubt when i saw the blue gleam my doubt was at once converted into certainty then his eyes too had the look which i know means victory benign or baleful it goes with his triumphs i have seen that look before and when once it lurks scintillating in the luminous depths of his gleaming eyeballs i recognise at once that whatever his aim he has succeeded in it  still hilda i am loth  she waved her hand impatiently waste no time she cried in an authoritative voice if you happen to let that needle rub carelessly against the sleeve of your coat you may destroy the evidence take it at once to your room plunge it into a culture and lock it up safe at a proper temperaturewhere sebastian cannot get at ittill the consequences develop  i did as she bid me by this time i was not wholly unprepared for the result she anticipated my belief in sebastian had sunk to zero and was rapidly reaching a negative quantity  at nine the next morning i tested one drop of the culture under the microscope clear and limpid to the naked eye it was alive with small objects of a most suspicious nature when properly magnified i knew those hungry forms still i would not decide offhand on my own authority in a matter of such moment sebastians character was at stakethe character of the man who led the profession i called in callaghan who happened to be in the ward and asked him to put his eye to the instrument for a moment he was a splendid fellow for the use of high powers and i had magnified the culture 300 diameters what do you call those i asked breathless  he scanned them carefully with his experienced eye is it the microbes ye mean he answered an what ud they be then if it wasnt the bacillus of pyaemia  bloodpoisoning i ejaculated horrorstruck  aye bloodpoisoning thats the english of it  i assumed an air of indifference i made them that myself i rejoined as if they were mere ordinary experimental germs but i wanted confirmation of my own opinion youre sure of the bacillus  an havent i been keeping swarms of those very same bacteria under close observation for sebastian for seven weeks past why i know them as well as i know me own mother  thank you i said that will do and i carried off the microscope bacilli and all into hilda wades sittingroom look yourself i cried to her  she stared at them through the instrument with an unmoved face i thought so she answered shortly the bacillus of pyaemia a most virulent type exactly what i expected  you anticipated that result  absolutely you see bloodpoisoning matures quickly and kills almost to a certainty delirium supervenes so soon that the patient has no chance of explaining suspicions besides it would all seem so very natural everybody would say she got some slight wound which microbes from some case she was attending contaminated you may be sure sebastian thought out all that he plans with consummate skill he had designed everything  i gazed at her uncertain and what will you do i asked expose him  she opened both her palms with a blank gesture of helplessness it is useless she answered nobody would believe me consider the situation you know the needle i gave you was the one sebastian meant to usethe one he dropped and i caughtbecause you are a friend of mine and because you have learned to trust me but who else would credit it i have only my word against hisan unknown nurses against the great professors everybody would say i was malicious or hysterical hysteria is always an easy stone to fling at an injured woman who asks for justice they would declare i had trumped up the case to forestall my dismissal they would set it down to spite we can do nothing against him remember on his part the utter absence of overt motive  and you mean to stop on here in close attendance on a man who has attempted your life i cried really alarmed for her safety  i am not sure about that she answered i must take time to think my presence at nathaniels was necessary to my plan the plan fails for the present i have now to look round and reconsider my position  but you are not safe here now i urged growing warm if sebastian really wishes to get rid of you and is as unscrupulous as you suppose with his gigantic brain he can soon compass his end what he plans he executes you ought not to remain within the professors reach one hour longer  i have thought of that too she replied with an almost unearthly calm but there are difficulties either way at any rate i am glad he did not succeed this time for to have killed me now would have frustrated my planshe clasped her handsmy plan is ten thousand times dearer than life to me  dear lady i cried drawing a deep breath i implore you in this strait listen to what i urge why fight your battle alone why refuse assistance i have admired you so longi am so eager to help you if only you will allow me to call you  her eyes brightened and softened her whole bosom heaved i felt in a flash she was not wholly indifferent to me strange tremors in the air seemed to play about us but she waved me aside once more dont press me she said in a very low voice let me go my own way it is hard enough already this task i have undertaken without your making it harder dear friend dear friend you dont quite understand there are two men at nathaniels whom i desire to escapebecause they both alike stand in the way of my purpose she took my hands in hers each in a different way she murmured once more but each i must avoid one is sebastian the other she let my hand drop again and broke off suddenly dear hubert she cried with a catch i cannot help it forgive me  it was the first time she had ever called me by my christian name the mere sound of the word made me unspeakably happy  yet she waved me away must i go i asked quivering  yes yes you must go i cannot stand it i must think this thing out undisturbed it is a very great crisis  that afternoon and evening by some unhappy chance i was fully engaged in work at the hospital late at night a letter arrived for me i glanced at it in dismay it bore the basingstoke postmark but to my alarm and surprise it was in hildas hand what could this change portend i opened it all tremulous  dear hubert i gave a sigh of relief it was no longer dear dr cumberledge now but hubert that was something gained at any rate i read on with a beating heart what had hilda to say to me   dear hubertby the time this reaches you i shall be far away irrevocably far from london with deep regret with fierce searchings of spirit i have come to the conclusion that for the purpose i have in view it would be better for me at once to leave nathaniels where i go or what i mean to do i do not wish to tell you of your charity i pray refrain from asking me i am aware that your kindness and generosity deserve better recognition but like sebastian himself i am the slave of my purpose i have lived for it all these years and it is still very dear to me to tell you my plans would interfere with that end do not therefore suppose i am insensible to your goodness dear hubert spare mei dare not say more lest i say too much i dare not trust myself but one thing i must say i am flying from you quite as much as from sebastian flying from my own heart quite as much as from my enemy some day perhaps if i accomplish my object i may tell you all meanwhile i can only beg of you of your kindness to trust me we shall not meet again i fear for years but i shall never forget youyou the kind counsellor who have half turned me aside from my lifes purpose one word more and i should falterin very great haste and amid much disturbance yours ever affectionately and gratefully  hilda   it was a hurried scrawl in pencil as if written in a train i felt utterly dejected was hilda then leaving england  rousing myself after some minutes i went straight to sebastians rooms and told him in brief terms that nurse wade had disappeared at a moments notice and had sent a note to tell me so  he looked up from his work and scanned me hard as was his wont that is well he said at last his eyes glowing deep she was getting too great a hold on you that young woman  she retains that hold upon me sir i answered curtly  you are making a grave mistake in life my dear cumberledge he went on in his old genial tone which i had almost forgotten before you go further and entangle yourself more deeply i think it is only right that i should undeceive you as to this girls true position she is passing under a false name and she comes of a tainted stock nurse wade as she chooses to call herself is a daughter of the notorious murderer yorkebannerman  my mind leapt back to the incident of the broken basin yorkebannermans name had profoundly moved her then i thought of hildas face murderers i said to myself do not beget such daughters as that not even accidental murderers like my poor friend le geyt i saw at once the prima facie evidence was strongly against her but i had faith in her still i drew myself up firmly and stared him back full in the face i do not believe it i answered shortly  you do not believe it i tell you it is so the girl herself as good as acknowledged it to me  i spoke slowly and distinctly dr sebastian i said confronting him let us be quite clear with one another i have found you out i know how you tried to poison that lady to poison her with bacilli which i detected i cannot trust your word i cannot trust your inferences either she is not yorkebannermans daughter at all or else yorkebannerman was not a murderer i watched his face closely conviction leaped upon me and someone else was i went on i might put a name to him  with a stern white face he rose and opened the door he pointed to it slowly this hospital is not big enough for you and me abreast he said with cold politeness one or other of us must go which i leave to your good sense to determine  even at that moment of detection and disgrace in one mans eyes at least sebastian retained his full measure of dignity    chapter vi  the episode of the letter with the basingstoke postmark   i have a vast respect for my grandfather he was a man of forethought he left me a modest little income of seven hundred ayear well invested now seven hundred ayear is not exactly wealth but it is an unobtrusive competence it permits a bachelor to move about the world and choose at will his own profession i chose medicine but i was not wholly dependent upon it so i honoured my grandfathers wise disposition of his worldly goods though oddly enough my cousin tom to whom he left his watch and five hundred pounds speaks most disrespectfully of his character and intellect  thanks to my grandfathers silkensailed barque therefore when i found myself practically dismissed from nathaniels i was not thrown on my beamends as most young men in my position would have been i had time and opportunity for the favourite pastime of looking about me of course had i chosen i might have fought the case to the bitter end against sebastian he could not dismiss methat lay with the committee but i hardly cared to fight in the first place though i had found him out as a man i still respected him as a great teacher and in the second place which is always more important i wanted to find and follow hilda  to be sure hilda in that enigmatic letter of hers had implored me not to seek her out but i think you will admit there is one request which no man can grant to the girl he lovesand that is the request to keep away from her if hilda did not want me i wanted hilda and being a man i meant to find her  my chances of discovering her whereabouts however i had to confess to myself when it came to the point were extremely slender she had vanished from my horizon melted into space my sole hint of a clue consisted in the fact that the letter she sent me had been posted at basingstoke here then was my problem given an envelope with the basingstoke postmark to find in what part of europe asia africa or america the writer of it might be discovered it opened up a fine field for speculation  when i set out to face this broad puzzle my first idea was i must ask hilda in all circumstances of difficulty i had grown accustomed to submitting my doubts and surmises to her acute intelligence and her instinct almost always supplied the right solution but now hilda was gone it was hilda herself i wished to track through the labyrinth of the world i could expect no assistance in tracking her from hilda  let me think i said to myself over a reflective pipe with feet poised on the fender how would hilda herself have approached this problem imagine im hilda i must try to strike a trail by applying her own methods to her own character she would have attacked the question no doubthere i eyed my pipe wiselyfrom the psychological side she would have asked herselfi stroked my chinwhat such a temperament as hers was likely to do under suchandsuch circumstances and she would have answered it aright but theni puffed away once or twiceshe is hilda  when i came to reconnoitre the matter in this light i became at once aware how great a gulf separated the clumsy male intelligence from the immediate and almost unerring intuitions of a clever woman i am considered no fool in my own profession i may venture to say i was sebastians favourite pupil yet though i asked myself over and over again where hilda would be likely to gocanada china australiaas the outcome of her character in these given conditions i got no answer i stared at the fire and reflected i smoked two successive pipes and shook out the ashes let me consider how hildas temperament would work i said looking sagacious i said it several timesbut there i stuck i went no further the solution would not come i felt that in order to play hildas part it was necessary first to have hildas headpiece not every man can bend the bow of ulysses  as i turned the problem over in my mind however one phrase at last came back to mea phrase which hilda herself had let fall when we were debating a very similar point about poor hugo le geyt if i were in his place what do you think i would dowhy hide myself at once in the greenest recesses of our carnarvonshire mountains  she must have gone to wales then i had her own authority for saying so and yetwales wales i pulled myself up with a jerk in that case how did she come to be passing by basingstoke  was the postmark a blind had she hired someone to take the letter somewhere for her on purpose to put me off on a false track i could hardly think so besides the time was against it i saw hilda at nathaniels in the morning the very same evening i received the envelope with the basingstoke postmark  if i were in his place yes true but now i come to think on it were the positions really parallel hilda was not flying for her life from justice she was only endeavouring to escape sebastianand myself the instances she had quoted of the mountaineers curious homing instinctthe wild yearning he feels at moments of great straits to bury himself among the nooks of his native hillswere they not all instances of murderers pursued by the police it was abject terror that drove these men to their burrows but hilda was not a murderer she was not dogged by remorse despair or the myrmidons of the law it was murder she was avoiding not the punishment of murder that made of course an obvious difference irrevocably far from london she said wales is a suburb i gave up the idea that it was likely to prove her place of refuge from the two men she was bent on escaping hongkong after all seemed more probable than llanberis  that first failure gave me a clue however as to the best way of applying hildas own methods what would such a person do under the circumstances that was her way of putting the question clearly then i must first decide what were the circumstances was sebastian speaking the truth was hilda wade or was she not the daughter of the supposed murderer dr yorkebannerman  i looked up as much of the case as i could in unobtrusive ways among the old lawreports and found that the barrister who had had charge of the defence was my fathers old friend mr horace mayfield a man of elegant tastes and the means to gratify them  i went to call on him on sunday evening at his artistically luxurious house in onslow gardens a sedate footman answered the bell fortunately mr mayfield was at home and what is rarer disengaged you do not always find a successful qc at his ease among his books beneath the electric light ready to give up a vacant hour to friendly colloquy  remember yorkebannermans case he said a huge smile breaking slowly like a wave over his genial fat facehorace mayfield resembles a great goodhumoured toad with bland manners and a capacious double chini should just say i did bless my soulwhy yes he beamed i was yorkebannermans counsel excellent fellow yorkebannermanmost unfortunate end thoughprecious clever chap too had an astounding memory recollected every symptom of every patient he ever attended and such an eye diagnosis it was clairvoyance a giftno less knew what was the matter with you the moment he looked at you  that sounded like hilda the same surprising power of recalling facts the same keen faculty for interpreting character or the signs of feeling he poisoned somebody i believe i murmured casually an uncle of his or something  mayfields great squat face wrinkled the double chin folding down on the neck became more ostentatiously double than ever well i cant admit that he said in his suave voice twirling the string of his eyeglass i was yorkebannermans advocate you see and therefore i was paid not to admit it besides he was a friend of mine and i always liked him but i will allow that the case did look a trifle black against him  ha looked black did it i faltered  the judicious barrister shrugged his shoulders a genial smile spread oilily once more over his smooth face none of my business to say so he answered puckering the corners of his eyes still it was a long time ago and the circumstances certainly were suspicious perhaps on the whole hubert it was just as well the poor fellow died before the trial came off otherwisehe pouted his lipsi might have had my work cut out to save him and he eyed the blue china gods on the mantelpiece affectionately  i believe the crown urged money as the motive i suggested  mayfield glanced inquiry at me now why do you want to know all this he asked in a suspicious voice coming back from his dragons it is irregular very to worm information out of an innocent barrister in his hours of ease about a former client we are a guileless race we lawyers dont abuse our confidence  he seemed an honest man i thought in spite of his mocking tone i trusted him and made a clean breast of it i believe i answered with an impressive little pause i want to marry yorkebannermans daughter  he gave a quick start what maisie he exclaimed  i shook my head no no that is not the name i replied  he hesitated a moment but there is no other he hazarded cautiously at last i knew the family  i am not sure of it i went on i have merely my suspicions i am in love with a girl and something about her makes me think she is probably a yorkebannerman  but my dear hubert if that is so the great lawyer went on waving me off with one fat hand it must be at once apparent to you that i am the last person on earth to whom you ought to apply for information remember my oath the practice of our clan the seal of secrecy  i was frank once more i do not know whether the lady i mean is or is not yorkebannermans daughter i persisted she may be and she may not she gives another namethats certain but whether she is or isnt one thing i knowi mean to marry her i believe in her i trust her i only seek to gain this information now because i dont know where she isand i want to track her  he crossed his big hands with an air of christian resignation and looked up at the panels of the coffered ceiling in that he answered i may honestly say i cant help you humbug apart i have not known mrs yorkebannermans addressor maisies eitherever since my poor friends death prudent woman mrs yorkebannerman she went away i believe to somewhere in north wales and afterwards to brittany but she probably changed her name andshe did not confide in me  i went on to ask him a few questions about the case premising that i did so in the most friendly spirit oh i can only tell you what is publicly known he answered beaming with the usual professional pretence of the most sphinxlike reticence but the plain facts as universally admitted were these i break no confidence yorkebannerman had a rich uncle from whom he had expectationsa certain admiral scott prideaux this uncle had lately made a will in yorkebannermans favour but he was a cantankerous old chapnaval you know autocraticcrustygiven to changing his mind with each change of the wind and easily offended by his relationsthe sort of cheerful old party who makes a new will once every month disinheriting the nephew he last dined with well one day the admiral was taken ill at his own house and yorkebannerman attended him our contention wasi speak now as my old friends counselthat scott prideaux getting as tired of life as we were all tired of him and weary of this recurrent worry of willmaking determined at last to clear out for good from a world where he was so little appreciated and therefore tried to poison himself  with aconitine i suggested eagerly  unfortunately yes he made use of aconitine for that otherwise laudable purpose now as ill luck would have itmayfields wrinkles deepenedyorkebannerman and sebastian then two rising doctors engaged in physiological researches together had just been occupied in experimenting upon this very drugtesting the use of aconitine indeed you will no doubt rememberhe crossed his fat hands again comfortablyit was these precise researches on a then littleknown poison that first brought sebastian prominently before the public what was the consequence his smooth persuasive voice flowed on as if i were a concentrated jury the admiral grew rapidly worse and insisted upon calling in a second opinion no doubt he didnt like the aconitine when it came to the pinchfor it does pinch i can tell youand repented him of his evil yorkebannerman suggested sebastian as the second opinion the uncle acquiesced sebastian was called in and of course being fresh from his researches immediately recognised the symptoms of aconitine poisoning  what sebastian found it out i cried starting  oh yes sebastian he watched the case from that point to the end and the oddest part of it all was thisthat though he communicated with the police and himself prepared every morsel of food that the poor old admiral took from that moment forth the symptoms continually increased in severity the police contention was that yorkebannerman somehow managed to put the stuff into the milk beforehand my own theory wasas counsel for the accusedhe blinked his fat eyesthat old prideaux had concealed a large quantity of aconitine in the bed before his illness and went on taking it from time to timejust to spite his nephew  and you believe that mr mayfield  the broad smile broke concentrically in ripples over the great lawyers face his smile was mayfields main feature he shrugged his shoulders and expanded his big hands wide open before him my dear hubert he said with a most humorous expression of countenance you are a professional man yourself therefore you know that every profession has its own little courtesiesits own small fictions i was yorkebannermans counsel as well as his friend tis a point of honour with us that no barrister will ever admit a doubt as to a clients innocenceis he not paid to maintain itand to my dying day i will constantly maintain that old prideaux poisoned himself maintain it with that dogged and meaningless obstinacy with which we always cling to whatever is least provable oh yes he poisoned himself and yorkebannerman was innocent but still you know it was the sort of case where an acute lawyer with a reputation to make would prefer to be for the crown rather than for the prisoner  but it was never tried i ejaculated  no happily for us it was never tried fortune favoured us yorkebannerman had a weak heart a conveniently weak heart which the inquest sorely affected and besides he was deeply angry at what he persisted in calling sebastians defection he evidently thought sebastian ought to have stood by him his colleague preferred the claims of public dutyas he understood them i meanto those of private friendship it was a very sad casefor yorkebannerman was really a charming fellow but i confess i was relieved when he died unexpectedly on the morning of his arrest it took off my shoulders a most serious burden  you think then the case would have gone against him  my dear hubert his whole face puckered with an indulgent smile of course the case must have gone against us juries are fools but they are not such fools as to swallow everythinglike ostriches to let me throw dust in their eyes about so plain an issue consider the facts consider them impartially yorkebannerman had easy access to aconitine had whole ounces of it in his possession he treated the uncle from whom he was to inherit he was in temporary embarrassmentsthat came out at the inquest it was known that the admiral had just made a twentythird will in his favour and that the admirals wills were liable to alteration every time a nephew ventured upon an opinion in politics religion science navigation or the right card at whist differing by a shade from that of the uncle the admiral died of aconitine poisoning and sebastian observed and detailed the symptoms could anything be plaineri mean could any combination of fortuitous circumstanceshe blinked pleasantly againbe more adverse to an advocate sincerely convinced of his clients innocenceas a professional duty and he gazed at me comically  the more he piled up the case against the man who i now felt sure was hildas father the less did i believe him a dark conspiracy seemed to loom up in the background has it ever occurred to you i asked at last in a very tentative tone that perhapsi throw out the hint as the merest suggestionperhaps it may have been sebastian who  he smiled this time till i thought his smile would swallow him  if yorkebannerman had not been my client he mused aloud i might have been inclined to suspect rather that sebastian aided him to avoid justice by giving him something violent to take if he wished it something which might accelerate the inevitable action of the heartdisease from which he was suffering isnt that more likely  i saw there was nothing further to be got out of mayfield his opinion was fixed he was a placid ruminant but he had given me already much food for thought i thanked him for his assistance and returned on foot to my rooms at the hospital  i was now however in a somewhat different position for tracking hilda from that which i occupied before my interview with the famous counsel i felt certain by this time that hilda wade and maisie yorkebannerman were one and the same person to be sure it gave me a twinge to think that hilda should be masquerading under an assumed name but i waived that question for the moment and awaited her explanations the great point now was to find hilda she was flying from sebastian to mature a new plan but whither i proceeded to argue it out on her own principles oh how lamely the world is still so big mauritius the argentine british columbia new zealand  the letter i had received bore the basingstoke postmark now a person may be passing basingstoke on his way either to southampton or plymouth both of which are ports of embarcation for various foreign countries i attached importance to that clue something about the tone of hildas letter made me realise that she intended to put the sea between us in concluding so much i felt sure i was not mistaken hilda had too big and too cosmopolitan a mind to speak of being irrevocably far from london if she were only going to some town in england or even to normandy or the channel islands irrevocably far pointed rather to a destination outside europe altogetherto india africa america not to jersey dieppe or saintmalo  was it southampton or plymouth to which she was first boundthat was the next question i inclined to southampton for the sprawling lines so different from her usual neat hand were written hurriedly in a train i could see and on consulting bradshaw i found that the plymouth expresses stop longest at salisbury where hilda would therefore have been likely to post her note if she were going to the far west while some of the southampton trains stop at basingstoke which is indeed the most convenient point on that route for sending off a letter this was mere blind guesswork to be sure compared with hildas immediate and unerring intuition but it had some probability in its favour at any rate try both of the two she was likelier to be going to southampton  my next move was to consult the list of outgoing steamers hilda had left london on a saturday morning now on alternate saturdays the steamers of the castle line sail from southampton where they call to take up passengers and mails was this one of those alternate saturdays i looked at the list of dates it was that told further in favour of southampton but did any steamer of any passenger line sail from plymouth on the same day none that i could find or from southampton elsewhere i looked them all up the royal mail companys boats start on wednesdays the north german lloyds on wednesdays and sundays those were the only likely vessels i could discover either then i concluded hilda meant to sail on saturday by the castle line for south africa or else on sunday by north german lloyd for some part of america  how i longed for one hour of hilda to help me out with her almost infallible instinct i realised how feeble and fallacious was my own groping in the dark her knowledge of temperament would have revealed to her at once what i was trying to discover like the police she despised by the clumsy clues which so roused her sarcasm  however i went to bed and slept on it next morning i determined to set out for southampton on a tour of inquiry to all the steamboat agencies if that failed i could go on to plymouth  but as chance would have it the morning post brought me an unexpected letter which helped me not a little in unravelling the problem it was a crumpled letter written on rather soiled paper in an uneducated hand and it bore like hildas the basingstoke postmark   charlotte churtwood sends her duty to dr cumberledge it said with somewhat uncertain spelling and i am very sorry that i was not able to post the letter to you in london as the lady ast me but after her train ad left has i was stepping into mine the ingine started and i was knocked down and badly hurt and the lady gave me a halfsovering to post it in london has soon as i got there but bein unable to do so i now return it dear sir not knowing the ladys name and adress she having trusted me through seeing me on the platform and perhaps you can send it back to her and was very sorry i could not post it were she ast me but time bein an objeck put it in the box in basingstoke station and now inclose post office order for ten shillings whitch dear sir kindly let the young lady have from your obedient servant  charlotte churtwood   in the corner was the address 11 chubbs cottages basingstoke  the happy accident of this letter advanced things for me greatlythough it also made me feel how dependent i was upon happy accidents where hilda would have guessed right at once by mere knowledge of character still the letter explained many things which had hitherto puzzled me i had felt not a little surprise that hilda wishing to withdraw from me and leave no traces should have sent off her farewell letter from basingstokeso as to let me see at once in what direction she was travelling nay i even wondered at times whether she had really posted it herself at basingstoke or given it to somebody who chanced to be going there to post for her as a blind but i did not think she would deliberately deceive me and in my opinion to get a letter posted at basingstoke would be deliberate deception while to get it posted in london was mere vague precaution i understood now that she had written it in the train and then picked out a likely person as she passed to take it to waterloo for her  of course i went straight down to basingstoke and called at once at chubbs cottages it was a squalid little row on the outskirts of the town i found charlotte churtwood herself exactly such a girl as hilda with her quick judgment of character might have hit upon for such a purpose she was a conspicuously honest and transparent country servant of the lumpy type on her way to london to take a place as housemaid her injuries were severe but not dangerous the lady saw me on the platform she said and beckoned to me to come to her she ast me where i was going and i says to london miss says she smiling kindlike could you post a letter for me certain sure says i you can depend upon me an then she give me the arfsovering an says says she mind its very partickler if the gentleman dont get it ell fret is eart out an through aving a young man o my own as is a groom at andover o course i understood er sir an then feeling all full of it as yu may say what with the arfsovering and what with one thing and what with another an all of a fluster with not being used to travelling i run up when the train for london come in an tried to scramble into it afore it ad quite stopped moving an a guard e rushes up an stand back says e wait till the train stops says e an waves his red flag at me but afore i could stand back with one foot on the step the train sort of jumped away from me and knocked me down like this and they say itll be a week now afore im well enough to go on to london but i posted the letter all the same at basingstoke station as they was carrying me off an i took down the address so as to return the arfsovering hilda was right as always she had chosen instinctively the trustworthy personchosen her at first sight and hit the bullseye  do you know what train the lady was in i asked as she paused where was it going did you notice  it was the southampton train sir i saw the board on the carriage  that settled the question you are a good and an honest girl i said pulling out my purse and you came to this misfortune through tryingtoo eagerlyto help the young lady a tenpound note is not overmuch as compensation for your accident take it and get well i should be sorry to think you lost a good place through your anxiety to help us  the rest of my way was plain sailing now i hurried on straight to southampton there my first visit was to the office of the castle line i went to the point at once was there a miss wade among the passengers by the dunottar castle  no nobody of that name on the list  had any lady taken a passage at the last moment  the clerk perpended yes a lady had come by the mail train from london with no heavy baggage and had gone on board direct taking what cabin she could get a young lady in grey quite unprepared gave no name called away in a hurry  what sort of lady  youngish goodlooking brown hair and eyes the clerk thought a sort of creamy skin and awell a mesmeric kind of glance that seemed to go right through you  that will do i answered sure now of my quarry to which port did she book  to cape town  very well i said promptly you may reserve me a good berth in the next outgoing steamer  it was just like hildas impulsive character to rush off in this way at a moments notice and just like mine to follow her but it piqued me a little to think that but for the accident of an accident i might never have tracked her down if the letter had been posted in london as she intended and not at basingstoke i might have sought in vain for her from then till doomsday  ten days later i was afloat on the channel bound for south africa  i always admired hildas astonishing insight into character and motive but i never admired it quite so profoundly as on the glorious day when we arrived at cape town i was standing on deck looking out for the first time in my life on that tremendous viewthe steep and massive bulk of table mountaina mere lump of rock dropped loose from the sky with the long white town spread gleaming at its base and the silvertree plantations that cling to its lower slopes and merge by degrees into gardens and vineyardswhen a messenger from the shore came up to me tentatively  dr cumberledge he said in an inquiring tone  i nodded that is my name  i have a letter for you sir  i took it in great surprise who on earth in cape town could have known i was coming i had not a friend to my knowledge in the colony i glanced at the envelope my wonder deepened that prescient brain it was hildas handwriting  i tore it open and read   my dear huberti know you will come i know you will follow me so i am leaving this letter at donald currie  cos office giving their agent instructions to hand it to you as soon as you reach cape town i am quite sure you will track me so far at least i understand your temperament but i beg you i implore you to go no further you will ruin my plan if you do and i still adhere to it it is good of you to come so far i cannot blame you for that i know your motives but do not try to find me out i warn you beforehand it will be quite useless i have made up my mind i have an object in life and dear as you are to methat i will not pretend to denyi can never allow even you to interfere with it so be warned in time go back quietly by the next steamer  your ever attached and grateful  hilda   i read it twice through with a little thrill of joy did any man ever court so strange a love her very strangeness drew me but go back by the next steamer i felt sure of one thing hilda was far too good a judge of character to believe that i was likely to obey that mandate  i will not trouble you with the remaining stages of my quest except for the slowness of south african mail coaches they were comparatively easy it is not so hard to track strangers in cape town as strangers in london i followed hilda to her hotel and from her hotel up country stage after stagejolted by rail worse jolted by mulewaggoninquiring inquiring inquiringtill i learned at last she was somewhere in rhodesia  that is a big address but it does not cover as many names as it covers square miles in time i found her still it took time and before we met hilda had had leisure to settle down quietly to her new existence people in rhodesia had noted her coming as a new portent because of one strange peculiarity she was the only woman of means who had ever gone up of her own free will to rhodesia other women had gone there to accompany their husbands or to earn their livings but that a lady should freely select that halfbaked land as a place of residencea lady of position with all the world before her where to choosethat puzzled the rhodesians so she was a marked person most people solved the vexed problem indeed by suggesting that she had designs against the stern celibacy of a leading south african politician depend upon it they said its rhodes shes after the moment i arrived at salisbury and stated my object in coming all the world in the new town was ready to assist me the lady was to be found vaguely speaking on a young farm to the northa budding farm whose general direction was expansively indicated to me by a wave of the arm with south african uncertainty  i bought a pony at salisburya pretty little seasoned sorrel mareand set out to find hilda my way lay over a brandnew road or what passes for a road in south africavery soft and lumpy like an english carttrack i am a fair crosscountry rider in our own midlands but i never rode a more tedious journey than that one i had crawled several miles under a blazing sun along the shadeless new track on my african pony when to my surprise i saw of all sights in the world a bicycle coming towards me  i could hardly believe my eyes civilisation indeed a bicycle in these remotest wilds of africa  i had been picking my way for some hours through a desolate plateauthe high veldtabout five thousand feet above the sea level and entirely treeless in places to be sure a few low bushes of prickly aspect rose in tangled clumps but for the most part the arid tableland was covered by a thick growth of short brown grass about nine inches high burnt up in the sun and most wearisome to look at the distressing nakedness of a new country confronted me here and there a bald farm or two had been literally pegged outthe pegs were almost all one saw of them as yet the fields were in the future here and there again a scattered range of low granite hills known locally as kopjesred rocky prominences flaunting in the sunshinediversified the distance but the road itself such as it was lay all on the high plain looking down now and again into gorges or kloofs wooded on their slopes with scrubby trees and comparatively wellwatered in the midst of all this crude unfinished land the mere sight of a bicycle bumping over the rubbly road was a sufficient surprise but my astonishment reached a climax when i saw as it drew near that it was ridden by a woman  one moment later i had burst into a wild cry and rode forward to her hurriedly hilda i shouted aloud in my excitement hilda  she stepped lightly from her pedals as if it had been in the park head erect and proud eyes liquid lustrous i dismounted trembling and stood beside her in the wild joy of the moment for the first time in my life i kissed her fervently hilda took the kiss unreproving she did not attempt to refuse me  so you have come at last she murmured with a glow on her face half nestling towards me half withdrawing as if two wills tore her in different directions i have been expecting you for some days and somehow today i was almost certain you were coming  then you are not angry with me i cried you remember you forbade me  angry with you dear hubert could i ever be angry with you especially for thus showing me your devotion and your trust i am never angry with you when one knows one understands i have thought of you so often sometimes alone here in this raw new land i have longed for you to come it is inconsistent of me of course but i am so solitary so lonely  and yet you begged me not to follow you  she looked up at me shylyi was not accustomed to see hilda shy her eyes gazed deep into mine beneath the long soft lashes i begged you not to follow me she repeated a strange gladness in her tone yes dear hubert i begged youand i meant it cannot you understand that sometimes one hopes a thing may never happenand is supremely happy because it happens in spite of one i have a purpose in life for which i live i live for it still for its sake i told you you must not come to me yet you have come against my orders and she paused and drew a deep sighoh hubert i thank you for daring to disobey me  i clasped her to my bosom she allowed me half resisting i am too weak she murmured only this morning i made up my mind that when i saw you i would implore you to return at once and now that you are here she laid her little hand confidingly in minesee how foolish i ami cannot dismiss you  which means to say hilda that after all you are still a woman  a woman oh yes very much a woman hubert i love you i half wish i did not  why darling i drew her to me  becauseif i did not i could send you awayso easily as it isi cannot let you stopand i cannot dismiss you  then divide it i cried gaily do neither come away with me  no no nor that either i will not stultify my whole past life i will not dishonour my dear fathers memory  i looked around for something to which to tether my horse a bridle is in ones waywhen one has to discuss important business there was really nothing about that seemed fit for the purpose hilda saw what i sought and pointed mutely to a stunted bush beside a big granite boulder which rose abruptly from the dead level of the grass affording a little shade from that sweltering sunlight i tied my mare to the gnarled rootit was the only part big enoughand sat down by hildas side under the shadow of a great rock in a thirsty land i realised at that moment the force and appropriateness of the psalmists simile the sun beat fiercely on the seeding grasses away on the southern horizon we could faintly perceive the floating yellow haze of the prairie fires lit by the mashonas  then you knew i would come i began as she seated herself on the burntup herbage while my hand stole into hers to nestle there naturally  she pressed it in return oh yes i knew you would come she answered with that strange ring of confidence in her voice of course you got my letter at cape town  i did hildaand i wondered at you more than ever as i read it but if you knew i would come why write to prevent me  her eyes had their mysterious faraway air she looked out upon infinity well i wanted to do my best to turn you aside she said slowly one must always do ones best even when one feels and believes it is useless that surely is the first clause in a doctors or a nurses rubric  but why didnt you want me to come i persisted why fight against your own heart hilda i am surei know you love me  her bosom rose and fell her eyes dilated love you she cried looking away over the bushy ridges as if afraid to trust herself oh yes hubert i love you it is not for that that i wish to avoid you or rather it is just because of that i cannot endure to spoil your lifeby a fruitless affection  why fruitless i asked leaning forward  she crossed her hands resignedly you know all by this time she answered sebastian would tell you of course when you went to announce that you were leaving nathaniels he could not do otherwise it is the outcome of his temperamentan integral part of his nature  hilda i cried you are a witch how could you know that i cant imagine  she smiled her restrained chaldean smile because i know sebastian she answered quietly i can read that man to the core he is simple as a book his composition is plain straightforward quite natural uniform there are no twists and turns in him once learn the key and it discloses everything like an open sesame he has a gigantic intellect a burning thirst for knowledge one love one hobbyscience and no moral instincts he goes straight for his ends and whatever comes in his way she dug her little heel in the brown soil he tramples on it as ruthlessly as a child will trample on a worm or a beetle  and yet i said he is so great  yes great i grant you but the easiest character to unravel that i have ever met it is calm austere unbending yet not in the least degree complex he has the impassioned temperament pushed to its highest pitch the temperament that runs deep with irresistible force but the passion that inspires him that carries him away headlong as love carries some men is a rare and abstract onethe passion of science  i gazed at her as she spoke with a feeling akin to awe it must destroy the plotinterest of life for you hilda i criedout there in the vast void of that wild african plateauto foresee so well what each person will dohow each will act under such given circumstances  she pulled a bent of grass and plucked off its dry spikelets one by one perhaps so she answered after a meditative pause though of course all natures are not equally simple only with great souls can you be sure beforehand like that for good or for evil it is essential to anything worth calling character that one should be able to predict in what way it will act under given circumstancesto feel certain this man will do nothing small or mean that one could never act dishonestly or speak deceitfully but smaller natures are more complex they defy analysis because their motives are not consistent  most people think to be complex is to be great i objected  she shook her head that is quite a mistake she answered great natures are simple and relatively predictable since their motives balance one another justly small natures are complex and hard to predict because small passions small jealousies small discords and perturbations come in at all moments and override for a time the permanent underlying factors of character great natures good or bad are equably poised small natures let petty motives intervene to upset their balance  then you knew i would come i exclaimed half pleased to find i belonged inferentially to her higher category  her eyes beamed on me with a beautiful light knew you would come oh yes i begged you not to come but i felt sure you were too deeply in earnest to obey me i asked a friend in cape town to telegraph your arrival and almost ever since the telegram reached me i have been expecting you and awaiting you  so you believed in me  implicitlyas you in me that is the worst of it hubert if you did not believe in me i could have told you alland then you would have left me but as it is you know alland yet you want to cling to me  you know i know allbecause sebastian told me  yes and i think i even know how you answered him  how  she paused the calm smile lighted up her face once more then she drew out a pencil you think life must lack plotinterest for me she began slowly because with certain natures i can partially guess beforehand what is coming but have you not observed that in reading a novel part of the pleasure you feel arises from your conscious anticipation of the end and your satisfaction in seeing that you anticipated correctly or part sometimes from the occasional unexpectedness of the real denouement well life is like that i enjoy observing my successes and in a way my failures let me show you what i mean i think i know what you said to sebastiannot the words of course but the purport and i will write it down now for you set down your version too and then we will compare them  it was a crucial test we both wrote for a minute or two somehow in hildas presence i forgot at once the strangeness of the scene the weird oddity of the moment that sombre plain disappeared for me i was only aware that i was with hilda once moreand therefore in paradise pison and gihon watered the desolate land whatever she did seemed to me supremely right if she had proposed to me to begin a ponderous work on medical jurisprudence under the shadow of the big rock i should have begun it incontinently  she handed me her slip of paper i took it and read sebastian told you i was dr yorkebannermans daughter and you answered if so yorkebannerman was innocent and you are the poisoner is not that correct  i handed her in answer my own paper she read it with a faint flush when she came to the words either she is not yorkebannermans daughter or else yorkebannerman was not a poisoner and someone else wasi might put a name to him she rose to her feet with a great rush of longsuppressed feeling and clasped me passionately my hubert she cried i read you aright i knew it i was sure of you  i folded her in my arms there on the rustyred south african desert then hilda dear i murmured you will consent to marry me  the words brought her back to herself she unfolded my arms with slow reluctance no dearest she said earnestly with a face where pride fought hard against love that is why above all things i did not want you to follow me i love you i trust you you love me you trust me but i never will marry anyone till i have succeeded in clearing my fathers memory i know he did not do it i know sebastian did but that is not enough i must prove it i must prove it  i believe it already i answered what need then to prove it  to you hubert oh no not to you there i am safe but to the world that condemned himcondemned him untried i must vindicate him i must clear him  i bent my face close to hers but may i not marry you first i askedand after that i can help you to clear him  she gazed at me fearlessly no no she cried clasping her hands much as i love you dear hubert i cannot consent to it i am too proudtoo proud i will not allow the world to saynot even to say falselyher face flushed crimson her voice dropped lowi will not allow them to say those hateful words he married a murderers daughter  i bowed my head as you will my darling i answered i am content to wait i trust you in this too some day we will prove it  and all this time preoccupied as i was with these deeper concerns i had not even asked where hilda lived or what she was doing    chapter vii  the episode of the stone that looked about it   hilda took me back with her to the embryo farm where she had pitched her tent for the moment a rough wild place it lay close to the main road from salisbury to chimoio  setting aside the inevitable rawness and newness of all things rhodesian however the situation itself was not wholly unpicturesque a ramping rock or tor of granite which i should judge at a rough guess to extend to an acre in size sprang abruptly from the brown grass of the upland plain it rose like a huge boulder its summit was crowned by the covered grave of some old kaffir chiefa rude cairn of big stones under a thatched awning at the foot of this jagged and cleft rock the farmhouse nestledfour square walls of wattleanddaub sheltered by its mass from the sweeping winds of the south african plateau a stream brought water from a spring close by in front of the houserare sight in that thirsty landspread a garden of flowers it was an oasis in the desert but the desert itself stretched grimly all round i could never quite decide how far the oasis was caused by the water from the spring and how far by hildas presence  then you live here i cried gazing roundmy voice i suppose betraying my latent sense of the unworthiness of the position  for the present hilda answered smiling you know hubert i have no abiding city anywhere till my purpose is fulfilled i came here because rhodesia seemed the farthest spot on earth where a white woman just now could safely penetratein order to get away from you and sebastian  that is an unkind conjunction i exclaimed reddening  but i mean it she answered with a wayward little nod i wanted breathingspace to form fresh plans i wanted to get clear away for a time from all who knew me and this promised best but nowadays really one is never safe from intrusion anywhere  you are cruel hilda  oh no you deserve it i asked you not to comeand you came in spite of me i have treated you very nicely under the circumstances i think i have behaved like an angel the question is now what ought i to do next you have upset my plans so  upset your plans how  dear hubertshe turned to me with an indulgent smilefor a clever man you are really too foolish cant you see that you have betrayed my whereabouts to sebastian i crept away secretly like a thief in the night giving no name or place and having the world to ransack he might have found it hard to track me for he had not your clue of the basingstoke letternor your reason for seeking me but now that you have followed me openly with your name blazoned forth in the companys passengerlists and your traces left plain in hotels and stages across the map of south africawhy the spoor is easy if sebastian cares to find us he can follow the scent all through without trouble  i never thought of that i cried aghast  she was forbearance itself no i knew you would never think of it you are a man you see i counted that in i was afraid from the first you would wreck all by following me  i was mutely penitent and yet you forgive me hilda  her eyes beamed tenderness to know all is to forgive all she answered i have to remind you of that so often how can i help forgiving when i know why you camewhat spur it was that drove you but it is the future we have to think of now not the past and i must wait and reflect i have no plan just at present  what are you doing at this farm i gazed round at it dissatisfied  i board here hilda answered amused at my crestfallen face but of course i cannot be idle so i have found work to do i ride out on my bicycle to two or three isolated houses about and give lessons to children in this desolate place who would otherwise grow up ignorant it fills my time and supplies me with something besides myself to think about  and what am i to do i cried oppressed with a sudden sense of helplessness  she laughed at me outright and is this the first moment that that difficulty has occurred to you she asked gaily you have hurried all the way from london to rhodesia without the slightest idea of what you mean to do now you have got here  i laughed at myself in turn upon my word hilda i cried i set out to find you beyond the desire to find you i had no plan in my head that was an end in itself my thoughts went no farther  she gazed at me half saucily then dont you think sir the best thing you can do now you have found me isto turn back and go home again  i am a man i said promptly taking a firm stand and you are a judge of character if you really mean to tell me you think that likelywell i shall have a lower opinion of your insight into men than i have been accustomed to harbour  her smile was not wholly without a touch of triumph  in that case she went on i suppose the only alternative is for you to remain here  that would appear to be logic i replied but what can i do set up in practice  i dont see much opening she answered if you ask my advice i should say there is only one thing to be done in rhodesia just nowturn farmer  it is done i answered with my usual impetuosity since you say the word i am a farmer already i feel an interest in oats that is simply absorbing what steps ought i to take first in my present condition  she looked at me all brown with the dust of my long ride i would suggest she said slowly a good wash and some dinner  hilda i cried surveying my boots or what was visible of them that is really clever of you a wash and some dinner so practical so timely the very thing i will see to it  before night fell i had arranged everything i was to buy the next farm from the owner of the one where hilda lodged i was also to learn the rudiments of south african agriculture from him for a valuable consideration and i was to lodge in his house while my own was building he gave me his views on the cultivation of oats he gave them at some lengthmore length than perspicuity i knew nothing about oats save that they were employed in the manufacture of porridgewhich i detest but i was to be near hilda once more and i was prepared to undertake the superintendence of the oat from its birth to its reaping if only i might be allowed to live so close to hilda  the farmer and his wife were boers but they spoke english mr jan willem klaas himself was a fine specimen of the breedtall erect broadshouldered and genial mrs klaas his wife was mainly suggestive in mind and person of suetpudding there was one prattling little girl of three years old by name sannie a most engaging child and also a chubby baby  you are betrothed of course mrs klaas said to hilda before me with the curious tactlessness of her race when we made our first arrangement  hildas face flushed no we are nothing to one another she answeredwhich was only true formally dr cumberledge had a post at the same hospital in london where i was a nurse and he thought he would like to try rhodesia that is all  mrs klaas gazed from one to other of us suspiciously you english are strange she answered with a complacent little shrug but therefrom europe your ways we know are different  hilda did not attempt to explain it would have been impossible to make the good soul understand her horizon was so simple she was a harmless housewife given mostly to dyspepsia and the care of her little ones hilda had won her heart by unfeigned admiration for the chubby baby to a mother that covers a multitude of eccentricities such as one expects to find in incomprehensible english mrs klaas put up with me because she liked hilda  we spent some months together on klaass farm it was a dreary place save for hilda the bare daubandwattle walls the clumps of misshapen and dusty pricklypears that girt round the thatched huts of the kaffir workpeople the stonepenned sheepkraals and the corrugated iron roof of the bald stable for the waggon oxenall was as crude and ugly as a new country can make things it seemed to me a desecration that hilda should live in such an unfinished landhilda whom i imagined as moving by nature through broad english parks with elizabethan cottages and immemorial oakshilda whose proper atmosphere seemed to be one of coffeecoloured laces ivyclad abbeys lichenincrusted wallsall that is beautiful and gracious in timehonoured civilisations  nevertheless we lived on there in a meaningless sort of wayi hardly knew why to me it was a puzzle when i asked hilda she shook her head with her sibylline air and answered confidently you do not understand sebastian as well as i do we have to wait for him the next move is his till he plays his piece i cannot tell how i may have to checkmate him  so we waited for sebastian to advance a pawn meanwhile i toyed with south african farmingnot very successfully i must admit nature did not design me for growing oats i am no judge of oxen and my views on the feeding of kaffir sheep raised broad smiles on the black faces of my mashona labourers  i still lodged at tant metties as everybody called mrs klaas she was courtesy aunt to the community at large while oom jan willem was its courtesy uncle they were simple homely folk who lived up to their religious principles on an unvaried diet of stewed oxbeef and bread they suffered much from chronic dyspepsia due in part at least no doubt to the monotony of their food their life their interests one could hardly believe one was still in the nineteenth century these people had the calm the local seclusion of the prehistoric epoch for them europe did not exist they knew it merely as a place where settlers came from what the czar intended what the kaiser designed never disturbed their rest a sick ox a rattling tile on the roof meant more to their lives than war in europe the one break in the sameness of their daily routine was family prayers the one weekly event going to church at salisbury still they had a single enthusiasm like everybody else for fifty miles around they believed profoundly in the future of rhodesia when i gazed about me at the raw new landthe weary flat of red soil and brown grassesi felt at least that with a present like that it had need of a future  i am not by disposition a pioneer i belong instinctively to the old civilisations in the midst of rudimentary towns and incipient fields i yearn for grey houses a norman church an english thatched cottage  however for hildas sake i braved it out and continued to learn the a b c of agriculture on an unmade farm with great assiduity from oom jan willem  we had been stopping some months at klaass together when business compelled me one day to ride in to salisbury i had ordered some goods for my farm from england which had at last arrived i had now to arrange for their conveyance from the town to my plot of landa portentous matter just as i was on the point of leaving klaass and was tightening the saddlegirth on my sturdy little pony oom jan willem himself sidled up to me with a mysterious air his broad face all wrinkled with anticipatory pleasure he placed a sixpence in my palm glancing about him on every side as he did so like a conspirator  what am i to buy with it i asked much puzzled and suspecting tobacco tant mettie declared he smoked too much for a church elder  he put his finger to his lips nodded and peered round lollipops for sannie he whispered low at last with a guilty smile buthe glanced about him againgive them to me please when tant mettie isnt looking his nod was all mystery  you may rely on my discretion i replied throwing the timehonoured prejudices of the profession to the winds and well pleased to aid and abet the simpleminded soul in his nefarious designs against little sannies digestive apparatus he patted me on the back peppermint lollipops mind he went on in the same solemn undertone sannie likes them bestpeppermint  i put my foot in the stirrup and vaulted into my saddle they shall not be forgotten i answered with a quiet smile at this pretty little evidence of fatherly feeling i rode off it was early morning before the heat of the day began hilda accompanied me part of the way on her bicycle she was going to the other young farm some eight miles off across the redbrown plateau where she gave lessons daily to the tenyear old daughter of an english settler it was a labour of love for settlers in rhodesia cannot afford to pay for what are beautifully described as finishing governesses but hilda was of the sort who cannot eat the bread of idleness she had to justify herself to her kind by finding some work to do which should vindicate her existence  i parted from her at a point on the monotonous plain where one rubbly road branched off from another then i jogged on in the full morning sun over that scorching plain of loose red sand all the way to salisbury not a green leaf or a fresh flower anywhere the eye ached at the hot glare of the reflected sunlight from the sandy level  my business detained me several hours in the halfbuilt town with its flaunting stores and its rough new offices it was not till towards afternoon that i could get away again on my sorrel across the blazing plain once more to klaass  i moved on over the plateau at an easy trot full of thoughts of hilda what could be the step she expected sebastian to take next she did not know herself she had told me there her faculty failed her but some step he would take and till he took it she must rest and be watchful  i passed the great tree that stands up like an obelisk in the midst of the plain beyond the deserted matabele village i passed the low clumps of dry karroobushes by the rocky kopje i passed the fork of the rubbly roads where i had parted from hilda at last i reached the long rolling ridge which looks down upon klaass and could see in the slant sunlight the mud farmhouse and the corrugated iron roof where the oxen were stabled  the place looked more deserted more deadalive than ever not a black boy moved in it even the cattle and kaffir sheep were nowhere to be seen but then it was always quiet and perhaps i noticed the obtrusive air of solitude and sleepiness even more than usual because i had just returned from salisbury all things are comparative after the lost loneliness of klaass farm even brandnew salisbury seemed busy and bustling  i hurried on ill at ease but tant mettie would doubtless have a cup of tea ready for me as soon as i arrived and hilda would be waiting at the gate to welcome me  i reached the stone enclosure and passed up through the flowergarden to my great surprise hilda was not there as a rule she came to meet me with her sunny smile but perhaps she was tired or the sun on the road might have given her a headache i dismounted from my mare and called one of the kaffir boys to take her to the stable nobody answered i called again still silence i tied her up to the post and strode over to the door astonished at the solitude i began to feel there was something weird and uncanny about this homecoming never before had i known klaass so entirely deserted  i lifted the latch and opened the door it gave access at once to the single plain livingroom there all was huddled for a moment my eyes hardly took in the truth there are sights so sickening that the brain at the first shock wholly fails to realise them  on the stone slab floor of the low livingroom tant mettie lay dead her body was pierced through by innumerable thrusts which i somehow instinctively recognised as assegai wounds by her side lay sannie the little prattling girl of three my constant playmate whom i had instructed in catscradle and taught the tales of cinderella and red riding hood my hand grasped the lollipops in my pocket convulsively she would never need them nobody else was about what had become of oom jan willemand the baby  i wandered out into the yard sick with the sight i had already seen there oom jan willem himself lay stretched at full length a bullet had pierced his left temple his body was also riddled through with assegai thrusts  i saw at once what this meant a rising of the matabele  i had come back from salisbury unknowing it into the midst of a revolt of bloodthirsty savages  yet even if i had known i must still have hurried home with all speed to klaassto protect hilda  hilda where was hilda a breathless sinking crept over me  i staggered out into the open it was impossible to say what horror might not have happened the matabele might even now be lurking about the kraalfor the bodies were hardly cold but hilda hilda whatever came i must find hilda  fortunately i had my loaded revolver in my belt though we had not in the least anticipated this sudden revoltit broke like a thunderclap from a clear skythe unsettled state of the country made even women go armed about their daily avocations  i strode on half maddened beside the great block of granite which sheltered the farm there rose one of those rocky little hillocks of loose boulders which are locally known in south africa by the dutch name of kopjes i looked out upon it drearily its round brown ironstones lay piled irregularly together almost as if placed there in some earlier age by the mighty hands of prehistoric giants my gaze on it was blank i was thinking not of it but of hilda hilda  i called the name aloud hilda hilda hilda  as i called to my immense surprise one of the smooth round boulders on the hillside seemed slowly to uncurl and to peer about it cautiously then it raised itself in the slant sunlight put a hand to its eyes and gazed out upon me with a human face for a moment after that it descended step by step among the other stones with a white object in its arms as the boulder uncurled and came to life i was aware by degrees yes yes it was hilda with tant metties baby  in the fierce joy of that discovery i rushed forward to her trembling and clasped her in my arms i could find no words but hilda hilda  are they gone she asked staring about her with a terrified air though still strangely preserving her wonted composure of manner  who gone the matabele  yes yes  did you see them hilda  for a momentwith black shields and assegais all shouting madly you have been to the house hubert you know what has happened  yes yes i knowa rising they have massacred the klaases  she nodded i came back on my bicycle and when i opened the door found tant mettie and little sannie dead poor sweet little sannie oom jan was lying shot in the yard outside i saw the cradle overturned and looked under it for the baby they did not kill herperhaps did not notice her i caught her up in my arms and rushed out to my machine thinking to make for salisbury and give the alarm to the men there one must try to save othersand you were coming hubert then i heard horses hoofsthe matabele returning they dashed back mountedstolen horses from other farmsthey have taken poor oom jansand they have gone on shouting to murder elsewhere i flung down my machine among the bushes as they camei hope they have not seen itand i crouched here between the boulders with the baby in my arms trusting for protection to the colour of my dress which is just like the ironstone  it is a perfect deception i answered admiring her instinctive cleverness even then i never so much as noticed you  no nor the matabele either for all their sharp eyes they passed by without stopping i clasped the baby hard and tried to keep it from cryingif it had cried all would have been lost but they passed just below and swept on toward rozenbooms i lay still for a while not daring to look out then i raised myself warily and tried to listen just at that moment i heard a horses hoofs ring out once more i couldnt tell of course whether it was you returning or one of the matabele left behind by the others so i crouched again thank god you are safe hubert  all this took a moment to say or was less said than hinted now what must we do i cried bolt back again to salisbury  it is the only thing possibleif my machine is unhurt they may have taken it or ridden over and broken it  we went down to the spot and picked it up where it lay halfconcealed among the brittle dry scrub of milkbushes i examined the bearings carefully though there were hoofmarks close by it had received no hurt i blew up the tire which was somewhat flabby and went on to untie my sturdy pony the moment i looked at her i saw the poor little brute was wearied out with her two long rides in the sweltering sun her flanks quivered it is no use i cried patting her as she turned to me with appealing eyes that asked for water she cant go back as far as salisbury at least till she has had a feed of corn and a drink even then it will be rough on her  give her bread hilda suggested that will hearten her more than corn there is plenty in the house tant mettie baked this morning  i crept in reluctantly to fetch it i also brought out from the dresser a few raw eggs to break into a tumbler and swallow whole for hilda and i needed food almost as sorely as the poor beast herself there was something gruesome in thus rummaging about for bread and meat in the dead womans cupboard while she herself lay there on the floor but one never realises how one will act in these great emergencies until they come upon one hilda still calm with unearthly calmness took a couple of loaves from my hand and began feeding the pony with them go and draw water for her she said simply while i give her the bread that will save time every minute is precious  i did as i was bid not knowing each moment but that the insurgents would return when i came back from the spring with the bucket the mare had demolished the whole two loaves and was going on upon some grass which hilda had plucked for her  she hasnt had enough poor dear hilda said patting her neck a couple of loaves are penny buns to her appetite let her drink the water while i go in and fetch out the rest of the baking  i hesitated you cant go in there again hilda i cried wait and let me do it  her white face was resolute yes i can she answered it is a work of necessity and in works of necessity a woman i think should flinch at nothing have i not seen already every varied aspect of death at nathaniels and in she went undaunted to that chamber of horrors still clasping the baby  the pony made short work of the remaining loaves which she devoured with great zest as hilda had predicted they seemed to hearten her the food and drink with a bucket of water dashed on her hoofs gave her new vigour like wine we gulped down our eggs in silence then i held hildas bicycle she vaulted lightly on to the seat white and tired as she was with the baby in her left arm and her right hand on the handlebar  i must take the baby i said  she shook her head  oh no i will not trust her to you  hilda i insist  and i insist too it is my place to take her  but can you ride so i asked anxiously  she began to pedal oh dear yes it is quite quite easy i shall get there all rightif the matabele dont burst upon us  tired as i was with my long days work i jumped into my saddle i saw i should only lose time if i disputed about the baby my little horse seemed to understand that something grave had occurred for weary as she must have been she set out with a will once more over that great red level hilda pedalled bravely by my side the road was bumpy but she was well accustomed to it i could have ridden faster than she went for the baby weighted her still we rode for dear life it was a grim experience  all round by this time the horizon was dim with clouds of black smoke which went up from burning farms and plundered homesteads the smoke did not rise high it hung sullenly over the hot plain in long smouldering masses like the smoke of steamers on foggy days in england the sun was nearing the horizon his slant red rays lighted up the red plain the red sand the brownred grasses with a murky spectral glow of crimson after those red pools of blood this universal burst of redness appalled one it seemed as though all nature had conspired in one unholy league with the matabele we rode on without a word the red sky grew redder  they may have sacked salisbury i exclaimed at last looking out towards the brandnew town  i doubt it hilda answered her very doubt reassured me  we began to mount a long slope hilda pedalled with difficulty not a sound was heard save the light fall of my ponys feet on the soft new road and the shrill cry of the cicalas then suddenly we started what was that noise in our rear once twice it rang out the loud ping of a rifle  looking behind us we saw eight or ten mounted matabele stalwart warriors they werehalf naked and riding stolen horses they were coming our way they had seen us they were pursuing us  put on all speed i cried in my agony hilda can you manage it she pedalled with a will but as we mounted the slope i saw they were gaining upon us a few hundred yards were all our start they had the descent of the opposite hill as yet in their favour  one man astride on a better horse than the rest galloped on in front and came within range of us he had a rifle in his hand he pointed it twice and covered us but he did not shoot hilda gave a cry of relief dont you see she exclaimed it is oom jan willems rifle that was their last cartridge they have no more ammunition  i saw she was probably right for klaas was out of cartridges and was waiting for my new stock to arrive from england if that were correct they must get near enough to attack us with assegais they are more dangerous so i remembered what an old boer had said to me at buluwayo the zulu with his assegai is an enemy to be feared with a gun he is a bungler  we pounded on up the hill it was deadly work with those brutes at our heels the child on hildas arm was visibly wearying her it kept on whining hilda i cried that baby will lose your life you cannot go on carrying it  she turned to me with a flash of her eyes what you are a man she broke out and you ask a woman to save her life by abandoning a baby hubert you shame me  i felt she was right if she had been capable of giving it up she would not have been hilda there was but one other way left  then you must take the pony i called out and let me have the bicycle  you couldnt ride it she called back it is a womans machine remember  yes i could i replied without slowing it is not much too short and i can bend my knees a bit quick quick no words do as i tell you  she hesitated a second the childs weight distressed her we should lose time in changing she answered at last doubtful but still pedalling though my hand was on the rein ready to pull up the pony  not if we manage it right obey orders the moment i say halt i shall slacken my mares pace when you see me leave the saddle jump off instantly you and mount her i will catch the machine before it falls are you ready halt then  she obeyed the word without one seconds delay i slipped off held the bridle caught the bicycle and led it instantaneously then i ran beside the ponybridle in one hand machine in the othertill hilda had sprung with a light bound into the stirrup at that a little leap and i mounted the bicycle it was all done nimbly in less time than the telling takes for we are both of us naturally quick in our movements hilda rode like a man astrideher short bicycling skirt unobtrusively divided in front and at the back made this easily possible looking behind me with a hasty glance i could see that the savages taken aback had reined in to deliberate at our unwonted evolution i feel sure that the novelty of the iron horse with a woman riding it played not a little on their superstitious fears they suspected no doubt this was some ingenious new engine of war devised against them by the unaccountable white man it might go off unexpectedly in their faces at any moment most of them i observed as they halted carried on their backs black oxhide shields interlaced with white thongs they were armed with two or three assegais apiece and a knobkerry  instead of losing time by the change as it turned out we had actually gained it hilda was able to put on my sorrel to her full pace which i had not dared to do for fear of outrunning my companion the wise little beast for her part seemed to rise to the occasion and to understand that we were pursued for she stepped out bravely on the other hand in spite of the low seat and the short crank of a womans machine i could pedal up the slope with more force than hilda for i am a practised hillclimber so that in both ways we gained besides having momentarily disconcerted and checked the enemy their ponies were tired and they rode them full tilt with savage recklessness making them canter uphill and so needlessly fatiguing them the matabele indeed are unused to horses and manage them but ill it is as foot soldiers creeping stealthily through bush or long grass that they are really formidable only one of their mounts was tolerably fresh the one which had once already almost overtaken us as we neared the top of the slope hilda glancing behind her exclaimed with a sudden thrill he is spurting again hubert  i drew my revolver and held it in my right hand using my left for steering i did not look back time was far too precious i set my teeth hard tell me when he draws near enough for a shot i said quietly  hilda only nodded being mounted on the mare she could see behind her more steadily now than i could from the machine and her eye was trustworthy as for the baby rocked by the heave and fall of the ponys withers it had fallen asleep placidly in the very midst of this terror  after a second i asked once more with bated breath is he gaining  she looked back yes gaining  a pause and now  still gaining he is poising an assegai  ten seconds more passed in breathless suspense the thud of their horses hoofs alone told me their nearness my finger was on the trigger i awaited the word fire she said at last in a calm unflinching voice he is well within distance  i turned half round and levelled as true as i could at the advancing black man he rode nearly naked showing all his teeth and brandishing his assegai the long white feathers stuck upright in his hair gave him a wild and terrifying barbaric aspect it was difficult to preserve ones balance keep the way on and shoot all at the same time but spurred by necessity i somehow did it i fired three shots in quick succession my first bullet missed my second knocked the man over my third grazed the horse with a ringing shriek the matabele fell in the road a black writhing mass his horse terrified dashed back with maddened snorts into the midst of the others its plunging disconcerted the whole party for a minute  we did not wait to see the rest taking advantage of this momentary diversion in our favour we rode on at full speed to the top of the slopei never knew before how hard i could pedaland began to descend at a dash into the opposite hollow  the sun had set by this time there is no twilight in those latitudes it grew dark at once we could see now in the plain all round where black clouds of smoke had rolled before one lurid red glare of burning houses mixed with a sullen haze of tawny light from the columns of prairie fire kindled by the insurgents  we made our way still onward across the open plain without one word towards salisbury the mare was giving out she strode with a will but her flanks were white with froth her breath came short foam flew from her nostrils  as we mounted the next ridge still distancing our pursuers i saw suddenly on its crest defined against the livid red sky like a silhouette two more mounted black men  its all up hilda i cried losing heart at last they are on both sides of us now the mare is spent we are surrounded  she drew rein and gazed at them for a moment suspense spoke in all her attitude then she burst into a sudden deep sigh of relief no no she cried these are friendlies  how do you know i gasped but i believed her  they are looking out this way with hands shading their eyes against the red glare they are looking away from salisbury in the direction of the attack they are expecting the enemy they must be friendlies see see they have caught sight of us  as she spoke one of the men lifted his rifle and half pointed it dont shoot dont shoot i shrieked aloud we are english english  the men let their rifles drop and rode down towards us who are you i cried  they saluted us military fashion matabele police sah the leader answered recognising me you are flying from klaass  yes i answered they have murdered klaas with his wife and child some of them are now following us  the spokesman was a welleducated cape town negro all right sah he answered i have forty men here right behind de kopje let dem come we can give a good account of dem ride on straight wit de lady to salisbury  the salisbury people know of this rising then i asked  yes sah dem know since five oclock kaffir boys from klaass brought in de news and a white man escaped from rozenbooms confirm it we have pickets all round you is safe now you can ride on into salisbury witout fear of de matabele  i rode on relieved mechanically my feet worked to and fro on the pedals it was a gentle downgradient now towards the town i had no further need for special exertion  suddenly hildas voice came wafted to me as through a mist what are you doing hubert youll be off in a minute  i started and recovered my balance with difficulty then i was aware at once that one second before i had all but dropped asleep dog tired on the bicycle worn out with my long day and with the nervous strain i began to doze off with my feet still moving round and round automatically the moment the anxiety of the chase was relieved and an easy downgrade gave me a little respite  i kept myself awake even then with difficulty riding on through the lurid gloom we reached salisbury at last and found the town already crowded with refugees from the plateau however we succeeded in securing two rooms at a house in the long street and were soon sitting down to a muchneeded supper  as we rested an hour or two later in the illfurnished back room discussing this sudden turn of affairs with our host and some neighboursfor of course all salisbury was eager for news from the scene of the massacresi happened to raise my head and saw to my great surprise a haggard white face peering in at us through the window  it peered round a corner stealthily it was an ascetic face very sharp and clearcut it had a stately profile the long and wiry grizzled moustache the deepset hawklike eyes the acute intense intellectual features all were very familiar so was the outer setting of long white hair straight and silvery as it fell and just curled in one wavelike inward sweep where it turned and rested on the stooping shoulders but the expression on the face was even stranger than the sudden apparition it was an expression of keen and poignant disappointmentas of a man whom fate has baulked of some wellplanned end his due by right which mere chance has evaded  they say theres a white man at the bottom of all this trouble our host had been remarking one second earlier the niggers know too much and where did they get their rifles people at rozenbooms believe some blacklivered traitor has been stirring up the matabele for weeks and weeks an enemy of rhodess of course jealous of our advance a french agent perhaps but more likely one of these confounded transvaal dutchmen depend upon it its krugers doing  as the words fell from his lips i saw the face i gave a quick little start then recovered my composure  but hilda noted it she looked up at me hastily she was sitting with her back to the window and therefore of course could not see the face itself which indeed was withdrawn with a hurried movement yet with a certain strange dignity almost before i could feel sure of having seen it still she caught my startled expression and the gleam of surprise and recognition in my eye she laid one hand upon my arm you have seen him she asked quietly almost below her breath  seen whom  sebastian  it was useless denying it to her yes i have seen him i answered in a confidential aside  just nowthis momentat the back of the houselooking in at the window upon us  you are rightas always  she drew a deep breath he has played his game she said low to me in an awed undertone i felt sure it was he i expected him to play though what piece i knew not and when i saw those poor dead souls i was certain he had done itindirectly done it the matabele are his pawns he wanted to aim a blow at me and this was the way he chose to aim it  do you think he is capable of that i cried for in spite of all i had still a sort of lingering respect for sebastian it seems so recklesslike the worst of anarchistswhen he strikes at one head to involve so many irrelevant lives in one common destruction  hildas face was like a drowned mans  to sebastian she answered shuddering the end is all the means are unessential who wills the end wills the means that is the sum and substance of his philosophy of life from first to last he has always acted up to it did i not tell you once he was a snowclad volcano  still i am loth to believe i cried  she interrupted me calmly i knew it she said i expected it beneath that cold exterior the fires of his life burn fiercely still i told you we must wait for sebastians next move though i confess even from him i hardly dreamt of this one but from the moment when i opened the door on poor tant metties body lying there in its red horror i felt it must be he and when you started just now i said to myself in a flash of intuitionsebastian has come he has come to see how his devils work has prospered he sees it has gone wrong so now he will try to devise some other  i thought of the malign expression on that cruel white face as it stared in at the window from the outer gloom and i felt convinced she was right she had read her man once more for it was the desperate contorted face of one appalled to discover that a great crime attempted and successfully carried out has failed by mere accident of its central intention    chapter viii  the episode of the european with the kaffir heart   unfashionable as it is to say so i am a man of peace i belong to a profession whose province is to heal not to destroy still there are times which turn even the most peaceful of us perforce into fighterstimes when those we love those we are bound to protect stand in danger of their lives and at moments like that no man can doubt what is his plain duty the matabele revolt was one such moment in a conflict of race we must back our own colour i do not know whether the natives were justified in rising or not most likely yes for we had stolen their country but when once they rose when the security of white women depended upon repelling them i felt i had no alternative for hildas sake for the sake of every woman and child in salisbury and in all rhodesia i was bound to bear my part in restoring order  for the immediate future it is true we were safe enough in the little town but we did not know how far the revolt might have spread we could not tell what had happened at charter at buluwayo at the outlying stations the matabele perhaps had risen in force over the whole vast area which was once lobengulas country if so their first object would certainly be to cut us off from communication with the main body of english settlers at buluwayo  i trust to you hilda i said on the day after the massacre at klaass to divine for us where these savages are next likely to attack us  she cooed at the motherless baby raising one bent finger and then turned to me with a white smile then you ask too much of me she answered just think what a correct answer would imply first a knowledge of these savages character next a knowledge of their mode of fighting cant you see that only a person who possessed my trick of intuition and who had also spent years in warfare among the matabele would be really able to answer your question  and yet such questions have been answered before now by people far less intuitive than you i went on why ive read somewhere how when the war between napoleon the first and the prussians broke out in 1806 jomini predicted that the decisive battle of the campaign would be fought near jena and near jena it was fought are not you better than many jominis  hilda tickled the babys cheek smile then baby smile she said pouncing one soft finger on a gathering dimple and who was your friend jomini  the greatest military critic and tactician of his age i answered one of napoleons generals i fancy he wrote a book dont you knowa book on wardes grandes operations militaires or something of that sort  well there you are then thats just it your jomini or hominy or whatever you call him not only understood napoleons temperament but understood war and understood tactics it was all a question of the lie of the land and strategy and so forth if i had been asked i could never have answered a quarter as well as jomini piccolominicould i baby jomini would have been worth a good many mes there there a dear motherless darling why she crows just as if she hadnt lost all her family  but hilda we must be serious i count upon you to help us in this matter we are still in danger even now these matabele may attack and destroy us  she laid the child on her lap and looked grave i know it hubert but i must leave it now to you men i am no tactician dont take me for one of napoleons generals  still i said we have not only the matabele to reckon with recollect there is sebastian as well and whether you know your matabele or not you at least know your sebastian  she shuddered i know him yes i know him but this case is so difficult we have sebastiancomplicated by a rabble of savages whose habits and manners i do not understand it is that that makes the difficulty  but sebastian himself i urged take him first in isolation  she paused for a full minute with her chin on her hand and her elbow on the table her brow gathered sebastian she repeated sebastianah there i might guess something well of course having once begun this attempt and being definitely committed as it were to a policy of killing us he will go through to the bitter end no matter how many other lives it may cost that is sebastians method  you dont think having once found out that i saw and recognised him he would consider the game lost and slink away to the coast again  sebastian oh no that is the absolute antipodes of his type and temperament  he will never give up because of a temporary check you think  no never the man has a will of sheer steelit may break but it will not bend besides consider he is too deeply involved you have seen him you know and he knows you know you may bring this thing home to him then what is his plain policy why to egg on the natives whose confidence he has somehow gained into making a further attack and cutting off all salisbury if he had succeeded in getting you and me massacred at klaass as he hoped he would no doubt have slunk off to the coast at once leaving his black dupes to be shot down at leisure by rhodess soldiers  i see but having failed in that  then he is bound to go through with it and kill us if he can even if he has to kill all salisbury with us that i feel sure is sebastians plan whether he can get the matabele to back him up in it or not is a different matter  but taking sebastian himself alone  oh sebastian himself alone would naturally say never mind buluwayo concentrate round salisbury and kill off all there first when that is done then you can move on at your ease and cut them to pieces in charter and buluwayo you see he would have no interest in the movement himself once he had fairly got rid of us here the matabele are only the pieces in his game it is me he wants not salisbury he would clear out of rhodesia as soon as he had carried his point but he would have to give some reasonable ground to the matabele for his first advice and it seems a reasonable ground to say dont leave salisbury in your rear so as to put yourselves between two fires capture the outpost first that down march on undistracted to the principal stronghold  who is no tactician i murmured half aloud  she laughed thats not tactics hubert thats plain common senseand knowledge of sebastian still it comes to nothing the question is not what would sebastian wish it is could sebastian persuade these angry black men to accept his guidance  sebastian i cried sebastian could persuade the very devil i know the mans fiery enthusiasm his contagious eloquence he thrilled me through myself with his electric personality so that it took me six yearsand your aidto find him out at last his very abstractness tells why even in this war you may be sure he will be making notes all the time on the healing of wounds in tropical climates contrasting the african with the european constitution  oh yes of course whatever he does he will never forget the interests of science he is true to his ladylove to whomever else he plays false that is his saving virtue  and he will talk down the matabele i went on even if he doesnt know their language but i suspect he does for you must remember he was three years in south africa as a young man on a scientific expedition collecting specimens he can ride like a trooper and he knows the country his masterful ways his austere face will cow the natives then again he has the air of a prophet and prophets always stir the negro i can imagine with what air he will bid them drive out the intrusive white men who have usurped their land and draw them flattering pictures of a new matabele empire about to arise under a new chief too strong for these goldgrubbing diamondhunting mobs from over sea to meddle with  she reflected once more do you mean to say anything of our suspicions in salisbury hubert she asked at last  it is useless i answered the salisbury folk believe there is a white man at the bottom of this trouble already they will try to catch him thats all that is necessary if we said it was sebastian people would only laugh at us they must understand sebastian as you and i understand him before they would think such a move credible as a rule in life if you know anything which other people do not know better keep it to yourself you will only get laughed at as a fool for telling it  i think so too that is why i never say what i suspect or infer from my knowledge of typesexcept to a few who can understand and appreciate hubert if they all arm for the defence of the town you will stop here i suppose to tend the wounded  her lips trembled as she spoke and she gazed at me with a strange wistfulness no dearest i answered at once taking her face in my hands i shall fight with the rest salisbury has more need today of fighters than of healers  i thought you would she answered slowly and i think you do right her face was set white she played nervously with the baby i would not urge you but i am glad you say so i want you to stop yet i could not love you so much if i did not see you ready to play the man at such a crisis  i shall give in my name with the rest i answered  hubert it is hard to spare youhard to send you to such danger but for one other thing i am glad you are going they must take sebastian alive they must not kill him  they will shoot him redhanded if they catch him i answered confidently a white man who sides with the blacks in an insurrection  then you must see that they do not do it they must bring him in alive and try him legally for meand therefore for youthat is of the first importance  why so hilda  hubert you want to marry me i nodded vehemently well you know i can only marry you on one conditionthat i have succeeded first in clearing my fathers memory now the only man living who can clear it is sebastian if sebastian were to be shot it could never be clearedand then law of medes and persians i could never marry you  but how can you expect sebastian of all men to clear it hilda i cried he is ready to kill us both merely to prevent your attempting a revision is it likely you can force him to confess his crime still less induce him to admit it voluntarily  she placed her hands over her eyes and pressed them hard with a strange prophetic air she often had about her when she gazed into the future i know my man she answered slowly without uncovering her eyes i know how i can do itif the chance ever comes to me but the chance must come first it is hard to find i lost it once at nathaniels i must not lose it again if sebastian is killed skulking here in rhodesia my lifes purpose will have failed i shall not have vindicated my fathers good name and then we can never marry  so i understand hilda my orders are these i am to go out and fight for the women and children if possible that sebastian shall be made prisoner alive and on no account to let him be killed in the open  i give you no orders hubert i tell you how it seems best to me but if sebastian is shot deadthen you understand it must be all over between us i never can marry you until or unless i have cleared my father  sebastian shall not be shot dead i cried with my youthful impetuosity he shall be brought in alive though all salisbury as one man try its best to lynch him  i went out to report myself as a volunteer for service within the next few hours the whole town had been put in a state of siege and all available men armed to oppose the insurgent matabele hasty preparations were made for defence the oxwaggons of settlers were drawn up outside in little circles here and there so as to form laagers which acted practically as temporary forts for the protection of the outskirts in one of these i was posted with our company were two american scouts named colebrook and doolittle irregular fighters whose value in south african campaigns had already been tested in the old matabele war against lobengula colebrook in particular was an oddlooking creaturea tall spare man bodied like a weasel he was redhaired ferreteyed and an excellent scout but scrappier and more inarticulate in his manner of speech than any human being i had ever encountered his conversation was a series of rapid interjections jerked out at intervals and made comprehensible by a running play of gesture and attitude  well yes he said when i tried to draw him out on the matabele mode of fighting not on the open never grass if you like or bushes the eyes of them the eyes he leaned eagerly forward as if looking for something see here doctor im telling you spots gleaming among the grass long grass and armed too a pair of em each one to throwhe raised his hand as if lancing somethingthe other for close fighting assegais you know thats the name of it only the eyes creeping creeping creeping no noise one raised waggons drawn up in laager oxen outspanned in the middle trekking all day tired out dog tired crawl crawl crawl hands and knees might be snakes a wriggle men sitting about the camp fire smoking gleam of their eyes under the waggons nearer nearer nearer then the throwing ones in your midst shower of em right and left halloa stand by boys look up see em swarming black like ants over the waggons inside the laager snatch up rifles all up oxen stampeding men running blacks sticking em like pigs in the back with their assegais bad job the whole thing dont care for it myself very tough uns to fight if they once break laager  then you should never let them get to close quarters i suggested catching the general drift of his inarticulate swift pictures  youre a square man you are doctor there you touch the spot never let em get at close quarters sentriescreep past em outpostscrawl between had forbes and wilson like that cut em off perdition but maxims will do it maxims never let em get near sweep the ground all round durned hard though to know just when theyre coming a night two nights all clear only waste ammunition third they swarm like bees break laager all over  this was not exactly an agreeable picture of what we had to expectthe more so as our particular laager happened to have no maxims however we kept a sharp lookout for those gleaming eyes in the long grass of which colebrook warned us their flashing light was the one thing to be seen at night above all when the black bodies could crawl unperceived through the tall dry herbage on our first night out we had no adventures we watched by turns outside relieving sentry from time to time while those of us who slept within the laager slept on the bare ground with our arms beside us nobody spoke much the tension was too great every moment we expected an attack of the enemy  next day news reached us by scouts from all the other laagers none of them had been attacked but in all there was a deep halfinstinctive belief that the matabele in force were drawing step by step closer and closer around us lobengulas old impis or native regiments had gathered together once more under their own indunasmen trained and drilled in all the arts and ruses of savage warfare on their own ground and among their native scrub those rude strategists are formidable they know the country and how to fight in it we had nothing to oppose to them but a handful of the new matabeleland police an old regular soldier or two and a raw crowd of volunteers most of whom like myself had never before really handled a rifle  that afternoon the major in command decided to send out the two american scouts to scour the grass and discover if possible how near our lines the matabele had penetrated i begged hard to be permitted to accompany them i wanted if i could to get evidence against sebastian or at least to learn whether he was still directing and assisting the enemy at first the scouts laughed at my request but when i told them privately that i believed i had a clue against the white traitor who had caused the revolt and that i wished to identify him they changed their tone and began to think there might be something in it  experience colebrook asked in his brief shorthand of speech running his ferret eyes over me  none i answered but a noiseless tread and a capacity for crawling through holes in hedges which may perhaps be useful  he glanced inquiry at doolittle who was a shorter and stouter man with a knack of getting over obstacles by sheer forcefulness  hands and knees he said abruptly in the imperative mood pointing to a clump of dry grass with thorny bushes ringed about it  i went down on my hands and knees and threaded my way through the long grasses and matted boughs as noiselessly as i could the two old hands watched me when i emerged several yards off much to their surprise colebrook turned to doolittle might answer he said curtly major says choose your own men anyhow if they catch him nobodys fault but his wants to go will do it  we set out through the long grass together walking erect at first till we had got some distance from the laager and then creeping as the matabele themselves creep without displacing the grassflowers for a mere wave on top would have betrayed us at once to the quick eyes of those observant savages we crept on for a mile or so at last colebrook turned to me one finger on his lips his ferret eyes gleamed we were approaching a wooded hill all interspersed with boulders kaffirs here he whispered low as if he knew by instinct how he knew i cannot tell he seemed almost to scent them  we stole on farther going more furtively than ever now i could notice by this time that there were waggons in front and could hear men speaking in them i wanted to proceed but colebrook held up one warning hand wont do he said shortly in a low tone only myself danger ahead stop here and wait for me  doolittle and myself waited colebrook kept on cautiously squirming his long body in sinuous waves like a lizards through the grass and was soon lost to us no snake could have been lither we waited with ears intent one minute two minutes many minutes passed we could catch the voices of the kaffirs in the bush all round they were speaking freely but what they said i did not know as i had picked up only a very few words of the matabele language  it seemed hours while we waited still as mice in our ambush and alert i began to think colebrook must have been lost or killedso long was he goneand that we must return without him at lastwe leaned forwarda muffled movement in the grass ahead a slight wave at the base then it divided below bit by bit while the tops remained stationary a weasellike body slank noiselessly through finger on lips once more colebrook glided beside us we turned and crawled back stifling our very pulses for many minutes none of us spoke but we heard in our rear a loud cry and a shaking of assegais the kaffirs behind us were yelling frightfully they must have suspected somethingseen some movement in the tufted heads of grass for they spread abroad shouting we halted holding our breath after a time however the noise died down they were moving another way we crept on again stealthily  when at last after many minutes we found ourselves beyond a sheltering belt of brushwood we ventured to rise and speak well i asked of colebrook did you discover anything  he nodded assent couldnt see him he said shortly but hes there right enough white man heard em talk of him  what did they say i asked eagerly  said he had a white skin but his heart was a kaffirs great induna leader of many impis prophet wise weather doctor friend of old moselekatses destroy the white men from over the big water restore the land to the matabele kill all in salisbury especially the white women witchesall witches they give charms to the men cook lions hearts for them make them brave with lovedrinks  they said that i exclaimed taken aback kill all the white women  yes kill all white witches every one the young ones worst word of the great induna  and you could not see him  crept near waggons close fellow himself inside heard his voice spoke english with a little matabele kaffir boy who was servant at the mission interpreted  what sort of voice like this and i imitated sebastians cold clearcut tone as well as i was able  the man thats him doctor youve got him down to the ground the very voice heard him giving orders  that settled the question i was certain of it now sebastian was with the insurgents  we made our way back to our laager flung ourselves down and slept a little on the ground before taking our turn in the fatigues of the night watch our horses were loosely tied ready for any sudden alarm about midnight we three were sitting with others about the fire talking low to one another all at once doolittle sprang up alert and eager look out boys he cried pointing his hands under the waggons whats wriggling in the grass there  i looked and saw nothing our sentries were posted outside about a hundred yards apart walking up and down till they met and exchanging alls well aloud at each meeting  they should have been stationary one of our scouts exclaimed looking out at them its easier for the matabele to see them so when they walk up and down moving against the sky the major ought to have posted them where it wouldnt have been so simple for a kaffir to see them and creep in between them  too late now boys colebrook burst out with a rare effort of articulateness call back the sentries major the blacks have broken line hold there theyre in upon us  even as he spoke i followed his eager pointing hand with my eyes and just descried among the grass two gleaming objects seen under the hollow of one of the waggons two then two then two again and behind whole pairs of them they looked like twin stars but they were eyes black eyes reflecting the starlight and the red glare of the campfire they crept on tortuously in serpentine curves through the long dry grasses i could feel rather than see that they were matabele crawling prone on their bellies and trailing their snakelike way between the dark jungle quick as thought i raised my rifle and blazed away at the foremost so did several others but the major shouted angrily who fired dont shoot boys till you hear the word of command back sentries to laager not a shot till theyre safe inside youll hit your own people  almost before he said it the sentries darted back the matabele crouching on hands and knees in the long grass had passed between them unseen a wild moment followed i can hardly describe it the whole thing was so new to me and took place so quickly hordes of black human ants seemed to surge up all at once over and under the waggons assegais whizzed through the air or gleamed brandished around one our men fell back to the centre of the laager and formed themselves hastily under the majors orders then a pause a deadly fire once twice thrice we volleyed the matabele fell by dozensbut they came on by hundreds as fast as we fired and mowed down one swarm fresh swarms seemed to spring from the earth and stream over the waggons others appeared to grow up almost beneath our feet as they wormed their way on their faces along the ground between the wheels squirmed into the circle and then rose suddenly erect and naked in front of us meanwhile they yelled and shouted clashing their spears and shields the oxen bellowed the rifles volleyed it was a pandemonium of sound in an orgy of gloom darkness lurid flame blood wounds death horror  yet in the midst of all this hubbub i could not help admiring the cool military calm and selfcontrol of our major his voice rose clear above the confused tumult steady boys steady dont fire at random pick each your likeliest man and aim at him deliberately thats right easyeasy shoot at leisure and dont waste ammunition  he stood as if he were on parade in the midst of this palpitating turmoil of savages some of us encouraged by his example mounted the waggons and shot from the tops at our approaching assailants  how long the hurlyburly went on i cannot say we fired fired fired and kaffirs fell like sheep yet more kaffirs rose fresh from the long grass to replace them they swarmed with greater ease now over the covered waggons across the mangled and writhing bodies of their fellows for the dead outside made an inclined plane for the living to mount by but the enemy were getting less numerous i thought and less anxious to fight the steady fire told on them byandby with a little halt for the first time they wavered all our men now mounted the waggons and began to fire on them in regular volleys as they came up the evil effects of the surprise were gone by this time we were acting with coolness and obeying orders but several of our people dropped close beside me pierced through with assegais  all at once as if a panic had burst over them the matabele with one mind stopped dead short in their advance and ceased fighting till that moment no number of deaths seemed to make any difference to them men fell disabled others sprang up from the ground by magic but now of a sudden their courage flaggedthey faltered gave way broke and shambled in a body at last as one man they turned and fled many of them leapt up with a loud cry from the long grass where they were skulking flung away their big shields with the white thongs interlaced and ran for dear life black crouching figures through the dense dry jungle they held their assegais still but did not dare to use them it was a flight pellmelland the devil take the hindmost  not until then had i leisure to think and to realise my position this was the first and only time i had ever seen a battle i am a bit of a coward i believelike most other menthough i have courage enough to confess it and i expected to find myself terribly afraid when it came to fighting instead of that to my immense surprise once the matabele had swarmed over the laager and were upon us in their thousands i had no time to be frightened the absolute necessity for keeping cool for loading and reloading for aiming and firing for beating them off at close quartersall this so occupied ones mind and still more ones hands that one couldnt find room for any personal terrors they are breaking over there they will overpower us yonder they are faltering now those thoughts were so uppermost in ones head and ones arms were so alert that only after the enemy gave way and began to run at full pelt could a man find breathingspace to think of his own safety then the thought occurred to me i have been through my first fight and come out of it alive after all i was a deal less afraid than i expected  that took but a second however next instant awaking to the altered circumstances we were after them at full speed accompanying them on their way back to their kraals in the uplands with a running fire as a farewell attention  as we broke laager in pursuit of them by the uncertain starlight we saw a sight which made us boil with indignation a mounted man turned and fled before them he seemed their leader unseen till then he was dressed like a europeantall thin unbending in a greyishwhite suit he rode a good horse and sat it well his air was commanding even as he turned and fled in the general rout from that lost battle  i seized colebrooks arm almost speechless with anger the white man i cried the traitor  he did not answer a word but with a set face of white rage loosed his horse from where it was tethered among the waggons at the same moment i loosed mine so did doolittle quick as thought but silently we led them out all three where the laager was broken i clutched my mares mane and sprang to the stirrup to pursue our enemy my sorrel bounded off like a bird the fugitive had a good two minutes start of us but our horses were fresh while his had probably been ridden all day i patted my ponys neck she responded with a ringing neigh of joy we tore after the outlaw all three of us abreast i felt a sort of fierce delight in the reaction after the fighting our ponies galloped wildly over the plain we burst out into the night never heeding the matabele whom we passed on the open in panicstricken retreat i noticed that many of them in their terror had even flung away their shields and their assegais  it was a mad chase across the dark veldtwe three neck to neck against that one desperate runaway we rode all we knew i dug my heels into my sorrels flanks and she responded bravely the tables were turned now on our traitor since the afternoon of the massacre he was the pursued and we were the pursuers we felt we must run him down and punish him for his treachery  at a breakneck pace we stumbled over low bushes we grazed big boulders we rolled down the sides of steep ravines but we kept him in sight all the time dim and black against the starry sky slowly slowlyyes yeswe gained upon him my pony led now the mysterious white man rode and rodehead bent neck forwardbut never looked behind him bit by bit we lessened the distance between us as we drew near him at last doolittle called out to me in a warning voice take care doctor have your revolvers ready hes driven to bay now as we approach hell fire at us  then it came home to me in a flash i felt the truth of it he dare not fire i cried he dare not turn towards us he cannot show his face if he did we might recognise him  on we rode still gaining now now i cried we shall catch him  even as i leaned forward to seize his rein the fugitive without checking his horse without turning his head drew his revolver from his belt and raising his hand fired behind him at random he fired towards us on the chance the bullet whizzed past my ear not hitting anyone we scattered right and left still galloping free and strong we did not return his fire as i had told the others of my desire to take him alive we might have shot his horse but the risk of hitting the rider coupled with the confidence we felt of eventually hunting him to earth restrained us it was the great mistake we made  he had gained a little by his shots but we soon caught it up once more i said we are on him  a minute later we were pulled up short before an impenetrable thicket of prickly shrubs through which i saw at once it would have been quite impossible to urge our staggering horses  the other man of course reached it before us with his mares last breath he must have been making for it indeed of set purpose for the second he arrived at the edge of the thicket he slipped off his tired pony and seemed to dive into the bush as a swimmer dives off a rock into the water  we have him now i cried in a voice of triumph and colebrook echoed we have him  we sprang down quickly take him alive if you can i exclaimed remembering hildas advice let us find out who he is and have him properly tried and hanged at buluwayo dont give him a soldiers death all he deserves is a murderers  you stop here colebrook said briefly flinging his bridle to doolittle to hold doctor and i follow him thick bush knows the ways of it revolvers ready  i handed my sorrel to doolittle he stopped behind holding the three foambespattered and panting horses while colebrook and i dived after our fugitive into the matted bushes  the thicket as i have said was impenetrable above but it was burrowed at its base by overground runs of some wild animalnot i think a very large one they were just like the runs which rabbits make among gorse and heather only on a bigger scalebigger even than a foxs or badgers by crouching and bending our backs we could crawl through them with difficulty into the scrubby tangle it was hard work creeping the runs divided soon colebrook felt with his hands on the ground i can make out the spoor he muttered after a minute he has gone on this way  we tracked him a little distance in crawling at times and rising now and again where the runs opened out on to the air for a moment the spoor was doubtful and the tunnels tortuous i felt the ground from time to time but could not be sure of the tracks with my fingers i was not a trained scout like colebrook or doolittle we wriggled deeper into the tangle something stirred once or twice it was not far from me i was uncertain whether it was himsebastianor a kaffir earthhog the animal which seemed likeliest to have made the burrows was he going to elude us even now would he turn upon us with a knife if so could we hold him  at last when we had pushed our way some distance in we heard a wild cry from outside it was doolittles voice quick quick out again the man will escape he has come back on his tracks and rounded  i saw our mistake at once we had left our companion out there alone rendered helpless by the care of all three horses  colebrook said never a word he was a man of action he turned with instinctive haste and followed our own spoor back again with his hands and knees to the opening in the thicket by which we had first entered  before we could reach it however two shots rang out clear in the direction where we had left poor doolittle and the horses then a sharp cry broke the stillnessthe cry of a wounded man we redoubled our pace we knew we were outwitted  when we reached the open we saw at once by the uncertain light what had happened the fugitive was riding away on my own little sorrelriding for dear life not back the way we came from salisbury but sideways across the veldt towards chimoio and the portuguese seaports the other two horses riderless and terrified were scampering with loose heels over the dark plain doolittle was not to be seen he lay a black lump among the black bushes about him  we looked around for him and found him he was severely i may even say dangerously wounded the bullet had lodged in his right side we had to catch our two horses and ride them back with our wounded man leading the fugitives mare in tow all blown and breathless i stuck to the fugitives mare it was the one clue we had now against him but sebastian if it was sebastian had ridden off scotfree i understood his game at a glance he had got the better of us once more he would make for the coast by the nearest road give himself out as a settler escaped from the massacre and catch the next ship for england or the cape now this coup had failed him  doolittle had not seen the traitors face the man rose from the bush he said shot him seized the pony and rode off in a second with ruthless haste he was tall and thin but erectthat was all the wounded scout could tell us about his assailant and that was not enough to identify sebastian  all danger was over we rode back to salisbury the first words hilda said when she saw me were well he has got away from you  yes how did you know  i read it in your step but i guessed as much before he is so very keen and you started too confident    chapter ix  the episode of the lady who was very exclusive   the matabele revolt gave hilda a prejudice against rhodesia i will confess that i shared it i may be hard to please but it somehow sets one against a country when one comes home from a ride to find all the other occupants of the house one lives in massacred so hilda decided to leave south africa by an odd coincidence i also decided on the same day to change my residence hildas movements and mine indeed coincided curiously the moment i learned she was going anywhere i discovered in a flash that i happened to be going there too i commend this strange case of parallel thought and action to the consideration of the society for psychical research  so i sold my farm and had done with rhodesia a country with a future is very well in its way but i am quite ibsenish in my preference for a country with a past oddly enough i had no difficulty in getting rid of my white elephant of a farm people seemed to believe in rhodesia none the less firmly because of this slight disturbance they treated massacres as necessary incidents in the early history of a colony with a future and i do not deny that native risings add picturesqueness but i prefer to take them in a literary form  you will go home of course i said to hilda when we came to talk it all over  she shook her head to england oh no i must pursue my plan sebastian will have gone home he expects me to follow  and why dont you  becausehe expects it you see he is a good judge of character he will naturally infer from what he knows of my temperament that after this experience i shall want to get back to england and safety so i shouldif it were not that i know he will expect it as it is i must go elsewhere i must draw him after me  where  why do you ask hubert  becausei want to know where i am going myself wherever you go i have reason to believe i shall find that i happen to be going also  she rested her little chin on her hand and reflected a minute does it occur to you she asked at last that people have tongues if you go on following me like this they will really begin to talk about us  now upon my word hilda i cried that is the very first time i have ever known you show a womans want of logic i do not propose to follow you i propose to happen to be travelling by the same steamer i ask you to marry me you wont you admit you are fond of me yet you tell me not to come with you it is i who suggest a course which would prevent people from chatteringby the simple device of a wedding it is you who refuse and then you turn upon me like this admit that you are unreasonable  my dear hubert have i ever denied that i was a woman  besides i went on ignoring her delicious smile i dont intend to follow you i expect on the contrary to find myself beside you when i know where you are going i shall accidentally turn up on the same steamer accidents will happen nobody can prevent coincidences from occurring you may marry me or you may not but if you dont marry me you cant expect to curtail my liberty of action can you you had better know the worst at once if you wont take me you must count upon finding me at your elbow all the world overtill the moment comes when you choose to accept me  dear hubert i am ruining your life  an excellent reason then for taking my advice and marrying me instantly but you wander from the question where are you going that is the issue now before the house you persist in evading it  she smiled and came back to earth oh if you must know to india by the east coast changing steamers at aden  extraordinary i cried do you know hilda as luck will have it i also shall be on my way to bombay by the very same steamer  but you dont know what steamer it is  no matter that only makes the coincidence all the odder whatever the name of the ship may be when you get on board i have a presentiment that you will be surprised to find me there  she looked up at me with a gathering film in her eyes hubert you are irrepressible  i am my dear child so you may as well spare yourself the needless trouble of trying to repress me  if you rub a piece of iron on a loadstone it becomes magnetic so i think i must have begun to acquire some part of hildas own prophetic strain for sure enough a few weeks later we both of us found ourselves on the german east african steamer kaiser wilhelm on our way to adenexactly as i had predicted which goes to prove that there is really something after all in presentiments  since you persist in accompanying me hilda said to me as we sat in our chairs on deck the first evening out i see what i must do i must invent some plausible and ostensible reason for our travelling together  we are not travelling together i answered we are travelling by the same steamer that is allexactly like the rest of our fellowpassengers i decline to be dragged into this imaginary partnership  now do be serious hubert i am going to invent an object in life for us  what object  how can i tell yet i must wait and see what turns up when we tranship at aden and find out what people are going on to bombay with us i shall probably discover some nice married lady to whom i can attach myself  and am i to attach myself to her too  my dear boy i never asked you to come you came unbidden you must manage for yourself as best you may but i leave much to the chapter of accidents we never know what will turn up till it turns up in the end everything comes at last you know to him that waits  and yet i put in with a meditative air i have never observed that waiters are so much better off than the rest of the community they seem to me  dont talk nonsense it is you who are wandering from the question now please return to it  i returned at once so i am to depend on what turns up  yes leave that to me when we see our fellowpassengers on the bombay steamer i shall soon discover some ostensible reason why we two should be travelling through india with one of them  well you are a witch hilda i answered i found that out long ago but if you succeed between here and bombay in inventing a mission i shall begin to believe you are even more of a witch than i ever thought you  at aden we changed into a p and o steamer our first evening out on our second cruise was a beautiful one the bland indian ocean wore its sweetest smile for us we sat on deck after dinner a lady with a husband came up from the cabin while we sat and gazed at the placid sea i was smoking a quiet digestive cigar hilda was seated in her deck chair next to me  the lady with the husband looked about her for a vacant space on which to place the chair a steward was carrying for her there was plenty of room on the quarterdeck i could not imagine why she gazed about her with such obtrusive caution she inspected the occupants of the various chairs around with deliberate scrutiny through a longhandled tortoiseshell optical abomination none of them seemed to satisfy her after a minutes effort during which she also muttered a few words very low to her husband she selected an empty spot midway between our group and the most distant group on the other side of us in other words she sat as far away from everybody present as the necessarily restricted area of the quarterdeck permitted  hilda glanced at me and smiled i snatched a quick look at the lady again she was dressed with an amount of care and a smartness of detail that seemed somewhat uncalled for on the indian ocean a cruise on a p and o steamer is not a garden party her chair was most luxurious and had her name painted on it back and front in very large letters with undue obtrusiveness i read it from where i sat lady meadowcroft  the owner of the chair was tolerably young not bad looking and most expensively attired her face had a certain vacant languid half ennuyee air which i have learned to associate with women of the nouveauriche typewomen with small brains and restless minds habitually plunged in a vortex of gaiety and miserable when left for a passing moment to their own resources  hilda rose from her chair and walked quietly forward towards the bow of the steamer i rose too and accompanied her well she said with a faint touch of triumph in her voice when we had got out of earshot  well what i answered unsuspecting  i told you everything turned up at the end she said confidently look at the ladys nose  it does turn up at the endcertainly i answered glancing back at her but i hardly see  hubert you are growing dull you were not so at nathaniels it is the lady herself who has turned up not her nosethough i grant you that turns up toothe lady i require for our tour in india the not impossible chaperon  her nose tells you that  her nose in part but her face as a whole too her dress her chair her mental attitude to things in general  my dear hilda you cant mean to tell me you have divined her whole nature at a glance by magic  not wholly at a glance i saw her come on board you knowshe transhipped from some other line at aden as we did and i have been watching her ever since yes i think i have unravelled her  you have been astonishingly quick i cried  perhapsbut then you see there is so little to unravel some books we all know you must chew and digest they can only be read slowly but some you can glance at skim and skip the mere turning of the pages tells you what little worth knowing there is in them  she doesnt look profound i admitted casting an eye at her meaningless small features as we paced up and down i incline to agree you might easily skim her  skim herand learn all the table of contents is so short you see in the first place she is extremely exclusive she prides herself on her exclusiveness it and her shoddy title are probably all she has to pride herself upon and she works them both hard she is a sham great lady  as hilda spoke lady meadowcroft raised a feebly querulous voice steward this wont do i can smell the engine here move my chair i must go on further  if you go on further that way my lady the steward answered goodhumouredly but with a manservants deference for any sort of title youll smell the galley where theyre cooking the dinner i dont know which your ladyship would like bestthe engine or the galley  the languid figure leaned back in the chair with an air of resignation im sure i dont know why they cook the dinners up so high she murmured pettishly to her husband why cant they stick the kitchens undergroundin the hold i meaninstead of bothering us up here on deck with them  the husband was a big burly roughandready yorkshiremanstout somewhat pompous about forty with hair wearing bald on the forehead the personification of the successful business man my dear emmie he said in a loud voice with a north country accent the cooks have got to live theyve got to live like the rest of us i can never persuade you that the hands must always be humoured if you dont humour em they wont work for you its a poor tale when the hands wont work even with galleys on deck the life of a seacook is not generally thowt an enviable position is not a happy onenot a happy one as the fellah says in the opera you must humour your cooks if you stuck em in the hold youd get no dinner at allthats the long and the short of it  the languid lady turned away with a sickly disappointed air then they ought to have a conscription or something she said pouting her lips the government ought to take it in hand and manage it somehow its bad enough having to go by these beastly steamers to india at all without having ones breath poisoned by the rest of the sentence died away inaudibly in a general murmur of ineffective grumbling  why do you think she is exclusive i asked hilda as we strolled on towards the stern out of the spoilt childs hearing  why didnt you noticeshe looked about her when she came on deck to see whether there was anybody who was anybody sitting there whom she might put her chair near but the governor of madras hadnt come up from his cabin yet and the wife of the chief commissioner of oude had three civilians hanging about her seat and the daughters of the commanderinchief drew their skirts away as she passed so she did the next best thingsat as far apart as she could from the common herd meaning all the rest of us if you cant mingle at once with the best people you can at least assert your exclusiveness negatively by declining to associate with the mere multitude  now hilda that is the first time i have ever known you to show any feminine illnature  illnature not at all i am merely trying to arrive at the ladys character for my own guidance i rather like her poor little thing dont i tell you she will do so far from objecting to her i mean to go the round of india with her  you have decided quickly  well you see if you insist upon accompanying me i must have a chaperon and lady meadowcroft will do as well as anybody else in fact being beladied she will do a little better from the point of view of society though that is a detail the great matter is to fix upon a possible chaperon at once and get her well in hand before we arrive at bombay  but she seems so complaining i interposed im afraid if you take her on youll get terribly bored with her  if she takes me on you mean shes not a ladysmaid though i intend to go with her and she may as well give in first as last for im going now see how nice i am to you sir ive provided you too with a post in her suite as you will come with me no never mind asking me what it is just yet all things come to him who waits and if you will only accept the post of waiter i mean all things to come to you  all things hilda i asked meaningly with a little tremor of delight  she looked at me with a sudden passing tenderness in her eyes yes all things hubert all things but we mustnt talk of thatthough i begin to see my way clearer now you shall be rewarded for your constancy at last dear knighterrant as to my chaperon im not afraid of her boring me she bores herself poor lady one can see that just to look at her but she will be much less bored if she has us two to travel with what she needs is constant companionship bright talk excitement she has come away from london where she swims with the crowd she has no resources of her own no work no head no interests accustomed to a whirl of foolish gaieties she wearies her small brain thrown back upon herself she bores herself at once because she has nothing interesting to tell herself she absolutely requires somebody else to interest her she cant even amuse herself with a book for three minutes together see she has a yellowbacked french novel now and she is only able to read five lines at a time then she gets tired and glances about her listlessly what she wants is someone gay laid on to divert her all the time from her own inanity  hilda how wonderfully quick you are at reading these things i see you are right but i could never have guessed so much myself from such small premises  well what can you expect my dear boy a girl like this brought up in a country rectory a girl of no intellect busy at home with the fowls and the pastry and the mothers meetingssuddenly married offhand to a wealthy man and deprived of the occupations which were her salvation in life to be plunged into the whirl of a london season and stranded at its end for want of the diversions which by dint of use have become necessaries of life to her  now hilda you are practising upon my credulity you cant possibly tell from her look that she was brought up in a country rectory  of course not you forget there my memory comes in i simply remember it  you remember it how  why just in the same way as i remembered your name and your mothers when i was first introduced to you i saw a notice once in the births deaths and marriagesat st alpheges millington by the rev hugh clitheroe ma father of the bride peter gubbins esq of the laurels middleston to emilia frances third daughter of the rev hugh clitheroe rector of millington  clitheroegubbins what on earth has that to do with it that would be mrs gubbins this is lady meadowcroft  the same article as the shopmen sayonly under a different name a year or two later i read a notice in the times that i ivor de courcy meadowcroft of the laurels middleston mayorelect of the borough of middleston hereby give notice that i have this day discontinued the use of the name peter gubbins by which i was formerly known and have assumed in lieu thereof the style and title of ivor de courcy meadowcroft by which i desire in future to be known  a month or two later again i happened to light upon a notice in the telegraph that the prince of wales had opened a new hospital for incurables at middleston and that the mayor mr ivor meadowcroft had received an intimation of her majestys intention of conferring upon him the honour of knighthood now what do you make of it  putting two and two together i answered with my eye on our subject and taking into consideration the ladys face and manner i should incline to suspect that she was the daughter of a poor parson with the usual large family in inverse proportion to his means that she unexpectedly made a good match with a very wealthy manufacturer who had raised himself and that she was puffed up accordingly with a sense of selfimportance  exactly he is a millionaire or something very like it and being an ambitious girl as she understands ambition she got him to stand for the mayoralty i dont doubt in the year when the prince of wales was going to open the royal incurables on purpose to secure him the chance of a knighthood then she said very reasonably i wont be lady gubbinssir peter gubbins theres an aristocratic name for youand by a stroke of his pen he straightway disgubbinised himself and emerged as sir ivor de courcy meadowcroft  really hilda you know everything about everybody and what do you suppose theyre going to india for  now youve asked me a hard one i havent the faintest notion and yet let me think how is this for a conjecture sir ivor is interested in steel rails i believe and in railway plant generally im almost sure ive seen his name in connection with steel rails in reports of public meetings theres a new government railway now being built on the nepaul frontierone of these strategic railways i think they call themits mentioned in the papers we got at aden he might be going out for that we can watch his conversation and see what part of india he talks about  they dont seem inclined to give us much chance of talking i objected  no they are very exclusive but im very exclusive too and i mean to give them a touch of my exclusiveness i venture to predict that before we reach bombay theyll be going down on their knees and imploring us to travel with them  at table as it happened from next mornings breakfast the meadowcrofts sat next to us hilda was on one side of me lady meadowcroft on the other and beyond her again bluff yorkshire sir ivor with his cold hard honest blue north country eyes and his dignified pompous english breaking down at times into a north country colloquialism they talked chiefly to each other acting on hildas instructions i took care not to engage in conversation with our exclusive neighbour except so far as the absolute necessities of the table compelled me i troubled her for the salt in the most frigid voice may i pass you the potato salad became on my lips a barrier of separation lady meadowcroft marked and wondered people of her sort are so anxious to ingratiate themselves with all the best people that if they find you are wholly unconcerned about the privilege of conversation with a titled person they instantly judge you to be a distinguished character as the days rolled on lady meadowcrofts voice began to melt by degrees once she asked me quite civilly to send round the ice she even saluted me on the third day out with a polite goodmorning doctor  still i maintained by hildas advice my dignified reserve and took my seat severely with a cold goodmorning i behaved like a highclass consultant who expects to be made physician in ordinary to her majesty  at lunch that day hilda played her first card with delicious unconsciousnessapparent unconsciousness for when she chose she was a consummate actress she played it at a moment when lady meadowcroft who by this time was burning with curiosity on our account had paused from her talk with her husband to listen to us i happened to say something about some oriental curios belonging to an aunt of mine in london hilda seized the opportunity what did you say was her name she asked blandly  why lady tepping i answered in perfect innocence she has a fancy for these things you know she brought a lot of them home with her from burma  as a matter of fact as i have already explained my poor dear aunt is an extremely commonplace old army widow whose husband happened to get knighted among the new years honours for some brush with the natives on the shan frontier but lady meadowcroft was at the stage where a title is a title and the discovery that i was the nephew of a titled person evidently interested her i could feel rather than see that she glanced significantly aside at sir ivor and that sir ivor in return made a little movement of his shoulders equivalent to i told you so  now hilda knew perfectly well that the aunt of whom i spoke was lady tepping so i felt sure that she had played this card of malice prepense to pique lady meadowcroft  but lady meadowcroft herself seized the occasion with inartistic avidity she had hardly addressed us as yet at the sound of the magic passport she pricked up her ears and turned to me suddenly burma she said as if to conceal the true reason for her change of front burma i had a cousin there once he was in the gloucestershire regiment  indeed i answered my tone was one of utter unconcern in her cousins history miss wade will you take bombay ducks with your curry in public i thought it wise under the circumstances to abstain from calling her hilda it might lead to misconceptions people might suppose we were more than fellowtravellers  you have had relations in burma lady meadowcroft persisted  i manifested a desire to discontinue the conversation yes i answered coldly my uncle commanded there  commanded there really ivor do you hear dr cumberledges uncle commanded in burma a faint intonation on the word commanded drew unobtrusive attention to its social importance may i ask what was his namemy cousin was there you see an insipid smile we may have friends in common  he was a certain sir malcolm tepping i blurted out staring hard at my plate  tepping i think i have heard dick speak of him ivor  your cousin sir ivor answered with emphatic dignity is certain to have mixed with nobbut the highest officials in burma  yes im sure dick used to speak of a certain sir malcolm my cousins name dr cumberledge was maltbycaptain richard maltby  indeed i answered with an icy stare i cannot pretend to the pleasure of having met him  be exclusive to the exclusive and they burn to know you from that moment forth lady meadowcroft pestered us with her endeavours to scrape acquaintance instead of trying how far she could place her chair from us she set it down as near us as politeness permitted she entered into conversation whenever an opening afforded itself and we two stood off haughtily she even ventured to question me about our relation to one another miss wade is your cousin i suppose she suggested  oh dear no i answered with a glassy smile we are not connected in any way  but you are travelling together  merely as you and i are travelling togetherfellowpassengers on the same steamer  still you have met before  yes certainly miss wade was a nurse at st nathaniels in london where i was one of the house doctors when i came on board at cape town after some months in south africa i found she was going by the same steamer to india which was literally true to have explained the rest would have been impossible at least to anyone who did not know the whole of hildas history  and what are you both going to do when you get to india  really lady meadowcroft i said severely i have not asked miss wade what she is going to do if you inquire of her pointblank as you have inquired of me i dare say she will tell you for myself i am just a globetrotter amusing myself i only want to have a look round at india  then you are not going out to take an appointment  by george emmie the burly yorkshireman put in with an air of annoyance you are crossquestioning dr cumberledge nowt less than crossquestioning him  i waited a second no i answered slowly i have not been practising of late i am looking about me i travel for enjoyment  that made her think better of me she was of the kind indeed who think better of a man if they believe him to be idle  she dawdled about all day on deck chairs herself seldom even reading and she was eager now to drag hilda into conversation hilda resisted she had found a volume in the library which immensely interested her  what are you reading miss wade lady meadowcroft cried at last quite savagely it made her angry to see anybody else pleased and occupied when she herself was listless  a delightful book hilda answered the buddhist praying wheel by william simpson  lady meadowcroft took it from her and turned the pages over with a languid air looks awfully dull she observed with a faint smile at last returning it  its charming hilda retorted glancing at one of the illustrations it explains so much it shows one why one turns round ones chair at cards for luck and why when a church is consecrated the bishop walks three times about it sunwise  our bishop is a dreadfully prosy old gentleman lady meadowcroft answered gliding off at a tangent on a personality as is the wont of her kind he had oh such a dreadful quarrel with my father over the rules of the st alphege schools at millington  indeed hilda answered turning once more to her book lady meadowcroft looked annoyed it would never have occurred to her that within a few weeks she was to owe her life to that very abstruse work and what hilda had read in it  that afternoon as we watched the flying fish from the ships side hilda said to me abruptly my chaperon is an extremely nervous woman  nervous about what  about disease chiefly she has the temperament that dreads infectionand therefore catches it  why do you think so  havent you noticed that she often doubles her thumb under her fingersfolds her fist across itsoespecially when anybody talks about anything alarming if the conversation happens to turn on jungle fever or any subject like that down goes her thumb instantly and she clasps her fist over it with a convulsive squeeze at the same time too her face twitches i know what that trick means shes horribly afraid of tropical diseases though she never says so  and you attach importance to her fear  of course i count upon it as probably our chief means of catching and fixing her  as how  she shook her head and quizzed me wait and see you are a doctor i a trained nurse before twentyfour hours i foresee she will ask us she is sure to ask us now she has learned that you are lady teppings nephew and that i am acquainted with several of the best people  that evening about ten oclock sir ivor strolled up to me in the smokingroom with affected unconcern he laid his hand on my arm and drew me aside mysteriously the ships doctor was there playing a quiet game of poker with a few of the passengers i beg your pardon dr cumberledge he began in an undertone could you come outside with me a minute lady meadowcroft has sent me up to you with a message  i followed him on to the open deck it is quite impossible my dear sir i said shaking my head austerely for i divined his errand i cant go and see lady meadowcroft medical etiquette you know the constant and salutary rule of the profession  why not he asked astonished  the ship carries a surgeon i replied in my most precise tone he is a duly qualified gentleman very able in his profession and he ought to inspire your wife with confidence i regard this vessel as dr boyells practice and all on board it as virtually his patients  sir ivors face fell but lady meadowcroft is not at all well he answered looking piteous andshe cant endure the ships doctor such a common man you know his loud voice disturbs her you must have noticed that my wife is a lady of exceptionally delicate nervous organisation he hesitated beamed on me and played his trump card she dislikes being attended by owt but a gentleman  if a gentleman is also a medical man i answered his sense of duty towards his brother practitioners would of course prevent him from interfering in their proper sphere or putting upon them the unmerited slight of letting them see him preferred before them  then you positively refuse he asked wistfully drawing back i could see he stood in a certain dread of that imperious little woman  i conceded a point i will go down in twenty minutes i admitted looking gravenot just now lest i annoy my colleagueand i will glance at lady meadowcroft in an unprofessional way if i think her case demands treatment i will tell dr boyell and i returned to the smokingroom and took up a novel  twenty minutes later i knocked at the door of the ladys private cabin with my best bedside manner in full play as i suspected she was nervousnothing moremy mere smile reassured her i observed that she held her thumb fast doubled under in her fist all the time i was questioning her as hilda had said and i also noticed that the fingers closed about it convulsively at first but gradually relaxed as my voice restored confidence she thanked me profusely and was really grateful  on deck next day she was very communicative they were going to make the regular tour first she said but were to go on to the tibetan frontier at the end where sir ivor had a contract to construct a railway in a very wild region tigers natives oh she didnt mind either of them but she was told that that districtwhat did they call it the terai or somethingwas terribly unwholesome fever was whatyoumaycallit thereyes endemicthat was the word oh thank you dr cumberledge she hated the very name of fever now you miss wade i suppose with an awestruck smile are not in the least afraid of it  hilda looked up at her calmly not in the least she answered i have nursed hundreds of cases  oh my how dreadful and never caught it  never i am not afraid you see  i wish i wasnt hundreds of cases it makes one ill to think of it and all successfully  almost all of them  you dont tell your patients stories when theyre ill about your other cases who died do you lady meadowcroft went on with a quick little shudder  hildas face by this time was genuinely sympathetic oh never she answered with truth that would be very bad nursing ones object in treating a case is to make ones patient well so one naturally avoids any sort of subject that might be distressing or alarming  you really mean it her face was pleading  why of course i try to make my patients my friends i talk to them cheerfully i amuse them and distract them i get them away as far as i can from themselves and their symptoms  oh what a lovely person to have about one when ones ill the languid lady exclaimed ecstatically i should like to send for you if i wanted nursing but thereits always so of course with a real lady common nurses frighten one so i wish i could always have a lady to nurse me  a person who sympathisesthat is the really important thing hilda answered in her quiet voice one must find out first ones patients temperament you are nervous i can see she laid one hand on her new friends arm you need to be kept amused and engaged when you are ill what you require most isinsightand sympathy  the little fist doubled up again the vacant face grew positively sweet thats just it you have hit it how clever you are i want all that i suppose miss wade you never go out for private nursing  never hilda answered you see lady meadowcroft i dont nurse for a livelihood i have means of my own i took up this work as an occupation and a sphere in life i havent done anything yet but hospital nursing  lady meadowcroft drew a slight sigh what a pity she murmured slowly it does seem hard that your sympathies should all be thrown away so to speak on a horrid lot of wretched poor people instead of being spent on your own equalswho would so greatly appreciate them  i think i can venture to say the poor appreciate them too hilda answered bridling up a littlefor there was nothing she hated so much as classprejudices besides they need sympathy more they have fewer comforts i should not care to give up attending my poor people for the sake of the idle rich  the set phraseology of the country rectory recurred to lady meadowcroftour poorer brethren and so forth oh of course she answered with the mechanical acquiescence such women always give to moral platitudes one must do ones best for the poor i knowfor conscience sake and all that its our duty and we all try hard to do it but theyre so terribly ungrateful dont you think so do you know miss wade in my fathers parish  hilda cut her short with a sunny smilehalf contemptuous toleration half genuine pity we are all ungrateful she said but the poor i think the least so im sure the gratitude ive often had from my poor women at st nathaniels has made me sometimes feel really ashamed of myself i had done so littleand they thanked me so much for it  which only shows lady meadowcroft broke in that one ought always to have a lady to nurse one  ca marche hilda said to me with a quiet smile a few minutes after when her ladyship had disappeared in her fluffy robe down the companionladder  yes ca marche i answered in an hour or two you will have succeeded in landing your chaperon and what is most amusing landed her too hilda just by being yourselfletting her see frankly the actual truth of what you think and feel about her and about everyone  i could not do otherwise hilda answered growing grave i must be myself or die for it my method of angling consists in showing myself just as i am you call me an actress but i am not really one i am only a woman who can use her personality for her own purposes if i go with lady meadowcroft it will be a mutual advantage i shall really sympathise with her for i can see the poor thing is devoured with nervousness  but do you think you will be able to stand her i asked  oh dear yes shes not a bad little thing au fond when you get to know her it is society that has spoilt her she would have made a nice helpful motherly body if shed married the curate  as we neared bombay conversation grew gradually more and more indian it always does under similar circumstances a sea voyage is half retrospect half prospect it has no personal identity you leave liverpool for new york at the english standpoint and are full of what you did in london or manchester halfway over you begin to discuss american customhouses and new york hotels by the time you reach sandy hook the talk is all of quick trains west and the shortest route from philadelphia to new orleans you grow by slow stages into the new attitude at malta you are still regretting europe after aden your mind dwells most on the hire of punkahwallahs and the proverbial toughness of the dakbungalow chicken  hows the plague at bombay now an inquisitive passenger inquired of the captain at dinner our last night out getting any better  lady meadowcrofts thumb dived between her fingers again what is there plague in bombay she asked innocently in her nervous fashion  plague in bombay the captain burst out his burly voice resounding down the saloon why bless your soul maam where else would you expect it plague in bombay its been there these five years better not quite going ahead like mad theyre dying by thousands  a microbe i believe dr boyell the inquisitive passenger observed deferentially with due respect for medical science  yes the ships doctor answered helping himself to an olive forty million microbes to each square inch of the bombay atmosphere  and we are going to bombay lady meadowcroft exclaimed aghast  you must have known there was plague there my dear sir ivor put in soothingly with a deprecating glance its been in all the papers but only the natives get it  the thumb uncovered itself a little oh only the natives lady meadowcroft echoed relieved as if a few thousand hindus more or less would hardly be missed among the blessings of british rule in india you know ivor i never read those dreadful things in the papers i read the society news and our social diary and columns that are headed mainly about people i dont care for anything but the morning post and the world and truth i hate horrors but its a blessing to think its only the natives  plenty of europeans too bless your heart the captain thundered out unfeelingly why last time i was in port a nurse died at the hospital  oh only a nurse lady meadowcroft began and then coloured up deeply with a side glance at hilda  and lots besides nurses the captain continued positively delighted at the terror he was inspiring pucka englishmen and englishwomen bad business this plague dr cumberledge catches particularly those who are most afraid of it  but its only in bombay lady meadowcroft cried clutching at the last straw i could see she was registering a mental determination to go straight upcountry the moment she landed  not a bit of it the captain answered with provoking cheerfulness rampaging about like a roaring lion all over india  lady meadowcrofts thumb must have suffered severely the nails dug into it as if it were someone elses  half an hour later as we were on deck in the cool of the evening the thing was settled my wife sir ivor said coming up to us with a serious face has delivered her ultimatum positively her ultimatum ive had a mort o trouble with her and now shes settled either she goes back from bombay by the return steamer or elseyou and miss wade must name your own terms to accompany us on our tour in case of emergencies he glanced wistfully at hilda do you think you can help us  hilda made no hypocritical pretence of hanging back her nature was transparent if you wish it yes she answered shaking hands upon the bargain i only want to go about and see india i can see it quite as well with lady meadowcroft as without herand even better it is unpleasant for a woman to travel unattached i require a chaperon and am glad to find one i will join your party paying my own hotel and travelling expenses and considering myself as engaged in case your wife should need my services for that you can pay me if you like some nominal retaining feefive pounds or anything the money is immaterial to me i like to be useful and i sympathise with nerves but it may make your wife feel she is really keeping a hold over me if we put the arrangement on a business basis as a matter of fact whatever sum she chooses to pay i shall hand it over at once to the bombay plague hospital  sir ivor looked relieved thank you ever so much he said wringing her hand warmly i thowt you were a brick and now i know it my wife says your face inspires confidence and your voice sympathy she must have you with her and you dr cumberledge  i follow miss wades lead i answered in my most solemn tone with an impressive bow i too am travelling for instruction and amusement only and if it would give lady meadowcroft a greater sense of security to have a duly qualified practitioner in her suite i shall be glad on the same terms to swell your party i will pay my own way and i will allow you to name any nominal sum you please for your claim on my medical attendance if necessary i hope and believe however that our presence will so far reassure our prospective patient as to make our post in both cases a sinecure  three minutes later lady meadowcroft rushed on deck and flung her arms impulsively round hilda you dear good girl she cried how sweet and kind of you i really couldnt have landed if you hadnt promised to come with us and dr cumberledge too so nice and friendly of you both but there it is so much pleasanter to deal with ladies and gentlemen  so hilda won her point and what was best won it fairly    chapter x  the episode of the guide who knew the country   we toured all round india with the meadowcrofts and really the lady who was so very exclusive turned out not a bad little thing when once one had succeeded in breaking through the ringfence with which she surrounded herself she had an endless quenchless restlessness it is true her eyes wandered aimlessly she never was happy for two minutes together unless she was surrounded by friends and was seeing something what she saw did not interest her much certainly her tastes were on the level with those of a very young child an oddlooking house a queerly dressed man a tree cut into shape to look like a peacock delighted her far more than the most glorious view of the quaintest old temple still she must be seeing she could no more sit still than a fidgety child or a monkey at the zoo to be up and doing was her naturedoing nothing to be sure but still doing it strenuously  so we went the regulation round of delhi and agra the taj mahal and the ghats at benares at railroad speed fulfilling the whole duty of the modern globetrotter lady meadowcroft looked at everythingfor ten minutes at a stretch then she wanted to be off to visit the next thing set down for her in her guidebook as we left each town she murmured mechanically well weve seen that thank heaven and straightway went on with equal eagerness and equal boredom to see the one after it  the only thing that did not bore her indeed was hildas bright talk  oh miss wade she would say clasping her hands and looking up into hildas eyes with her own empty blue ones you are so funny so original dont you know you never talk or think of anything like other people i cant imagine how such ideas come up in your mind if i were to try all day im sure i should never hit upon them which was so perfectly true as to be a trifle obvious  sir ivor not being interested in temples but in steel rails had gone on at once to his concession or contract or whatever else it was on the northeast frontier leaving his wife to follow and rejoin him in the himalayas as soon as she had exhausted the sights of india so after a few dusty weeks of wear and tear on the indian railways we met him once more in the recesses of nepaul where he was busy constructing a light local line for the reigning maharajah  if lady meadowcroft had been bored at allahabad and ajmere she was immensely more bored in a rough bungalow among the trackless depths of the himalayan valleys to anybody with eyes in his head indeed toloo where sir ivor had pitched his headquarters was lovely enough to keep one interested for a twelvemonth snowclad needles of rock hemmed it in on either side great deodars rose like huge tapers on the hillsides the plants and flowers were a joy to look at but lady meadowcroft did not care for flowers which one could not wear in ones hair and what was the good of dressing here with no one but ivor and dr cumberledge to see one she yawned till she was tired then she began to grow peevish  why ivor should want to build a railway at all in this stupid silly place she said as we sat in the veranda in the cool of evening im sure i cant imagine we must go somewhere this is maddening maddening miss wadedr cumberledgei count upon you to discover something for me to do if i vegetate like this seeing nothing all day long but those eternal hillsshe clenched her little fisti shall go mad with ennui  hilda had a happy thought i have a fancy to see some of these buddhist monasteries she said smiling as one smiles at a tiresome child whom one likes in spite of everything you remember i was reading that book of mr simpsons on the steamercoming outa curious book about the buddhist praying wheels and it made me want to see one of their temples immensely what do you say to camping out a few weeks in the hills it would be an adventure at any rate  camping out lady meadowcroft exclaimed half roused from her languor by the idea of a change oh do you think that would be fun should we sleep on the ground but wouldnt it be dreadfully horribly uncomfortable  not half so uncomfortable as youll find yourself here at toloo in a few days emmie her husband put in grimly the rains will soon be on lass and when the rains are on by all accounts theyre precious heavy hereaboutsrare fine rains so that a mans halfflooded out of his bed o nightswhich wont suit you my lady  the poor little woman clasped her twitching hands in feeble agony oh ivor how dreadful is it what they call the mongoose or monsoon or something but if theyre so bad here surely theyll be worse in the hillsand camping out toowont they  not if you go the right way to work ahm told it never rains tother side o the hills the mountains stop the clouds and once youre over youre safe enough only you must take care to keep well in the maharajahs territory cross the frontier tother side into tibet an theyll skin thee alive as soon as look at thee they dont like strangers in tibet prejudiced against them somehow they pretty well skinned that young chap landor who tried to go there a year ago  but ivor i dont want to be skinned alive im not an eel please  thats all right lass leave that to me i can get thee a guide a man thats very well acquainted with the mountains i was talking to a scientific explorer here tother day and he knows of a good guide who can take you anywhere hell get you the chance of seeing the inside of a buddhist monastery if you like miss wade hes hand in glove with all the religion theyve got in this part o the country theyve got noan much but at what there is hes a rare devout one  we discussed the matter fully for two or three days before we made up our minds lady meadowcroft was undecided between her hatred of dulness and her haunting fear that scorpions and snakes would intrude upon our tents and beds while we were camping in the end however the desire for change carried the day she decided to dodge the rainy season by getting behind the himalayanpasses in the dry region to the north of the great range where rain seldom falls the country being watered only by the melting of the snows on the high summits  this decision delighted hilda who since she came to india had fallen a prey to the fashionable vice of amateur photography she took to it enthusiastically she had bought herself a firstrate camera of the latest scientific pattern at bombay and ever since had spent all her time and spoiled her pretty hands in developing she was also seized with a craze for buddhism the objects that everywhere particularly attracted her were the old buddhist temples and tombs and sculptures with which india is studded of these she had taken some hundreds of views all printed by herself with the greatest care and precision but in india after all buddhism is a dead creed its monuments alone remain she was anxious to see the buddhist religion in its living state and that she could only do in these remote outlying himalayan valleys  our outfit therefore included a dark tent for hildas photographic apparatus a couple of roomy tents to live and sleep in a small cookingstove a cook to look after it halfadozen bearers and the highly recommended guide who knew his way about the country in three days we were ready to sir ivors great delight he was fond of his pretty wife and proud of her i believe but when once she was away from the whirl and bustle of the london that she loved it was a relief to him i fancy to pursue his work alone unhampered by her restless and querulous childishness  on the morning when we were to make our start the guide who was well acquainted with the mountains turned upas villainouslooking a person as i have ever set eyes on he was sullen and furtive i judged him at sight to be half hindu half tibetan he had a dark complexion between brown and tawny narrow slant eyes very small and beadyblack with a cunning leer in their oblique corners a flat nose much broadened at the wings a cruel thick sensuous mouth and high cheekbones the whole surmounted by a comprehensive scowl and an abundant crop of lank black hair tied up in a knot at the nape of the neck with a yellow ribbon his face was shifty his short stout form looked well adapted to mountain climbing and also to wriggling a deep scar on his left cheek did not help to inspire confidence but he was polite and civilspoken altogether a clever unscrupulous wideawake soul who would serve you well if he thought he could make by it and would betray you at a pinch to the highest bidder  we set out in merry mood prepared to solve all the abstruse problems of the buddhist religion our spoilt child stood the camping out better than i expected she was fretful of course and worried about trifles she missed her maid and her accustomed comforts but she minded the roughing it less on the whole than she had minded the boredom of inaction in the bungalow and being cast on hilda and myself for resources she suddenly evolved an unexpected taste for producing developing and printing photographs we took dozens as we went along of little villages on our route woodbuilt villages with quaint houses and turrets and as hilda had brought her collection of prints with her for comparison of the indian and nepaulese monuments we spent the evenings after our short days march each day in arranging and collating them we had planned to be away six weeks at least in that time the monsoon would have burst and passed our guide thought we might see all that was worth seeing of the buddhist monasteries and sir ivor thought we should have fairly escaped the dreaded wet season  what do you make of our guide i asked of hilda on our fourth day out i began somehow to distrust him  oh he seems all right hilda answered carelesslyand her voice reassured me hes a rogue of course all guides and interpreters and dragomans and the like in outoftheway places always are rogues if they were honest men they would share the ordinary prejudices of their countrymen and would have nothing to do with the hated stranger but in this case our friend ram das has no end to gain by getting us into mischief if he had he wouldnt scruple for a second to cut our throats but then there are too many of us he will probably try to cheat us by making preposterous charges when he gets us back to toloo but thats lady meadowcrofts business i dont doubt sir ivor will be more than a match for him there ill back one shrewd yorkshireman against any three tibetan halfcastes any day  youre right that he would cut our throats if it served his purpose i answered hes servile and servility goes hand in hand with treachery the more i watch him the more i see scoundrel written in large type on every bend of the fellows oily shoulders  oh yes hes a bad lot i know the cook who can speak a little english and a little tibetan as well as hindustani tells me ram das has the worst reputation of any man in the mountains but he says hes a very good guide to the passes for all that and if hes well paid will do what hes paid for  next day but one we approached at last after several short marches the neighbourhood of what our guide assured us was a buddhist monastery i was glad when he told us of it giving the place the name of a wellknown nepaulese village for to say the truth i was beginning to get frightened judging by the sun for i had brought no compass it struck me that we seemed to have been marching almost due north ever since we left toloo and i fancied such a line of march must have brought us by this time suspiciously near the tibetan frontier now i had no desire to be skinned alive as sir ivor put it i did not wish to emulate st bartholomew and others of the early christian martyrs so i was pleased to learn that we were really drawing near to kulak the first of the nepaulese buddhist monasteries to which our wellinformed guide himself a buddhist had promised to introduce us  we were tramping up a beautiful high mountain valley closed round on every side by snowy peaks a brawling river ran over a rocky bed in cataracts down its midst crags rose abruptly a little in front of us halfway up the slope to the left on a ledge of rock rose a long low building with curious pyramidlike roofs crowned at either end by a sort of minaret which resembled more than anything else a huge earthenware oiljar this was the monastery or lamasery we had come so far to see honestly at first sight i did not feel sure it was worth the trouble  our guide called a halt and turned to us with a sudden peremptory air his servility had vanished you stoppee here he said slowly in broken english while mea go on to see whether lamasahibs ready to take you must ask leave from lamasahibs to visit village if no ask leavehe drew his hand across his throat with a significant gesturelamasahibs cuttee head off eulopean  goodness gracious lady meadowcroft cried clinging tight to hilda miss wade this is dreadful where on earth have you brought us to  oh thats all right hilda answered trying to soothe her though she herself began to look a trifle anxious thats only ram dass graphic way of putting things  we sat down on a bank of trailing clubmoss by the side of the rough track for it was nothing more and let our guide go on to negotiate with the lamas well tonight anyhow i exclaimed looking up we shall sleep on our own mattresses with a roof over our heads these monks will find us quarters thats always something  we got out our basket and made tea in all moments of doubt your englishwoman makes tea as hilda said she will boil her etna on vesuvius we waited and drank our tea we drank our tea and waited a full hour passed away ram das never came back i began to get frightened  at last something stirred a group of excited men in yellow robes issued forth from the monastery wound their way down the hill and approached us shouting they gesticulated as they came i could see they looked angry all at once hilda clutched my arm hubert she cried in an undertone we are betrayed i see it all now these are tibetans not nepaulese she paused a second then went on i see it allall all our guideram dashe had a reason after all for getting us into mischief sebastian must have tracked us he was bribed by sebastian it was he who recommended ram das to sir ivor  why do you think so i asked low  becauselook for yourself these men who come are dressed in yellow that means tibetans red is the colour of the lamas in nepaul yellow in tibet and all other buddhist countries i read it in the bookthe buddhist praying wheel you know these are tibetan fanatics and as ram das said they will probably cut our throats for us  i was thankful that hildas marvellous memory gave us even that moment for preparation and facing the difficulty i saw in a flash that she was quite right we had been inveigled across the frontier these moutis were tibetansbuddhist inquisitorsenemies tibet is the most jealous country on earth it allows no stranger to intrude upon its borders i had to meet the worst i stood there a single white man armed only with one revolver answerable for the lives of two english ladies and accompanied by a cringing outcaste ghoorka cook and halfadozen doubtful nepaulese bearers to fly was impossible we were fairly trapped there was nothing for it but to wait and put a bold face on our utter helplessness  i turned to our spoilt child lady meadowcroft i said very seriously this is danger real danger now listen to me you must do as you are bid no crying no cowardice your life and ours depend upon it we must none of us give way we must pretend to be brave show one sign of fear and these people will probably cut our throats on the spot here  to my immense surprise lady meadowcroft rose to the height of the situation oh as long as it isnt disease she answered resignedly im not much afraid of anything i should mind the plague a great deal more than i mind a set of howling savages  by that time the men in yellow robes had almost come up to us it was clear they were boiling over with indignation but they still did everything decently and in order one who was dressed in finer vestments than the resta portly person with the fat greasy cheeks and drooping flesh of a celibate church dignitary whom i therefore judged to be the abbot or chief lama of the monasterygave orders to his subordinates in a language which we did not understand his men obeyed him in a second they had closed us round as in a ring or cordon  then the chief lama stepped forward with an authoritative air like poohbah in the play and said something in the same tongue to the cook who spoke a little tibetan it was obvious from his manner that ram das had told them all about us for the lama selected the cook as interpreter at once without taking any notice of myself the ostensible head of the petty expedition  what does he say i asked as soon as he had finished speaking  the cook who had been salaaming all the time at the risk of a broken back in his most utterly abject and grovelling attitude made answer tremulously in his broken english this is priestsahib of the temple he very angry because why eulopeansahib and memsahibs come into tibetland no eulopean no hindu must come into tibetland priestsahib say cut all eulopean throats let nepaul man go back like him come to him own country  i looked as if the message were purely indifferent to me tell him i said smilingthough at some little effortwe were not trying to enter tibet our rascally guide misled us we were going to kulak in the maharajahs territory we will turn back quietly to the maharajahs land if the priestsahib will allow us to camp out for the night here  i glanced at hilda and lady meadowcroft i must say their bearing under these trying circumstances was thoroughly worthy of two english ladies they stood erect looking as though all tibet might come and they would smile at it scornfully  the cook interpreted my remarks as well as he was ablehis tibetan being probably about equal in quality to his english but the chief lama made a reply which i could see for myself was by no means friendly  what is his answer i asked the cook in my haughtiest voice i am haughty with difficulty  our interpreter salaamed once more shaking in his shoes if he wore any priestsahib say that all lies that all damlies you is eulopean missionary very bad man you want to go to lhasa but no white sahib must go to lhasa holy city lhasa for buddhists only this is not the way to kulak this not maharajahs land this place belonga dalailama head of all lamas have house at lhasa but priestsahib know you eulopean missionary want to go lhasa convert buddhists because ram das tell him so  ram das i exclaimed thoroughly angry by this time the rogue the scoundrel he has not only deserted us but betrayed us as well he has told this lie on purpose to set the tibetans against us we must face the worst now our one chance is to cajole these people  the fat priest spoke again what does he say this time i asked  he say ram das tell him all this because ram das good manvery good man ram das converted buddhist you pay ram das to guidee you to lhasa but ram das good man not want to let eulopean see holy city bring you here instead then tell priestsahib about it and he chuckled inwardly  what will they do to us lady meadowcroft asked her face very white though her manner was more courageous than i could easily have believed of her  i dont know i answered biting my lip but we must not give way we must put a bold face upon it their bark after all may be worse than their bite we may still persuade them to let us go back again  the men in yellow robes motioned us to move on towards the village and monastery we were their prisoners and it was useless to resist so i ordered the bearers to take up the tents and baggage lady meadowcroft resigned herself to the inevitable we mounted the path in a long line the lamas in yellow closely guarding our draggled little procession i tried my best to preserve my composure and above all else not to look dejected  as we approached the village with its squalid and fetid huts we caught the sound of bells innumerable bells tinkling at regular intervals many people trooped out from their houses to look at us all flatfaced all with oblique eyes all stolidly sullenly stupidly passive they seemed curious as to our dress and appearance but not apparently hostile we walked on to the low line of the monastery with its pyramidal roof and its queer flowervase minarets after a moments discussion they ushered us into the temple or chapel which was evidently also their communal councilroom and place of deliberation we entered trembling we had no great certainty that we would ever get out of it alive again  the temple was a large oblong hall with a great figure of buddha crosslegged imperturbable enthroned in a niche at its further end like the apse or recess in a church in italy before it stood an altar the buddha sat and smiled on us with his eternal smile a complacent deity carved out of white stone and gaudily painted a yellow robe like the lamas dangled across his shoulders the air seemed close with incense and also with bad ventilation the centre of the nave if i may so call it was occupied by a huge wooden cylinder a sort of overgrown drum painted in bright colours with ornamental designs and tibetan letters it was much taller than a man some nine feet high i should say and it revolved above and below on an iron spindle looking closer i saw it had a crank attached to it with a string tied to the crank a solitary monk absorbed in his devotions was pulling this string as we entered and making the cylinder revolve with a jerk as he pulled it at each revolution a bell above rang once the monk seemed as if his whole soul was bound up in the huge revolving drum and the bell worked by it  we took this all in at a glance somewhat vaguely at first for our lives were at stake and we were scarcely in a mood for ethnological observations but the moment hilda saw the cylinder her eye lighted up i could see at once an idea had struck her this is a prayingwheel she cried in quite a delighted voice i know where i am now hubertlady meadowcrofti see a way out of this do exactly as you see me do and all may yet go well dont show surprise at anything i think we can work upon these peoples religious feelings  without a moments hesitation she prostrated herself thrice on the ground before the figure of buddha knocking her head ostentatiously in the dust as she did so we followed suit instantly then hilda rose and began walking slowly round the big drum in the nave saying aloud at each step in a sort of monotonous chant like a priest intoning the four mystic words aum mani padme hum aum mani padme hum many times over we repeated the sacred formula after her as if we had always been brought up to it i noticed that hilda walked the way of the sun it is an important point in all these mysterious halfmagical ceremonies  at last after about ten or twelve such rounds she paused with an absorbed air of devotion and knocked her head three times on the ground once more doing poojah before the eversmiling buddha  by this time however the lessons of st alpheges rectory began to recur to lady meadowcrofts mind oh miss wade she murmured in an awestruck voice ought we to do like this isnt it clear idolatry  hildas common sense waved her aside at once idolatry or not it is the only way to save our lives she answered in her firmest voice  butought we to save our lives oughtnt we to be well christian martyrs  hilda was patience itself i think not dear she replied gently but decisively you are not called upon to be a martyr the danger of idolatry is scarcely so great among europeans of our time that we need feel it a duty to protest with our lives against it i have better uses to which to put my life myself i dont mind being a martyrwhere a sufficient cause demands it but i dont think such a sacrifice is required of us now in a tibetan monastery life was not given us to waste on gratuitous martyrdoms  but really im afraid  dont be afraid of anything dear or you will risk all follow my lead i will answer for your conduct surely if naaman in the midst of idolaters was permitted to bow down in the house of rimmon to save his place at court you may blamelessly bow down to save your life in a buddhist temple now no more casuistry but do as i tell you aum mani padme hum again once more round the drum there  we followed her a second time lady meadowcroft giving in after a feeble protest the priests in yellow looked on profoundly impressed by our circumnavigation it was clear they began to reconsider the question of our nefarious designs on their holy city  after we had finished our second tour round the drum with the utmost solemnity one of the monks approached hilda whom he seemed to take now for an important priestess he said something to her in tibetan which of course we did not understand but as he pointed at the same time to the brother on the floor who was turning the wheel hilda nodded acquiescence if you wish it she said in englishand he appeared to comprehend he wants to know whether i would like to take a turn at the cylinder  she knelt down in front of it before the little stool where the brother in yellow had been kneeling till that moment and took the string in her hand as if she were well accustomed to it i could see that the abbot gave the cylinder a surreptitious push with his left hand before she began so as to make it revolve in the opposite direction from that in which the monk had just been moving it this was obviously to try her but hilda let the string drop with a little cry of horror that was the wrong way roundthe unlucky uncanonical direction the evil way widdershins the opposite of sunwise with an awed air she stopped short repeated once more the four mystic words or mantra and bowed thrice with wellassumed reverence to the buddha then she set the cylinder turning of her own accord with her right hand in the propitious direction and sent it round seven times with the utmost gravity  at this point encouraged by hildas example i too became possessed of a brilliant inspiration i opened my purse and took out of it four brandnew silver rupees of the indian coinage they were very handsome and shiny coins each impressed with an excellent design of the head of the queen as empress of india holding them up before me i approached the buddha and laid the four in a row submissively at his feet uttering at the same time an appropriate formula but as i did not know the proper mantra for use upon such an occasion i supplied one from memory saying in a hushed voice hokeypokeywinkywum as i laid each one before the benignlysmiling statue i have no doubt from their faces the priests imagined i was uttering a most powerful spell or prayer in my own language  as soon as i retreated with my face towards the image the chief lama glided up and examined the coins carefully it was clear he had never seen anything of the sort before for he gazed at them for some minutes and then showed them round to his monks with an air of deep reverence i do not doubt he took the image of her gracious majesty for a very mighty and potent goddess as soon as all had inspected them with many cries of admiration he opened a little secret drawer or relicholder in the pedestal of the statue and deposited them in it with a muttered prayer as precious offerings from a european buddhist  by this time we could easily see we were beginning to produce a most favourable impression hildas study of buddhism had stood us in good stead the chief lama or abbot motioned to us to be seated in a much politer mood after which he and his principal monks held a long and animated conversation together i gathered from their looks and gestures that the head lama inclined to regard us as orthodox buddhists but that some of his followers had grave doubts of their own as to the depth and reality of our religious convictions  while they debated and hesitated hilda had another splendid idea she undid her portfolio and took out of it the photographs of ancient buddhist topes and temples which she had taken in india these she produced triumphantly at once the priests and monks crowded round us to look at them in a moment when they recognised the meaning of the pictures their excitement grew quite intense the photographs were passed round from hand to hand amid loud exclamations of joy and surprise one brother would point out with astonishment to another some familiar symbol or some ancient text two or three of them in their devout enthusiasm fell down on their knees and kissed the pictures  we had played a trump card the monks could see for themselves by this time that we were deeply interested in buddhism now minds of that calibre never understand a disinterested interest the moment they saw we were collectors of buddhist pictures they jumped at once to the conclusion that we must also of course be devout believers so far did they carry their sense of fraternity indeed that they insisted upon embracing us that was a hard trial to lady meadowcroft for the brethren were not conspicuous for personal cleanliness she suspected germs and she dreaded typhoid far more than she dreaded the tibetan cutthroat  the brethren asked through the medium of our interpreter the cook where these pictures had been made we explained as well as we could by means of the same mouthpiece a very earthen vessel that they came from ancient buddhist buildings in india this delighted them still more though i know not in what form our ghoorka retainer may have conveyed the information at any rate they insisted on embracing us again after which the chief lama said something very solemnly to our amateur interpreter  the cook interpreted priestsahib say he too got very sacred thing come from india sacred buddhist poojahthing go to show it to you  we waited breathless the chief lama approached the altar before the recess in front of the great crosslegged vapidly smiling buddha he bowed himself to the ground three times over as well as his portly frame would permit him knocking his forehead against the floor just as hilda had done then he proceeded almost awestruck to take from the altar an object wrapped round with gold brocade and very carefully guarded two acolytes accompanied him in the most reverent way he slowly unwound the folds of gold cloth and released from its hidingplace the highly sacred deposit he held it up before our eyes with an air of triumph it was an english bottle  the label on it shone with gold and bright colours i could see it was figured the figure represented a cat squatting on its haunches the sacred inscription ran in our own tongue old tom gin unsweetened  the monks bowed their heads in profound silence as the sacred thing was produced i caught hildas eye for heavens sake i murmured low dont either of you laugh if you do its all up with us  they kept their countenances with admirable decorum  another idea struck me tell them i said to the cook that we too have a similar and very powerful god but much more lively he interpreted my words to them  then i opened our stores and drew out with a flourishour last remaining bottle of simla sodawater  very solemnly and seriously i unwired the cork as if performing an almost sacrosanct ceremony the monks crowded round with the deepest curiosity i held the cork down for a second with my thumb while i uttered once more in my most awesome tone the mystic words hokeypokeywinkywum then i let it fly suddenly the sodawater was well up the cork bounded to the ceiling the contents of the bottle spurted out over the place in the most impressive fashion  for a minute the lamas drew back alarmed the thing seemed almost devilish then slowly reassured by our composure they crept back and looked with a glance of inquiry at the abbot i took out my pocket corkscrew and drew the cork of the ginbottle which had never been opened i signed for a cup they brought me one reverently i poured out a little gin to which i added some sodawater and drank first of it myself to show them it was not poison after that i handed it to the chief lama who sipped at it sipped again and emptied the cup at the third trial evidently the sacred drink was very much to his taste for he smacked his lips after it and turned with exclamations of surprised delight to his inquisitive companions  the rest of the sodawater duly mixed with gin soon went the round of the expectant monks it was greatly approved of unhappily there was not quite enough soda water to supply a drink for all of them but those who tasted it were deeply impressed i could see that they took the bite of carbonicacid gas for evidence of a most powerful and present deity  that settled our position we were instantly regarded not only as buddhists but as mighty magicians from a far country the monks made haste to show us rooms destined for our use in the monastery they were not unbearably filthy and we had our own bedding we had to spend the night there that was certain we had at least escaped the worst and most pressing danger i may add that i believe our cook to have been a most arrant liarwhich was a lucky circumstance once the wretched creature saw the tide turn i have reason to infer that he supported our cause by telling the chief lama the most incredible stories about our holiness and power at any rate it is certain that we were regarded with the utmost respect and treated thenceforth with the affectionate deference due to acknowledged and certified sainthood  it began to strike us now however that we had almost overshot the mark in this matter of sanctity we had made ourselves quite too holy the monks who were eager at first to cut our throats thought so much of us now that we grew a little anxious as to whether they would not wish to keep such devout souls in their midst for ever as a matter of fact we spent a whole week against our wills in the monastery being very well fed and treated meanwhile yet virtually captives it was the camera that did it the lamas had never seen any photographs before they asked how these miraculous pictures were produced and hilda to keep up the good impression showed them how she operated when a fulllength portrait of the chief lama in his sacrificial robes was actually printed off and exhibited before their eyes their delight knew no bounds the picture was handed about among the astonished brethren and received with loud shouts of joy and wonder nothing would satisfy them then but that we must photograph every individual monk in the place even the buddha himself crosslegged and imperturbable had to sit for his portrait as he was used to sittingnever indeed having done anything elsehe came out admirably  day after day passed suns rose and suns set and it was clear that the monks did not mean to let us leave their precincts in a hurry lady meadowcroft having recovered by this time from her first fright began to grow bored the buddhists ritual ceased to interest her to vary the monotony i hit upon an expedient for killing time till our too pressing hosts saw fit to let us depart they were fond of religious processions of the most protracted sortdances before the altar with animal masks or heads and other weird ceremonial orgies hilda who had read herself up in buddhist ideas assured me that all these things were done in order to heap up karma  what is karma i asked listlessly  karma is good works or merit the more prayingwheels you turn the more bells you ring the greater the merit one of the monks is always at work turning the big wheel that moves the bell so as to heap up merit night and day for the monastery  this set me thinking i soon discovered that no matter how the wheel is turned the karma or merit is equal it is the turning it that counts not the personal exertion there were wheels and bells in convenient situations all over the village and whoever passed one gave it a twist as he went by thus piling up karma for all the inhabitants reflecting upon these facts i was seized with an idea i got hilda to take instantaneous photographs of all the monks during a sacred procession at rapid intervals in that sunny climate we had no difficulty at all in printing off from the plates as soon as developed then i took a small wheel about the size of an oysterbarrelthe monks had dozens of themand pasted the photographs inside in successive order like what is called a zoetrope or wheel of life by cutting holes in the side and arranging a mirror from lady meadowcrofts dressingbag i completed my machine so that when it was turned round rapidly one saw the procession actually taking place as if the figures were moving the thing in short made a living picture like a cinematograph a mountain stream ran past the monastery and supplied it with water i had a second inspiration i was always mechanical i fixed a waterwheel in the stream where it made a petty cataract and connected it by means of a small crank with the barrel of photographs my zoetrope thus worked off itself and piled up karma for all the village whether anyone happened to be looking at it or not  the monks who were really excellent fellows when not engaged in cutting throats in the interest of the faith regarded this device as a great and glorious religious invention they went down on their knees to it and were profoundly respectful they also bowed to me so deeply when i first exhibited it that i began to be puffed up with spiritual pride lady meadowcroft recalled me to my better self by murmuring with a sigh i suppose we really cant draw a line now but it does seem to me like encouraging idolatry  purely mechanical encouragement i answered gazing at my handicraft with an inventors pardonable pride you see it is the turning itself that does good not any prayers attached to it i divert the idolatry from human worshippers to an unconscious streamwhich must surely be meritorious then i thought of the mystic sentence aum mani padme hum what a pity it is i cried i couldnt make them a phonograph to repeat their mantra if i could they might fulfil all their religious duties together by machinery  hilda reflected a second there is a great future she said at last for the man who first introduces smokejacks into tibet every household will buy one as an automatic means of acquiring karma  dont publish that idea in england i exclaimed hastilyif ever we get there as sure as you do somebody will see in it an opening for british trade and we shall spend twenty millions on conquering tibet in the interests of civilisation and a smokejack syndicate  how long we might have stopped at the monastery i cannot say had it not been for the intervention of an unexpected episode which occurred just a week after our first arrival we were comfortable enough in a rough way with our ghoorka cook to prepare our food for us and our bearers to wait but to the end i never felt quite sure of our hosts who after all were entertaining us under false pretences we had told them truly enough that buddhist missionaries had now penetrated to england and though they had not the slightest conception where england might be and knew not the name of madame blavatsky this news interested them regarding us as promising neophytes they were anxious now that we should go on to lhasa in order to receive full instruction in the faith from the chief fountainhead the grand lama in person to this we demurred mr landors experiences did not encourage us to follow his lead the monks for their part could not understand our reluctance they thought that every wellintentioned convert must wish to make the pilgrimage to lhasa the mecca of their creed our hesitation threw some doubt on the reality of our conversion a proselyte above all men should never be lukewarm they expected us to embrace the opportunity with fervour we might be massacred on the way to be sure but what did that matter we should be dying for the faith and ought to be charmed at so splendid a prospect  on the dayweek after our arrival time chief lama came to me at nightfall his face was serious he spoke to me through our accredited interpreter the cook priestsahib say very important the sahib and memsahibs must go away from here before sun get up tomorrow morning  why so i asked as astonished as i was pleased  priestsahib say he like you very much oh very very much no want to see village people kill you  kill us but i thought they believed we were saints  priest say that just it too much saint altogether people hereabout all telling that the sahib and the memsahibs very great saints much holy like buddha make picture work miracles people think if them kill you and have your tomb here very holy place very great karma very good for trade plenty tibetan man hear you holy men come here on pilgrimage pilgrimage make fair make market very good for village so people want to kill you build shrine over your body  this was a view of the advantages of sanctity which had never before struck me now i had not been eager even for the distinction of being a christian martyr as to being a buddhist martyr that was quite out of the question then what does the lama advise us to do i asked  priestsahib say he love you no want to see village people kill you he give you guidevery good guideknow mountains well take you back straight to maharajahs country  not ram das i asked suspiciously  no not ram das very good mantibetan  i saw at once this was a genuine crisis all was hastily arranged i went in and told hilda and lady meadowcroft our spoilt child cried a little of course at the idea of being enshrined but on the whole behaved admirably at early dawn next morning before the village was awake we crept with stealthy steps out of the monastery whose inmates were friendly our new guide accompanied us we avoided the village on whose outskirts the lamasery lay and made straight for the valley by six oclock we were well out of sight of the clustered houses and the pyramidal spires but i did not breathe freely till late in the afternoon when we found ourselves once more under british protection in the first hamlet of the maharajahs territory  as for that scoundrel ram das we heard nothing more of him he disappeared into space from the moment he deserted us at the door of the trap into which he had led us the chief lama told me he had gone back at once by another route to his own country    chapter xi  the episode of the officer who understood perfectly   after our fortunate escape from the clutches of our tooadmiring tibetan hosts we wound our way slowly back through the maharajahs territory towards sir ivors headquarters on the third day out from the lamasery we camped in a romantic himalayan valleya narrow green glen with a brawling stream running in white cataracts and rapids down its midst we were able to breathe freely now we could enjoy the great tapering deodars that rose in ranks on the hillsides the snowclad needles of ramping rock that bounded the view to north and south the feathery bamboojungle that fringed and halfobscured the mountain torrent whose cool musicalas fallaciously coolwas borne to us through the dense screen of waving foliage lady meadowcroft was so delighted at having got clear away from those murderous and saintly tibetans that for a while she almost forgot to grumble she even condescended to admire the deepcleft ravine in which we bivouacked for the night and to admit that the orchids which hung from the tall trees were as fine as any at her florists in piccadilly though how they can have got them out here already in this outlandish placethe most fashionable kindswhen we in england have to grow them with such care in expensive hothouses she said really passes my comprehension  she seemed to think that orchids originated in covent garden  early next morning i was engaged with one of my native men in lighting the fire to boil our kettlefor in spite of all misfortunes we still made tea with creditable punctualitywhen a tall and goodlooking nepaulese approached us from the hills with catlike tread and stood before me in an attitude of profound supplication he was a welldressed young man like a superior native servant his face was broad and flat but kindly and goodhumoured he salaamed many times but still said nothing  ask him what he wants i cried turning to our fairweather friend the cook  the deferential nepaulese did not wait to be asked salaam sahib he said bowing again very low till his forehead almost touched the ground you are eulopean doctor sahib  i am i answered taken aback at being thus recognised in the forests of nepaul but how in wonder did you come to know it  you camp near here when you pass dis way before and you doctor little native girl who got sore eyes all de country here tell you is very great physician so i come and to see if you will turn aside to my village to help us  where did you learn english i exclaimed more and more astonished  i is servant one time at british lesidents at de maharajahs city pick up english dere also pick up plenty lupee velly good business at british lesidents now gone back home to my own village letired gentleman and he drew himself up with conscious dignity  i surveyed the retired gentleman from head to foot he had an air of distinction which not even his bare toes could altogether mar he was evidently a person of local importance and what did you want me to visit your village for i inquired dubiously  white traveller sahib ill dere sir vely ill got plague great firstclass sahib all same like governor ill fit to die send me out all times to try find eulopean doctor  plague i repeated startled he nodded  yes plague all same like dem hab him so bad down bombay way  do you know his name i asked for though one does not like to desert a fellowcreature in distress i did not care to turn aside from my road on such an errand with hilda and lady meadowcroft unless for some amply sufficient reason  the retired gentleman shook his head in the most emphatic fashion how me know he answered opening the palms of his hands as if to show he had nothing concealed in them forget eulopean name all times so easily and traveller sahib name very hard to lemember not got english name him eulopean foleigner  a european foreigner i repeated and you say he is seriously ill plague is no trifle well wait a minute ill see what the ladies say about it how far off is your village  he pointed with his hand somewhat vaguely to the hillside two hours walk he answered with the mountaineers habit of reckoning distance by time which extends under the like circumstances the whole world over  i went back to the tents and consulted hilda and lady meadowcroft our spoilt child pouted and was utterly averse to any detour of any sort lets get back straight to ivor she said petulantly ive had enough of camping out its all very well in its way for a week but when they begin to talk about cutting your throat and all that it ceases to be a joke and becomes a wee bit uncomfortable i want my feather bed i object to their villages  but consider dear hilda said gently this traveller is ill all alone in a strange land how can hubert desert him it is a doctors duty to do what he can to alleviate pain and to cure the sick what would we have thought ourselves when we were at the lamasery if a body of european travellers had known we were there imprisoned and in danger of our lives and had passed by on the other side without attempting to rescue us  lady meadowcroft knit her forehead that was us she said with an impatient nod after a pauseand this is another person you cant turn aside for everybody whos ill in all nepaul and plague tooso horrid besides how do we know this isnt another plan of these hateful people to lead us into danger  lady meadowcroft is quite right i said hastily i never thought about that there may be no plague no patient at all i will go up with this man alone hilda and find out the truth it will only take me five hours at most by noon i shall be back with you  what and leave us here unprotected among the wild beasts and the savages lady meadowcroft cried horrified in the midst of the forest dr cumberledge how can you  you are not unprotected i answered soothing her you have hilda with you she is worth ten men and besides our nepaulese are fairly trustworthy  hilda bore me out in my resolve she was too much of a nurse and had imbibed too much of the true medical sentiment to let me desert a man in peril of his life in a tropical jungle so in spite of lady meadowcroft i was soon winding my way up a steep mountain track overgrown with creeping indian weeds on my road to the still problematical village graced by the residence of the retired gentleman  after two hours hard climbing we reached it at last the retired gentleman led the way to a house in a street of the little wooden hamlet the door was low i had to stoop to enter it i saw in a moment this was indeed no trick on a native bed in a corner of the one room a man lay desperately ill a european with white hair and with a skin well bronzed by exposure to the tropics ominous dark spots beneath the epidermis showed the nature of the disease he tossed restlessly as he lay but did not raise his fevered head or look at my conductor well any news of ram das he asked at last in a parched and feeble voice parched and feeble as it was i recognised it instantly the man on the bed was sebastianno other  no news of lam das the retired gentleman replied with an unexpected display of womanly tenderness lam das clean gone not come any more but i bling you back eulopean doctor sahib  sebastian did not look up from his bed even then i could see he was more anxious about a message from his scout than about his own condition the rascal he moaned with his eyes closed tight the rascal he has betrayed me and he tossed uneasily  i looked at him and said nothing then i seated myself on a low stool by the bedside and took his hand in mine to feel his pulse the wrist was thin and wasted the face too i noticed had fallen away greatly it was clear that the malignant fever which accompanies the disease had wreaked its worst on him so weak and ill was he indeed that he let me hold his hand with my fingers on his pulse for half a minute or more without ever opening his eyes or displaying the slightest curiosity at my presence one might have thought that european doctors abounded in nepaul and that i had been attending him for a week with the mixture as before at every visit  your pulse is weak and very rapid i said slowly in a professional tone you seem to me to have fallen into a perilous condition  at the sound of my voice he gave a sudden start yet even so for a second he did not open his eyes the revelation of my presence seemed to come upon him as in a dream like cumberledges he muttered to himself gasping exactly like cumberledges but cumberledge is dead i must be delirious if i didnt know to the contrary i could have sworn it was cumberledges  i spoke again bending over him how long have the glandular swellings been present professor i asked with quiet deliberativeness  this time he opened his eyes sharply and looked up in my face he swallowed a great gulp of surprise his breath came and went he raised himself on his elbows and stared at me with a fixed stare cumberledge he cried cumberledge come back to life then they told me you were dead and here you are cumberledge  who told you i was dead i asked sternly  he stared at me still in a dazed way he was more than half comatose your guide ram das he answered at last half incoherently he came back by himself came back without you he swore to me he had seen all your throats cut in tibet he alone had escaped the buddhists had massacred you  he told you a lie i said shortly  i thought so i thought so and i sent him back for confirmatory evidence but the rogue has never brought it he let his head drop on his rude pillow heavily never never brought it  i gazed at him full of horror the man was too ill to hear me too ill to reason too ill to recognise the meaning of his own words almost otherwise perhaps he would hardly have expressed himself quite so frankly though to be sure he had said nothing to criminate himself in any way his action might have been due to anxiety for our safety  i fixed my glance on him long and dubiously what ought i to do next as for sebastian he lay with his eyes closed half oblivious of my presence the fever had gripped him hard he shivered and looked helpless as a child in such circumstances the instincts of my profession rose imperative within me i could not nurse a case properly in this wretched hut the one thing to be done was to carry the patient down to our camp in the valley there at least we had air and pure running water  i asked a few questions from the retired gentleman as to the possibility of obtaining sufficient bearers in the village as i supposed any number were forthcoming immediately your nepaulese is by nature a beast of burden he can carry anything up and down the mountains and spends his life in the act of carrying  i pulled out my pencil tore a leaf from my notebook and scribbled a hasty note to hilda the invalid iswhom do you thinksebastian he is dangerously ill with some malignant fever i am bringing him down into camp to nurse get everything ready for him then i handed it over to a messenger found for me by the retired gentleman to carry to hilda my host himself i could not spare as he was my only interpreter  in a couple of hours we had improvised a rough wovengrass hammock as an ambulance couch had engaged our bearers and had got sebastian under way for the camp by the river  when i arrived at our tents i found hilda had prepared everything for our patient with her usual cleverness not only had she got a bed ready for sebastian who was now almost insensible but she had even cooked some arrowroot from our stores beforehand so that he might have a little food with a dash of brandy in it to recover him after the fatigue of the journey down the mountain by the time we had laid him out on a mattress in a cool tent with the fresh air blowing about him and had made him eat the meal prepared for him he really began to look comparatively comfortable  lady meadowcroft was now our chief trouble we did not dare to tell her it was really plague but she had got near enough back to civilisation to have recovered her faculty for profuse grumbling and the idea of the delay that sebastian would cause us drove her wild with annoyance only two days off from ivor she cried and that comfortable bungalow and now to think we must stop here in the woods a week or ten days for this horrid old professor why cant he get worse at once and die like a gentleman but there with you to nurse him hilda hell never get worse he couldnt die if he tried hell linger on and on for weeks and weeks through a beastly convalescence  hubert hilda said to me when we were alone once more we mustnt keep her here she will be a hindrance not a help one way or another we must manage to get rid of her  how can we i asked we cant turn her loose upon the mountain roads with a nepaulese escort she isnt fit for it she would be frantic with terror  ive thought of that and i see only one thing possible i must go on with her myself as fast as we can push to sir ivors place and then return to help you nurse the professor  i saw she was right it was the sole plan open to us and i had no fear of letting hilda go off alone with lady meadowcroft and the bearers she was a host in herself and could manage a party of native servants at least as well as i could  so hilda went and came back again meanwhile i took charge of the nursing of sebastian fortunately i had brought with me a good stock of junglemedicines in my little travellingcase including plenty of quinine and under my careful treatment the professor passed the crisis and began to mend slowly the first question he asked me when he felt himself able to talk once more was nurse wadewhat has become of herfor he had not yet seen her i feared the shock for him  she is here with me i answered in a very measured voice she is waiting to be allowed to come and help me in taking care of you  he shuddered and turned away his face buried itself in the pillow i could see some twinge of remorse had seized upon him at last he spoke cumberledge he said in a very low and almost frightened tone dont let her come near me i cant bear it i cant bear it  ill as he was i did not mean to let him think i was ignorant of his motive you cant bear a woman whose life you have attempted i said in my coldest and most deliberate way to have a hand in nursing you you cant bear to let her heap coals of fire on your head in that you are right but remember you have attempted my life too you have twice done your best to get me murdered  he did not pretend to deny it he was too weak for subterfuges he only writhed as he lay you are a man he said shortly and she is a woman that is all the difference then he paused for a minute or two dont let her come near me he moaned once more in a piteous voice dont let her come near me  i will not i answered she shall not come near you i spare you that but you will have to eat the food she prepares and you know she will not poison you you will have to be tended by the servants she chooses and you know they will not murder you she can heap coals of fire on your head without coming into your tent consider that you sought to take her lifeand she seeks to save yours she is as anxious to keep you alive as you are anxious to kill her  he lay as in a reverie his long white hair made his clearcut thin face look more unearthly than ever with the hectic flush of fever upon it at last he turned to me we each work for our own ends he said in a weary way we pursue our own objects it suits me to get rid of her it suits her to keep me alive i am no good to her dead living she expects to wring a confession out of me but she shall not have it tenacity of purpose is the one thing i admire in life she has the tenacity of purposeand so have i cumberledge dont you see it is a mere duel of endurance between us  and may the just side win i answered solemnly  it was several days later before he spoke to me of it again hilda had brought some food to the door of the tent and passed it in to me for our patient how is he now she whispered  sebastian overheard her voice and cowering within himself still managed to answer better getting better i shall soon be well now you have carried your point you have cured your enemy  thank god for that hilda said and glided away silently  sebastian ate his cup of arrowroot in silence then he looked at me with wistful musing eyes cumberledge he murmured at last after all i cant help admiring that woman she is the only person who has ever checkmated me she checkmates me every time steadfastness is what i love her steadfastness of purpose and her determination move me  i wish they would move you to tell the truth i answered  he mused again to tell the truth he muttered moving his head up and down i have lived for science shall i wreck all now there are truths which it is better to hide than to proclaim uncomfortable truthstruths that never should have beentruths which help to make greater truths incredible but all the same i cannot help admiring that woman she has yorkebannermans intellect with a great deal more than yorkebannermans force of will such firmness such energy such resolute patience she is a wonderful creature i cant help admiring her  i said no more to him just then i thought it better to let nascent remorse and nascent admiration work out their own natural effects unimpeded for i could see our enemy was beginning to feel some sting of remorse some men are below it sebastian thought himself above it i felt sure he was mistaken  yet even in the midst of these personal preoccupations i saw that our great teacher was still as ever the pure man of science he noted every symptom and every change of the disease with professional accuracy he observed his own case whenever his mind was clear enough as impartially as he would have observed any outside patients this is a rare chance cumberledge he whispered to me once in an interval of delirium so few europeans have ever had the complaint and probably none who were competent to describe the specific subjective and psychological symptoms the delusions one gets as one sinks into the coma for example are of quite a peculiar typedelusions of wealth and of absolute power most exhilarating and magnificent i think myself a millionaire or a prime minister be sure you make a note of thatin case i die if i recover of course i can write an exhaustive monograph on the whole history of the disease in the british medical journal but if i die the task of chronicling these interesting observations will devolve upon you a most exceptional chance you are much to be congratulated  you must not die professor i cried thinking more i will confess of hilda wade than of himself you must live to report this case for science i used what i thought the strongest lever i knew for him  he closed his eyes dreamily for science yes for science there you strike the right chord what have i not dared and done for science but in case i die cumberledge be sure you collect the notes i took as i was sickeningthey are most important for the history and etiology of the disease i made them hourly and dont forget the main points to be observed as i am dying you know what they are this is a rare rare chance i congratulate you on being the man who has the first opportunity ever afforded us of questioning an intelligent european case a case where the patient is fully capable of describing with accuracy his symptoms and his sensations in medical phraseology  he did not die however in about another week he was well enough to move we carried him down to mozufferpoor the first large town in the plains thereabouts and handed him over for the stage of convalescence to the care of the able and efficient station doctor to whom my thanks are due for much courteous assistance  and now what do you mean to do i asked hilda when our patient was placed in other hands and all was over  she answered me without one seconds hesitation go straight to bombay and wait there till sebastian takes passage for england  he will go home you think as soon as he is well enough  undoubtedly he has now nothing more to stop in india for  why not as much as ever  she looked at me curiously it is so hard to explain she replied after a moments pause during which she had been drumming her little forefinger on the table i feel it rather than reason it but dont you see that a certain change has lately come over sebastians attitude he no longer desires to follow me he wants to avoid me that is why i wish more than ever to dog his steps i feel the beginning of the end has come i am gaining my point sebastian is wavering  then when he engages a berth you propose to go by the same steamer  yes it makes all the difference when he tries to follow we he is dangerous when he tries to avoid me it becomes my work in life to follow him i must keep him in sight every minute now i must quicken his conscience i must make him feel his own desperate wickedness he is afraid to face me that means remorse the more i compel him to face me the more the remorse is sure to deepen  i saw she was right we took the train to bombay i found rooms at the hospitable club by a members invitation while hilda went to stop with some friends of lady meadowcrofts on the malabar hill we waited for sebastian to come down from the interior and take his passage hilda with her intuitive certainty felt sure he would come  a steamer two steamers three steamers sailed and still no sebastian i began to think he must have made up his mind to go back some other way but hilda was confident so i waited patiently at last one morning i dropped in as i had often done before at the office of one of the chief steamship companies it was the very morning when a packet was to sail can i see the list of passengers on the vindhya i asked of the clerk a sandyhaired englishman tall thin and sallow  the clerk produced it  i scanned it in haste to my surprise and delight a pencilled entry halfway down the list gave the name professor sebastian  oh sebastian is going by this steamer i murmured looking up  the sandyhaired clerk hummed and hesitated well i believe hes going sir he answered at last but its a bit uncertain hes a fidgety man the professor he came down here this morning and asked to see the list the same as you have done then he engaged a berth provisionallymind provisionally he saidthats why his name is only put in on the list in pencil i take it hes waiting to know whether a party of friends he wishes to meet are going also  or wishes to avoid i thought to myself inwardly but i did not say so i asked instead is he coming again  yes i think so at 530  and she sails at seven  at seven punctually passengers must be aboard by halfpast six at latest  very good i answered making up my mind promptly i only called to know the professors movements dont mention to him that i came i may look in again myself an hour or two later  you dont want a passage sir you may be the friend hes expecting  no i dont want a passagenot at present certainly then i ventured on a bold stroke look here i said leaning across towards him and assuming a confidential tone i am a private detectivewhich was perfectly true in essenceand im dogging the professor who for all his eminence is gravely suspected of a great crime if you will help me i will make it worth your while let us understand one another i offer you a fivepound note to say nothing of all this to him  the sallow clerks fishy eye glistened you can depend upon me he answered with an acquiescent nod i judged that he did not often get the chance of earning some eighty rupees so easily  i scribbled a hasty note and sent it round to hilda pack your boxes at once and hold yourself in readiness to embark on the vindhya at six oclock precisely then i put my own things straight and waited at the club till a quarter to six at that time i strolled on unconcernedly into the office a cab outside held hilda and our luggage i had arranged it all meanwhile by letter  professor sebastian been here again i asked  yes sir hes been here and he looked over the list again and hes taken his passage but he muttered something about eavesdroppers and said that if he wasnt satisfied when he got on board he would return at once and ask for a cabin in exchange by the next steamer  that will do i answered slipping the promised fivepound note into the clerks open palm which closed over it convulsively talked about eavesdroppers did he then he knows hes been shadowed it may console you to learn that you are instrumental in furthering the aims of justice and unmasking a cruel and wicked conspiracy now the next thing is this i want two berths at once by this very steamerone for myselfname of cumberledge one for a ladyname of wade and look sharp about it  the sandyhaired man did look sharp and within three minutes we were driving off with our tickets to princes dock landingstage  we slipped on board unobtrusively and instantly took refuge in our respective staterooms till the steamer was well under way and fairly out of sight of kolaba island only after all chance of sebastians avoiding us was gone for ever did we venture up on deck on purpose to confront him  it was one of those delicious balmy evenings which one gets only at sea and in the warmer latitudes the sky was alive with myriads of twinkling and palpitating stars which seemed to come and go like sparks on a fireback as one gazed upward into the vast depths and tried to place them they played hideandseek with one another and with the innumerable meteors which shot recklessly every now and again across the field of the firmament leaving momentary furrows of light behind them beneath the sea sparkled almost like the sky for every turn of the screw churned up the scintillating phosphorescence in the water so that countless little jets of living fire seemed to flash and die away at the summit of every wavelet a tall spare man in a picturesque cloak and with long lank white hair leant over the taffrail gazing at the numberless flashing lights of the surface as he gazed he talked on in his clear rapt voice to a stranger by his side the voice and the ring of enthusiasm were unmistakable oh no he was saying as we stole up behind him that hypothesis i venture to assert is no longer tenable by the light of recent researches death and decay have nothing to do directly with the phosphorescence of the sea though they have a little indirectly the light is due in the main to numerous minute living organisms most of them bacilli on which i once made several close observations and crucial experiments they possess organs which may be regarded as miniature bullseye lanterns and these organs  what a lovely evening hubert hilda said to me in an apparently unconcerned voice as the professor reached this point in his exposition  sebastians voice quavered and stammered for a moment he tried just at first to continue and complete his sentence and these organs he went on aimlessly these bullseyes that i spoke about are so arrangedso arrangedi was speaking on the subject of crustaceans i thinkcrustaceans so arranged then he broke down utterly and turned sharply round to me he did not look at hildai think he did not dare but he faced me with his head down and his long thin neck protruded eyeing me from under those overhanging penthouse brows of his you sneak he cried passionately you sneak you have dogged me by false pretences you have lied to bring this about you have come aboard under a false nameyou and your accomplice  i faced him in turn erect and unflinching professor sebastian i answered in my coldest and calmest tone you say what is not true if you consult the list of passengers by the vindhya now posted near the companionladder you will find the names of hilda wade and hubert cumberledge duly entered we took our passage after you inspected the list at the office to see whether our names were therein order to avoid us but you cannot avoid us we do not mean that you shall avoid us we will dog you now through lifenot by lies or subterfuges as you say but openly and honestly it is you who need to slink and cower not we the prosecutor need not descend to the sordid shifts of the criminal  the other passenger had sidled away quietly the moment he saw our conversation was likely to be private and i spoke in a low voice though clearly and impressively because i did not wish for a scene i was only endeavouring to keep alive the slow smouldering fire of remorse in the mans bosom and i saw i had touched him on a spot that hurt sebastian drew himself up and answered nothing for a minute or two he stood erect with folded arms gazing moodily before him then he said as if to himself i owe the man my life he nursed me through the plague if it had not been for thatif he had not tended me so carefully in that valley in nepauli would throw him overboard nowcatch him in my arms and throw him overboard i wouldand be hanged for it  he walked past us as if he saw us not silent erect moody hilda stepped aside and let him pass he never even looked at her i knew why he dared not every day now remorse for the evil part he had played in her life respect for the woman who had unmasked and outwitted him made it more and more impossible for sebastian to face her during the whole of that voyage though he dined in the same saloon and paced the same deck he never spoke to her he never so much as looked at her once or twice their eyes met by accident and hilda stared him down sebastians eyelids dropped and he stole away uneasily in public we gave no overt sign of our differences but it was understood on board that relations were strained that professor sebastian and dr cumberledge had been working at the same hospital in london together and that owing to some disagreement between them dr cumberledge had resignedwhich made it most awkward for them to be travelling together by the same steamer  we passed through the suez canal and down the mediterranean all the time sebastian never again spoke to us the passengers indeed held aloof from the solitary gloomy old man who strode along the quarterdeck with his long slow stride absorbed in his own thoughts and intent only on avoiding hilda and myself his mood was unsociable as for hilda her helpful winning ways made her a favourite with all the women as her pretty face did with all the men for the first time in his life sebastian seemed to be aware that he was shunned he retired more and more within himself for company his keen eye began to lose in some degree its extraordinary fire his expression to forget its magnetic attractiveness indeed it was only young men of scientific tastes that sebastian could ever attract among them his eager zeal his singleminded devotion to the cause of science awoke always a responsive chord which vibrated powerfully  day after day passed and we steamed through the straits and neared the channel our thoughts began to assume a home complexion everybody was full of schemes as to what he would do when he reached england old bradshaws were overhauled and trains looked out on the supposition that we would get in by such an hour on tuesday we were steaming along the french coast off the western promontory of brittany the evening was fine and though of course less warm than we had experienced of late yet pleasant and summerlike we watched the distant cliffs of the finistere mainland and the numerous little islands that lie off the shore all basking in the unreal glow of a deep red sunset the first officer was in charge a very cocksure and careless young man handsome and darkhaired the sort of young man who thought more of creating an impression upon the minds of the lady passengers than of the duties of his position  arent you going down to your berth i asked of hilda about halfpast ten that night the air is so much colder here than you have been feeling it of late that im afraid of your chilling yourself  she looked up at me with a smile and drew her little fluffy white woollen wrap closer about her shoulders am i so very valuable to you then she askedfor i suppose my glance had been a trifle too tender for a mere acquaintances no thank you hubert i dont think ill go down and if youre wise you wont go down either i distrust this first officer hes a careless navigator and tonight his heads too full of that pretty mrs ogilvy he has been flirting with her desperately ever since we left bombay and tomorrow he knows he will lose her for ever his mind isnt occupied with the navigation at all what he is thinking of is how soon his watch will be over so that he may come down off the bridge on to the quarterdeck to talk to her dont you see shes lurking over yonder looking up at the stars and waiting for him by the compass poor child she has a bad husband and now she has let herself get too much entangled with this empty young fellow i shall be glad for her sake to see her safely landed and out of the mans clutches  as she spoke the first officer glanced down towards mrs ogilvy and held out his chronometer with an encouraging smile which seemed to say only an hour and a half more now at twelve i shall be with you  perhaps youre right hilda i answered taking a seat beside her and throwing away my cigar this is one of the worst bits on the french coast that were approaching were not far off ushant i wish the captain were on the bridge instead of this helterskelter selfconceited young fellow hes too cocksure he knows so much about seamanship that he could take a ship through any rocks on his course blindfoldin his own opinion i always doubt a man who is so much at home in his subject that he never has to think about it most things in this world are done by thinking  we cant see the ushant light hilda remarked looking ahead  no theres a little haze about on the horizon i fancy see the stars are fading away it begins to feel damp sea mist in the channel  hilda sat uneasily in her deckchair thats bad she answered for the first officer is taking no more heed of ushant than of his latter end he has forgotten the existence of the breton coast his head is just stuffed with mrs ogilvys eyelashes very pretty long eyelashes too i dont deny it but they wont help him to get through the narrow channel they say its dangerous  dangerous i answered not a bit of itwith reasonable care nothing at sea is dangerousexcept the inexplicable recklessness of navigators theres always plenty of searoomif they care to take it collisions and icebergs to be sure are dangers that cant be avoided at times especially if theres fog about but ive been enough at sea in my time to know this much at leastthat no coast in the world is dangerous except by dint of reckless cornercutting captains of great ships behave exactly like two hansomdrivers in the streets of london they think they can just shave past without grazing and they do shave past nine times out of ten the tenth time they run on the rocks through sheer recklessness and lose their vessel and then the newspapers always ask the same solemn questionin childish good faithhow did so experienced and able a navigator come to make such a mistake in his reckoning he made no mistake he simply tried to cut it fine and cut it too fine for once with the result that he usually loses his own life and his passengers thats all we who have been at sea understand that perfectly  just at that moment another passenger strolled up and joined usa bengal civil servant he drew his chair over by hildas and began discussing mrs ogilvys eyes and the first officers flirtations hilda hated gossip and took refuge in generalities in three minutes the talk had wandered off to ibsens influence on the english drama and we had forgotten the very existence of the isle of ushant  the english public will never understand ibsen the newcomer said reflectively with the omniscient air of the indian civilian he is too purely scandinavian he represents that part of the continental mind which is farthest removed from the english temperament to him respectabilityour godis not only no fetish it is the unspeakable thing the moabitish abomination he will not bow down to the golden image which our british nebuchadnezzar king demos has made and which he asks us to worship and the british nebuchadnezzar will never get beyond the worship of his vishnu respectability the deity of the pure and blameless ratepayer so ibsen must always remain a sealed book to the vast majority of the english people  that is true hilda answered as to his direct influence but dont you think indirectly he is leavening england a man so wholly out of tune with the prevailing note of english life could only affect it of course by means of disciples and popularisersoften even popularisers who but dimly and distantly apprehend his meaning he must be interpreted to the english by english intermediaries half philistine themselves who speak his language ill and who miss the greater part of his message yet only by such halfhintswhy what was that i think i saw something  even as she uttered the words a terrible jar ran fiercely through the ship from stem to sterna jar that made one clench ones teeth and hold ones jaws tightthe jar of a prow that shattered against a rock i took it all in at a glance we had forgotten ushant but ushant had not forgotten us it had revenged itself upon us by revealing its existence  in a moment all was turmoil and confusion on deck i cannot describe the scene that followed sailors rushed to and fro unfastening ropes and lowering boats with admirable discipline women shrieked and cried aloud in helpless terror the voice of the first officer could be heard above the din endeavouring to atone by courage and coolness in the actual disaster for his recklessness in causing it passengers rushed on deck half clad and waited for their turn to take places in the boats it was a time of terror turmoil and hubbub but in the midst of it all hilda turned to me with infinite calm in her voice where is sebastian she asked in a perfectly collected tone whatever happens we must not lose sight of him  i am here another voice equally calm responded beside her you are a brave woman whether i sink or swim i admire your courage your steadfastness of purpose it was the only time he had addressed a word to her during the entire voyage  they put the women and children into the first boats lowered mothers and little ones went first single women and widows after now miss wade the first officer said taking her gently by the shoulders when her turn arrived make haste dont keep us waiting  but hilda held back no no she said firmly i wont go yet i am waiting for the mens boat i must not leave professor sebastian  the first officer shrugged his shoulders there was no time for protest next then he said quickly miss martinmiss weatherly  sebastian took her hand and tried to force her in you must go he said in a low persuasive tone you must not wait for me  he hated to see her i knew but i imagined in his voicefor i noted it even thenthere rang some undertone of genuine desire to save her  hilda loosened his grasp resolutely no no she answered i cannot fly i shall never leave you  not even if i promise  she shook her head and closed her lips hard certainly not she said again after a pause i cannot trust you besides i must stop by your side and do my best to save you your life is all in all to me i dare not risk it  his gaze was now pure admiration as you will he answered for he that loseth his life shall gain it  if ever we land alive hilda answered glowing red in spite of the danger i shall remind you of that word i shall call upon you to fulfil it  the boat was lowered and still hilda stood by my side one second later another shock shook us the vindhya parted amidships and we found ourselves struggling and choking in the cold sea water  it was a miracle that every soul of us was not drowned that moment as many of us were the swirling eddy which followed as the vindhya sank swamped two of the boats and carried down not a few of those who were standing on the deck with us the last i saw of the first officer was a writhing form whirled about in the water before he sank he shouted aloud with a seamans frank courage say it was all my fault i accept the responsibility i ran her too close i am the only one to blame for it then he disappeared in the whirlpool caused by the sinking ship and we were left still struggling  one of the liferafts hastily rigged by the sailors floated our way hilda struck out a stroke or two and caught it she dragged herself on to it and beckoned me to follow i could see she was holding on to something tightly i struck out in turn and reached the raft which was composed of two seats fastened together in haste at the first note of danger i hauled myself up by hildas side help me to pull him aboard she cried in an agonised voice i am afraid he has lost consciousness then i looked at the object she was clutching in her hands it was sebastians white head apparently quite lifeless  i pulled him up with her and laid him out on the raft a very faint breeze from the southwest had sprung up that and a strong seaward current that sets round the rocks were carrying us straight out from the breton coast and all chance of rescue towards the open channel  but hilda thought nothing of such physical danger we have saved him hubert she cried clasping her hands we have saved him but do you think he is alive for unless he is my chance our chance is gone forever  i bent over and felt his pulse as far as i could make out it still beat feebly    chapter xii  the episode of the dead man who spoke    i will not trouble you with details of those three terrible days and nights when we drifted helplessly about at the mercy of the currents on our improvised liferaft up and down the english channel the first night was the worst slowly after that we grew used to the danger the cold the hunger and the thirst our senses were numbed we passed whole hours together in a sort of torpor just vaguely wondering whether a ship would come in sight to save us obeying the merciful law that those who are utterly exhausted are incapable of acute fear and acquiescing in the probability of our own extinction but however slender the chanceand as the hours stole on it seemed slender enoughhilda still kept her hopes fixed mainly on sebastian no daughter could have watched the father she loved more eagerly and closely than hilda watched her lifelong enemythe man who had wrought such evil upon her and hers to save our own lives without him would be useless at all hazards she must keep him alive on the bare chance of a rescue if he died there died with him the last hope of justice and redress  as for sebastian after the first halfhour during which he lay white and unconscious he opened his eyes faintly as we could see by the moonlight and gazed around him with a strange puzzled state of inquiry then his senses returned to him by degrees what you cumberledge he murmured measuring me with his eye and you nurse wade well i thought you would manage it there was a tone almost of amusement in his voice a halfironical tone which had been familiar to us in the old hospital days he raised himself on one arm and gazed at the water all round then he was silent for some minutes at last he spoke again do you know what i ought to do if i were consistent he asked with a tinge of pathos in his words jump off this raft and deprive you of your last chance of triumphthe triumph which you have worked for so hard you want to save my life for your own ends not for mine why should i help you to my own undoing  hildas voice was tenderer and softer than usual as she answered no not for my own ends alone and not for your undoing but to give you one last chance of unburdening your conscience some men are too small to be capable of remorse their little souls have no room for such a feeling you are great enough to feel it and to try to crush it down but you cannot crush it down it crops up in spite of you you have tried to bury it in your soul and you have failed it is your remorse that has driven you to make so many attempts against the only living souls who knew and understood if ever we get safely to land once moreand god knows it is not likelyi give you still the chance of repairing the mischief you have done and of clearing my fathers memory from the cruel stain which you and only you can wipe away  sebastian lay long silent once more gazing up at her fixedly with the foggy white moonlight shining upon his bright inscrutable eyes you are a brave woman maisie yorkebannerman he said at last slowly a very brave woman i will try to livei toofor a purpose of my own i say it again he that loseth his life shall gain it  incredible as it may sound in half an hour more he was lying fast asleep on that wavetossed raft and hilda and i were watching him tenderly and it seemed to us as we watched him that a change had come over those stern and impassive features they had softened and melted until his face was that of a gentler and better type it was as if some inward change of soul was moulding the fierce old professor into a nobler and more venerable man  day after day we drifted on without food or water the agony was terrible i will not attempt to describe it for to do so is to bring it back too clearly to my memory hilda and i being younger and stronger bore up against it well but sebastian old and worn and still weak from the plague grew daily weaker his pulse just beat and sometimes i could hardly feel it thrill under my finger he became delirious and murmured much about yorkebannermans daughter sometimes he forgot all and spoke to me in the friendly terms of our old acquaintance at nathaniels giving me directions and advice about imaginary operations hour after hour we watched for a sail and no sail appeared one could hardly believe we could toss about so long in the main highway of traffic without seeing a ship or spying more than the smoketrail of some passing steamer  as far as i could judge during those days and nights the wind veered from southwest to southeast and carried us steadily and surely towards the open atlantic on the third evening out about five oclock i saw a dark object on the horizon was it moving towards us we strained our eyes in breathless suspense a minute passed and then another yes there could be no doubt it grew larger and larger it was a shipa steamer we made all the signs of distress we could manage i stood up and waved hildas white shawl frantically in the air there was half an hour of suspense and our hearts sank as we thought that they were about to pass us then the steamer hove to a little and seemed to notice us next instant we dropped upon our knees for we saw they were lowering a boat they were coming to our aid they would be in time to save us  hilda watched our rescuers with parted lips and agonised eyes then she felt sebastians pulse thank heaven she cried he still lives they will be here before he is quite past confession  sebastian opened his eyes dreamily a boat he asked  yes a boat  then you have gained your point child i am able to collect myself give me a few hours more life and what i can do to make amends to you shall be done  i dont know why but it seemed longer between the time when the boat was lowered and the moment when it reached us than it had seemed during the three days and nights we lay tossing about helplessly on the open atlantic there were times when we could hardly believe it was really moving at last however it reached us and we saw the kindly faces and outstretched hands of our rescuers hilda clung to sebastian with a wild clasp as the men reached out for her  no take him first she cried when the sailors after the custom of men tried to help her into the gig before attempting to save us his life is worth more to me than my own take himand for gods sake lift him gently for he is nearly gone  they took him aboard and laid him down in the stern then and then only hilda stepped into the boat and i staggered after her the officer in charge a kind young irishman had had the foresight to bring brandy and a little beef essence we ate and drank what we dared as they rowed us back to the steamer sebastian lay back with his white eyelashes closed over the lids and the livid hue of death upon his emaciated cheeks but he drank a teaspoonful or two of brandy and swallowed the beef essence with which hilda fed him  your father is the most exhausted of the party the officer said in a low undertone poor fellow he is too old for such adventures he seems to have hardly a spark of life left in him  hilda shuddered with evident horror he is not my fatherthank heaven she cried leaning over him and supporting his drooping head in spite of her own fatigue and the cold that chilled our very bones but i think he will live i mean him to live he is my best friend nowand my bitterest enemy  the officer looked at her in surprise and then touched his forehead inquiringly with a quick glance at me he evidently thought cold and hunger had affected her reason i shook my head it is a peculiar case i whispered what the lady says is right everything depends for us upon our keeping him alive till we reach england  they rowed us to the boat and we were handed tenderly up the side there the ships surgeon and everybody else on board did their best to restore us after our terrible experience the ship was the don of the royal mail steamship companys west indian line and nothing could exceed the kindness with which we were treated by every soul on board from the captain to the stewardess and the junior cabinboy sebastians great name carried weight even here as soon as it was generally understood on board that we had brought with us the famous physiologist and pathologist the man whose name was famous throughout europe we might have asked for anything that the ship contained without fear of a refusal but indeed hildas sweet face was enough in itself to win the interest and sympathy of all who saw it  by eleven next morning we were off plymouth sound and by midday we had landed at the mill bay docks and were on our way to a comfortable hotel in the neighbourhood  hilda was too good a nurse to bother sebastian at once about his implied promise she had him put to bed and kept him there carefully  what do you think of his condition she asked me after the second day was over i could see by her own grave face that she had already formed her own conclusions  he cannot recover i answered his constitution shattered by the plague and by his incessant exertions has received too severe a shock in this shipwreck he is doomed  so i think the change is but temporary he will not last out three days more i fancy  he has rallied wonderfully today i said but tis a passing rally a flickerno more if you wish to do anything now is the moment if you delay you will be too late  i will go in and see him hilda answered i have said nothing more to him but i think he is moved i think he means to keep his promise he has shown a strange tenderness to me these last few days i almost believe he is at last remorseful and ready to undo the evil which he has done  she stole softly into the sick room i followed her on tiptoe and stood near the door behind the screen which shut off the draught from the patient sebastian stretched his arms out to her ah maisie my child he cried addressing her by the name she had borne in her childhoodboth were her owndont leave me any more stay with me always maisie i cant get on without you  but you hated once to see me  because i have so wronged you  and now will you do nothing to repair the wrong  my child i can never undo that wrong it is irreparable for the past can never be recalled but i will try my best to minimise it call cumberledge in i am quite sensible now quite conscious you will be my witness cumberledge that my pulse is normal and that my brain is clear i will confess it all maisie your constancy and your firmness have conquered me and your devotion to your father if only i had had a daughter like you my girl one whom i could have loved and trusted i might have been a better man i might even have done better work for sciencethough on that side at least i have little with which to reproach myself  hilda bent over him hubert and i are here she said slowly in a strangely calm voice but that is not enough i want a public an attested confession it must be given before witnesses and signed and sworn to somebody might throw doubt upon my word and huberts  sebastian shrank back given before witnesses and signed and sworn to maisie is this humiliation necessary do you exact it  hilda was inexorable you know yourself how you are situated you have only a day or two to live she said in an impressive voice you must do it at once or never you have postponed it all your life now at this last moment you must make up for it will you die with an act of injustice unconfessed on your conscience  he paused and struggled i couldif it were not for you he answered  then do it for me hilda cried do it for me i ask it of you not as a favour but as a right i demand it she stood white stern inexorable by his couch and laid her hand upon his shoulder  he paused once more then he murmured feebly in a querulous tone what witnesses whom do you wish to be present  hilda spoke clearly and distinctly she had thought it all out with herself beforehand such witnesses as will carry absolute conviction to the mind of all the world irreproachable disinterested witnesses official witnesses in the first place a commissioner of oaths then a plymouth doctor to show that you are in a fit state of mind to make a confession next mr horace mayfield who defended my father lastly dr blake crawford who watched the case on your behalf at the trial  but hilda i interposed we may possibly find that they cannot come away from london just now they are busy men and likely to be engaged  they will come if i pay their fees i do not mind how much this costs me what is money compared to this one great object of my life  and thenthe delay suppose that we are too late  he will live some days yet i can telegraph up at once i want no holeandcorner confession which may afterwards be useless but an open avowal before the most approved witnesses if he will make it well and good if not my lifework will have failed but i had rather it failed than draw back one inch from the course which i have laid down for myself  i looked at the worn face of sebastian he nodded his head slowly she has conquered he answered turning upon the pillow let her have her own way i hid it for years for science sake that was my motive cumberledge and i am too near death to lie science has now nothing more to gain or lose by me i have served her well but i am worn out in her service maisie may do as she will i accept her ultimatum  we telegraphed up at once fortunately both men were disengaged and both keenly interested in the case by that evening horace mayfield was talking it all over with me in the hotel at southampton well hubert my boy he said a woman we know can do a great deal he smiled his familiar smile like a genial fat toad but if your yorkebannerman succeeds in getting a confession out of sebastian shell extort my admiration he paused a moment then he added in an afterthought i say that shell extort my admiration but mind you i dont know that i shall feel inclined to believe it the facts have always appeared to mestrictly between ourselves you knowto admit of only one explanation  wait and see i answered you think it more likely that miss wade will have persuaded sebastian to confess to things that never happened than that he will convince you of yorkebannermans innocence  the great qc fingered his cigaretteholder affectionately  you hit it first time he answered that is precisely my attitude the evidence against our poor friend was so peculiarly black it would take a great deal to make me disbelieve it  but surely a confession  ah well let me hear the confession and then i shall be better able to judge  even as he spoke hilda had entered the room  there will be no difficulty about that mr mayfield you shall hear it and i trust that it will make you repent for taking so black a view of the case of your own client  without prejudice miss bannerman without prejudice said the lawyer with some confusion our conversation is entirely between ourselves and to the world i have always upheld that your father was an innocent man  but such distinctions are too subtle for a loving woman  he was an innocent man said she angrily it was your business not only to believe it but to prove it you have neither believed it nor proved it but if you will come upstairs with me i will show you that i have done both  mayfield glanced at me and shrugged his fat shoulders hilda had led the way and we both followed her in the room of the sick man our other witnesses were waiting a tall dark austere man who was introduced to me as dr blake crawford whose name i had heard as having watched the case for sebastian at the time of the investigation there were present also a commissioner of oaths and dr mayby a small local practitioner whose attitude towards the great scientist was almost absurdly reverential the three men were grouped at the foot of the bed and mayfield and i joined them hilda stood beside the dying man and rearranged the pillow against which he was propped then she held some brandy to his lips now said she  the stimulant brought a shade of colour into his ghastly cheeks and the old quick intelligent gleam came back into his deep sunk eyes  a remarkable woman gentlemen said he a very noteworthy woman i had prided myself that my willpower was the most powerful in the countryi had never met any to match itbut i do not mind admitting that for firmness and tenacity this lady is my equal she was anxious that i should adopt one course of action i was determined to adopt another your presence here is a proof that she has prevailed  he paused for breath and she gave him another small sip of the brandy  i execute her will ungrudgingly and with the conviction that it is the right and proper course for me to take he continued you will forgive me some of the ill which i have done you maisie when i tell you that i really died this morningall unknown to cumberledge and youand that nothing but my will force has sufficed to keep spirit and body together until i should carry out your will in the manner which you suggested i shall be glad when i have finished for the effort is a painful one and i long for the peace of dissolution it is now a quarter to seven i have every hope that i may be able to leave before eight  it was strange to hear the perfect coolness with which he discussed his own approaching dissolution calm pale and impassive his manner was that of a professor addressing his class i had seen him speak so to a ring of dressers in the old days at nathaniels  the circumstances which led up to the death of admiral scott prideaux and the suspicions which caused the arrest of doctor yorkebannerman have never yet been fully explained although they were by no means so profound that they might not have been unravelled at the time had a man of intellect concentrated his attention upon them the police however were incompetent and the legal advisers of dr bannerman hardly less so and a woman only has had the wit to see that a gross injustice has been done the true facts i will now lay before you  mayfields broad face had reddened with indignation but now his curiosity drove out every other emotion and he leaned forward with the rest of us to hear the old mans story  in the first place i must tell you that both dr bannerman and myself were engaged at the time in an investigation upon the nature and properties of the vegetable alkaloids and especially of aconitine we hoped for the very greatest results from this drug and we were both equally enthusiastic in our research especially we had reason to believe that it might have a most successful action in the case of a certain rare but deadly disease into the nature of which i need not enter reasoning by analogy we were convinced that we had a certain cure for this particular ailment  our investigation however was somewhat hampered by the fact that the condition in question is rare out of tropical countries and that in our hospital wards we had not at that time any example of it so serious was this obstacle that it seemed that we must leave other men more favourably situated to reap the benefit of our work and enjoy the credit of our discovery but a curious chance gave us exactly what we were in search of at the instant when we were about to despair it was yorkebannerman who came to me in my laboratory one day to tell me that he had in his private practice the very condition of which we were in search  the patient said he is my uncle admiral scott prideaux  your uncle i cried in amazement but how came he to develop such a condition  his last commission in the navy was spent upon the malabar coast where the disease is endemic there can be do doubt that it has been latent in his system ever since and that the irritability of temper and indecision of character of which his family have so often had to complain were really among the symptoms of his complaint  i examined the admiral in consultation with my colleague and i confirmed his diagnosis but to my surprise yorkebannerman showed the most invincible and reprehensible objection to experiment upon his relative in vain i assured him that he must place his duty to science high above all other considerations it was only after great pressure that i could persuade him to add an infinitesimal portion of aconitine to his prescriptions the drug was a deadly one he said and the toxic dose was still to be determined he could not push it in the case of a relative who trusted himself to his care i tried to shake him in what i regarded as his absurd squeamishnessbut in vain  but i had another resource bannermans prescriptions were made up by a fellow named barclay who had been dispenser at nathaniels and afterwards set up as a chemist in sackville street this man was absolutely in my power i had discovered him at nathaniels in dishonest practices and i held evidence which would have sent him to gaol i held this over him now and i made him unknown to bannerman increase the doses of aconitine in the medicine until they were sufficient for my experimental purposes i will not enter into figures but suffice it that bannerman was giving more than ten times what he imagined  you know the sequel i was called in and suddenly found that i had bannerman in my power there had been a very keen rivalry between us in science he was the only man in england whose career might impinge upon mine i had this supreme chance of putting him out of my way he could not deny that he had been giving his uncle aconitine i could prove that his uncle had died of aconitine he could not himself account for the factshe was absolutely in my power i did not wish him to be condemned maisie i only hoped that he would leave the court discredited and ruined i give you my word that my evidence would have saved him from the scaffold  hilda was listening with a set white face  proceed said she and held out the brandy once more  i did not give the admiral any more aconitine after i had taken over the case but what was already in his system was enough it was evident that we had seriously underestimated the lethal dose as to your father maisie you have done me an injustice you have always thought that i killed him  proceed said she  i speak now from the brink of the grave and i tell you that i did not his heart was always weak and it broke down under the strain indirectly i was the causei do not seek to excuse anything but it was the sorrow and the shame that killed him as to barclay the chemist that is another matter i will not deny that i was concerned in that mysterious disappearance which was a seven days wonder in the press i could not permit my scientific calm to be interrupted by the blackmailing visits of so insignificant a person and then after many years you came maisie you also got between me and that work which was life to me you also showed that you would rake up this old matter and bring dishonour upon a name which has stood for something in science you alsobut you will forgive me i have held on to life for your sake as an atonement for my sins now i go cumberledgeyour notebook subjective sensations swimming in the head light flashes before the eyes soothing torpor some touch of coldness constriction of the temples humming in the ears a sense of sinkingsinkingsinking  it was an hour later and hilda and i were alone in the chamber of death as sebastian lay there a marble figure with his keen eyes closed and his pinched thin face whiter and serener than ever i could not help gazing at him with some pangs of recollection i could not avoid recalling the time when his very name was to me a word of power and when the thought of him roused on my cheek a red flush of enthusiasm as i looked i murmured two lines from brownings grammarians funeral        this is our master famous calm and dead      borne on our shoulders   hilda wade standing beside me with an awestruck air added a stanza from the same great poem        lofty designs must close in like effects        loftily lying      leave himstill loftier than the world suspects        living and dying   i gazed at her with admiration and it is you hilda who pay him this generous tribute i cried you of all women  yes it is i she answered he was a great man after all hubert not good but great and greatness by itself extorts our unwilling homage  hilda i cried you are a great woman and a good woman too it makes me proud to think you will soon be my wife for there is now no longer any just cause or impediment  beside the dead master she laid her hand solemnly and calmly in mine no impediment she answered i have vindicated and cleared my fathers memory and now i can live actual life comes next we have much to do hubert
