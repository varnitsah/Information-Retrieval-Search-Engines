69937692	the adventures of jerry muskrat  by thornton w burgess     chapter i jerry muskrat has a fright  what was it mother muskrat had said about farmer browns boy and his traps jerry muskrat sat on the edge of the big rock and kicked his heels while he tried to remember the fact is jerry had not half heeded he had been thinking of other things besides it seemed to him that mother muskrat was altogether foolish about a great many things  pooh said jerry throwing out his chest i guess i can take care of myself without being tied to my mothers apron strings what if farmer browns boy is setting traps around the smiling pool i guess he cant fool your uncle jerry he isnt so smart as he thinks he is i can fool him any day jerry chuckled he was thinking of how he had once fooled farmer browns boy into thinking a big trout was on his hook  slowly jerry slid into the smiling pool and swam over towards his favorite log peter rabbit stuck his head over the edge of the bank hi jerry he shouted last night i saw farmer browns boy coming over this way with a lot of traps better watch out  go chase yourself peter rabbit i guess i can look out for myself replied jerry just a little crossly  peter made a wry face and started for the sweet clover patch hardly was he out of sight when billy mink and bobby coon came down the laughing brook together they seemed very much excited when they saw jerry muskrat they beckoned for him to come over where they were and when he got there they both talked at once and it was all about farmer browns boy and his traps  youd better watch out jerry warned billy mink who is a great traveler and has had wide experience  oh i guess im able to take care of myself said jerry airily and once more started for his favorite log and what do you suppose he was thinking about as he swam along he was wishing that he knew what a trap looked like for despite his boasting he didnt even know what he was to look out for as he drew near his favorite log something tickled his nose he stopped swimming to sniff and sniff my how good it did smell and it seemed to come right straight from the old log jerry began to swim as fast as he could in a few minutes he scrambled out on the old log then jerry rubbed his eyes three times to be sure that he saw aright there were luscious pieces of carrot lying right in front of him  now there is nothing that jerry muskrat likes better than carrot so he didnt stop to wonder how it got there he just reached out for the nearest piece and ate it then he reached for the next piece and ate it then he did a funny little dance just for joy when he was quite out of breath he sat down to rest snap something had jerry muskrat by the tail jerry squealed with fright and pain oh how it did hurt he twisted and turned but he was held fast and could not see what had him then he pulled and pulled until it seemed as if his tail would pull off but it didnt so he kept pulling and pretty soon the thing let go so suddenly that jerry tumbled head first into the water  when he reached home mother muskrat did his sore tail up for him what did i tell you about traps she asked severely  jerry stopped crying was that a trap he asked then he remembered that in his fright he didnt even see it oh dear he moaned i wouldnt know one today if i met it    chapter ii the convention at the big rock  jolly round red mr sun looked down on the smiling pool he almost forgot to keep on climbing up in the blue sky he was so interested in what he saw there what do you think it was why it was a convention at the big rock the queerest convention he ever had seen your papa would say that it was a massmeeting of angry citizens maybe it was but that is a pretty long term anyway mother muskrat said it was a convention and she ought to know for she is the one who had called it  of course jerry muskrat was there and his uncles and aunts and all his cousins billy mink was there and all his relations even old grandfather mink who has lost most of his teeth and is a little hard of hearing  little joe otter was there with his father and mother and all his relations even to his third cousins bobby coon was there and he had brought with him every coon of his acquaintance who ever fished in the smiling pool or along the laughing brook and everybody was looking very solemn very solemn indeed  when the last one had arrived mother muskrat climbed up on the big rock and called jerry muskrat up beside her where all could see him then she made a speech friends of the smiling pool and laughing brook began mrs muskrat i have called you together to show you what has happened to my son jerry and to ask your advice she stopped and pointed to jerrys sore tail what do you think did that she demanded  probably jerrys been in a fight and got whipped said bobby coon to his neighbor for bobby coon is a graceless young scamp and does not always show proper respect to his neighbors  mrs muskrat glared at him for she had overheard the remark then she held up one hand to command silence friends it was a trapa trap set by farmer browns boy a trap to catch you and me and our children said she solemnly it is no longer safe for our little folks to play around the smiling pool or along the laughing brook what are we going to do about it  everybody looked at everybody else in dismay then everybody began to talk at once and if farmer browns boy could have heard all the things said about him his cheeks certainly would have burned indeed i am afraid that they would have blistered such excitement everybody had a different idea and nobody would listen to anybody else old mr mink lost his temper and called grandpa otter a meddlesome knownothing it looked very much as if the convention was going to break up in a sad quarrel then mr coon climbed up on the big rock and with a stick pounded for silence  i move said he that in as much as we cannot agree we tell greatgrandfather frog all about the danger and ask his advice for he is very old and very wise and remembers when the world was young all in favor please raise their right hands  at once the air was full of hands and everybody was goodnatured once more so it was agreed to call in greatgrandfather frog    chapter iii the oracle of the smiling pool  grandfather frog sat on his big green lilypad with his eyes half closed for all the world as if he knew nothing about the meeting at the big rock of course he did know for there isnt much going on around the smiling pool which he doesnt see or at least hear all about the merry little breezes who are here there and everywhere told him all that was going on so that when he saw jerry muskrat and little joe otter swimming towards him he knew what they were coming for but he pretended to be very much surprised when jerry muskrat very politely said good morning grandfather frog  good morning jerry muskrat youre out early this morning replied grandfather frog  if you please you are wanted over at the big rock said jerry  grandfather frogs eyes twinkled but he made his voice very deep and gruff as he replied chugarum youre a scamp jerry muskrat and little joe otter is another what trick are you trying to play on me now  jerry muskrat and little joe otter looked a wee bit sheepish for it was true that they were forever trying to play tricks on grandfather frog really and truly grandfather frog there isnt any trick this time said jerry there is a meeting at the big rock to try to decide what to do to keep farmer browns boy from setting traps around the smiling pool and along the laughing brook and everybody wants your advice because you are so old and so wise please come  grandfather frog smoothed down his white and yellow waistcoat and pretended to think the matter over very seriously while jerry and little joe fidgeted impatiently finally he spoke  i am very old as you have said jerry muskrat and it is a long way over to the big rock  get right on my back and ill take you over there said jerry eagerly  im afraid that youll spill me off replied grandfather frog  no i wont just try me and see begged jerry  so grandfather frog climbed on jerry muskrats back and jerry started for the big rock as fast as he could go when all the minks and the otters and the coons and the muskrats saw them coming they gave a great shout for grandfather frog is sometimes called the oracle of the smiling pool you know an oracle is one who is very wise  bobby coon helped grandfather frog up on the big rock and when he had made himself comfortable mrs muskrat told him all about farmer browns boy and his traps and how jerry had been caught in one by the tail and she ended by asking for his advice because they all knew that he was so wise  when she said this grandfather frog puffed himself up until it seemed as if his white and yellow waistcoat would surely burst he sat very still for a while and gazed straight at jolly round red mr sun without blinking once then he spoke in a very deep voice  tomorrow morning at sunrise i will tell you what to do said he and not another word could they get out of him    chapter iv grandfather frogs plan  just as old mother west wind and her merry little breezes came down from the purple hills and jolly round red mr sun threw his nightcap off and began his daily climb up in the blue sky greatgrandfather frog climbed up on the big rock in the smiling pool early as he was all the little people who live along the laughing brook and around the smiling pool were waiting for him bobby coon had found two traps set by farmer browns boy and billy mink had almost stepped in a third no one felt safe any more yet no one knew what to do so they all waited for the advice of greatgrandfather frog who you know is accounted very very wise  grandfather frog cleared his throat chugarum said he you must find all the traps that farmer browns boy has set  how are we going to do it asked bobby coon  by looking for them replied grandfather frog tartly  bobby coon looked foolish and slipped out of sight behind his mother  all the coons and all the minks must search along the banks of the laughing brook and all the muskrats and all the otters must search along the banks of the smiling pool you must use your eyes and your noses when you find things good to eat where you have never found them before watch out when you get the first whiff of the mansmell watch out billy mink you are small and quick and your eyes are sharp you sit here on the big rock until you see farmer browns boy coming then go hide in the bulrushes where you can watch him but where he cannot see you follow him everywhere he goes around the smiling pool or along the laughing brook without knowing it he will show you where every trap is hidden  when all the traps have been found drop a stick or a stone in each that will spring them and then they will be harmless then you can bury them deep in the mud but dont eat any of the food until you have sprung all of the traps for just as likely as not you will get caught when all the traps have been sprung why not bring all the good things to eat which you find around them to the big rock and have a grand feast  hurrah for grandfather frog thats a great idea shouted little joe otter turning a somersault in the water  every one agreed with little joe otter and immediately they began to plan a grand hunt for the traps of farmer browns boy the muskrats and the otters started to search the banks of the smiling pool and the coons and the minks all but billy started for the laughing brook billy climbed up on the big rock to watch and grandfather frog slowly swam back to his big green lilypad to wait for some foolish green flies for his breakfast    chapter v a busy day at the smiling pool  everybody was excited yes sir everybody in the smiling pool and along the laughing brook was just bubbling over with excitement even spotty the turtle who usually takes everything so calmly that some people think him stupid climbed up on the highest point of an old log where he could see what was going on only grandfather frog sitting on his big green lilypad and watching for foolish green flies for his breakfast appeared not to know that something unusual was going on really he was just as much excited as the rest but because he is very old and accounted very very wise it would not do for him to show it  what was it all about why all the minks and the coons and the otters and the muskrats who live and play around the smiling pool and the laughing brook were hunting for traps yes sir they were hunting for traps set by farmer browns boy just as grandfather frog had advised them to  jerry muskrat and little joe otter were hunting together they were swimming along close to shore just where the laughing brook leaves the smiling pool when jerry wrinkled up his funny little nose and stopped swimming sniff sniff sniff went jerry muskrat then little cold shivers ran down his backbone and way out to the tip of his tail  what is it asked little joe otter  its the mansmell whispered jerry  just then little joe otter gave a long sniff my i smell fish he cried his eyes sparkling and started in the direction from which the smell came he swam faster than jerry and in a minute he shouted in delight  hi jerry some ones left a fish on the edge of the bank what a feast  jerry hurried as fast as he could swim his eyes popping out with fright for the nearer he got the stronger grew that dreadful mansmell dont touch it he panted dont touch it joe otter  little joe laughed whats the matter jerry fraid ill eat it all up before you get here he asked as he reached out for the fish  stop shrieked jerry and gave little joe a push just as the latter touched the fish  snap a pair of wicked steel jaws flew together and caught little joe otter by a claw of one toe if it hadnt been for jerrys push he would have been caught by a foot  oh oh oh cried little joe otter  next time i guess youll remember what grandfather frog said about watching out when you find things to eat where they never were before said jerry as he helped little joe pull himself free from the trap but he left the claw behind and had a dreadfully sore toe as a result then they buried the trap deep down in the mud and started to look for another  all around the smiling pool and along the laughing brook their cousins and uncles and aunts and friends were just as busy and every once in a while some one would have just as narrow an escape as little joe otter and all the time up at the farmhouse farmer browns boy was planning what he would do with the skins of the little animals he was sure he would catch in his traps    chapter vi farmer browns boy is puzzled  farmer browns boy was whistling merrily as he tramped down across the green meadows the merry little breezes saw him coming and they raced over to the smiling pool to tell billy mink farmer browns boy was coming to visit his traps he was very sure that he would find billy mink or little joe otter or jerry muskrat or perhaps bobby coon  billy mink was sitting on top of the big rock he saw the merry little breezes racing across the green meadows and behind them he saw farmer browns boy billy mink dived head first into the smiling pool then he swam over to jerry muskrats house and warned jerry together they hunted up little joe otter and then the three little scamps in brown hid in the bulrushes where they could watch farmer browns boy  the first place farmer browns boy visited was jerry muskrats old log very cautiously he peeped over the edge of the bank the trap was gone  hurrah shouted farmer browns boy he was very much excited as he caught hold of the end of the chain which fastened it to the old log he was sure that at last he had caught jerry muskrat when he pulled the trap up it was empty between the jaws were a few hairs and a little bit of skin which jerry muskrat had left there when he sprung the trap with his tail  farmer browns boy was disappointed well ill get him tomorrow anyway said he to himself then he went on to his next trap it was nowhere to be seen when he pulled the chain he was so excited that he trembled the trap did not come up at once he pulled and pulled and then suddenly up it came all covered with mud in it was one little claw from little joe otter very carefully farmer browns boy set the trap again if he could have looked over in the bulrushes and have seen little joe otter and billy mink and jerry muskrat watching him and tickling and laughing he would not have been so sure that next time he would catch little joe otter  all around the smiling pool and then up and down the laughing brook farmer browns boy tramped and each trap he found sprung and buried in the mud he had stopped whistling by this time and there was a puzzled frown on his freckled face what did it mean could some other boy have found all his traps and played a trick by springing all of them the more he thought about it the more puzzled he became you see he did not know anything about the busy day the minks and the otters and the muskrats and the coons had spent the day before  old grandfather frog sitting on his big green lilypad smoothed down his white and yellow waistcoat and winked up at jolly round red mr sun as farmer browns boy tramped off across the green meadows  chugarum said grandfather frog as he snapped up a foolish green fly much good it will do you to set those traps again  then grandfather frog called to billy mink and sent him to tell all the other little people of the smiling pool and the laughing brook that they must hurry and spring all the traps again as they had before  this time it was easy because they knew just where the traps were so all day long they dropped sticks and stones into the traps and once more sprung them then they prepared for a grand feast of the good things to eat which farmer browns boy had left scattered around the traps    chapter vii jerry muskrat makes a discovery  the beautiful springtime had brought a great deal of happiness to the smiling pool as it had to the green meadows and to the green forest greatgrandfather frog who had slept the long winter away in his own special bed way down in the mud had waked up with an appetite so great that for a while it seemed as if he could think of nothing but his stomach jerry muskrat had felt the spring fever in his bones and had gone up and down the laughing brook poking into all kinds of places just for the fun of seeing new things little joe otter had been more full of fun than ever if that were possible mr and mrs redwing had come back to the bulrushes from their winter home way down in the warm southland everybody was happy just as happy as could be  one sunny morning jerry muskrat sat on the big rock in the middle of the smiling pool just thinking of how happy everybody was and laughing at little joe otter who was cutting up all sorts of capers in the water suddenly jerrys sharp eyes saw something that made him wrinkle his forehead in a puzzled frown and look and look at the opposite bank finally he called to little joe otter  hi little joe come over here shouted jerry  what for asked little joe turning a somersault in the water  i want you to see if there is anything wrong with my eyes replied jerry  little joe otter stopped swimming and stared up at jerry muskrat they look all right to me said he as he started to climb up on the big rock  of course they look all right replied jerry but what i want to know is if they see all right look over at that bank  little joe otter looked over at the bank he stared and stared but he didnt see anything unusual it looked just as it always did he told jerry muskrat so  then it must be my eyes sighed jerry it certainly must be my eyes it looks to me as if the water does not come as high up on the bank as it did yesterday  little joe otter looked again and his eyes opened wide you are right jerry muskrat he cried theres nothing the matter with your eyes the water is as low as it ever gets even in the very middle of summer what can it mean  i dont know replied jerry muskrat it is queer it certainly is very queer lets go ask grandfather frog you know he is very old and very wise so perhaps he can tell us what it means  splash jerry muskrat and little joe otter dived into the smiling pool and started a race to see who could reach grandfather frog first he was sitting among the bulrushes on the edge of the smiling pool for the lilypads were not yet big enough for him to sit on comfortably  oh grandfather frog whats the matter with the smiling pool they shouted as they came up quite out of breath  chugarum theres nothing the matter with the smiling pool its the best place in all the world replied grandfather frog gruffly  but there is something the matter insisted jerry muskrat and then he told what he had discovered  i dont believe it said grandfather frog i never heard of such a thing in the springtime    chapter viii grandfather frog watches his toes  grandfather frog sat among the bulrushes on the edge of the smiling pool over his head mr redwing was singing as if his heart would burst with the very joy of springtime   tralalalee see me  see me   happy am i as i can be   happy am i the whole day long   and so i sing my gladsome song  of course mr redwing was happy why shouldnt he be here it was the beautiful springtime the gladdest time of all the year the time when happiness creeps into everybodys heart grandfather frog listened he nodded his head chugarum im happy too said grandfather frog but even as he said it a little worried look crept into his big goggly eyes and then down to the corners of his big mouth which had been stretched in a smile little by little the smile grew smaller and smaller until there wasnt any smile no sir there wasnt any smile instead of looking happy as he said he felt grandfather frog actually looked unhappy  the fact is he couldnt forget what jerry muskrat and little joe otter had told himthat there was something the matter with the smiling pool he didnt believe it not a word of it at least he tried to make himself think that he didnt believe it they had said that the water in the smiling pool was growing lower and lower just as it did in the middle of summer in the very hottest weather now grandfather frog is very old and very wise and he had never heard of such a thing happening in the springtime so he wouldnt believe it now and yetand yet grandfather frog had an uncomfortable feeling that something was wrong ha he knew now what it was he had been sitting up to his middle in water and now he was sitting with only his toes in the water and he couldnt remember having changed his position  of course i moved without thinking what i was doing muttered grandfather frog but still the worried look didnt leave his face you see he just couldnt make himself believe what he wanted to believe try as he would  chugarum i know what ill do ill watch my toes exclaimed grandfather frog  so grandfather frog waded out into the water until it covered his feet and then he sat down and began to watch his toes mr redwing looked down and saw him and grandfather frog looked so funny gazing at his own toes that mr redwing stopped singing long enough to ask what are you doing grandfather frog  watching my toes replied grandfather frog gruffly  watching your toes ho ho ho watching your toes who ever heard of such a thing are you afraid that they will run away grandfather frog shouted mr redwing  grandfather frog didnt answer he kept right on watching his toes mr redwing flew away to tell everybody he met how grandfather frog had become foolish and was watching his toes the sun shone down warm and bright and pretty soon grandfather frogs big goggly eyes began to blink then his head began to nod and thenwhy then grandfather frog fell fast asleep  by and by grandfather frog awoke with a start he looked down at his toes they were not in the water at all indeed the water was a good long jump away  chugarum there is something wrong with the smiling pool cried grandfather frog as he made a long jump into the water and started to swim out to the big rock    chapter ix the laughing brook stops laughing  there was something wrong grandfather frog knew it the very minute he got up that morning at first he couldnt think what it was he sat with just his head out of water and blinked his great goggly eyes as he tried to think what it was that was wrong suddenly grandfather frog realized how still it was it was a different kind of stillness from anything he could ever remember he missed something and he couldnt think what it was it wasnt the song of mr redwing there were many times when he didnt hear that it wasgrandfather frog gave a startled jump out on to the shore chugarum its the laughing brook the laughing brook has stopped laughing cried grandfather frog  could it be who ever heard of such a thing excepting when jack frost bound the laughing brook with hard black ice why in the spring and in the summer and in the fall the laughing brook had laughedsuch a merry happy laughever since grandfather frog could remember and you know he can remember way back in the long ago for he is very old and very wise never once in all that time had the laughing brook failed to laugh it couldnt be true now grandfather frog put a hand behind one ear and listened and listened but not a sound could he hear  chugarum it must be me said grandfather frog it must be that i am growing old and deaf ill go over and ask jerry muskrat  so grandfather frog dove into the water and swam out to the middle of the smiling pool on his way to jerry muskrats house it was then that he first fully realized the truth of what jerry muskrat and little joe otter had told him the day beforethat there was something very very wrong with the smiling pool he stopped swimming to look around and it seemed as if his great goggly eyes would pop right out of his head yes sir it seemed as if those great goggly eyes certainly would pop right out of grandfather frogs head the smiling pool had grown so small that there wasnt enough of it left to smile  where are you going grandfather frog asked a voice over his head  grandfather frog looked up looking down on him from over the edge of the big rock was jerry muskrat the edge of the big rock was twice as high above the water as grandfather frog had ever seen it before  iiwas going to swim over to your house to see you replied grandfather frog  its of no use replied jerry because im not there besides you couldnt swim there anyway  why not demanded grandfather frog in great surprise  because it isnt in the water any longer its way up on dry land said jerry muskrat in the most mournful voice  whats that you say cried grandfather frog as if he couldnt believe his own ears  its just as true as that im sitting here replied jerry sadly  listen jerry muskrat and tell me truly is the laughing brook laughing cried grandfather frog sharply  no replied jerry the laughing brook has stopped laughing and the smiling pool has stopped smiling and i think the world is upside down    chapter x why the world seemed upside down to jerry muskrat  jerry muskrat sat on the big rock in the smiling pool which smiled no longer and held his head in both hands for his head ached he had thought and thought and thought until it seemed to him that his head would split and with all his thinking he didnt understand things any more now than he had in the beginning you see jerry muskrats little world was topsyturvy yes sir jerrys world was upside down anyway it seemed so to him and he couldnt understand it at all  the smiling pool the laughing brook and the green meadows are jerry muskrats little world now as he sat on the big rock and looked about him the green meadows were as lovely as ever he could see no change in them but the laughing brook had stopped laughing and the smiling pool had stopped smiling the truth is there wasnt enough of the laughing brook left to laugh and there wasnt enough of the smiling pool left to smile  it was dreadful jerry looked over to his house of which he had once been so proud he had built it with the doorway under water he had felt perfectly safe there because no one excepting billy mink or little joe otter who can swim under water could reach him now the smiling pool had grown so small that jerrys house wasnt in the water at all anybody who wanted to could get into it there was the doorway plainly to be seen worse still there was the secret entrance to the long tunnel leading to his castle under the roots of the big hickorytree that had been jerrys most secret secret and now there it was for all the world to see and there were all the wonderful caves and holes and hidingplaces under the bank which had been known only to jerry muskrat and billy mink and little joe otter because the openings had always been under water now anybody could find them for they were plainly to be seen and where had always been smiling dimpling water jerry saw only mud it was mud mud mud everywhere the bulrushes which had always grown with their feet in the water now had them only in mud and that was fast drying up the lilypads lay half curled up at the ends of their long stems stretched out on the mud and looked very very sick jerry turned towards the laughing brook there was just a little teeny weeny stream of water trickling down the middle of it with here and there a tiny pool in which frightened trout and minnows were crowded all the secrets of the laughing brook were exposed just as were the secrets of the smiling pool jerry knew that if he wanted to find billy minks hidingplaces all he need do would be to walk up the laughing brook and look  yes sir the world has turned upside down said jerry in a mournful voice  i believe it has replied grandfather frog looking up from the little pool of water left at the foot of the big rock  i know it has cried jerry i wonder if it will ever turn upside up again  if it doesnt what are you going to do asked grandfather frog  i dont know replied jerry muskrat here come little joe otter and billy mink lets find out what they are going to do    chapter xi five heads together  something had to be done jerry muskrat said so grandfather frog said so billy mink said so little joe otter said so even spotty the turtle said so the laughing brook couldnt laugh and the smiling pool couldnt smile you see there wasnt water enough in either of them to laugh or smile and nobody knew if there ever would be again nobody had ever known anything like it before and so nobody knew what to think or do and yet they all felt that something must be done  what do you think billy mink asked grandfather frog  billy mink looked down from the top of the big rock into the little pool of water that was all there was left of the smiling pool he could see a dozen fat trout in it and he knew that he could catch them just as easily as not because there was no place for them to swim away from him but somehow he didnt want to catch them he knew that they were frightened almost to death already by the running away of nearly all the water from the laughing brook and the smiling pool and somehow he felt sorry for them  i think that the best thing we can do is to move down to the big river ive been down there and thats all right said billy mink  thats what i think said little joe otter theres no danger that the big river will go dry  how do you know asked jerry muskrat the laughing brook and the smiling pool never went dry before  its a long long way down to the big river broke in spotty the turtle who travels very very slowly and carries his house with him  chugarum i for one dont want to leave the smiling pool without finding out what the trouble is   theres nothing happens as you know   but has a cause to make it so  now there must be some cause some reason for this terrible trouble with the smiling pool and if we can find that out perhaps we shall know better what to do said grandfather frog  jerry muskrat nodded his head grandfather frog is right said he of course there must be a cause but where are we to look for it ive been all over the smiling pool and im sure it isnt there  grandfather frog actually smiled chugarum said he of course the cause of all the trouble isnt in the smiling pool any one would know that  well if you know so much tell us where it is then snapped jerry muskrat  in the laughing brook of course replied grandfather frog  no such thing said billy mink ive been all the way down the laughing brook to the big river and i didnt find a thing  have you been all the way up the laughing brook to the place it starts from asked grandfather frog  noo replied billy mink  well thats where the cause of all the trouble is said grandfather frog just as if he knew all about it its the water that comes down the laughing brook that makes the smiling pool and the smiling pool never could dry up if the laughing brook didnt first stop running  thats so i never had thought of that cried little joe otter i tell you what billy mink and i will go way up the laughing brook and see what we can find  chugarum let us all go said grandfather frog  then the five put their heads together and decided that they would go up the laughing brook to hunt for the trouble    chapter xii a hunt for trouble  ol mistah buzzard sailing high in the blue blue sky looked down on a funny sight yes sir it certainly was a funny sight it was a little procession of five of his friends of the smiling pool first was billy mink who because he is slim and nimble moves so quickly it sometimes is hard to follow him behind him was little joe otter whose legs are so short that he almost looks as if he hadnt any behind little joe was jerry muskrat who is a better traveler in the water than on land behind jerry was grandfather frog who neither walks nor runs but travels with great jumps last of all was spotty the turtle who travels very very slowly because you know he carries his house with him and all five were headed up the laughing brook which laughed no more because there was not water enough in it  now ol mistah buzzard hadnt been over near the smiling pool for some time and he hadnt heard how the smiling pool had stopped smiling and the laughing brook had stopped laughing when he looked down and saw how the water was so nearly gone from them that the trout and the minnows had hardly enough in which to live he was so surprised that he kept saying over and over to himself  fo the lans sake fo the lans sake  then when he saw his five little friends marching up the laughing brook he guessed right away that it must be something to do with the trouble in the smiling pool ol mistah buzzard just turned his broad wings and slid down down out of the blue blue sky until he was right over grandfather frog  where are yoalls going asked ol mistah buzzard  chugarum to find out what is the trouble with the laughing brook replied grandfather frog  ill help you said ol mistah buzzard once more sailing up in the blue blue sky  grandfather frog watched him until he was nothing but a speck i wish i had wings sighed grandfather frog and once more began to hop along up the bed of the laughing brook  the laughing brook came down from the green forest and wound through the green meadows for a little way before it reached the smiling pool there the sun shone down into it and grandfather frog didnt mind although his legs were getting tired but when they got into the green forest it was dark and gloomy at least grandfather frog thought so and so did spotty the turtle for both dearly love the sunshine but still they kept on for they felt that they must find the trouble with the laughing brook if they found this they would also find the trouble with the smiling pool  so billy mink jumped and skipped far ahead little joe otter ran jerry muskrat walked for he soon gets tired on land grandfather frog hopped spotty the turtle crawled and way way up in the blue blue sky of mistah buzzard flew all looking for the trouble which had stopped the laughing of the laughing brook and the smiling of the smiling pool    chapter xiii ol mistah buzzard sees something  wait for me cried little joe otter to billy mink but billy mink was in too much of a hurry and just ran faster  wait for me cried jerry muskrat to little joe otter but little joe was in too much of a hurry and just ran faster  wait for me cried grandfather frog to jerry muskrat but jerry was in too much of a hurry and just walked faster  wait for me cried spotty the turtle to grandfather frog but grandfather frog was in too much of a hurry and just jumped faster  so running and walking and jumping and crawling billy mink little joe otter jerry muskrat grandfather frog and spotty the turtle hurried up the laughing brook to try to find out why it laughed no more and high overhead in the blue blue sky sailed ol mistah buzzard and he also was looking for the trouble that had taken away the laugh from the laughing brook and the smile from the smiling pool  now ol mistah buzzards eyes are very sharp and looking down from way up in the blue blue sky he can see a great deal indeed ol mistah buzzard can see all that is going on below on the green meadows and in the green forest his wings are very broad and he can sail through the air very swiftly when he makes up his mind to now as he looked down he saw that billy mink was selfish and wouldnt wait for little joe otter and little joe otter was selfish and wouldnt wait for jerry muskrat and jerry muskrat was selfish and wouldnt wait for grandfather frog and grandfather frog was selfish and wouldnt wait for spotty the turtle  ah reckon ah will hurry up right smart and find out what the trouble is mahself and then go back and tell brer turtle it will save him a powerful lot of work and it will serve brer mink right if brer turtle finds out first what is the trouble with the laughing brook said ol mistah buzzard and shot far ahead over the green forest towards that part of it from which the laughing brook comes in a few minutes he was as far ahead of billy mink as billy was ahead of spotty the turtle   for wings are swifter far than legs   on whatsoever purpose bent but doubly swift and tireless  those wings on kindly deed intent  and this is how it happened that ol mistah buzzard was the first to find out what it was that had stopped the laughing of the laughing brook and the smiling of the smiling pool but he was so surprised when he did find out that he forgot all about going back to tell spotty the turtle he forgot everything but his own great surprise and he blinked his eyes a great many times to make sure that he wasnt dreaming then he sailed around and around in circles looking down among the trees of the green forest and saying over and over to himself  did yo ever no ah never did yo ever no ah never    chapter xiv spotty the turtle keeps right on going   one step two steps three steps so   four steps five steps six steps go   keep right on and do your best   mayhap youll win while others rest  spotty the turtle said this over to himself every time he felt a little downhearted as he plodded along the bed of the laughing brook and every time he said it he felt better one step two steps he kept saying over and over and each time he said it he took a step and then another they were very short steps very short steps indeed for spottys legs are very short but each one carried him forward just so much and he knew that he was just so much nearer the thing he was seeking anyway he hoped he was  you see if the laughing brook would never laugh any more and the smiling pool would never smile any more there was nothing to do but to go down to the big river to live and no one wanted to do that especially grandfather frog and spotty the turtle  now because billy mink could go faster than little joe otter and little joe otter could go faster than jerry muskrat and jerry could go faster than grandfather frog and grandfather frog could go faster than spotty the turtle and because each one wanted to be the first to find the trouble no one would wait for the one behind him so spotty the turtle who has to carry his house with him was a long long way behind the others but he kept right on going   one step two steps three steps so  and he didnt stop for anything he crawled over sticks and around big stones and sometimes when he found a little pool of water he swam he always felt better then because he can swim faster than he can walk  after a long long time spotty the turtle came to a little pool where the sunshine lay warm and inviting there in the middle of it on a mossy stone sat grandfather frog fast asleep he had thought that he was so far ahead of spotty that he could safely rest his tired legs spotty wanted to climb right up beside him and take a nap too but he didnt he just grinned and kept right on going   one step two steps three steps so  while grandfather frog slept on  by and by after a long long time spotty came to another little pool and who should he see but jerry muskrat busily opening and eating some freshwater clams which he had found there he was so busy enjoying himself that he didnt see spotty and spotty didnt say a word but kept right on going although the sight of jerrys feast had made him dreadfully hungry  by and by after a long long time he came to a third little pool with a high smooth bank and who should he see there but little joe otter who had made a slippery slide down the smooth bank and was having a glorious time sliding down into the little pool spotty would have liked to take just one slide but he didnt he didnt even let little joe otter see him but kept right on going   one step two steps three steps so  by and by after a long long time he came to a hollow log and just happening to peep in he saw some one curled up fast asleep who was it why billy mink to be sure you see billy thought that he was so far ahead that he might just as well take it easy and that was what he was doing spotty the turtle didnt waken him he just kept right on going the same slow way he had come all day and so just as jolly round red mr sun was going to bed behind the purple hills spotty the turtle found the cause of the trouble in the laughing brook and the smiling pool    chapter xv what spotty the turtle found  spotty the turtle stared and stared and stared until it seemed as if his eyes surely would pop out of his funny little head of course he could believe his own eyes and yetand yetwell if anybody else had seen what he was looking at and had told him about it he wouldnt have believed it no sir he wouldnt have believed it you see he couldnt have believed it becausewhy because it didnt seem as if it could be really and truly so  he wondered if the sun shining in his eyes made him think he saw more than he really did see so he carefully changed his position it made no difference then spotty was sure that what he saw was real and that he had found the cause of the trouble in the laughing brook which had made it stop laughing and the smiling pool stop smiling  spotty the turtle was feeling pretty good in fact spotty was feeling very good indeed because he had been the first to find out what was the matter with the laughing brook at least he thought that he was the first and he was of all the little people who live in the smiling pool only ol mistah buzzard had been before him and he didnt count because his wings are broad and all he had to do was to sail over the green forest and look down the ones who really counted were billy mink and little joe otter and jerry muskrat and grandfather frog billy mink had stopped for a nap little joe otter had stopped to play jerry muskrat had stopped to eat grandfather frog had stopped for a sunnap but spotty the turtle had kept right on going and now here he was the first one to find the cause of the trouble in the laughing brook do you wonder that he felt proud and very happy   keeping at it thats the way  spotty won the race that day  but now spotty was beginning to wish that some of the others would hurry up he wanted to know what they thought he wanted to talk it all over it was such a surprising thing that he could make neither head nor tail of it himself and he wondered what the others would say and now the long black shadows were creeping through the green forest and if they didnt get there pretty soon they would have to wait until the next day  so spotty the turtle found a good place to spend the night and then he sat down to watch and wait right before him was the thing which he had found and which puzzled him so what was it why it was a wall yes sir that is just what it wasa wall of logs and sticks and mud and it was right across the laughing brook where the banks were steep and narrow of course the laughing brook could laugh no longer there couldnt enough water get through that wall of logs and sticks and mud to make even the beginning of a laugh spotty wondered what lay behind that wall and who had built it and what for and a lot of other things and he was still wondering when he fell asleep    chapter xvi the pond in the green forest  spotty the turtle was awake by the time the first rays of the rising sun began to creep through the green forest he was far far up the laughing brook very much farther than he had ever been before and as he yawned and stretched he wondered if after all he hadnt dreamed about the wall of logs and sticks and mud across the laughing brook when he had rubbed the last sleepywink out of his eyes he looked again there it was just as he had seen it the night before then spotty knew that it was real and he began to wonder what was on the other side of it  i cannot climb it for my legs were never made for climbing said spotty mournfully as he looked at his funny little black feet oh dear i wish that i could climb like happy jack squirrel just then a thought popped into his head and chased away the little frown that had crept into spottys face perhaps happy jack sometimes wishes that he could swim as i can so i guess we are even i cant climb but he cant swim how foolish it is to wish for things never meant for you  and with that all the discontent left spotty the turtle and he began to study how he could make the most of his short legs and his perseverance of which as you already know he had a great deal he looked this way and he looked that way and he saw that if he could climb to the top of the bank on one side of the laughing brook he would be able to walk right out on the strange wall of logs and sticks and mud and then of course he could see just what was on the other side  so spotty the turtle wasted no more time wishing that he could do something it was never meant that he should do instead he picked out what looked like the easiest place to climb the bank and started up my my my it was hard work you see he had to carry his house along with him for he has to carry that wherever he goes and it would have been hard enough to have climbed that bank without carrying anything every time he had climbed up three steps he slipped back two steps but he kept at it puffing and blowing saying over and over to himself   i can if i will and will if i can   im sure to get there if i follow this plan  halfway up the bank spotty lost his balance and the house he was carrying just tipped him right over backward and down he rolled to the place he had started from  i needed to cool off said spotty to himself and slid into a little pool of water then he tried the bank again and just as before he slipped back two steps for every three he went up but he shut his mouth tight and kept at it and by and by he was up to the place from which he had tumbled there he stopped to get his breath   i can if i will and will if i can   im sure to get there if i follow this plan  said he and started on again twice more he tumbled clear down to the place he had started from but each time he laughed at himself and tried again and at last he reached the top of the bank  i said i could if i would and i would if i could and i have he cried  then he hurried to see what was behind the strange wall what do you think it was why a pond yes sir there was a pond right in the middle of the green forest trees were coming up right out of the middle of it but it was a sure enough pond spotty found it harder work to believe his own eyes now than when he had first seen the strange wall across the laughing brook  why why why what does it mean exclaimed spotty the turtle  thats what i want to know cried billy mink who came hurrying up just then    chapter xvii who had made the strange pond  who had made the strange pond that is what spotty the turtle wanted to know that is what billy mink wanted to know so did little joe otter and jerry muskrat and grandfather frog when they arrived so did ol mistah buzzard looking down from the blue blue sky it was very strange very strange indeed never had there been a pond in that part of the green forest before not even in the days when sister south wind melted the snow so fast that the laughing brook ran over its banks and the smiling pool grew twice as large as it ought to be  of course some one had made it spotty the turtle had known that as soon as he had seen the strange pond all in a flash he had understood what that wall of logs and brush and mud across the laughing brook was for it was to stop the water from running down the laughing brook and of course if the water couldnt keep on running and laughing on its way to the smiling pool it would just stand still and grow and grow into a pond of course there was nothing else for it to do spotty felt very proud when he had thought that out all by himself  this wall we are sitting on has made the pond said spotty the turtle after a long time in which no one had spoken  you dont say so said billy mink how ever ever did you guess it are you sure quite sure that the pond didnt make the wall  spotty knew that billy mink was making fun of him but he is too goodnatured to lose his temper over a little thing like that he tried to think of something smart to say in reply but spotty is a slow thinker as well as a slow walker and before he could think of anything billy was talking once more  this wall is what farmer browns boy calls a dam said billy mink who is a great traveler dams are usually built to keep water from running where it isnt wanted or to make it go where it is wanted now what i want to know is who under the sun wants a pond way back here in the green forest and what is it for who do you think built this dam grandfather frog  grandfather frog shook his head his big goggly eyes seemed more goggly than ever as he stared at the new pond in the green forest  i dont know said grandfather frog i dont know what to think  why it must be farmer browns boy or farmer brown himself said jerry muskrat  of course said little joe otter just as if he knew all about it  still grandfather frog shook his head as if he didnt agree i dont know said grandfather frog i dont know it doesnt look so to me  billy mink ran along the top of the dam and down the back side he looked it all over with those sharp little eyes of his  grandfather frog is right said he when he came back it doesnt look like the work of farmer brown or farmer browns boy but if they didnt do it who did who could have done it  i dont know said grandfather frog again in a dreamy sort of voice  spotty the turtle looked at him and saw that grandfather frogs face wore the faraway look that it always does when he tells a story of the days when the world was young i dont know he repeated but it looks to me very much like the work of grandfather frog stopped short off and turned to jerry muskrat jerry muskrat said he so sharply that jerry nearly lost his balance in his surprise has your big cousin come down from the north    chapter xviii jerry muskrats big cousin   fiddle faddle feedle fuddle  was there ever such a muddle  fuddle feedle faddle fiddle  who is there will solve the riddle  here was the laughing brook laughing no longer here was the smiling pool smiling no longer here was a brand new pond deep in the green forest here was a wall of logs and bushes and mud called a dam built by some one whom nobody had seen and here was grandfather frog asking jerry muskrat if his big cousin had come down from the north when jerry didnt even know that he had a big cousin  ii havent any big cousin said jerry when he had quite recovered from his surprise at grandfather frogs question  chugarum exclaimed grandfather frog and the scornful way in which he said it made jerry muskrat feel very small chugarum of course youve got a big cousin in the north do you mean to tell me that you dont know that jerry muskrat  jerry had to admit that it was true that he didnt know anything about that big cousin if grandfather frog said that he had one it must be so for grandfather frog is very old and very wise and he knows a great deal still it was very hard for jerry to believe that he had a big cousin of whom he had never heard  diddid you ever see him grandfather frog jerry asked  no snapped grandfather frog i never did but i know all about him he is a great worker is this big cousin of yours and he builds dams like this one we are sitting on  i dont believe it cried billy mink i dont believe any cousin of jerry muskrats ever built such a dam as this why just look at that great tree trunk at the bottom no one but farmer brown or farmer browns boy could ever have dragged that there youre crazy grandfather frog just plain crazy billy mink sometimes is very disrespectful to grandfather frog  chugarum replied grandfather frog im pretty old but im not too old to learn as some folks seem to be and he looked very hard at billy mink did i say that that tree trunk was dragged here  no replied billy mink but if it wasnt dragged here how did it get here you are so smart grandfather frog tell me that  grandfather frog blinked his great goggly eyes at billy mink as he said just as if he was very very sorry for billy your eyes are very bright and very sharp billy mink and it is a great pity that you have never learned how to use them that tree wasnt dragged here it was cut so that it fell right where it lies as he spoke grandfather frog pointed to the stump of the tree and billy mink saw that he was right  but billy mink is like a great many other people he dearly loves to have the last word now he suddenly began to laugh  ha ha ha ho ho ho laughed billy mink ho ho ho ha ha ha  what is it that is so funny snapped grandfather frog for nothing makes him so angry as to be laughed at  do you mean to say that anybody but farmer brown or farmer browns boy could have cut down such a big tree as that asked billy why that would be as hard as to drag the tree here  jerry muskrats big cousin from the north could do it and i believe he did replied grandfather frog now that we have found the cause of the trouble in the laughing brook and the smiling pool what are we going to do about it    chapter xix jerry muskrat has a busy day  there was the strange pond in the green forest and there was the dam of logs and sticks and mud which had made the strange pond but look as they would billy mink and little joe otter and jerry muskrat and grandfather frog and spotty the turtle could see nothing of the one who had built the dam it was very queer the more they thought about it the queerer it seemed they looked this way and they looked that way  there is one thing very sure and that is that whoever built this dam had no thought for those who live in the laughing brook and the smiling pool said grandfather frog they are selfish just plain everyday selfish thats what they are now the laughing brook cannot laugh and the smiling pool cannot smile while this dam stops the water from running and so grandfather frog stopped and looked around at his four friends  and so what cried billy mink impatiently  and so we must spoil this dam we must make a place for the water to run through said grandfather frog very gravely  of course thats the very thing cried little joe otter and billy mink and jerry muskrat and spotty the turtle then little joe otter looked at billy mink and billy mink looked at jerry muskrat and jerry muskrat looked at spotty the turtle and after that they all looked very hard at grandfather frog and all together they asked how are we going to do it  grandfather frog scratched his head thoughtfully and looked a long time at the dam of logs and sticks and mud then his big mouth widened in a big smile  why that is very simple said he jerry muskrat will make a big hole through the dam near the bottom because he knows how and the rest of us will keep watch to see that no harm comes near  the very thing cried little joe otter and billy mink and spotty the turtle but jerry muskrat thought it wasnt fair you see it gave him all of the real work to do however jerry thought of his dear smiling pool and how terrible it would be if it should smile no more and so without another word he set to work  now jerry muskrat is a great worker and he had made many long tunnels into the bank around the smiling pool so he had no doubt but that he could soon make a hole through this dam but almost right away he found trouble yes sir jerry had hardly begun before he found real trouble you see that dam was made mostly of sticks instead of mud and so instead of digging his way in as he would have done into the bank of the smiling pool he had to stop every few minutes to gnaw off sticks that were in the way  it was hard work the hardest kind of hard work but jerry muskrat is the kind that is the more determined to do the work the harder the work is to be done and so while grandfather frog sat on one end of the dam and pretended to keep watch but really took a nap in the warm sunshine and while spotty the turtle sat on the other end of the dam doing the same thing and while billy mink and little joe otter swam around in the strange pond and enjoyed themselves jerry muskrat worked and worked and worked and just as jolly round red mr sun started down behind the purple hills jerry broke through into the strange pond and the water began to run in the laughing brook once more    chapter xx jerry has a dreadful disappointment   theres nothing in this world thats sure   no matter how we scheme and plan  we simply have to be content   with doing just the best we can  jerry muskrat had curled himself up for the night so tired that he could hardly keep his eyes open long enough to find a comfortable place to sleep but he was happy yes indeed jerry was happy he could hear the laughing brook beginning to laugh again it was just a little low gurgling laugh but jerry knew that in a little while it would grow into the full laugh that makes music through the green forest and puts happiness into the hearts of all who hear it  so jerry was happy for was it not because of him that the laughing brook was beginning to laugh he had worked all the long day to make a hole through the dam which some one had built across the laughing brook and so stopped its laughter now the water was running again and soon the new strange pond behind the dam there in the green forest would be gone and the laughing brook and the smiling pool would be their own beautiful selves once more it was because he had worked so hard all day that he was going to sleep now usually he would rather sleep a part of the day and be abroad at night  very pleasant dreams had jerry muskrat that night dreams of the dear smiling pool smiling just as it had as long as jerry could remember before this trouble had come he was still dreaming when spotty the turtle found him and waked him for it was broad daylight jerry yawned and stretched and then he lay still for a minute to listen to the pleasant murmur of the laughing brook but there wasnt any pleasant murmur there wasnt any sound at all jerry began to wonder if he really was awake after all he looked at spotty the turtle and he knew then that he was for spottys face had such a worried look  get up jerry muskrat and come look at the hole you made yesterday in the dam you couldnt have done your work very well for the hole has filled up so that the water does not run any more said spotty  i did do it well snapped jerry crossly i did it just as well as i know how you lazy folks who just sit and take sunnaps while you pretend to keep watch had better get busy and do a little work yourselves if you dont like the way i work  ii beg your pardon jerry muskrat i didnt mean to say just that replied spotty you see we are all worried we thought last night that by this morning the laughing brook would be full of water again and we could go back to the smiling pool as soon as we felt like it and here it is as bad as ever  perhaps the trouble is just that some sticks and grass drifted down in the water and filled up the hole i made that must be the trouble said jerry hopefully as he hurried towards the dam  first he carefully examined it from the laughing brook side then he dived down under water on the other side he was gone a long time and billy mink was just getting ready to dive to see what had become of him when he came up again  what is the trouble cried spotty the turtle and grandfather frog and billy mink and little joe otter together is the hole filled up with stuff that has drifted in  jerry shook his head as he slowly climbed out of the water no said he no it isnt filled with drift stuff brought down by the water it is filled with sticks and mud that somebody has put there somebody has filled up the hole that i worked so hard to make yesterday and it will take me all day to open it up again  then grandfather frog and spotty the turtle and billy mink and little joe otter and jerry muskrat stared at one mother and for a long time no one said a word    chapter xxi jerry muskrat keeps watch   the way in which to find things out   and what goes on all round about   is just to keep my two eyes peeled   and two ears all the time unsealed  so said jerry muskrat as he settled himself comfortably on one end of the new dam across the laughing brook deep in the green forest and watched the dark shadows creep farther and farther out into the strange pond made by the new dam  im going to find out who it is that built this dam and who it is that filled the hole i made in it im going to find out if i have to move up here and live all summer the way in which jerry said this and snapped his teeth together showed that he meant just what he said  you see jerry had spent another long weary day opening the hole in the dam once more only to have it closed again while he slept that had been enough for jerry he hadnt tried again instead he had made up his mind that he would find out who was playing such a trick on him he would just watch until they came and then if they were not bigger than he or there were not too many of them he wouldwell the way jerry gritted and clashed those sharp teeth of his sounded as if he meant to do something pretty bad  billy mink and little joe otter had given up in disgust and started for the big river they are great travelers anyway and so didnt mind so much because there was no longer water enough in the laughing brook and the smiling pool grandfather frog and spotty the turtle who are such very very slow travelers had decided that the big river was too far away and so they would stay and live in the strange pond for a while though it wasnt nearly so nice as their dear smiling pool they bad gone to sleep now each in his own secret place where he would be safe for the night  so jerry muskrat sat alone and watched the black shadows crept farther and farther across the pond and grew blacker and blacker jerry didnt mind this because as you know his eyes are made for seeing in the dark and he dearly loves the night jerry had sat there a long time without moving he was listening and watching by and by he saw something that made him draw in his breath and anger leap into his eyes it was a little silver line on the water and it was coming straight towards the dam where he sat jerry knew that it was made by some one swimming  ha said jerry now we shall see  nearer and nearer came the silver line then jerry made out the head of the swimmer suddenly all the anger left jerry he didnt have room for anger a great fear had crowded it out the head was bigger than that of any muskrat jerry had ever seen it was bigger than the head of any of billy minks relatives it was the head of a stranger a stranger so big that jerry felt very very small and hoped with all his might that the stranger would not see him  jerry held his breath as the stranger swam past and then climbed out on the dam he looked very much like jerry himself only ever and ever so much bigger and his tail jerry had never seen such a tail it was very broad and flat suddenly the big stranger turned and looked straight at jerry  hello jerry muskrat said he dont you know me  jerry was too frightened to speak  im your big cousin from the north im paddy the beaver and if you leave my dam alone i think well be good friends continued the stranger  iii hope so said jerry in a very faint voice trying to be polite but with his teeth chattering with fear    chapter xxii jerry loses his fear   oh tell me you and you and you    if it may hap youve ever heard   of all that wondrous is and great    the greatest is the spoken word  its true its the truest thing that ever was if you dont believe it you just go ask jerry muskrat hell tell you its true and jerry knows you see its this way words are more than just sounds oh my yes they are little messengers and once they have been sent out you cant call them back no sir you cant call them back and sometimes that is a very sad thing becausewell you see these little messengers always carry something to some one else and that something may be anger or hate or fear or an untruth and it is these things which make most of the trouble in this world or that something may be love or sympathy or helpfulness or kindness and it is these things which put an end to most of the troubles in this world  just take the ease of jerry muskrat there he sat on the new dam which had made the strange pond in the green forest shaking with fear until his teeth chattered as he watched a stranger very very much bigger than he climb up on the dam jerry was afraid because he had seen that the stranger could swim as well as he could and as jerry had no secret burrows there he knew that he couldnt get away from the stranger if he wanted to somehow jerry knew without being told that the stranger had built the dam and you know jerry had twice made a hole in the dam to let the water out of the strange pond into the laughing brook jerry knew right down in his heart that if he had built that dam he would be very very angry with any one who tried to spoil it and that is just what he had tried to do so he sat with chattering teeth too frightened to even try to run  i wish i had let some one else keep watch said jerry to himself  then the big stranger had spoken he had said hello jerry muskrat dont you know me and his voice hadnt sounded the least bit angry then he had told jerry that he was his big cousin paddy the beaver and he hoped that they would be friends  now everything was just as it had been beforethe strange pond the dam jerry himself and the big stranger and the black shadows of the nightand yet somehow everything was different all because a few pleasant words had been spoken a great fear had fallen away from jerrys heart and in its place was a great hope that after all there wasnt to be any trouble so he replied to paddy the beaver as politely as he knew how paddy was just as polite and the first thing jerry knew instead of being enemies as jerry had all along made up his mind would be the case when he found the builder of the dam here they were becoming the best of friends all because paddy the beaver had said the right thing in the right way  but you havent told me yet what you made those holes in my dam for cousin jerry said paddy the beaver finally  jerry didnt know just what to say he was so pleased with his big new cousin that he didnt want to hurt his feelings by telling him that he didnt think that dam had any business to be across the laughing brook and at the same time he wanted paddy to know how he had spoiled the laughing brook and the smiling pool at last he made up his mind to tell the whole story    chapter xxiii paddy the beaver does a kind deed  paddy the beaver listened to all that his small cousin jerry muskrat had to tell him about the trouble which paddys dam had caused in the laughing brook and the smiling pool  you see we who live in the smiling pool love it dearly and we dont want to have to leave it but if the water cannot run down the laughing brook there can be no smiling pool and so we will have to move off to the big river concluded jerry muskrat that is why i tried to spoil your dam  there was a twinkle in the eyes of paddy the beaver as he replied well now that you have found out that you cant do that because i am bigger than you and can stop you what are you going to do about it  i dont know said jerry muskrat sadly i dont see what we can do about it of course you are big and strong and can do just as you please but it doesnt seem right that we who have lived here so long should have to move and go away from all that we love so just because you a stranger happen to want to live here i tell you what jerrys eyes sparkled as a brand new thought came to him couldnt you come down and live in the smiling pool with us im sure there is room enough  paddy the beaver shook his head no said he and jerrys heart sank no i cant do that because down there there isnt any of the kind of food i eat besides i wouldnt feel at all safe in the smiling pool you see i always live in the woods no i couldnt possibly come down to live in the smiling pool but im truly sorry that i have made you so much worry cousin jerry and im going to prove it to you now you sit right here until i come back  before jerry realized what he was going to do paddy the beaver dived into the pond and as he disappeared his broad tail hit the water such a slap that it made jerry jump then there began a great disturbance down under water in a few minutes up bobbed a stick and then another and another and the water grew so muddy that jerry couldnt see what was going on paddy was gone a long time jerry wondered how he could stay under water so long without air all the time paddy was just fooling him he would come up to the surface stick his nose out nothing more fill his lungs with fresh air and go down again  suddenly jerry muskrat heard a sound that made him prick up his funny little short ears and whirl about so that he could look over the other side of the dam into the laughing brook what do you think that sound was why it was the sound of rushing water the sweetest sound jerry had listened to for a long time there was a great hole in the dam and already the brook was beginning to laugh as the water rushed down it  how do you like that cousin jerry said a voice right in his ear paddy the beaver had climbed up beside him and his eyes were twinkling  itits splendid cried jerry butbut youve spoiled your dam  oh thats all right replied paddy i didnt really want it now anyway i dont usually build dams at this time of year and i built this one just for fun because it seemed such a nice place to build one you see i was traveling through here and it seemed such a nice place that i thought i would stay a while i didnt know anything about the smiling pool you know now i guess ill have to move on and find a place where i can make a pond in the fall that will not trouble other people you see i dont like to be troubled myself and so i dont want to trouble other people this green forest is a very nice place  the very nicest place in all the world excepting the green meadows and the smiling pool replied jerry promptly wont you stay cousin paddy im sure we would all like to have you  of course we would said a gruff voice right beside them it was grandfather frog  paddy the beaver looked thoughtful perhaps i will said he if i can find some good hidingplaces in the laughing brook    chapter xxiv a merry homegoing   the laughing brook is merry   and so am i cried jerry   grandfather frog said he was too   and spotty was the others knew  the trees stood with wet feet where just a little while before had been the strange pond in the green forest the pond made by the dam of paddy the beaver in the dam was a great hole made by paddy himself  through the green forest rang the laughter of the laughing brook for once more the water ran deep between its banks and in the hearts of grandfather frog and jerry muskrat and spotty the turtle was laughter also for now the smiling pool would smile once more and they could go home in peace and happiness and there was one more who laughed who was it why paddy the beaver to be sure and his was the best laugh of all for it was because he had brought happiness to others  you beat me up here to the dam but you wont beat me back to the smiling pool cried jerry muskrat to spotty the turtle  spotty laughed goodnaturedly youd better not stop to eat or play or sleep on the way then said he for i shall keep right on going all the time ive found that is the only way to get anywhere  let us all go down together said grandfather frog we can help each other over the bad places  jerry muskrat laughed until he had to hold his sides at the very thought of grandfather frog or spotty the turtle being able to help him but he is very goodnatured and so he agreed that they should all go down together paddy the beaver said that he would go too so off the four started jerry muskrat and paddy the beaver swimming side by side and behind them grandfather frog and spotty the turtle  now spotty the turtle is a very slow traveler on land but in the water spotty is not so slow in fact it was not long before grandfather frog found that he was the one who could not keep up you see while he is a great diver and can swim fast for a short distance he is soon tired out pretty soon he was puffing and blowing and dropping farther and farther behind by and by spotty the turtle looked back there was grandfather frog just tumbling head first over a little waterfall he came up choking and gasping and kicking his long legs very feebly spotty climbed out on a rock and waited he helped grandfather frog out beside him and when grandfather frog had once more gotten his breath what do you think spotty did why he took grandfather frog right on his back and started on again  now jerry muskrat and paddy the beaver being great swimmers were soon out of sight all at once jerry remembered that they had agreed to go back together and down in his heart he felt a little bit mean when he looked for grandfather frog and spotty the turtle and could see nothing of them so he and paddy sat down to wait after what seemed a long time they saw something queer bobbing along in the water  its grandfather frog cried paddy the beaver  no its spotty the turtle said jerry muskrat  its both replied paddy beginning to laugh  just then spotty tumbled over another waterfall which he hadnt seen and of course grandfather frog went with him and lost his hold on spottys back  i have an idea cried paddy  what is it asked jerry  why grandfather frog can ride on my flat tail replied paddy and then well go slow enough for spotty to keep up with us  and so it was that just as the first moonbeams kissed the smiling pool out of the laughing brook swam the merriest party that ever was seen  chugarum said grandfather frog it is good to be home but i think i would travel often if i could have the tail of paddy the beaver for a boat    chapter xxv paddy the beaver decides to stay   the fair green meadows spreading wide   the smiling pool and laughing brook   they fill our hearts with joy and pride   we love their every hidden nook  so said jerry muskrat as he climbed up on the big rock in the middle of the smiling pool with paddy the beaver beside him and watched the dear smiling pool dimpling and smiling in the moonlight as he had so often seen it before the great trouble had come  chugarum said grandfather frog in his great deep voice from the bulrushes one never knows how great their blessings are until they have been lost and found again  the bulrushes nodded as if they too were thinking of this you see their feet were once more in the cool water paddy the beaver seemed to understand just how every one felt and he smiled to himself as he saw how happy these new friends of his were  it surely is a very nice place here and i dont wonder that you couldnt bear to leave it said he im sorry that i made you all that trouble and worry but you see i didnt know  oh thats all right replied jerry muskrat who was now very proud of his big cousin i hope that now you see how nice it is you will stay and make your home here  paddy the beaver looked back at the great black shadow which he knew was the green forest way over in the middle of it he heard the huntingcall of hooty the owl then he looked out over the green meadows and from way over on the far side of them sounded the bark of reddy fox and it was answered by the deep voice of bowser the hound up in farmer browns dooryard for some reason that last sound made paddy the beaver shiver a little just as the voice of hooty the owl made the smaller people of the green forest and the green meadows shiver when they heard it paddy wasnt afraid of hooty or of reddy fox but bowsers great voice was new to him and somehow the very sound of it made him afraid you see the green meadows were so strange and open that he didnt feel at all at home for he dearly loves the deepest part of the green forest  no said paddy the beaver i cant possibly live here in the smiling pool it is a very nice pool but it wouldnt do at all for me cousin jerry i wouldnt feel safe here a minute besides there is nothing to eat here  oh yes there is jerry muskrat interrupted there are lilyroots and the nicest freshwater clams and  but there are no trees said paddy the beaver and you know i have to have trees  jerry stared at paddy as if he didnt understand dodo you eat trees he asked finally  paddy laughed just the bark said he and i have to have a great deal of it  jerry looked as disappointed as he felt of course you cant stay then said he andand i had thought that we would have such good times together  paddys eyes twinkled perhaps we may yet said he you see i have about made up my mind that i will stay a while along the laughing brook in the green forest and you can come to see me there on our way down i saw a very nice hole in the bank that i think will make me a good house for the present and you can come up there to see me but if i do stay you and grandfather frog and spotty the turtle must keep my secret no one must know that i am there will you  of course we will cried jerry muskrat and grandfather frog and spotty the turtle together  then ill stay said paddy the beaver diving into the smiling pool with a great splash  and so one of jerry muskrats greatest adventures ended in the finding of his biggest cousin paddy the beaver now jerry has a lot of cousins and one of them lives on the green meadows not far from the smiling pool his name is danny meadow mouse and danny is forever having adventures too he has them every day in the next book you will be told about some of these if you care to read about them
