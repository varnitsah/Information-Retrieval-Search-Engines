76918081	man and superman  a comedy and a philosophy  by bernard shaw     epistle dedicatory to arthur bingham walkley  my dear walkley  you once asked me why i did not write a don juan play the levity with which you assumed this frightful responsibility has probably by this time enabled you to forget it but the day of reckoning has arrived here is your play i say your play because qui facit per alium facit per se its profits like its labor belong to me its morals its manners its philosophy its influence on the young are for you to justify you were of mature age when you made the suggestion and you knew your man it is hardly fifteen years since as twin pioneers of the new journalism of that time we two cradled in the same new sheets made an epoch in the criticism of the theatre and the opera house by making it a pretext for a propaganda of our own views of life so you cannot plead ignorance of the character of the force you set in motion you meant me to epater le bourgeois and if he protests i hereby refer him to you as the accountable party  i warn you that if you attempt to repudiate your responsibility i shall suspect you of finding the play too decorous for your taste the fifteen years have made me older and graver in you i can detect no such becoming change your levities and audacities are like the loves and comforts prayed for by desdemona they increase even as your days do grow no mere pioneering journal dares meddle with them now the stately times itself is alone sufficiently above suspicion to act as your chaperone and even the times must sometimes thank its stars that new plays are not produced every day since after each such event its gravity is compromised its platitude turned to epigram its portentousness to wit its propriety to elegance and even its decorum into naughtiness by criticisms which the traditions of the paper do not allow you to sign at the end but which you take care to sign with the most extravagant flourishes between the lines i am not sure that this is not a portent of revolution in eighteenth century france the end was at hand when men bought the encyclopedia and found diderot there when i buy the times and find you there my prophetic ear catches a rattle of twentieth century tumbrils  however that is not my present anxiety the question is will you not be disappointed with a don juan play in which not one of that heros mille e tre adventures is brought upon the stage to propitiate you let me explain myself you will retort that i never do anything else it is your favorite jibe at me that what i call drama is nothing but explanation but you must not expect me to adopt your inexplicable fantastic petulant fastidious ways you must take me as i am a reasonable patient consistent apologetic laborious person with the temperament of a schoolmaster and the pursuits of a vestryman no doubt that literary knack of mine which happens to amuse the british public distracts attention from my character but the character is there none the less solid as bricks i have a conscience and conscience is always anxiously explanatory you on the contrary feel that a man who discusses his conscience is much like a woman who discusses her modesty the only moral force you condescend to parade is the force of your wit the only demand you make in public is the demand of your artistic temperament for symmetry elegance style grace refinement and the cleanliness which comes next to godliness if not before it but my conscience is the genuine pulpit article it annoys me to see people comfortable when they ought to be uncomfortable and i insist on making them think in order to bring them to conviction of sin if you dont like my preaching you must lump it i really cannot help it  in the preface to my plays for puritans i explained the predicament of our contemporary english drama forced to deal almost exclusively with cases of sexual attraction and yet forbidden to exhibit the incidents of that attraction or even to discuss its nature your suggestion that i should write a don juan play was virtually a challenge to me to treat this subject myself dramatically the challenge was difficult enough to be worth accepting because when you come to think of it though we have plenty of dramas with heroes and heroines who are in love and must accordingly marry or perish at the end of the play or about people whose relations with one another have been complicated by the marriage laws not to mention the looser sort of plays which trade on the tradition that illicit love affairs are at once vicious and delightful we have no modern english plays in which the natural attraction of the sexes for one another is made the mainspring of the action that is why we insist on beauty in our performers differing herein from the countries our friend william archer holds up as examples of seriousness to our childish theatres there the juliets and isoldes the romeos and tristans might be our mothers and fathers not so the english actress the heroine she impersonates is not allowed to discuss the elemental relations of men and women all her romantic twaddle about noveletmade love all her purely legal dilemmas as to whether she was married or betrayed quite miss our hearts and worry our minds to console ourselves we must just look at her we do so and her beauty feeds our starving emotions sometimes we grumble ungallantly at the lady because she does not act as well as she looks but in a drama which with all its preoccupation with sex is really void of sexual interest good looks are more desired than histrionic skill  let me press this point on you since you are too clever to raise the fools cry of paradox whenever i take hold of a stick by the right instead of the wrong end why are our occasional attempts to deal with the sex problem on the stage so repulsive and dreary that even those who are most determined that sex questions shall be held open and their discussion kept free cannot pretend to relish these joyless attempts at social sanitation is it not because at bottom they are utterly sexless what is the usual formula for such plays a woman has on some past occasion been brought into conflict with the law which regulates the relations of the sexes a man by falling in love with her or marrying her is brought into conflict with the social convention which discountenances the woman now the conflicts of individuals with law and convention can be dramatized like all other human conflicts but they are purely judicial and the fact that we are much more curious about the suppressed relations between the man and the woman than about the relations between both and our courts of law and private juries of matrons produces that sensation of evasion of dissatisfaction of fundamental irrelevance of shallowness of useless disagreeableness of total failure to edify and partial failure to interest which is as familiar to you in the theatres as it was to me when i too frequented those uncomfortable buildings and found our popular playwrights in the mind to as they thought emulate ibsen  i take it that when you asked me for a don juan play you did not want that sort of thing nobody does the successes such plays sometimes obtain are due to the incidental conventional melodrama with which the experienced popular author instinctively saves himself from failure but what did you want owing to your unfortunate habityou now i hope feel its inconvenienceof not explaining yourself i have had to discover this for myself first then i have had to ask myself what is a don juan vulgarly a libertine but your dislike of vulgarity is pushed to the length of a defect universality of character is impossible without a share of vulgarity and even if you could acquire the taste you would find yourself overfed from ordinary sources without troubling me so i took it that you demanded a don juan in the philosophic sense  philosophically don juan is a man who though gifted enough to be exceptionally capable of distinguishing between good and evil follows his own instincts without regard to the common statute or canon law and therefore whilst gaining the ardent sympathy of our rebellious instincts which are flattered by the brilliancies with which don juan associates them finds himself in mortal conflict with existing institutions and defends himself by fraud and farce as unscrupulously as a farmer defends his crops by the same means against vermin the prototypic don juan invented early in the xvi century by a spanish monk was presented according to the ideas of that time as the enemy of god the approach of whose vengeance is felt throughout the drama growing in menace from minute to minute no anxiety is caused on don juans account by any minor antagonist he easily eludes the police temporal and spiritual and when an indignant father seeks private redress with the sword don juan kills him without an effort not until the slain father returns from heaven as the agent of god in the form of his own statue does he prevail against his slayer and cast him into hell the moral is a monkish one repent and reform now for tomorrow it may be too late this is really the only point on which don juan is sceptical for he is a devout believer in an ultimate hell and risks damnation only because as he is young it seems so far off that repentance can be postponed until he has amused himself to his hearts content  but the lesson intended by an author is hardly ever the lesson the world chooses to learn from his book what attracts and impresses us in el burlador de sevilla is not the immediate urgency of repentance but the heroism of daring to be the enemy of god from prometheus to my own devils disciple such enemies have always been popular don juan became such a pet that the world could not bear his damnation it reconciled him sentimentally to god in a second version and clamored for his canonization for a whole century thus treating him as english journalism has treated that comic foe of the gods punch molieres don juan casts back to the original in point of impenitence but in piety he falls off greatly true he also proposes to repent but in what terms oui ma foi il faut samender encore vingt ou trente ans de cette vieci et puis nous songerons a nous after moliere comes the artistenchanter the master of masters mozart who reveals the heros spirit in magical harmonies elfin tones and elate darting rhythms as of summer lightning made audible here you have freedom in love and in morality mocking exquisitely at slavery to them and interesting you attracting you tempting you inexplicably forcing you to range the hero with his enemy the statue on a transcendant plane leaving the prudish daughter and her priggish lover on a crockery shelf below to live piously ever after  after these completed works byrons fragment does not count for much philosophically our vagabond libertines are no more interesting from that point of view than the sailor who has a wife in every port and byrons hero is after all only a vagabond libertine and he is dumb he does not discuss himself with a sganarelleleporello or with the fathers or brothers of his mistresses he does not even like casanova tell his own story in fact he is not a true don juan at all for he is no more an enemy of god than any romantic and adventurous young sower of wild oats had you and i been in his place at his age who knows whether we might not have done as he did unless indeed your fastidiousness had saved you from the empress catherine byron was as little of a philosopher as peter the great both were instances of that rare and useful but unedifying variation an energetic genius born without the prejudices or superstitions of his contemporaries the resultant unscrupulous freedom of thought made byron a greater poet than wordsworth just as it made peter a greater king than george iii but as it was after all only a negative qualification it did not prevent peter from being an appalling blackguard and an arrant poltroon nor did it enable byron to become a religious force like shelley let us then leave byrons don juan out of account mozarts is the last of the true don juans for by the time he was of age his cousin faust had in the hands of goethe taken his place and carried both his warfare and his reconciliation with the gods far beyond mere lovemaking into politics high art schemes for reclaiming new continents from the ocean and recognition of an eternal womanly principle in the universe goethes faust and mozarts don juan were the last words of the xviii century on the subject and by the time the polite critics of the xix century ignoring william blake as superficially as the xviii had ignored hogarth or the xvii bunyan had got past the dickensmacaulay dumasguizot stage and the stendhalmeredithturgenieff stage and were confronted with philosophic fiction by such pens as ibsens and tolstoys don juan had changed his sex and become dona juana breaking out of the dolls house and asserting herself as an individual instead of a mere item in a moral pageant  now it is all very well for you at the beginning of the xx century to ask me for a don juan play but you will see from the foregoing survey that don juan is a full century out of date for you and for me and if there are millions of less literate people who are still in the eighteenth century have they not moliere and mozart upon whose art no human hand can improve you would laugh at me if at this time of day i dealt in duels and ghosts and womanly women as to mere libertinism you would be the first to remind me that the festin de pierre of moliere is not a play for amorists and that one bar of the voluptuous sentimentality of gounod or bizet would appear as a licentious stain on the score of don giovanni even the more abstract parts of the don juan play are dilapidated past use for instance don juans supernatural antagonist hurled those who refuse to repent into lakes of burning brimstone there to be tormented by devils with horns and tails of that antagonist and of that conception of repentance how much is left that could be used in a play by me dedicated to you on the other hand those forces of middle class public opinion which hardly existed for a spanish nobleman in the days of the first don juan are now triumphant everywhere civilized society is one huge bourgeoisie no nobleman dares now shock his greengrocer the women marchesane principesse cameriere cittadine and all are become equally dangerous the sex is aggressive powerful when women are wronged they do not group themselves pathetically to sing protegga il giusto cielo they grasp formidable legal and social weapons and retaliate political parties are wrecked and public careers undone by a single indiscretion a man had better have all the statues in london to supper with him ugly as they are than be brought to the bar of the nonconformist conscience by donna elvira excommunication has become almost as serious a business as it was in the x century  as a result man is no longer like don juan victor in the duel of sex whether he has ever really been may be doubted at all events the enormous superiority of womans natural position in this matter is telling with greater and greater force as to pulling the nonconformist conscience by the beard as don juan plucked the beard of the commandants statue in the convent of san francisco that is out of the question nowadays prudence and good manners alike forbid it to a hero with any mind besides it is don juans own beard that is in danger of plucking far from relapsing into hypocrisy as sganarelle feared he has unexpectedly discovered a moral in his immorality the growing recognition of his new point of view is heaping responsibility on him his former jests he has had to take as seriously as i have had to take some of the jests of mr w s gilbert his scepticism once his least tolerated quality has now triumphed so completely that he can no longer assert himself by witty negations and must to save himself from cipherdom find an affirmative position his thousand and three affairs of gallantry after becoming at most two immature intrigues leading to sordid and prolonged complications and humiliations have been discarded altogether as unworthy of his philosophic dignity and compromising to his newly acknowledged position as the founder of a school instead of pretending to read ovid he does actually read schopenhaur and nietzsche studies westermarck and is concerned for the future of the race instead of for the freedom of his own instincts thus his profligacy and his daredevil airs have gone the way of his sword and mandoline into the rag shop of anachronisms and superstitions in fact he is now more hamlet than don juan for though the lines put into the actors mouth to indicate to the pit that hamlet is a philosopher are for the most part mere harmonious platitude which with a little debasement of the wordmusic would be properer to pecksniff yet if you separate the real hero inarticulate and unintelligible to himself except in flashes of inspiration from the performer who has to talk at any cost through five acts and if you also do what you must always do in shakespears tragedies that is dissect out the absurd sensational incidents and physical violences of the borrowed story from the genuine shakespearian tissue you will get a true promethean foe of the gods whose instinctive attitude towards women much resembles that to which don juan is now driven from this point of view hamlet was a developed don juan whom shakespear palmed off as a reputable man just as he palmed poor macbeth off as a murderer today the palming off is no longer necessary at least on your plane and mine because don juanism is no longer misunderstood as mere casanovism don juan himself is almost ascetic in his desire to avoid that misunderstanding and so my attempt to bring him up to date by launching him as a modern englishman into a modern english environment has produced a figure superficially quite unlike the hero of mozart  and yet i have not the heart to disappoint you wholly of another glimpse of the mozartian dissoluto punito and his antagonist the statue i feel sure you would like to know more of that statueto draw him out when he is off duty so to speak to gratify you i have resorted to the trick of the strolling theatrical manager who advertizes the pantomime of sinbad the sailor with a stock of secondhand picture posters designed for ali baba he simply thrusts a few oil jars into the valley of diamonds and so fulfils the promise held out by the hoardings to the public eye i have adapted this simple device to our occasion by thrusting into my perfectly modern threeact play a totally extraneous act in which my hero enchanted by the air of the sierra has a dream in which his mozartian ancestor appears and philosophizes at great length in a shaviosocratic dialogue with the lady the statue and the devil  but this pleasantry is not the essence of the play over this essence i have no control you propound a certain social substance sexual attraction to wit for dramatic distillation and i distil it for you i do not adulterate the product with aphrodisiacs nor dilute it with romance and water for i am merely executing your commission not producing a popular play for the market you must therefore unless like most wise men you read the play first and the preface afterwards prepare yourself to face a trumpery story of modern london life a life in which as you know the ordinary mans main business is to get means to keep up the position and habits of a gentleman and the ordinary womans business is to get married in 9999 cases out of 10000 you can count on their doing nothing whether noble or base that conflicts with these ends and that assurance is what you rely on as their religion their morality their principles their patriotism their reputation their honor and so forth  on the whole this is a sensible and satisfactory foundation for society money means nourishment and marriage means children and that men should put nourishment first and women children first is broadly speaking the law of nature and not the dictate of personal ambition the secret of the prosaic mans success such as it is is the simplicity with which he pursues these ends the secret of the artistic mans failure such as that is is the versatility with which he strays in all directions after secondary ideals the artist is either a poet or a scallawag as poet he cannot see as the prosaic man does that chivalry is at bottom only romantic suicide as scallawag he cannot see that it does not pay to spunge and beg and lie and brag and neglect his person therefore do not misunderstand my plain statement of the fundamental constitution of london society as an irishmans reproach to your nation from the day i first set foot on this foreign soil i knew the value of the prosaic qualities of which irishmen teach englishmen to be ashamed as well as i knew the vanity of the poetic qualities of which englishmen teach irishmen to be proud for the irishman instinctively disparages the quality which makes the englishman dangerous to him and the englishman instinctively flatters the fault that makes the irishman harmless and amusing to him what is wrong with the prosaic englishman is what is wrong with the prosaic men of all countries stupidity the vitality which places nourishment and children first heaven and hell a somewhat remote second and the health of society as an organic whole nowhere may muddle successfully through the comparatively tribal stages of gregariousness but in nineteenth century nations and twentieth century empires the determination of every man to be rich at all costs and of every woman to be married at all costs must without a highly scientific social organization produce a ruinous development of poverty celibacy prostitution infant mortality adult degeneracy and everything that wise men most dread in short there is no future for men however brimming with crude vitality who are neither intelligent nor politically educated enough to be socialists so do not misunderstand me in the other direction either if i appreciate the vital qualities of the englishman as i appreciate the vital qualities of the bee i do not guarantee the englishman against being like the bee or the canaanite smoked out and unloaded of his honey by beings inferior to himself in simple acquisitiveness combativeness and fecundity but superior to him in imagination and cunning  the don juan play however is to deal with sexual attraction and not with nutrition and to deal with it in a society in which the serious business of sex is left by men to women as the serious business of nutrition is left by women to men that the men to protect themselves against a too aggressive prosecution of the womens business have set up a feeble romantic convention that the initiative in sex business must always come from the man is true but the pretence is so shallow that even in the theatre that last sanctuary of unreality it imposes only on the inexperienced in shakespears plays the woman always takes the initiative in his problem plays and his popular plays alike the love interest is the interest of seeing the woman hunt the man down she may do it by blandishment like rosalind or by stratagem like mariana but in every case the relation between the woman and the man is the same she is the pursuer and contriver he the pursued and disposed of when she is baffled like ophelia she goes mad and commits suicide and the man goes straight from her funeral to a fencing match no doubt nature with very young creatures may save the woman the trouble of scheming prospero knows that he has only to throw ferdinand and miranda together and they will mate like a pair of doves and there is no need for perdita to capture florizel as the lady doctor in alls well that ends well an early ibsenite heroine captures bertram but the mature cases all illustrate the shakespearian law the one apparent exception petruchio is not a real one he is most carefully characterized as a purely commercial matrimonial adventurer once he is assured that katharine has money he undertakes to marry her before he has seen her in real life we find not only petruchios but mantalinis and dobbins who pursue women with appeals to their pity or jealousy or vanity or cling to them in a romantically infatuated way such effeminates do not count in the world scheme even bunsby dropping like a fascinated bird into the jaws of mrs macstinger is by comparison a true tragic object of pity and terror i find in my own plays that woman projecting herself dramatically by my hands a process over which i assure you i have no more real control than i have over my wife behaves just as woman did in the plays of shakespear  and so your don juan has come to birth as a stage projection of the tragicomic love chase of the man by the woman and my don juan is the quarry instead of the huntsman yet he is a true don juan with a sense of reality that disables convention defying to the last the fate which finally overtakes him the womans need of him to enable her to carry on natures most urgent work does not prevail against him until his resistance gathers her energy to a climax at which she dares to throw away her customary exploitations of the conventional affectionate and dutiful poses and claim him by natural right for a purpose that far transcends their mortal personal purposes  among the friends to whom i have read this play in manuscript are some of our own sex who are shocked at the unscrupulousness meaning the total disregard of masculine fastidiousness with which the woman pursues her purpose it does not occur to them that if women were as fastidious as men morally or physically there would be an end of the race is there anything meaner then to throw necessary work upon other people and then disparage it as unworthy and indelicate we laugh at the haughty american nation because it makes the negro clean its boots and then proves the moral and physical inferiority of the negro by the fact that he is a shoeblack but we ourselves throw the whole drudgery of creation on one sex and then imply that no female of any womanliness or delicacy would initiate any effort in that direction there are no limits to male hypocrisy in this matter no doubt there are moments when mans sexual immunities are made acutely humiliating to him when the terrible moment of birth arrives its supreme importance and its superhuman effort and peril in which the father has no part dwarf him into the meanest insignificance he slinks out of the way of the humblest petticoat happy if he be poor enough to be pushed out of the house to outface his ignominy by drunken rejoicings but when the crisis is over he takes his revenge swaggering as the breadwinner and speaking of womans sphere with condescension even with chivalry as if the kitchen and the nursery were less important than the office in the city when his swagger is exhausted he drivels into erotic poetry or sentimental uxoriousness and the tennysonian king arthur posing as guinevere becomes don quixote grovelling before dulcinea you must admit that here nature beats comedy out of the field the wildest hominist or feminist farce is insipid after the most commonplace slice of life the pretence that women do not take the initiative is part of the farce why the whole world is strewn with snares traps gins and pitfalls for the capture of men by women give women the vote and in five years there will be a crushing tax on bachelors men on the other hand attach penalties to marriage depriving women of property of the franchise of the free use of their limbs of that ancient symbol of immortality the right to make oneself at home in the house of god by taking off the hat of everything that he can force woman to dispense with without compelling himself to dispense with her all in vain woman must marry because the race must perish without her travail if the risk of death and the certainty of pain danger and unutterable discomforts cannot deter her slavery and swaddled ankles will not and yet we assume that the force that carries women through all these perils and hardships stops abashed before the primnesses of our behavior for young ladies it is assumed that the woman must wait motionless until she is wooed nay she often does wait motionless that is how the spider waits for the fly but the spider spins her web and if the fly like my hero shows a strength that promises to extricate him how swiftly does she abandon her pretence of passiveness and openly fling coil after coil about him until he is secured for ever  if the really impressive books and other artworks of the world were produced by ordinary men they would express more fear of womens pursuit than love of their illusory beauty but ordinary men cannot produce really impressive artworks those who can are men of genius that is men selected by nature to carry on the work of building up an intellectual consciousness of her own instinctive purpose accordingly we observe in the man of genius all the unscrupulousness and all the selfsacrifice the two things are the same of woman he will risk the stake and the cross starve when necessary in a garret all his life study women and live on their work and care as darwin studied worms and lived upon sheep work his nerves into rags without payment a sublime altruist in his disregard of himself an atrocious egotist in his disregard of others here woman meets a purpose as impersonal as irresistible as her own and the clash is sometimes tragic when it is complicated by the genius being a woman then the game is one for a king of critics your george sand becomes a mother to gain experience for the novelist and to develop her and gobbles up men of genius chopins mussets and the like as mere hors doeuvres  i state the extreme case of course but what is true of the great man who incarnates the philosophic consciousness of life and the woman who incarnates its fecundity is true in some degree of all geniuses and all women hence it is that the worlds books get written its pictures painted its statues modelled its symphonies composed by people who are free of the otherwise universal dominion of the tyranny of sex which leads us to the conclusion astonishing to the vulgar that art instead of being before all things the expression of the normal sexual situation is really the only department in which sex is a superseded and secondary power with its consciousness so confused and its purpose so perverted that its ideas are mere fantasy to common men whether the artist becomes poet or philosopher moralist or founder of a religion his sexual doctrine is nothing but a barren special pleading for pleasure excitement and knowledge when he is young and for contemplative tranquillity when he is old and satiated romance and asceticism amorism and puritanism are equally unreal in the great philistine world the world shown us in books whether the books be confessed epics or professed gospels or in codes or in political orations or in philosophic systems is not the main world at all it is only the selfconsciousness of certain abnormal people who have the specific artistic talent and temperament a serious matter this for you and me because the man whose consciousness does not correspond to that of the majority is a madman and the old habit of worshipping madmen is giving way to the new habit of locking them up and since what we call education and culture is for the most part nothing but the substitution of reading for experience of literature for life of the obsolete fictitious for the contemporary real education as you no doubt observed at oxford destroys by supplantation every mind that is not strong enough to see through the imposture and to use the great masters of arts as what they really are and no more that is patentees of highly questionable methods of thinking and manufacturers of highly questionable and for the majority but half valid representations of life the schoolboy who uses his homer to throw at his fellows head makes perhaps the safest and most rational use of him and i observe with reassurance that you occasionally do the same in your prime with your aristotle  fortunately for us whose minds have been so overwhelmingly sophisticated by literature what produces all these treatises and poems and scriptures of one sort or another is the struggle of life to become divinely conscious of itself instead of blindly stumbling hither and thither in the line of least resistance hence there is a driving towards truth in all books on matters where the writer though exceptionally gifted is normally constituted and has no private axe to grind copernicus had no motive for misleading his fellowmen as to the place of the sun in the solar system he looked for it as honestly as a shepherd seeks his path in a mist but copernicus would not have written love stories scientifically when it comes to sex relations the man of genius does not share the common mans danger of capture nor the woman of genius the common womans overwhelming specialization and that is why our scriptures and other art works when they deal with love turn from honest attempts at science in physics to romantic nonsense erotic ecstasy or the stern asceticism of satiety the road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom said william blake for you never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough  there is a political aspect of this sex question which is too big for my comedy and too momentous to be passed over without culpable frivolity it is impossible to demonstrate that the initiative in sex transactions remains with woman and has been confirmed to her so far more and more by the suppression of rapine and discouragement of importunity without being driven to very serious reflections on the fact that this initiative is politically the most important of all the initiatives because our political experiment of democracy the last refuge of cheap misgovernment will ruin us if our citizens are ill bred  when we two were born this country was still dominated by a selected class bred by political marriages the commercial class had not then completed the first twentyfive years of its new share of political power and it was itself selected by money qualification and bred if not by political marriage at least by a pretty rigorous class marriage aristocracy and plutocracy still furnish the figureheads of politics but they are now dependent on the votes of the promiscuously bred masses and this if you please at the very moment when the political problem having suddenly ceased to mean a very limited and occasional interference mostly by way of jobbing public appointments in the mismanagement of a tight but parochial little island with occasional meaningless prosecution of dynastic wars has become the industrial reorganization of britain the construction of a practically international commonwealth and the partition of the whole of africa and perhaps the whole of asia by the civilized powers can you believe that the people whose conceptions of society and conduct whose power of attention and scope of interest are measured by the british theatre as you know it today can either handle this colossal task themselves or understand and support the sort of mind and character that is at least comparatively capable of handling it for remember what our voters are in the pit and gallery they are also in the polling booth we are all now under what burke called the hoofs of the swinish multitude burkes language gave great offence because the implied exceptions to its universal application made it a class insult and it certainly was not for the pot to call the kettle black the aristocracy he defended in spite of the political marriages by which it tried to secure breeding for itself had its mind undertrained by silly schoolmasters and governesses its character corrupted by gratuitous luxury its selfrespect adulterated to complete spuriousness by flattery and flunkeyism it is no better today and never will be any better our very peasants have something morally hardier in them that culminates occasionally in a bunyan a burns or a carlyle but observe this aristocracy which was overpowered from 1832 to 1885 by the middle class has come back to power by the votes of the swinish multitude tom paine has triumphed over edmund burke and the swine are now courted electors how many of their own class have these electors sent to parliament hardly a dozen out of 670 and these only under the persuasion of conspicuous personal qualifications and popular eloquence the multitude thus pronounces judgment on its own units it admits itself unfit to govern and will vote only for a man morphologically and generically transfigured by palatial residence and equipage by transcendent tailoring by the glamor of aristocratic kinship well we two know these transfigured persons these college passmen these well groomed monocular algys and bobbies these cricketers to whom age brings golf instead of wisdom these plutocratic products of the nail and sarspan business as he got his money by do you know whether to laugh or cry at the notion that they poor devils will drive a team of continents as they drive a fourinhand turn a jostling anarchy of casual trade and speculation into an ordered productivity and federate our colonies into a worldpower of the first magnitude give these people the most perfect political constitution and the soundest political program that benevolent omniscience can devise for them and they will interpret it into mere fashionable folly or canting charity as infallibly as a savage converts the philosophical theology of a scotch missionary into crude african idolatry  i do not know whether you have any illusions left on the subject of education progress and so forth i have none any pamphleteer can show the way to better things but when there is no will there is no way my nurse was fond of remarking that you cannot make a silk purse out of a sows ear and the more i see of the efforts of our churches and universities and literary sages to raise the mass above its own level the more convinced i am that my nurse was right progress can do nothing but make the most of us all as we are and that most would clearly not be enough even if those who are already raised out of the lowest abysses would allow the others a chance the bubble of heredity has been pricked the certainty that acquirements are negligible as elements in practical heredity has demolished the hopes of the educationists as well as the terrors of the degeneracy mongers and we know now that there is no hereditary governing class any more than a hereditary hooliganism we must either breed political capacity or be ruined by democracy which was forced on us by the failure of the older alternatives yet if despotism failed only for want of a capable benevolent despot what chance has democracy which requires a whole population of capable voters that is of political critics who if they cannot govern in person for lack of spare energy or specific talent for administration can at least recognize and appreciate capacity and benevolence in others and so govern through capably benevolent representatives where are such voters to be found today nowhere promiscuous breeding has produced a weakness of character that is too timid to face the full stringency of a thoroughly competitive struggle for existence and too lazy and petty to organize the commonwealth cooperatively being cowards we defeat natural selection under cover of philanthropy being sluggards we neglect artificial selection under cover of delicacy and morality  yet we must get an electorate of capable critics or collapse as rome and egypt collapsed at this moment the roman decadent phase of panem et circenses is being inaugurated under our eyes our newspapers and melodramas are blustering about our imperial destiny but our eyes and hearts turn eagerly to the american millionaire as his hand goes down to his pocket our fingers go up to the brims of our hats by instinct our ideal prosperity is not the prosperity of the industrial north but the prosperity of the isle of wight of folkestone and ramsgate of nice and monte carlo that is the only prosperity you see on the stage where the workers are all footmen parlourmaids comic lodgingletters and fashionable professional men whilst the heroes and heroines are miraculously provided with unlimited dividends and eat gratuitously like the knights in don quixotes books of chivalry  the city papers prate of the competition of bombay with manchester and the like the real competition is the competition of regent street with the rue de rivoli of brighton and the south coast with the riviera for the spending money of the american trusts what is all this growing love of pageantry this effusive loyalty this officious rising and uncovering at a wave from a flag or a blast from a brass band imperialism not a bit of it obsequiousness servility cupidity roused by the prevailing smell of money when mr carnegie rattled his millions in his pockets all england became one rapacious cringe only when rhodes who had probably been reading my socialism for millionaires left word that no idler was to inherit his estate the bent backs straightened mistrustfully for a moment could it be that the diamond king was no gentleman after all however it was easy to ignore a rich mans solecism the ungentlemanly clause was not mentioned again and the backs soon bowed themselves back into their natural shape  but i hear you asking me in alarm whether i have actually put all this tub thumping into a don juan comedy i have not i have only made my don juan a political pamphleteer and given you his pamphlet in full by way of appendix you will find it at the end of the book i am sorry to say that it is a common practice with romancers to announce their hero as a man of extraordinary genius and to leave his works entirely to the readers imagination so that at the end of the book you whisper to yourself ruefully that but for the authors solemn preliminary assurance you should hardly have given the gentleman credit for ordinary good sense you cannot accuse me of this pitiable barrenness this feeble evasion i not only tell you that my hero wrote a revolutionists handbook i give you the handbook at full length for your edification if you care to read it and in that handbook you will find the politics of the sex question as i conceive don juans descendant to understand them not that i disclaim the fullest responsibility for his opinions and for those of all my characters pleasant and unpleasant they are all right from their several points of view and their points of view are for the dramatic moment mine also this may puzzle the people who believe that there is such a thing as an absolutely right point of view usually their own it may seem to them that nobody who doubts this can be in a state of grace however that may be it is certainly true that nobody who agrees with them can possibly be a dramatist or indeed anything else that turns upon a knowledge of mankind hence it has been pointed out that shakespear had no conscience neither have i in that sense  you may however remind me that this digression of mine into politics was preceded by a very convincing demonstration that the artist never catches the point of view of the common man on the question of sex because he is not in the same predicament i first prove that anything i write on the relation of the sexes is sure to be misleading and then i proceed to write a don juan play well if you insist on asking me why i behave in this absurd way i can only reply that you asked me to and that in any case my treatment of the subject may be valid for the artist amusing to the amateur and at least intelligible and therefore possibly suggestive to the philistine every man who records his illusions is providing data for the genuinely scientific psychology which the world still waits for i plank down my view of the existing relations of men to women in the most highly civilized society for what it is worth it is a view like any other view and no more neither true nor false but i hope a way of looking at the subject which throws into the familiar order of cause and effect a sufficient body of fact and experience to be interesting to you if not to the playgoing public of london i have certainly shown little consideration for that public in this enterprise but i know that it has the friendliest disposition towards you and me as far as it has any consciousness of our existence and quite understands that what i write for you must pass at a considerable height over its simple romantic head it will take my books as read and my genius for granted trusting me to put forth work of such quality as shall bear out its verdict so we may disport ourselves on our own plane to the top of our bent and if any gentleman points out that neither this epistle dedicatory nor the dream of don juan in the third act of the ensuing comedy is suitable for immediate production at a popular theatre we need not contradict him napoleon provided talma with a pit of kings with what effect on talmas acting is not recorded as for me what i have always wanted is a pit of philosophers and this is a play for such a pit  i should make formal acknowledgment to the authors whom i have pillaged in the following pages if i could recollect them all the theft of the brigandpoetaster from sir arthur conan doyle is deliberate and the metamorphosis of leporello into enry straker motor engineer and new man is an intentional dramatic sketch for the contemporary embryo of mr h g wellss anticipation of the efficient engineering class which will he hopes finally sweep the jabberers out of the way of civilization mr barrio has also whilst i am correcting my proofs delighted london with a servant who knows more than his masters the conception of mendoza limited i trace back to a certain west indian colonial secretary who at a period when he and i and mr sidney webb were sowing our political wild oats as a sort of fabian three musketeers without any prevision of the surprising respectability of the crop that followed recommended webb the encyclopedic and inexhaustible to form himself into a company for the benefit of the shareholders octavius i take over unaltered from mozart and i hereby authorize any actor who impersonates him to sing dalla sua pace if he can at any convenient moment during the representation ann was suggested to me by the fifteenth century dutch morality called everyman which mr william poel has lately resuscitated so triumphantly i trust he will work that vein further and recognize that elizabethan renascence fustian is no more bearable after medieval poesy than scribe after ibsen as i sat watching everyman at the charterhouse i said to myself why not everywoman ann was the result every woman is not ann but ann is everywoman  that the author of everyman was no mere artist but an artistphilosopher and that the artistphilosophers are the only sort of artists i take quite seriously will be no news to you even plato and boswell as the dramatists who invented socrates and dr johnson impress me more deeply than the romantic playwrights ever since as a boy i first breathed the air of the transcendental regions at a performance of mozarts zauberflote i have been proof against the garish splendors and alcoholic excitements of the ordinary stage combinations of tappertitian romance with the police intelligence bunyan blake hogarth and turner these four apart and above all the english classics goethe shelley schopenhaur wagner ibsen morris tolstoy and nietzsche are among the writers whose peculiar sense of the world i recognize as more or less akin to my own mark the word peculiar i read dickens and shakespear without shame or stint but their pregnant observations and demonstrations of life are not coordinated into any philosophy or religion on the contrary dickenss sentimental assumptions are violently contradicted by his observations and shakespears pessimism is only his wounded humanity both have the specific genius of the fictionist and the common sympathies of human feeling and thought in preeminent degree they are often saner and shrewder than the philosophers just as sanchopanza was often saner and shrewder than don quixote they clear away vast masses of oppressive gravity by their sense of the ridiculous which is at bottom a combination of sound moral judgment with lighthearted good humor but they are concerned with the diversities of the world instead of with its unities they are so irreligious that they exploit popular religion for professional purposes without delicacy or scruple for example sydney carton and the ghost in hamlet they are anarchical and cannot balance their exposures of angelo and dogberry sir leicester dedlock and mr tite barnacle with any portrait of a prophet or a worthy leader they have no constructive ideas they regard those who have them as dangerous fanatics in all their fictions there is no leading thought or inspiration for which any man could conceivably risk the spoiling of his hat in a shower much less his life both are alike forced to borrow motives for the more strenuous actions of their personages from the common stockpot of melodramatic plots so that hamlet has to be stimulated by the prejudices of a policeman and macbeth by the cupidities of a bushranger dickens without the excuse of having to manufacture motives for hamlets and macbeths superfluously punt his crew down the stream of his monthly parts by mechanical devices which i leave you to describe my own memory being quite baffled by the simplest question as to monks in oliver twist or the long lost parentage of smike or the relations between the dorrit and clennam families so inopportunely discovered by monsieur rigaud blandois the truth is the world was to shakespear a great stage of fools on which he was utterly bewildered he could see no sort of sense in living at all and dickens saved himself from the despair of the dream in the chimes by taking the world for granted and busying himself with its details neither of them could do anything with a serious positive character they could place a human figure before you with perfect verisimilitude but when the moment came for making it live and move they found unless it made them laugh that they had a puppet on their hands and had to invent some artificial external stimulus to make it work this is what is the matter with hamlet all through he has no will except in his bursts of temper foolish bardolaters make a virtue of this after their fashion they declare that the play is the tragedy of irresolution but all shakespears projections of the deepest humanity he knew have the same defect their characters and manners are lifelike but their actions are forced on them from without and the external force is grotesquely inappropriate except when it is quite conventional as in the case of henry v falstaff is more vivid than any of these serious reflective characters because he is selfacting his motives are his own appetites and instincts and humors richard iii too is delightful as the whimsical comedian who stops a funeral to make love to the corpses widow but when in the next act he is replaced by a stage villain who smothers babies and offs with peoples heads we are revolted at the imposture and repudiate the changeling faulconbridge coriolanus leontes are admirable descriptions of instinctive temperaments indeed the play of coriolanus is the greatest of shakespears comedies but description is not philosophy and comedy neither compromises the author nor reveals him he must be judged by those characters into which he puts what he knows of himself his hamlets and macbeths and lears and prosperos if these characters are agonizing in a void about factitious melodramatic murders and revenges and the like whilst the comic characters walk with their feet on solid ground vivid and amusing you know that the author has much to show and nothing to teach the comparison between falstaff and prospero is like the comparison between micawber and david copperfield at the end of the book you know micawber whereas you only know what has happened to david and are not interested enough in him to wonder what his politics or religion might be if anything so stupendous as a religious or political idea or a general idea of any sort were to occur to him he is tolerable as a child but he never becomes a man and might be left out of his own biography altogether but for his usefulness as a stage confidant a horatio or charles his friend what they call on the stage a feeder  now you cannot say this of the works of the artistphilosophers you cannot say it for instance of the pilgrims progress put your shakespearian hero and coward henry v and pistol or parolles beside mr valiant and mr fearing and you have a sudden revelation of the abyss that lies between the fashionable author who could see nothing in the world but personal aims and the tragedy of their disappointment or the comedy of their incongruity and the field preacher who achieved virtue and courage by identifying himself with the purpose of the world as he understood it the contrast is enormous bunyans coward stirs your blood more than shakespears hero who actually leaves you cold and secretly hostile you suddenly see that shakespear with all his flashes and divinations never understood virtue and courage never conceived how any man who was not a fool could like bunyans hero look back from the brink of the river of death over the strife and labor of his pilgrimage and say yet do i not repent me or with the panache of a millionaire bequeath my sword to him that shall succeed me in my pilgrimage and my courage and skill to him that can get it this is the true joy in life the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one the being thoroughly worn out before you are thrown on the scrap heap the being a force of nature instead of a feverish selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy and also the only real tragedy in life is the being used by personally minded men for purposes which you recognize to be base all the rest is at worst mere misfortune or mortality this alone is misery slavery hell on earth and the revolt against it is the only force that offers a mans work to the poor artist whom our personally minded rich people would so willingly employ as pandar buffoon beauty monger sentimentalizer and the like  it may seem a long step from bunyan to nietzsche but the difference between their conclusions is purely formal bunyans perception that righteousness is filthy rags his scorn for mr legality in the village of morality his defiance of the church as the supplanter of religion his insistence on courage as the virtue of virtues his estimate of the career of the conventionally respectable and sensible worldly wiseman as no better at bottom than the life and death of mr badman all this expressed by bunyan in the terms of a tinkers theology is what nietzsche has expressed in terms of postdarwinian postschopenhaurian philosophy wagner in terms of polytheistic mythology and ibsen in terms of midxix century parisian dramaturgy nothing is new in these matters except their novelties for instance it is a novelty to call justification by faith wille and justification by works vorstellung the sole use of the novelty is that you and i buy and read schopenhaurs treatise on will and representation when we should not dream of buying a set of sermons on faith versus works at bottom the controversy is the same and the dramatic results are the same bunyan makes no attempt to present his pilgrims as more sensible or better conducted than mr worldly wiseman mr w ws worst enemies as mr embezzler mr nevergotochurchonsunday mr bad form mr murderer mr burglar mr corespondent mr blackmailer mr cad mr drunkard mr labor agitator and so forth can read the pilgrims progress without finding a word said against them whereas the respectable people who snub them and put them in prison such as mr ww himself and his young friend civility formalist and hypocrisy wildhead inconsiderate and pragmatick who were clearly young university men of good family and high feeding that brisk lad ignorance talkative byends of fairspeech and his motherinlaw lady feigning and other reputable gentlemen and citizens catch it very severely even little faith though he gets to heaven at last is given to understand that it served him right to be mobbed by the brothers faint heart mistrust and guilt all three recognized members of respectable society and veritable pillars of the law the whole allegory is a consistent attack on morality and respectability without a word that one can remember against vice and crime exactly what is complained of in nietzsche and ibsen is it not and also exactly what would be complained of in all the literature which is great enough and old enough to have attained canonical rank officially or unofficially were it not that books are admitted to the canon by a compact which confesses their greatness in consideration of abrogating their meaning so that the reverend rector can agree with the prophet micah as to his inspired style without being committed to any complicity in micahs furiously radical opinions why even i as i force myself pen in hand into recognition and civility find all the force of my onslaught destroyed by a simple policy of nonresistance in vain do i redouble the violence of the language in which i proclaim my heterodoxies i rail at the theistic credulity of voltaire the amoristic superstition of shelley the revival of tribal soothsaying and idolatrous rites which huxley called science and mistook for an advance on the pentateuch no less than at the welter of ecclesiastical and professional humbug which saves the face of the stupid system of violence and robbery which we call law and industry even atheists reproach me with infidelity and anarchists with nihilism because i cannot endure their moral tirades and yet instead of exclaiming send this inconceivable satanist to the stake the respectable newspapers pith me by announcing another book by this brilliant and thoughtful writer and the ordinary citizen knowing that an author who is well spoken of by a respectable newspaper must be all right reads me as he reads micah with undisturbed edification from his own point of view it is narrated that in the eighteenseventies an old lady a very devout methodist moved from colchester to a house in the neighborhood of the city road in london where mistaking the hall of science for a chapel she sat at the feet of charles bradlaugh for many years entranced by his eloquence without questioning his orthodoxy or moulting a feather of her faith i fear i small be defrauded of my just martyrdom in the same way  however i am digressing as a man with a grievance always does and after all the main thing in determining the artistic quality of a book is not the opinions it propagates but the fact that the writer has opinions the old lady from colchester was right to sun her simple soul in the energetic radiance of bradlaughs genuine beliefs and disbeliefs rather than in the chill of such mere painting of light and heat as elocution and convention can achieve my contempt for belles lettres and for amateurs who become the heroes of the fanciers of literary virtuosity is not founded on any illusion of mind as to the permanence of those forms of thought call them opinions by which i strive to communicate my bent to my fellows to younger men they are already outmoded for though they have no more lost their logic than an eighteenth century pastel has lost its drawing or its color yet like the pastel they grow indefinably shabby and will grow shabbier until they cease to count at all when my books will either perish or if the world is still poor enough to want them will have to stand with bunyans by quite amorphous qualities of temper and energy with this conviction i cannot be a bellettrist no doubt i must recognize as even the ancient mariner did that i must tell my story entertainingly if i am to hold the wedding guest spellbound in spite of the siren sounds of the loud bassoon but for arts sake alone i would not face the toil of writing a single sentence i know that there are men who having nothing to say and nothing to write are nevertheless so in love with oratory and with literature that they keep desperately repeating as much as they can understand of what others have said or written aforetime i know that the leisurely tricks which their want of conviction leaves them free to play with the diluted and misapprehended message supply them with a pleasant parlor game which they call style i can pity their dotage and even sympathize with their fancy but a true original style is never achieved for its own sake a man may pay from a shilling to a guinea according to his means to see hear or read another mans act of genius but he will not pay with his whole life and soul to become a mere virtuoso in literature exhibiting an accomplishment which will not even make money for him like fiddle playing effectiveness of assertion is the alpha and omega of style he who has nothing to assert has no style and can have none he who has something to assert will go as far in power of style as its momentousness and his conviction will carry him disprove his assertion after it is made yet its style remains darwin has no more destroyed the style of job nor of handel than martin luther destroyed the style of giotto all the assertions get disproved sooner or later and so we find the world full of a magnificent debris of artistic fossils with the matteroffact credibility gone clean out of them but the form still splendid and that is why the old masters play the deuce with our mere susceptibles your royal academician thinks he can get the style of giotto without giottos beliefs and correct his perspective into the bargain your man of letters thinks he can get bunyans or shakespears style without bunyans conviction or shakespears apprehension especially if he takes care not to split his infinitives and so with your doctors of music who with their collections of discords duly prepared and resolved or retarded or anticipated in the manner of the great composers think they can learn the art of palestrina from cherubims treatise all this academic art is far worse than the trade in sham antique furniture for the man who sells me an oaken chest which he swears was made in the xiii century though as a matter of fact he made it himself only yesterday at least does not pretend that there are any modern ideas in it whereas your academic copier of fossils offers them to you as the latest outpouring of the human spirit and worst of all kidnaps young people as pupils and persuades them that his limitations are rules his observances dexterities his timidities good taste and his emptinesses purities and when he declares that art should not be didactic all the people who have nothing to teach and all the people who dont want to learn agree with him emphatically  i pride myself on not being one of these susceptible if you study the electric light with which i supply you in that bumbledonian public capacity of mine over which you make merry from time to time you will find that your house contains a great quantity of highly susceptible copper wire which gorges itself with electricity and gives you no light whatever but here and there occurs a scrap of intensely insusceptible intensely resistant material and that stubborn scrap grapples with the current and will not let it through until it has made itself useful to you as those two vital qualities of literature light and heat now if i am to be no mere copper wire amateur but a luminous author i must also be a most intensely refractory person liable to go out and to go wrong at inconvenient moments and with incendiary possibilities these are the faults of my qualities and i assure you that i sometimes dislike myself so much that when some irritable reviewer chances at that moment to pitch into me with zest i feel unspeakably relieved and obliged but i never dream of reforming knowing that i must take myself as i am and get what work i can out of myself all this you will understand for there is community of material between us we are both critics of life as well as of art and you have perhaps said to yourself when i have passed your windows there but for the grace of god go i an awful and chastening reflection which shall be the closing cadence of this immoderately long letter from yours faithfully  g bernard shaw  woking 1903     act i  roebuck ramsden is in his study opening the morning letters the study handsomely and solidly furnished proclaims the man of means not a speck of dust is visible it is clear that there are at least two housemaids and a parlormaid downstairs and a housekeeper upstairs who does not let them spare elbowgrease even the top of roebucks head is polished on a sunshiny day he could heliograph his orders to distant camps by merely nodding in no other respect however does he suggest the military man it is in active civil life that men get his broad air of importance his dignified expectation of deference his determinate mouth disarmed and refined since the hour of his success by the withdrawal of opposition and the concession of comfort and precedence and power he is more than a highly respectable man he is marked out as a president of highly respectable men a chairman among directors an alderman among councillors a mayor among aldermen four tufts of irongrey hair which will soon be as white as isinglass and are in other respects not at all unlike it grow in two symmetrical pairs above his ears and at the angles of his spreading jaws he wears a black frock coat a white waistcoat it is bright spring weather and trousers neither black nor perceptibly blue of one of those indefinitely mixed hues which the modern clothier has produced to harmonize with the religions of respectable men he has not been out of doors yet today so he still wears his slippers his boots being ready for him on the hearthrug surmising that he has no valet and seeing that he has no secretary with a shorthand notebook and a typewriter one meditates on how little our great burgess domesticity has been disturbed by new fashions and methods or by the enterprise of the railway and hotel companies which sell you a saturday to monday of life at folkestone as a real gentleman for two guineas first class fares both ways included  how old is roebuck the question is important on the threshold of a drama of ideas for under such circumstances everything depends on whether his adolescence belonged to the sixties or to the eighties he was born as a matter of fact in 1839 and was a unitarian and free trader from his boyhood and an evolutionist from the publication of the origin of species consequently he has always classed himself as an advanced thinker and fearlessly outspoken reformer  sitting at his writing table he has on his right the windows giving on portland place through these as through a proscenium the curious spectator may contemplate his profile as well as the blinds will permit on his left is the inner wall with a stately bookcase and the door not quite in the middle but somewhat further from him against the wall opposite him are two busts on pillars one to his left of john bright the other to his right of mr herbert spencer between them hang an engraved portrait of richard cobden enlarged photographs of martineau huxley and george eliot autotypes of allegories by mr gf watts for roebuck believed in the fine arts with all the earnestness of a man who does not understand them and an impression of duponts engraving of delaroches beaux artes hemicycle representing the great men of all ages on the wall behind him above the mantelshelf is a family portrait of impenetrable obscurity  a chair stands near the writing table for the convenience of business visitors two other chairs are against the wall between the busts  a parlormaid enters with a visitors card roebuck takes it and nods pleased evidently a welcome caller  ramsden show him up  the parlormaid goes out and returns with the visitor  the maid mr robinson  mr robinson is really an uncommonly nice looking young fellow he must one thinks be the jeune premier for it is not in reason to suppose that a second such attractive male figure should appear in one story the slim shapely frame the elegant suit of new mourning the small head and regular features the pretty little moustache the frank clear eyes the wholesome bloom and the youthful complexion the well brushed glossy hair not curly but of fine texture and good dark color the arch of good nature in the eyebrows the erect forehead and neatly pointed chin all announce the man who will love and suffer later on and that he will not do so without sympathy is guaranteed by an engaging sincerity and eager modest serviceableness which stamp him as a man of amiable nature the moment he appears ramsdens face expands into fatherly liking and welcome an expression which drops into one of decorous grief as the young man approaches him with sorrow in his face as well as in his black clothes ramsden seems to know the nature of the bereavement as the visitor advances silently to the writing table the old man rises and shakes his hand across it without a word a long affectionate shake which tells the story of a recent sorrow common to both  ramsden concluding the handshake and cheering up well well octavius its the common lot we must all face it someday sit down  octavius takes the visitors chair ramsden replaces himself in his own  octavius yes we must face it mr ramsden but i owed him a great deal he did everything for me that my father could have done if he had lived  ramsden he had no son of his own you see  octavius but he had daughters and yet he was as good to my sister as to me and his death was so sudden i always intended to thank himto let him know that i had not taken all his care of me as a matter of course as any boy takes his fathers care but i waited for an opportunity and now he is deaddropped without a moments warning he will never know what i felt he takes out his handkerchief and cries unaffectedly  ramsden how do we know that octavius he may know it we cannot tell come dont grieve octavius masters himself and puts up his handkerchief thats right now let me tell you something to console you the last time i saw himit was in this very roomhe said to me tavy is a generous lad and the soul of honor and when i see how little consideration other men get from their sons i realize how much better than a son hes been to me there doesnt that do you good  octavius mr ramsden he used to say to me that he had met only one man in the world who was the soul of honor and that was roebuck ramsden  ramsden oh that was his partiality we were very old friends you know but there was something else he used to say about you i wonder whether i ought to tell you or not  octavius you know best  ramsden it was something about his daughter  octavius eagerly about ann oh do tell me that mr ramsden  ramsden well he said he was glad after all you were not his son because he thought that someday annie and youoctavius blushes vividly well perhaps i shouldnt have told you but he was in earnest  octavius oh if only i thought i had a chance you know mr ramsden i dont care about money or about what people call position and i cant bring myself to take an interest in the business of struggling for them well ann has a most exquisite nature but she is so accustomed to be in the thick of that sort of thing that she thinks a mans character incomplete if he is not ambitious she knows that if she married me she would have to reason herself out of being ashamed of me for not being a big success of some kind  ramsden getting up and planting himself with his back to the fireplace nonsense my boy nonsense youre too modest what does she know about the real value of men at her age more seriously besides shes a wonderfully dutiful girl her fathers wish would be sacred to her do you know that since she grew up to years of discretion i dont believe she has ever once given her own wish as a reason for doing anything or not doing it its always father wishes me to or mother wouldnt like it its really almost a fault in her i have often told her she must learn to think for herself  octavius shaking his head i couldnt ask her to marry me because her father wished it mr ramsden  ramsden well perhaps not no of course not i see that no you certainly couldnt but when you win her on your own merits it will be a great happiness to her to fulfil her fathers desire as well as her own eh come youll ask her wont you  octavius with sad gaiety at all events i promise you i shall never ask anyone else  ramsden oh you shant need to shell accept you my boyalthough here he suddenly becomes very serious indeed you have one great drawback  octavius anxiously what drawback is that mr ramsden i should rather say which of my many drawbacks  ramsden ill tell you octavius he takes from the table a book bound in red cloth i have in my hand a copy of the most infamous the most scandalous the most mischievous the most blackguardly book that ever escaped burning at the hands of the common hangman i have not read it i would not soil my mind with such filth but i have read what the papers say of it the title is quite enough for me he reads it the revolutionists handbook and pocket companion by john tanner mirc member of the idle rich class  octavius smiling but jack  ramsden testily for goodness sake dont call him jack under my roof he throws the book violently down on the table then somewhat relieved he comes past the table to octavius and addresses him at close quarters with impressive gravity now octavius i know that my dead friend was right when he said you were a generous lad i know that this man was your schoolfellow and that you feel bound to stand by him because there was a boyish friendship between you but i ask you to consider the altered circumstances you were treated as a son in my friends house you lived there and your friends could not be turned from the door this tanner was in and out there on your account almost from his childhood he addresses annie by her christian name as freely as you do well while her father was alive that was her fathers business not mine this man tanner was only a boy to him his opinions were something to be laughed at like a mans hat on a childs head but now tanner is a grown man and annie a grown woman and her father is gone we dont as yet know the exact terms of his will but he often talked it over with me and i have no more doubt than i have that youre sitting there that the will appoints me annies trustee and guardian forcibly now i tell you once for all i cant and i wont have annie placed in such a position that she must out of regard for you suffer the intimacy of this fellow tanner its not fair its not right its not kind what are you going to do about it  octavius but ann herself has told jack that whatever his opinions are he will always be welcome because he knew her dear father  ramsden out of patience that girls mad about her duty to her parents he starts off like a goaded ox in the direction of john bright in whose expression there is no sympathy for him as he speaks he fumes down to herbert spencer who receives him still more coldly excuse me octavius but there are limits to social toleration you know that i am not a bigoted or prejudiced man you know that i am plain roebuck ramsden when other men who have done less have got handles to their names because i have stood for equality and liberty of conscience while they were truckling to the church and to the aristocracy whitefield and i lost chance after chance through our advanced opinions but i draw the line at anarchism and free love and that sort of thing if i am to be annies guardian she will have to learn that she has a duty to me i wont have it i will not have it she must forbid john tanner the house and so must you  the parlormaid returns  octavius but  ramsden calling his attention to the servant ssh well  the maid mr tanner wishes to see you sir  ramsden mr tanner  octavius jack  ramsden how dare mr tanner call on me say i cannot see him  octavius hurt i am sorry you are turning my friend from your door like that  the maid calmly hes not at the door sir hes upstairs in the drawingroom with miss ramsden he came with mrs whitefield and miss ann and miss robinson sir  ramsdens feelings are beyond words  octavius grinning thats very like jack mr ramsden you must see him even if its only to turn him out  ramsden hammering out his words with suppressed fury go upstairs and ask mr tanner to be good enough to step down here the parlormaid goes out and ramsden returns to the fireplace as to a fortified position i must say that of all the confounded pieces of impertinencewell if these are anarchist manners i hope you like them and annie with him annie a he chokes  octavius yes thats what surprises me hes so desperately afraid of ann there must be something the matter  mr john tanner suddenly opens the door and enters he is too young to be described simply as a big man with a beard but it is already plain that middle life will find him in that category he has still some of the slimness of youth but youthfulness is not the effect he aims at his frock coat would befit a prime minister and a certain high chested carriage of the shoulders a lofty pose of the head and the olympian majesty with which a mane or rather a huge wisp of hazel colored hair is thrown back from an imposing brow suggest jupiter rather than apollo he is prodigiously fluent of speech restless excitable mark the snorting nostril and the restless blue eye just the thirtysecondth of an inch too wide open possibly a little mad he is carefully dressed not from the vanity that cannot resist finery but from a sense of the importance of everything he does which leads him to make as much of paying a call as other men do of getting married or laying a foundation stone a sensitive susceptible exaggerative earnest man a megalomaniac who would be lost without a sense of humor  just at present the sense of humor is in abeyance to say that he is excited is nothing all his moods are phases of excitement he is now in the panicstricken phase and he walks straight up to ramsden as if with the fixed intention of shooting him on his own hearthrug but what he pulls from his breast pocket is not a pistol but a foolscap document which he thrusts under the indignant nose of ramsden as he exclaims  tanner ramsden do you know what that is  ramsden loftily no sir  tanner its a copy of whitefields will ann got it this morning  ramsden when you say ann you mean i presume miss whitefield  tanner i mean our ann your ann tavys ann and now heaven help me my ann  octavius rising very pale what do you mean  tanner mean he holds up the will do you know who is appointed anns guardian by this will  ramsden coolly i believe i am  tanner you you and i man i i i both of us he flings the will down on the writing table  ramsden you impossible  tanner its only too hideously true he throws himself into octaviuss chair ramsden get me out of it somehow you dont know ann as well as i do shell commit every crime a respectable woman can and shell justify every one of them by saying that it was the wish of her guardians shell put everything on us and we shall have no more control over her than a couple of mice over a cat  octavius jack i wish you wouldnt talk like that about ann  tanner this chaps in love with her thats another complication well shell either jilt him and say i didnt approve of him or marry him and say you ordered her to i tell you this is the most staggering blow that has ever fallen on a man of my age and temperament  ramsden let me see that will sir he goes to the writing table and picks it up i cannot believe that my old friend whitefield would have shown such a want of confidence in me as to associate me with his countenance falls as he reads  tanner its all my own doing thats the horrible irony of it he told me one day that you were to be anns guardian and like a fool i began arguing with him about the folly of leaving a young woman under the control of an old man with obsolete ideas  ramsden stupended my ideas obsolete  tanner totally i had just finished an essay called down with government by the greyhaired and i was full of arguments and illustrations i said the proper thing was to combine the experience of an old hand with the vitality of a young one hang me if he didnt take me at my word and alter his willits dated only a fortnight after that conversationappointing me as joint guardian with you  ramsden pale and determined i shall refuse to act  tanner whats the good of that ive been refusing all the way from richmond but ann keeps on saying that of course shes only an orphan and that she cant expect the people who were glad to come to the house in her fathers time to trouble much about her now thats the latest game an orphan its like hearing an ironclad talk about being at the mercy of the winds and waves  octavius this is not fair jack she is an orphan and you ought to stand by her  tanner stand by her what danger is she in she has the law on her side she has popular sentiment on her side she has plenty of money and no conscience all she wants with me is to load up all her moral responsibilities on me and do as she likes at the expense of my character i cant control her and she can compromise me as much as she likes i might as well be her husband  ramsden you can refuse to accept the guardianship i shall certainly refuse to hold it jointly with you  tanner yes and what will she say to that what does she say to it just that her fathers wishes are sacred to her and that she shall always look up to me as her guardian whether i care to face the responsibility or not refuse you might as well refuse to accept the embraces of a boa constrictor when once it gets round your neck  octavius this sort of talk is not kind to me jack  tanner rising and going to octavius to console him but still lamenting if he wanted a young guardian why didnt he appoint tavy  ramsden ah why indeed  octavius i will tell you he sounded me about it but i refused the trust because i loved her i had no right to let myself be forced on her as a guardian by her father he spoke to her about it and she said i was right you know i love her mr ramsden and jack knows it too if jack loved a woman i would not compare her to a boa constrictor in his presence however much i might dislike her he sits down between the busts and turns his face to the wall  ramsden i do not believe that whitefield was in his right senses when he made that will you have admitted that he made it under your influence  tanner you ought to be pretty well obliged to me for my influence he leaves you two thousand five hundred for your trouble he leaves tavy a dowry for his sister and five thousand for himself  octavius his tears flowing afresh oh i cant take it he was too good to us  tanner you wont get it my boy if ramsden upsets the will  ramsden ha i see you have got me in a cleft stick  tanner he leaves me nothing but the charge of anns morals on the ground that i have already more money than is good for me that shows that he had his wits about him doesnt it  ramsden grimly i admit that  octavius rising and coming from his refuge by the wall mr ramsden i think you are prejudiced against jack he is a man of honor and incapable of abusing  tanner dont tavy youll make me ill i am not a man of honor i am a man struck down by a dead hand tavy you must marry her after all and take her off my hands and i had set my heart on saving you from her  octavius oh jack you talk of saving me from my highest happiness  tanner yes a lifetime of happiness if it were only the first half hours happiness tavy i would buy it for you with my last penny but a lifetime of happiness no man alive could bear it it would be hell on earth  ramsden violently stuff sir talk sense or else go and waste someone elses time i have something better to do than listen to your fooleries he positively kicks his way to his table and resumes his seat  tanner you hear him tavy not an idea in his head later than eighteensixty we cant leave ann with no other guardian to turn to  ramsden i am proud of your contempt for my character and opinions sir your own are set forth in that book i believe  tanner eagerly going to the table what youve got my book what do you think of it  ramsden do you suppose i would read such a book sir  tanner then why did you buy it  ramsden i did not buy it sir it has been sent me by some foolish lady who seems to admire your views i was about to dispose of it when octavius interrupted me i shall do so now with your permission he throws the book into the waste paper basket with such vehemence that tanner recoils under the impression that it is being thrown at his head  tanner you have no more manners than i have myself however that saves ceremony between us he sits down again what do you intend to do about this will  octavius may i make a suggestion  ramsden certainly octavius  octavius arent we forgetting that ann herself may have some wishes in this matter  ramsden i quite intend that annies wishes shall be consulted in every reasonable way but she is only a woman and a young and inexperienced woman at that  tanner ramsden i begin to pity you  ramsden hotly i dont want to know how you feel towards me mr tanner  tanner ann will do just exactly what she likes and whats more shell force us to advise her to do it and shell put the blame on us if it turns out badly so as tavy is longing to see her  octavius shyly i am not jack  tanner you lie tavy you are so lets have her down from the drawingroom and ask her what she intends us to do off with you tavy and fetch her tavy turns to go and dont be long for the strained relations between myself and ramsden will make the interval rather painful ramsden compresses his lips but says nothing  octavius never mind him mr ramsden hes not serious he goes out  ramsden very deliberately mr tanner you are the most impudent person i have ever met  tanner seriously i know it ramsden yet even i cannot wholly conquer shame we live in an atmosphere of shame we are ashamed of everything that is real about us ashamed of ourselves of our relatives of our incomes of our accents of our opinions of our experience just as we are ashamed of our naked skins good lord my dear ramsden we are ashamed to walk ashamed to ride in an omnibus ashamed to hire a hansom instead of keeping a carriage ashamed of keeping one horse instead of two and a groomgardener instead of a coachman and footman the more things a man is ashamed of the more respectable he is why youre ashamed to buy my book ashamed to read it the only thing youre not ashamed of is to judge me for it without having read it and even that only means that youre ashamed to have heterodox opinions look at the effect i produce because my fairy godmother withheld from me this gift of shame i have every possible virtue that a man can have except  ramsden i am glad you think so well of yourself  tanner all you mean by that is that you think i ought to be ashamed of talking about my virtues you dont mean that i havent got them you know perfectly well that i am as sober and honest a citizen as yourself as truthful personally and much more truthful politically and morally  ramsden touched on his most sensitive point i deny that i will not allow you or any man to treat me as if i were a mere member of the british public i detest its prejudices i scorn its narrowness i demand the right to think for myself you pose as an advanced man let me tell you that i was an advanced man before you were born  tanner i knew it was a long time ago  ramsden i am as advanced as ever i was i defy you to prove that i have ever hauled down the flag i am more advanced than ever i was i grow more advanced every day  tanner more advanced in years polonius  ramsden polonius so you are hamlet i suppose  tanner no i am only the most impudent person youve ever met thats your notion of a thoroughly bad character when you want to give me a piece of your mind you ask yourself as a just and upright man what is the worst you can fairly say of me thief liar forger adulterer perjurer glutton drunkard not one of these names fit me you have to fall back on my deficiency in shame well i admit it i even congratulate myself for if i were ashamed of my real self i should cut as stupid a figure as any of the rest of you cultivate a little impudence ramsden and you will become quite a remarkable man  ramsden i have no  tanner you have no desire for that sort of notoriety bless you i knew that answer would come as well as i know that a box of matches will come out of an automatic machine when i put a penny in the slot you would be ashamed to say anything else  the crushing retort for which ramsden has been visibly collecting his forces is lost for ever for at this point octavius returns with miss ann whitefield and her mother and ramsden springs up and hurries to the door to receive them whether ann is goodlooking or not depends upon your taste also and perhaps chiefly on your age and sex to octavius she is an enchantingly beautiful woman in whose presence the world becomes transfigured and the puny limits of individual consciousness are suddenly made infinite by a mystic memory of the whole life of the race to its beginnings in the east or even back to the paradise from which it fell she is to him the reality of romance the leaner good sense of nonsense the unveiling of his eyes the freeing of his soul the abolition of time place and circumstance the etherealization of his blood into rapturous rivers of the very water of life itself the revelation of all the mysteries and the sanctification of all the dogmas to her mother she is to put it as moderately as possible nothing whatever of the kind not that octaviuss admiration is in any way ridiculous or discreditable ann is a well formed creature as far as that goes and she is perfectly ladylike graceful and comely with ensnaring eyes and hair besides instead of making herself an eyesore like her mother she has devised a mourning costume of black and violet silk which does honor to her late father and reveals the family tradition of brave unconventionality by which ramsden sets such store  but all this is beside the point as an explanation of anns charm turn up her nose give a cast to her eye replace her black and violet confection by the apron and feathers of a flower girl strike all the aitches out of her speech and ann would still make men dream vitality is as common as humanity but like humanity it sometimes rises to genius and ann is one of the vital geniuses not at all if you please an oversexed person that is a vital defect not a true excess she is a perfectly respectable perfectly selfcontrolled woman and looks it though her pose is fashionably frank and impulsive she inspires confidence as a person who will do nothing she does not mean to do also some fear perhaps as a woman who will probably do everything she means to do without taking more account of other people than may be necessary and what she calls right in short what the weaker of her own sex sometimes call a cat  nothing can be more decorous than her entry and her reception by ramsden whom she kisses the late mr whitefield would be gratified almost to impatience by the long faces of the men except tanner who is fidgety the silent handgrasps the sympathetic placing of chairs the sniffing of the widow and the liquid eye of the daughter whose heart apparently will not let her control her tongue to speech ramsden and octavius take the two chairs from the wall and place them for the two ladies but ann comes to tanner and takes his chair which he offers with a brusque gesture subsequently relieving his irritation by sitting down on the corner of the writing table with studied indecorum octavius gives mrs whitefield a chair next ann and himself takes the vacant one which ramsden has placed under the nose of the effigy of mr herbert spencer  mrs whitefield by the way is a little woman whose faded flaxen hair looks like straw on an egg she has an expression of muddled shrewdness a squeak of protest in her voice and an odd air of continually elbowing away some larger person who is crushing her into a corner one guesses her as one of those women who are conscious of being treated as silly and negligible and who without having strength enough to assert themselves effectually at any rate never submit to their fate there is a touch of chivalry in octaviuss scrupulous attention to her even whilst his whole soul is absorbed by ann  ramsden goes solemnly back to his magisterial seat at the writing table ignoring tanner and opens the proceedings  ramsden i am sorry annie to force business on you at a sad time like the present but your poor dear fathers will has raised a very serious question you have read it i believe  ann assents with a nod and a catch of her breath too much affected to speak  i must say i am surprised to find mr tanner named as joint guardian and trustee with myself of you and rhoda a pause they all look portentous but they have nothing to say ramsden a little ruffled by the lack of any response continues i dont know that i can consent to act under such conditions mr tanner has i understand some objection also but i do not profess to understand its nature he will no doubt speak for himself but we are agreed that we can decide nothing until we know your views i am afraid i shall have to ask you to choose between my sole guardianship and that of mr tanner for i fear it is impossible for us to undertake a joint arrangement  ann in a low musical voice mamma  mrs whitefield hastily now ann i do beg you not to put it on me i have no opinion on the subject and if i had it would probably not be attended to i am quite with whatever you three think best  tanner turns his head and looks fixedly at ramsden who angrily refuses to receive this mute communication  ann resuming in the same gentle voice ignoring her mothers bad taste mamma knows that she is not strong enough to bear the whole responsibility for me and rhoda without some help and advice rhoda must have a guardian and though i am older i do not think any young unmarried woman should be left quite to her own guidance i hope you agree with me granny  tanner starting granny do you intend to call your guardians granny  ann dont be foolish jack mr ramsden has always been grandpapa roebuck to me i am grannys annie and he is annies granny i christened him so when i first learned to speak  ramsden sarcastically i hope you are satisfied mr tanner go on annie i quite agree with you  ann well if i am to have a guardian can i set aside anybody whom my dear father appointed for me  ramsden biting his lip you approve of your fathers choice then  ann it is not for me to approve or disapprove i accept it my father loved me and knew best what was good for me  ramsden of course i understand your feeling annie it is what i should have expected of you and it does you credit but it does not settle the question so completely as you think let me put a case to you suppose you were to discover that i had been guilty of some disgraceful actionthat i was not the man your poor dear father took me for would you still consider it right that i should be rhodas guardian  ann i cant imagine you doing anything disgraceful granny  tanner to ramsden you havent done anything of the sort have you  ramsden indignantly no sir  mrs whitefield placidly well then why suppose it  ann you see granny mamma would not like me to suppose it  ramsden much perplexed you are both so full of natural and affectionate feeling in these family matters that it is very hard to put the situation fairly before you  tanner besides my friend you are not putting the situation fairly before them  ramsden sulkily put it yourself then  tanner i will ann ramsden thinks i am not fit be your guardian and i quite agree with him he considers that if your father had read my book he wouldnt have appointed me that book is the disgraceful action he has been talking about he thinks its your duty for rhodas sake to ask him to act alone and to make me withdraw say the word and i will  ann but i havent read your book jack  tanner diving at the wastepaper basket and fishing the book out for her then read it at once and decide  ramsden if i am to be your guardian i positively forbid you to read that book annie he smites the table with his fist and rises  ann of course if you dont wish it she puts the book on the table  tanner if one guardian is to forbid you to read the other guardians book how are we to settle it suppose i order you to read it what about your duty to me  ann gently i am sure you would never purposely force me into a painful dilemma jack  ramsden irritably yes yes annie this is all very well and as i said quite natural and becoming but you must make a choice one way or the other we are as much in a dilemma as you  ann i feel that i am too young too inexperienced to decide my fathers wishes are sacred to me  mrs whitefield if you two men wont carry them out i must say it is rather hard that you should put the responsibility on ann it seems to me that people are always putting things on other people in this world  ramsden i am sorry you take it that way  ann touchingly do you refuse to accept me as your ward granny  ramsden no i never said that i greatly object to act with mr tanner thats all  mrs whitefield why whats the matter with poor jack  tanner my views are too advanced for him  ramsden indignantly they are not i deny it  ann of course not what nonsense nobody is more advanced than granny i am sure it is jack himself who has made all the difficulty come jack be kind to me in my sorrow you dont refuse to accept me as your ward do you  tanner gloomily no i let myself in for it so i suppose i must face it he turns away to the bookcase and stands there moodily studying the titles of the volumes  ann rising and expanding with subdued but gushing delight then we are all agreed and my dear fathers will is to be carried out you dont know what a joy that is to me and to my mother she goes to ramsden and presses both his hands saying and i shall have my dear granny to help and advise me she casts a glance at tanner over her shoulder and jack the giant killer she goes past her mother to octavius and jacks inseparable friend rickytickytavy he blushes and looks inexpressibly foolish  mrs whitefield rising and shaking her widows weeds straight now that you are anns guardian mr ramsden i wish you would speak to her about her habit of giving people nicknames they cant be expected to like it she moves towards the door  ann how can you say such a thing mamma glowing with affectionate remorse oh i wonder can you be right have i been inconsiderate she turns to octavius who is sitting astride his chair with his elbows on the back of it putting her hand on his forehead the turns his face up suddenly do you want to be treated like a grown up man must i call you mr robinson in future  octavius earnestly oh please call me rickytickytavy mr robinson would hurt me cruelly she laughs and pats his cheek with her finger then comes back to ramsden you know im beginning to think that granny is rather a piece of impertinence but i never dreamt of its hurting you  ramsden breezily as he pats her affectionately on the back my dear annie nonsense i insist on granny i wont answer to any other name than annies granny  ann gratefully you all spoil me except jack  tanner over his shoulder from the bookcase i think you ought to call me mr tanner  ann gently no you dont jack thats like the things you say on purpose to shock people those who know you pay no attention to them but if you like ill call you after your famous ancestor don juan  ramsden don juan  ann innocently oh is there any harm in it i didnt know then i certainly wont call you that may i call you jack until i can think of something else  tanker oh for heavens sake dont try to invent anything worse i capitulate i consent to jack i embrace jack here endeth my first and last attempt to assert my authority  ann you see mamma they all really like to have pet names  mrs whitefield well i think you might at least drop them until we are out of mourning  ann reproachfully stricken to the soul oh how could you remind me mother she hastily leaves the room to conceal her emotion  mrs whitefield of course my fault as usual she follows ann  tanner coming from the bockcase ramsden were beatensmashednonentitized like her mother  ramsden stuff sir he follows mrs whitefield out of the room  tanner left alone with octavius stares whimsically at him tavy do you want to count for something in the world  octavius i want to count for something as a poet i want to write a great play  tanner with ann as the heroine  octavius yes i confess it  tanner take care tavy the play with ann as the heroine is all right but if youre not very careful by heaven shell marry you  octavius sighing no such luck jack  tanner why man your head is in the lionesss mouth you are half swallowed alreadyin three bitesbite one ricky bite two ticky bite three tavy and down you go  octavius she is the same to everybody jack you know her ways  tanner yes she breaks everybodys back with the stroke of her paw but the question is which of us will she eat my own opinion is that she means to eat you  octavius rising pettishly its horrible to talk like that about her when she is upstairs crying for her father but i do so want her to eat me that i can bear your brutalities because they give me hope  tanner tavy thats the devilish side of a womans fascination she makes you will your own destruction  octavius but its not destruction its fulfilment  tanner yes of her purpose and that purpose is neither her happiness nor yours but natures vitality in a woman is a blind fury of creation she sacrifices herself to it do you think she will hesitate to sacrifice you  octavius why it is just because she is selfsacrificing that she will not sacrifice those she loves  tanner that is the profoundest of mistakes tavy it is the selfsacrificing women that sacrifice others most recklessly because they are unselfish they are kind in little things because they have a purpose which is not their own purpose but that of the whole universe a man is nothing to them but an instrument of that purpose  octavius dont be ungenerous jack they take the tenderest care of us  tanner yes as a soldier takes care of his rifle or a musician of his violin but do they allow us any purpose or freedom of our own will they lend us to one another can the strongest man escape from them when once he is appropriated they tremble when we are in danger and weep when we die but the tears are not for us but for a father wasted a sons breeding thrown away they accuse us of treating them as a mere means to our pleasure but how can so feeble and transient a folly as a mans selfish pleasure enslave a woman as the whole purpose of nature embodied in a woman can enslave a man  octavius what matter if the slavery makes us happy  tanner no matter at all if you have no purpose of your own and are like most men a mere breadwinner but you tavy are an artist that is you have a purpose as absorbing and as unscrupulous as a womans purpose  octavius not unscrupulous  tanner quite unscrupulous the true artist will let his wife starve his children go barefoot his mother drudge for his living at seventy sooner than work at anything but his art to women he is half vivisector half vampire he gets into intimate relations with them to study them to strip the mask of convention from them to surprise their inmost secrets knowing that they have the power to rouse his deepest creative energies to rescue him from his cold reason to make him see visions and dream dreams to inspire him as he calls it he persuades women that they may do this for their own purpose whilst he really means them to do it for his he steals the mothers milk and blackens it to make printers ink to scoff at her and glorify ideal women with he pretends to spare her the pangs of childbearing so that he may have for himself the tenderness and fostering that belong of right to her children since marriage began the great artist has been known as a bad husband but he is worse he is a childrobber a bloodsucker a hypocrite and a cheat perish the race and wither a thousand women if only the sacrifice of them enable him to act hamlet better to paint a finer picture to write a deeper poem a greater play a profounder philosophy for mark you tavy the artists work is to show us ourselves as we really are our minds are nothing but this knowledge of ourselves and he who adds a jot to such knowledge creates new mind as surely as any woman creates new men in the rage of that creation he is as ruthless as the woman as dangerous to her as she to him and as horribly fascinating of all human struggles there is none so treacherous and remorseless as the struggle between the artist man and the mother woman which shall use up the other that is the issue between them and it is all the deadlier because in your romanticist cant they love one another  octavius even if it were soand i dont admit it for a momentit is out of the deadliest struggles that we get the noblest characters  tanner remember that the next time you meet a grizzly bear or a bengal tiger tavy  octavius i meant where there is love jack  tanner oh the tiger will love you there is no love sincerer than the love of food i think ann loves you that way she patted your cheek as if it were a nicely underdone chop  octavius you know jack i should have to run away from you if i did not make it a fixed rule not to mind anything you say you come out with perfectly revolting things sometimes  ramsden returns followed by ann they come in quickly with their former leisurely air of decorous grief changed to one of genuine concern and on ramsdens part of worry he comes between the two men intending to address octavius but pulls himself up abruptly as he sees tanner  ramsden i hardly expected to find you still here mr tanner  tanner am i in the way good morning fellow guardian he goes towards the door  ann stop jack granny he must know sooner or later  ramsden octavius i have a very serious piece of news for you it is of the most private and delicate natureof the most painful nature too i am sorry to say do you wish mr tanner to be present whilst i explain  octavius turning pale i have no secrets from jack  ramsden before you decide that finally let me say that the news concerns your sister and that it is terrible news  octavius violet what has happened is shedead  ramsden i am not sure that it is not even worse than that  octavius is she badly hurt has there been an accident  ramsden no nothing of that sort  tanner ann will you have the common humanity to tell us what the matter is  ann half whispering i cant violet has done something dreadful we shall have to get her away somewhere she flutters to the writing table and sits in ramsdens chair leaving the three men to fight it out between them  octavius enlightened is that what you meant mr ramsden  ramsden yes octavius sinks upon a chair crushed i am afraid there is no doubt that violet did not really go to eastbourne three weeks ago when we thought she was with the parry whitefields and she called on a strange doctor yesterday with a wedding ring on her finger mrs parry whitefield met her there by chance and so the whole thing came out  octavius rising with his fists clenched who is the scoundrel  ann she wont tell us  octavius collapsing upon his chair again what a frightful thing  tanner with angry sarcasm dreadful appalling worse than death as ramsden says he comes to octavius what would you not give tavy to turn it into a railway accident with all her bones broken or something equally respectable and deserving of sympathy  octavius dont be brutal jack  tanner brutal good heavens man what are you crying for here is a woman whom we all supposed to be making bad water color sketches practising grieg and brahms gadding about to concerts and parties wasting her life and her money we suddenly learn that she has turned from these sillinesses to the fulfilment of her highest purpose and greatest functionto increase multiply and replenish the earth and instead of admiring her courage and rejoicing in her instinct instead of crowning the completed womanhood and raising the triumphal strain of unto us a child is born unto us a son is given here you areyou who have been as merry as brigs in your mourning for the deadall pulling long faces and looking as ashamed and disgraced as if the girl had committed the vilest of crimes  ramsden roaring with rage i will not have these abominations uttered in my house he smites the writing table with his fist  tanner look here if you insult me again ill take you at your word and leave your house ann where is violet now  ann why are you going to her  tanner of course i am going to her she wants help she wants money she wants respect and congratulation she wants every chance for her child she does not seem likely to get it from you she shall from me where is she  ann dont be so headstrong jack shes upstairs  tanner what under ramsdens sacred roof go and do your miserable duty ramsden hunt her out into the street cleanse your threshold from her contamination vindicate the purity of your english home ill go for a cab  ann alarmed oh granny you mustnt do that  octavius brokenheartedly rising ill take her away mr ramsden she had no right to come to your house  ramsden indignantly but i am only too anxious to help her turning on tanner how dare you sir impute such monstrous intentions to me i protest against it i am ready to put down my last penny to save her from being driven to run to you for protection  tanner subsiding its all right then hes not going to act up to his principles its agreed that we all stand by violet  octavius but who is the man he can make reparation by marrying her and he shall or he shall answer for it to me  ramsden he shall octavius there you speak like a man  tanner then you dont think him a scoundrel after all  octavius not a scoundrel he is a heartless scoundrel  ramsden a damned scoundrel i beg your pardon annie but i can say no less  tanner so we are to marry your sister to a damned scoundrel by way of reforming her character on my soul i think you are all mad  ann dont be absurd jack of course you are quite right tavy but we dont know who he is violet wont tell us  tanner what on earth does it matter who he is hes done his part and violet must do the rest  ramsden beside himself stuff lunacy there is a rascal in our midst a libertine a villain worse than a murderer and we are not to learn who he is in our ignorance we are to shake him by the hand to introduce him into our homes to trust our daughters with him toto  ann coaxingly there granny dont talk so loud its most shocking we must all admit that but if violet wont tell us what can we do nothing simply nothing  ramsden hmph im not so sure of that if any man has paid violet any special attention we can easily find that out if there is any man of notoriously loose principles among us  tanner ahem  ramsden raising his voice yes sir i repeat if there is any man of notoriously loose principles among us  tanner or any man notoriously lacking in selfcontrol  ramsden aghast do you dare to suggest that i am capable of such an act  tanner my dear ramsden this is an act of which every man is capable that is what comes of getting at cross purposes with nature the suspicion you have just flung at me clings to us all its a sort of mud that sticks to the judges ermine or the cardinals robe as fast as to the rags of the tramp come tavy dont look so bewildered it might have been me it might have been ramsden just as it might have been anybody if it had what could we do but lie and protest as ramsden is going to protest  ramsden choking iii  tanner guilt itself could not stammer more confusedly and yet you know perfectly well hes innocent tavy  ramsden exhausted i am glad you admit that sir i admit myself that there is an element of truth in what you say grossly as you may distort it to gratify your malicious humor i hope octavius no suspicion of me is possible in your mind  octavius of you no not for a moment  tanner drily i think he suspects me just a little  octavius jack you couldntyou wouldnt  tanner why not  octavius appalled why not  tanner oh well ill tell you why not first you would feel bound to quarrel with me second violet doesnt like me third if i had the honor of being the father of violets child i should boast of it instead of denying it so be easy our friendship is not in danger  octavius i should have put away the suspicion with horror if only you would think and feel naturally about it i beg your pardon  tanner my pardon nonsense and now lets sit down and have a family council he sits down the rest follow his example more or less under protest violet is going to do the state a service consequently she must be packed abroad like a criminal until its over whats happening upstairs  ann violet is in the housekeepers roomby herself of course  tanner why not in the drawingroom  ann dont be absurd jack miss ramsden is in the drawingroom with my mother considering what to do  tanner oh the housekeepers room is the penitentiary i suppose and the prisoner is waiting to be brought before her judges the old cats  ann oh jack  ramsden you are at present a guest beneath the roof of one of the old cats sir my sister is the mistress of this house  tanner she would put me in the housekeepers room too if she dared ramsden however i withdraw cats cats would have more sense ann as your guardian i order you to go to violet at once and be particularly kind to her  ann i have seen her jack and i am sorry to say i am afraid she is going to be rather obstinate about going abroad i think tavy ought to speak to her about it  octavius how can i speak to her about such a thing he breaks down  ann dont break down ricky try to bear it for all our sakes  ramsden life is not all plays and poems octavius come face it like a man  tanner chafing again poor dear brother poor dear friends of the family poor dear tabbies and grimalkins poor dear everybody except the woman who is going to risk her life to create another life tavy dont you be a selfish ass away with you and talk to violet and bring her down here if she cares to come octavius rises tell her well stand by her  ramsden rising no sir  tanner rising also and interrupting him oh we understand its against your conscience but still youll do it  octavius i assure you all on my word i never meant to be selfish its so hard to know what to do when one wishes earnestly to do right  tanner my dear tavy your pious english habit of regarding the world as a moral gymnasium built expressly to strengthen your character in occasionally leads you to think about your own confounded principles when you should be thinking about other peoples necessities the need of the present hour is a happy mother and a healthy baby bend your energies on that and you will see your way clearly enough  octavius much perplexed goes out  ramsden facing tanner impressively and morality sir what is to become of that  tanner meaning a weeping magdalen and an innocent child branded with her shame not in our circle thank you morality can go to its father the devil  ramsden i thought so sir morality sent to the devil to please our libertines male and female that is to be the future of england is it  tanner oh england will survive your disapproval meanwhile i understand that you agree with me as to the practical course we are to take  ramsden not in your spirit sir not for your reasons  tanner you can explain that if anybody calls you to account here or hereafter he turns away and plants himself in front of mr herbert spencer at whom he stares gloomily  ann rising and coming to ramsden granny hadnt you better go up to the drawingroom and tell them what we intend to do  ramsden looking pointedly at tanner i hardly like to leave you alone with this gentleman will you not come with me  ann miss ramsden would not like to speak about it before me granny i ought not to be present  ramsden you are right i should have thought of that you are a good girl annie  he pats her on the shoulder she looks up at him with beaming eyes and he goes out much moved having disposed of him she looks at tanner his back being turned to her she gives a moments attention to her personal appearance then softly goes to him and speaks almost into his ear  ann jack he turns with a start are you glad that you are my guardian you dont mind being made responsible for me i hope  tanner the latest addition to your collection of scapegoats eh  ann oh that stupid old joke of yours about me do please drop it why do you say things that you know must pain me i do my best to please you jack i suppose i may tell you so now that you are my guardian you will make me so unhappy if you refuse to be friends with me  tanner studying her as gloomily as he studied the dust you need not go begging for my regard how unreal our moral judgments are you seem to me to have absolutely no conscienceonly hypocrisy and you cant see the differenceyet there is a sort of fascination about you i always attend to you somehow i should miss you if i lost you  ann tranquilly slipping her arm into his and walking about with him but isnt that only natural jack we have known each other since we were children do you remember  tanner abruptly breaking loose stop i remember everything  ann oh i daresay we were often very silly but  tanner i wont have it ann i am no more that schoolboy now than i am the dotard of ninety i shall grow into if i live long enough it is over let me forget it  ann wasnt it a happy time she attempts to take his arm again  tanner sit down and behave yourself he makes her sit down in the chair next the writing table no doubt it was a happy time for you you were a good girl and never compromised yourself and yet the wickedest child that ever was slapped could hardly have had a better time i can understand the success with which you bullied the other girls your virtue imposed on them but tell me this did you ever know a good boy  ann of course all boys are foolish sometimes but tavy was always a really good boy  tanner struck by this yes youre right for some reason you never tempted tavy  ann tempted jack  tanner yes my dear lady mephistopheles tempted you were insatiably curious as to what a boy might be capable of and diabolically clever at getting through his guard and surprising his inmost secrets  ann what nonsense all because you used to tell me long stories of the wicked things you had donesilly boys tricks and you call such things inmost secrets boys secrets are just like mens and you know what they are  tanner obstinately no i dont what are they pray  ann why the things they tell everybody of course  tanner now i swear i told you things i told no one else you lured me into a compact by which we were to have no secrets from one another we were to tell one another everything i didnt notice that you never told me anything  ann you didnt want to talk about me jack you wanted to talk about yourself  tanner ah true horribly true but what a devil of a child you must have been to know that weakness and to play on it for the satisfaction of your own curiosity i wanted to brag to you to make myself interesting and i found myself doing all sorts of mischievous things simply to have something to tell you about i fought with boys i didnt hate i lied about things i might just as well have told the truth about i stole things i didnt want i kissed little girls i didnt care for it was all bravado passionless and therefore unreal  ann i never told of you jack  tanner no but if you had wanted to stop me you would have told of me you wanted me to go on  ann flashing out oh thats not true its not true jack i never wanted you to do those dull disappointing brutal stupid vulgar things i always hoped that it would be something really heroic at last recovering herself excuse me jack but the things you did were never a bit like the things i wanted you to do they often gave me great uneasiness but i could not tell on you and get you into trouble and you were only a boy i knew you would grow out of them perhaps i was wrong  tanner sardonically do not give way to remorse ann at least nineteen twentieths of the exploits i confessed to you were pure lies i soon noticed that you didnt like the true stories  ann of course i knew that some of the things couldnt have happened but  tanner you are going to remind me that some of the most disgraceful ones did  ann fondly to his great terror i dont want to remind you of anything but i knew the people they happened to and heard about them  tanner yes but even the true stories were touched up for telling a sensitive boys humiliations may be very good fun for ordinary thickskinned grownups but to the boy himself they are so acute so ignominious that he cannot confess themcannot but deny them passionately however perhaps it was as well for me that i romanced a bit for on the one occasion when i told you the truth you threatened to tell of me  ann oh never never once  tanner yes you did do you remember a darkeyed girl named rachel rosetree anns brows contract for an instant involuntarily i got up a love affair with her and we met one night in the garden and walked about very uncomfortably with our arms round one another and kissed at parting and were most conscientiously romantic if that love affair had gone on it would have bored me to death but it didnt go on for the next thing that happened was that rachel cut me because she found out that i had told you how did she find it out from you you went to her and held the guilty secret over her head leading her a life of abject terror and humiliation by threatening to tell on her  ann and a very good thing for her too it was my duty to stop her misconduct and she is thankful to me for it now  tanner is she  ann she ought to be at all events  tanner it was not your duty to stop my misconduct i suppose  ann i did stop it by stopping her  tanner are you sure of that you stopped my telling you about my adventures but how do you know that you stopped the adventures  ann do you mean to say that you went on in the same way with other girls  tanner no i had enough of that sort of romantic tomfoolery with rachel  ann unconvinced then why did you break off our confidences and become quite strange to me  tanner enigmatically it happened just then that i got something that i wanted to keep all to myself instead of sharing it with you  ann i am sure i shouldnt have asked for any of it if you had grudged it  tanner it wasnt a box of sweets ann it was something youd never have let me call my own  ann incredulously what  tanner my soul  ann oh do be sensible jack you know youre talking nonsense  tanner the most solemn earnest ann you didnt notice at that time that you were getting a soul too but you were it was not for nothing that you suddenly found you had a moral duty to chastise and reform rachel up to that time you had traded pretty extensively in being a good child but you had never set up a sense of duty to others well i set one up too up to that time i had played the boy buccaneer with no more conscience than a fox in a poultry farm but now i began to have scruples to feel obligations to find that veracity and honor were no longer goodygoody expressions in the mouths of grown up people but compelling principles in myself  ann quietly yes i suppose youre right you were beginning to be a man and i to be a woman  tanner are you sure it was not that we were beginning to be something more what does the beginning of manhood and womanhood mean in most peoples mouths you know it means the beginning of love but love began long before that for me love played its part in the earliest dreams and follies and romances i can remembermay i say the earliest follies and romances we can rememberthough we did not understand it at the time no the change that came to me was the birth in me of moral passion and i declare that according to my experience moral passion is the only real passion  ann all passions ought to be moral jack  tanner ought do you think that anything is strong enough to impose oughts on a passion except a stronger passion still  ann our moral sense controls passion jack dont be stupid  tanner our moral sense and is that not a passion is the devil to have all the passions as well as all the good times if it were not a passionif it were not the mightiest of the passions all the other passions would sweep it away like a leaf before a hurricane it is the birth of that passion that turns a child into a man  ann there are other passions jack very strong ones  tanner all the other passions were in me before but they were idle and aimlessmere childish greedinesses and cruelties curiosities and fancies habits and superstitions grotesque and ridiculous to the mature intelligence when they suddenly began to shine like newly lit flames it was by no light of their own but by the radiance of the dawning moral passion that passion dignified them gave them conscience and meaning found them a mob of appetites and organized them into an army of purposes and principles my soul was born of that passion  ann i noticed that you got more sense you were a dreadfully destructive boy before that  tanner destructive stuff i was only mischievous  ann oh jack you were very destructive you ruined all the young fir trees by chopping off their leaders with a wooden sword you broke all the cucumber frames with your catapult you set fire to the common the police arrested tavy for it because he ran away when he couldnt stop you you  tanner pooh pooh pooh these were battles bombardments stratagems to save our scalps from the red indians you have no imagination ann i am ten times more destructive now than i was then the moral passion has taken my destructiveness in hand and directed it to moral ends i have become a reformer and like all reformers an iconoclast i no longer break cucumber frames and burn gorse bushes i shatter creeds and demolish idols  ann bored i am afraid i am too feminine to see any sense in destruction destruction can only destroy  tanner yes that is why it is so useful construction cumbers the ground with institutions made by busybodies destruction clears it and gives us breathing space and liberty  ann its no use jack no woman will agree with you there  tanner thats because you confuse construction and destruction with creation and murder theyre quite different i adore creation and abhor murder yes i adore it in tree and flower in bird and beast even in you a flush of interest and delight suddenly clears the growing perplexity and boredom from her face it was the creative instinct that led you to attach me to you by bonds that have left their mark on me to this day yes ann the old childish compact between us was an unconscious love compact  ann jack  tanner oh dont be alarmed  ann i am not alarmed  tanner whimsically then you ought to be where are your principles  ann jack are you serious or are you not  tanner do you mean about the moral passion  ann no no the other one confused oh you are so silly one never knows how to take you  tanner you must take me quite seriously i am your guardian and it is my duty to improve your mind  ann the love compact is over then is it i suppose you grew tired of me  tanner no but the moral passion made our childish relations impossible a jealous sense of my new individuality arose in me  ann you hated to be treated as a boy any longer poor jack  tanner yes because to be treated as a boy was to be taken on the old footing i had become a new person and those who knew the old person laughed at me the only man who behaved sensibly was my tailor he took my measure anew every time he saw me whilst all the rest went on with their old measurements and expected them to fit me  ann you became frightfully selfconscious  tanner when you go to heaven ann you will be frightfully conscious of your wings for the first year or so when you meet your relatives there and they persist in treating you as if you were still a mortal you will not be able to bear them you will try to get into a circle which has never known you except as an angel  ann so it was only your vanity that made you run away from us after all  tanner yes only my vanity as you call it  ann you need not have kept away from me on that account  tanner from you above all others you fought harder than anybody against my emancipation  ann earnestly oh how wrong you are i would have done anything for you  tanner anything except let me get loose from you even then you had acquired by instinct that damnable womans trick of heaping obligations on a man of placing yourself so entirely and helplessly at his mercy that at last he dare not take a step without running to you for leave i know a poor wretch whose one desire in life is to run away from his wife she prevents him by threatening to throw herself in front of the engine of the train he leaves her in that is what all women do if we try to go where you do not want us to go there is no law to prevent us but when we take the first step your breasts are under our foot as it descends your bodies are under our wheels as we start no woman shall ever enslave me in that way  ann but jack you cannot get through life without considering other people a little  tanner ay but what other people it is this consideration of other people or rather this cowardly fear of them which we call consideration that makes us the sentimental slaves we are to consider you as you call it is to substitute your will for my own how if it be a baser will than mine are women taught better than men or worse are mobs of voters taught better than statesmen or worse worse of course in both cases and then what sort of world are you going to get with its public men considering its voting mobs and its private men considering their wives what does church and state mean nowadays the woman and the ratepayer  ann placidly i am so glad you understand politics jack it will be most useful to you if you go into parliament he collapses like a pricked bladder but i am sorry you thought my influence a bad one  tanner i dont say it was a bad one but bad or good i didnt choose to be cut to your measure and i wont be cut to it  ann nobody wants you to jack i assure youreally on my wordi dont mind your queer opinions one little bit you know we have all been brought up to have advanced opinions why do you persist in thinking me so narrow minded  tanner thats the danger of it i know you dont mind because youve found out that it doesnt matter the boa constrictor doesnt mind the opinions of a stag one little bit when once she has got her coils round it  ann rising in sudden enlightenment oooooh now i understand why you warned tavy that i am a boa constrictor granny told me she laughs and throws her boa around her neck doesnt it feel nice and soft jack  tanner in the toils you scandalous woman will you throw away even your hypocrisy  ann i am never hypocritical with you jack are you angry she withdraws the boa and throws it on a chair perhaps i shouldnt have done that  tanner contemptuously pooh prudery why should you not if it amuses you  ann shyly well becausebecause i suppose what you really meant by the boa constrictor was this she puts her arms round his neck  tanner staring at her magnificent audacity she laughs and pats his cheeks now just to think that if i mentioned this episode not a soul would believe me except the people who would cut me for telling whilst if you accused me of it nobody would believe my denial  ann taking her arms away with perfect dignity you are incorrigible jack but you should not jest about our affection for one another nobody could possibly misunderstand it you do not misunderstand it i hope  tanner my blood interprets for me ann poor ricky tiky tavy  ann looking quickly at him as if this were a new light surely you are not so absurd as to be jealous of tavy  tanner jealous why should i be but i dont wonder at your grip of him i feel the coils tightening round my very self though you are only playing with me  ann do you think i have designs on tavy  tanner i know you have  ann earnestly take care jack you may make tavy very happy if you mislead him about me  tanner never fear he will not escape you  ann i wonder are you really a clever man  tanner why this sudden misgiving on the subject  ann you seem to understand all the things i dont understand but you are a perfect baby in the things i do understand  tanner i understand how tavy feels for you ann you may depend on that at all events  ann and you think you understand how i feel for tavy dont you  tanner i know only too well what is going to happen to poor tavy  ann i should laugh at you jack if it were not for poor papas death mind tavy will be very unhappy  tanner yes but he wont know it poor devil he is a thousand times too good for you thats why he is going to make the mistake of his life about you  ann i think men make more mistakes by being too clever than by being too good she sits down with a trace of contempt for the whole male sex in the elegant carriage of her shoulders  tanner oh i know you dont care very much about tavy but there is always one who kisses and one who only allows the kiss tavy will kiss and you will only turn the cheek and you will throw him over if anybody better turns up  ann offended you have no right to say such things jack they are not true and not delicate if you and tavy choose to be stupid about me that is not my fault  tanner remorsefully forgive my brutalities ann they are levelled at this wicked world not at you she looks up at him pleased and forgiving he becomes cautious at once all the same i wish ramsden would come back i never feel safe with you there is a devilish charmor no not a charm a subtle interest she laughs just so you know it and you triumph in it openly and shamelessly triumph in it  ann what a shocking flirt you are jack  tanner a flirt i  ann yes a flirt you are always abusing and offending people but you never really mean to let go your hold of them  tanner i will ring the bell this conversation has already gone further than i intended  ramsden and octavius come back with miss ramsden a hardheaded old maiden lady in a plain brown silk gown with enough rings chains and brooches to show that her plainness of dress is a matter of principle not of poverty she comes into the room very determinedly the two men perplexed and downcast following her ann rises and goes eagerly to meet her tanner retreats to the wall between the busts and pretends to study the pictures ramsden goes to his table as usual and octavius clings to the neighborhood of tanner  miss ramsden almost pushing ann aside as she comes to mr whitefields chair and plants herself there resolutely i wash my hands of the whole affair  octavius very wretched i know you wish me to take violet away miss ramsden i will he turns irresolutely to the door  ramsden no no  miss ramsden what is the use of saying no roebuck octavius knows that i would not turn any truly contrite and repentant woman from your doors but when a woman is not only wicked but intends to go on being wicked she and i part company  ann oh miss ramsden what do you mean what has violet said  ramsden violet is certainly very obstinate she wont leave london i dont understand her  miss ramsden i do its as plain as the nose on your face roebuck that she wont go because she doesnt want to be separated from this man whoever he is  ann oh surely surely octavius did you speak to her  octavius she wont tell us anything she wont make any arrangement until she has consulted somebody it cant be anybody else than the scoundrel who has betrayed her  tanner to octavius well let her consult him he will be glad enough to have her sent abroad where is the difficulty  miss ramsden taking the answer out of octaviuss mouth the difficulty mr jack is that when he offered to help her i didnt offer to become her accomplice in her wickedness she either pledges her word never to see that man again or else she finds some new friends and the sooner the better  the parlormaid appears at the door ann hastily resumes her seat and looks as unconcerned as possible octavius instinctively imitates her  the maid the cab is at the door maam  miss ramsden what cab  the maid for miss robinson  miss ramsden oh recovering herself all right the maid withdraws she has sent for a cab  tanner i wanted to send for that cab half an hour ago  miss ramsden i am glad she understands the position she has placed herself in  ramsden i dont like her going away in this fashion susan we had better not do anything harsh  octavius no thank you again and again but miss ramsden is quite right violet cannot expect to stay  ann hadnt you better go with her tavy  octavius she wont have me  miss ramsden of course she wont shes going straight to that man  tanner as a natural result of her virtuous reception here  ramsden much troubled there susan you hear and theres some truth in it i wish you could reconcile it with your principles to be a little patient with this poor girl shes very young and theres a time for everything  miss ramsden oh she will get all the sympathy she wants from the men im surprised at you roebuck  tanner so am i ramsden most favorably  violet appears at the door she is as impenitent and selfassured a young lady as one would desire to see among the best behaved of her sex her small head and tiny resolute mouth and chin her haughty crispness of speech and trimness of carriage the ruthless elegance of her equipment which includes a very smart hat with a dead bird in it mark a personality which is as formidable as it is exquisitely pretty she is not a siren like ann admiration comes to her without any compulsion or even interest on her part besides there is some fun in ann but in this woman none perhaps no mercy either if anything restrains her it is intelligence and pride not compassion her voice might be the voice of a schoolmistress addressing a class of girls who had disgraced themselves as she proceeds with complete composure and some disgust to say what she has come to say  violet i have only looked in to tell miss ramsden that she will find her birthday present to me the filagree bracelet in the housekeepers room  tanner do come in violet and talk to us sensibly  violet thank you i have had quite enough of the family conversation this morning so has your mother ann she has gone home crying but at all events i have found out what some of my pretended friends are worth good bye  tanner no no one moment i have something to say which i beg you to hear she looks at him without the slightest curiosity but waits apparently as much to finish getting her glove on as to hear what he has to say i am altogether on your side in this matter i congratulate you with the sincerest respect on having the courage to do what you have done you are entirely in the right and the family is entirely in the wrong  sensation ann and miss ramsden rise and turn toward the two violet more surprised than any of the others forgets her glove and comes forward into the middle of the room both puzzled and displeased octavius alone does not move or raise his head he is overwhelmed with shame  ann pleading to tanner to be sensible jack  miss ramsden outraged well i must say  violet sharply to tanner who told you  tanner why ramsden and tavy of course why should they not  violet but they dont know  tanner dont know what  violet they dont know that i am in the right i mean  tanner oh they know it in their hearts though they think themselves bound to blame you by their silly superstitions about morality and propriety and so forth but i know and the whole world really knows though it dare not say so that you were right to follow your instinct that vitality and bravery are the greatest qualities a woman can have and motherhood her solemn initiation into womanhood and that the fact of your not being legally married matters not one scrap either to your own worth or to our real regard for you  violet flushing with indignation oh you think me a wicked woman like the rest you think i have not only been vile but that i share your abominable opinions miss ramsden i have borne your hard words because i knew you would be sorry for them when you found out the truth but i wont bear such a horrible insult as to be complimented by jack on being one of the wretches of whom he approves i have kept my marriage a secret for my husbands sake but now i claim my right as a married woman not to be insulted  octavius raising his head with inexpressible relief you are married  violet yes and i think you might have guessed it what business had you all to take it for granted that i had no right to wear my wedding ring not one of you even asked me i cannot forget that  tanner in ruins i am utterly crushed i meant welli apologizeabjectly apologize  violet i hope you will be more careful in future about the things you say of course one does not take them seriously but they are very disagreeable and rather in bad taste  tanner bowing to the storm i have no defence i shall know better in future than to take any womans part we have all disgraced ourselves in your eyes i am afraid except ann she befriended you for anns sake forgive us  violet yes ann has been very kind but then ann knew  tanner oh  miss ramsden stiffly and who pray is the gentleman who does not acknowledge his wife  violet promptly that is my business miss ramsden and not yours i have my reasons for keeping my marriage a secret for the present  ramsden all i can say is that we are extremely sorry violet i am shocked to think of how we have treated you  octavius awkwardly i beg your pardon violet i can say no more  miss ramsden still loth to surrender of course what you say puts a very different complexion on the matter all the same i owe it to myself  violet cutting her short you owe me an apology miss ramsden thats what you owe both to yourself and to me if you were a married woman you would not like sitting in the housekeepers room and being treated like a naughty child by young girls and old ladies without any serious duties and responsibilities  tanner dont hit us when were down violet we seem to have made fools of ourselves but really it was you who made fools of us  violet it was no business of yours jack in any case  tanner no business of mine why ramsden as good as accused me of being the unknown gentleman  ramsden makes a frantic demonstration but violets cool keen anger extinguishes it  violet you oh how infamous how abominable how disgracefully you have all been talking about me if my husband knew it he would never let me speak to any of you again to ramsden i think you might have spared me at least  ramsden but i assure you i neverat least it is a monstrous perversion of something i said that  miss ramsden you neednt apologize roebuck she brought it all on herself it is for her to apologize for having deceived us  violet i can make allowances for you miss ramsden you cannot understand how i feel on this subject though i should have expected rather better taste from people of greater experience however i quite feel that you have all placed yourselves in a very painful position and the most truly considerate thing for me to do is to go at once good morning  she goes leaving them staring  miss ramsden well i must say  ramsden plaintively i dont think she is quite fair to us  tanner you must cower before the wedding ring like the rest of us ramsden the cup of our ignominy is full     act ii  on the carriage drive in the park of a country house near richmond a motor car has broken down it stands in front of a clump of trees round which the drive sweeps to the house which is partly visible through them indeed tanner standing in the drive with the car on his right hand could get an unobstructed view of the west corner of the house on his left were he not far too much interested in a pair of supine legs in blue serge trousers which protrude from beneath the machine he is watching them intently with bent back and hands supported on his knees his leathern overcoat and peaked cap proclaim him one of the dismounted passengers  the legs aha i got him  tanner all right now  the legs all right now  tanner stoops and takes the legs by the ankles drawing their owner forth like a wheelbarrow walking on his hands with a hammer in his mouth he is a young man in a neat suit of blue serge clean shaven dark eyed square fingered with short well brushed black hair and rather irregular sceptically turned eyebrows when he is manipulating the car his movements are swift and sudden yet attentive and deliberate with tanner and tanners friends his manner is not in the least deferential but cool and reticent keeping them quite effectually at a distance whilst giving them no excuse for complaining of him nevertheless he has a vigilant eye on them always and that too rather cynically like a man who knows the world well from its seamy side he speaks slowly and with a touch of sarcasm and as he does not at all affect the gentleman in his speech it may be inferred that his smart appearance is a mark of respect to himself and his own class not to that which employs him  he now gets into the car to test his machinery and put his cap and overcoat on again tanner takes off his leather overcoat and pitches it into the car the chauffeur or automobilist or motoreer or whatever england may presently decide to call him looks round inquiringly in the act of stowing away his hammer  the chauffeur had enough of it eh  tanner i may as well walk to the house and stretch my legs and calm my nerves a little looking at his watch i suppose you know that we have come from hyde park corner to richmond in twentyone minutes  the chauffeur id have done it under fifteen if id had a clear road all the way  tanner why do you do it is it for love of sport or for the fun of terrifying your unfortunate employer  the chauffeur what are you afraid of  tanner the police and breaking my neck  the chauffeur well if you like easy going you can take a bus you know its cheaper you pay me to save your time and give you the value of your thousand pound car he sits down calmly  tanner i am the slave of that car and of you too i dream of the accursed thing at night  the chauffeur youll get over that if youre going up to the house may i ask how long youre goin to stay there because if you mean to put in the whole morning talkin to the ladies ill put the car in the stables and make myself comfortable if not ill keep the car on the go about here til you come  tanner better wait here we shant be long theres a young american gentleman a mr malone who is driving mr robinson down in his new american steam car  the chauffeur springing up and coming hastily out of the car to tanner american steam car wot racin us down from london  tanner perhaps theyre here already  the chauffeur if id known it with deep reproach why didnt you tell me mr tanner  tanner because ive been told that this car is capable of 84 miles an hour and i already know what you are capable of when there is a rival car on the road no henry there are things it is not good for you to know and this was one of them however cheer up we are going to have a day after your own heart the american is to take mr robinson and his sister and miss whitefield we are to take miss rhoda  the chauffeur consoled and musing on another matter thats miss whitefields sister isnt it  tanner yes  the chauffeur and miss whitefield herself is goin in the other car not with you  tanner why the devil should she come with me mr robinson will be in the other car the chauffeur looks at tanner with cool incredulity and turns to the car whistling a popular air softly to himself tanner a little annoyed is about to pursue the subject when he hears the footsteps of octavius on the gravel octavius is coming from the house dressed for motoring but without his overcoat weve lost the race thank heaven heres mr robinson well tavy is the steam car a success  octavius i think so we came from hyde park corner here in seventeen minutes the chauffeur furious kicks the car with a groan of vexation how long were you  tanner oh about three quarters of an hour or so  the chauffeur remonstrating now now mr tanner come now we could ha done it easy under fifteen  tanner by the way let me introduce you mr octavius robinson mr enry straker  straker pleased to meet you sir mr tanner is gittin at you with his enry straker you know you call it henery but i dont mind bless you  tanner you think its simply bad taste in me to chaff him tavy but youre wrong this man takes more trouble to drop his aiches than ever his father did to pick them up its a mark of caste to him i have never met anybody more swollen with the pride of class than enry is  straker easy easy a little moderation mr tanner  tanner a little moderation tavy you observe you would tell me to draw it mild but this chap has been educated whats more he knows that we havent what was that board school of yours straker  straker sherbrooke road  tanner sherbrooke road would any of us say rugby harrow eton in that tone of intellectual snobbery sherbrooke road is a place where boys learn something eton is a boy farm where we are sent because we are nuisances at home and because in after life whenever a duke is mentioned we can claim him as an old schoolfellow  straker you dont know nothing about it mr tanner its not the board school that does it its the polytechnic  tanner his university octavius not oxford cambridge durham dublin or glasgow not even those nonconformist holes in wales no tavy regent street chelsea the boroughi dont know half their confounded names these are his universities not mere shops for selling class limitations like ours you despise oxford enry dont you  straker no i dont very nice sort of place oxford i should think for people that like that sort of place they teach you to be a gentleman there in the polytechnic they teach you to be an engineer or such like see  tanner sarcasm tavy sarcasm oh if you could only see into enrys soul the depth of his contempt for a gentleman the arrogance of his pride in being an engineer would appal you he positively likes the car to break down because it brings out my gentlemanly helplessness and his workmanlike skill and resource  straker never you mind him mr robinson he likes to talk we know him dont we  octavius earnestly but theres a great truth at the bottom of what he says i believe most intensely in the dignity of labor  straker unimpressed thats because you never done any mr robinson my business is to do away with labor youll get more out of me and a machine than you will out of twenty laborers and not so much to drink either  tanner for heavens sake tavy dont start him on political economy he knows all about it and we dont youre only a poetic socialist tavy hes a scientific one  straker unperturbed yes well this conversation is very improvin but ive got to look after the car and you two want to talk about your ladies i know he retires to busy himself about the car and presently saunters off towards the house  tanner thats a very momentous social phenomenon  octavius what is  tanner straker is here have we literary and cultured persons been for years setting up a cry of the new woman whenever some unusually old fashioned female came along and never noticing the advent of the new man strakers the new man  octavius i see nothing new about him except your way of chaffing him but i dont want to talk about him just now i want to speak to you about ann  tanner straker knew even that he learnt it at the polytechnic probably well what about ann have you proposed to her  octavius selfreproachfully i was brute enough to do so last night  tanner brute enough what do you mean  octavius dithyrambically jack we men are all coarse we never understand how exquisite a womans sensibilities are how could i have done such a thing  tanner done what you maudlin idiot  octavius yes i am an idiot jack if you had heard her voice if you had seen her tears i have lain awake all night thinking of them if she had reproached me i could have borne it better  tanner tears thats dangerous what did she say  octavius she asked me how she could think of anything now but her dear father she stifled a sobhe breaks down  tanner patting him on the back bear it like a man tavy even if you feel it like an ass its the old game shes not tired of playing with you yet  octavius impatiently oh dont be a fool jack do you suppose this eternal shallow cynicism of yours has any real bearing on a nature like hers  tanner hm did she say anything else  octavius yes and that is why i expose myself and her to your ridicule by telling you what passed  tanner remorsefully no dear tavy not ridicule on my honor however no matter go on  octavius her sense of duty is so devout so perfect so  tanner yes i know go on  octavius you see under this new arrangement you and ramsden are her guardians and she considers that all her duty to her father is now transferred to you she said she thought i ought to have spoken to you both in the first instance of course she is right but somehow it seems rather absurd that i am to come to you and formally ask to be received as a suitor for your wards hand  tanner i am glad that love has not totally extinguished your sense of humor tavy  octavius that answer wont satisfy her  tanner my official answer is obviously bless you my children may you be happy  octavius i wish you would stop playing the fool about this if it is not serious to you it is to me and to her  tanner you know very well that she is as free to choose as you she does not think so  tanner oh doesnt she just however say what you want me to do  octavius i want you to tell her sincerely and earnestly what you think about me i want you to tell her that you can trust her to methat is if you feel you can  tanner i have no doubt that i can trust her to you what worries me is the idea of trusting you to her have you read maeterlincks book about the bee  octavius keeping his temper with difficulty i am not discussing literature at present  tanner be just a little patient with me i am not discussing literature the book about the bee is natural history its an awful lesson to mankind you think that you are anns suitor that you are the pursuer and she the pursued that it is your part to woo to persuade to prevail to overcome fool it is you who are the pursued the marked down quarry the destined prey you need not sit looking longingly at the bait through the wires of the trap the door is open and will remain so until it shuts behind you for ever  octavius i wish i could believe that vilely as you put it  tanner why man what other work has she in life but to get a husband it is a womans business to get married as soon as possible and a mans to keep unmarried as long as he can you have your poems and your tragedies to work at ann has nothing  octavius i cannot write without inspiration and nobody can give me that except ann  tanner well hadnt you better get it from her at a safe distance petrarch didnt see half as much of laura nor dante of beatrice as you see of ann now and yet they wrote firstrate poetryat least so im told they never exposed their idolatry to the test of domestic familiarity and it lasted them to their graves marry ann and at the end of a week youll find no more inspiration than in a plate of muffins  octavius you think i shall tire of her  tanner not at all you dont get tired of muffins but you dont find inspiration in them and you wont in her when she ceases to be a poets dream and becomes a solid eleven stone wife youll be forced to dream about somebody else and then there will be a row  octavius this sort of talk is no use jack you dont understand you have never been in love  tanner i i have never been out of it why i am in love even with ann but i am neither the slave of love nor its dupe go to the bee thou poet consider her ways and be wise by heaven tavy if women could do without our work and we ate their childrens bread instead of making it they would kill us as the spider kills her mate or as the bees kill the drone and they would be right if we were good for nothing but love  octavius ah if we were only good enough for love there is nothing like love there is nothing else but love without it the world would be a dream of sordid horror  tanner and thisthis is the man who asks me to give him the hand of my ward tavy i believe we were changed in our cradles and that you are the real descendant of don juan  octavius i beg you not to say anything like that to ann  tanner dont be afraid she has marked you for her own and nothing will stop her now you are doomed straker comes back with a newspaper here comes the new man demoralizing himself with a halfpenny paper as usual  straker now would you believe it mr robinson when were out motoring we take in two papers the times for him the leader or the echo for me and do you think i ever see my paper not much he grabs the leader and leaves me to stodge myself with his times  octavius are there no winners in the times  tanner enry dont old with bettin tavy motor records are his weakness whats the latest  straker paris to biskra at forty mile an hour average not countin the mediterranean  tanner how many killed  straker two silly sheep what does it matter sheep dont cost such a lot they were glad to ave the price without the trouble o sellin em to the butcher all the same dysee therell be a clamor agin it presently and then the french governmentll stop it an our chance will be gone see that what makes me fairly mad mr tanner wont do a good run while he can  tanner tavy do you remember my uncle james  octavius yes why  tanner uncle james had a first rate cook he couldnt digest anything except what she cooked well the poor man was shy and hated society but his cook was proud of her skill and wanted to serve up dinners to princes and ambassadors to prevent her from leaving him that poor old man had to give a big dinner twice a month and suffer agonies of awkwardness now here am i and here is this chap enry straker the new man i loathe travelling but i rather like enry he cares for nothing but tearing along in a leather coat and goggles with two inches of dust all over him at sixty miles an hour and the risk of his life and mine except of course when he is lying on his back in the mud under the machine trying to find out where it has given way well if i dont give him a thousand mile run at least once a fortnight i shall lose him he will give me the sack and go to some american millionaire and i shall have to put up with a nice respectful groomgardeneramateur who will touch his hat and know his place i am enrys slave just as uncle james was his cooks slave  straker exasperated garn i wish i had a car that would go as fast as you can talk mr tanner what i say is that you lose money by a motor car unless you keep it workin might as well ave a pram and a nussmaid to wheel you in it as that car and me if you dont git the last inch out of us both  tanner soothingly all right henry all right well go out for half an hour presently  straker in disgust arf an ahr he returns to his machine seats himself in it and turns up a fresh page of his paper in search of more news  octavius oh that reminds me i have a note for you from rhoda he gives tanner a note  tanner opening it i rather think rhoda is heading for a row with ann as a rule there is only one person an english girl hates more than she hates her mother and thats her eldest sister but rhoda positively prefers her mother to ann sheindignantly oh i say  octavius whats the matter  tanner rhoda was to have come with me for a ride in the motor car she says ann has forbidden her to go out with me  straker suddenly begins whistling his favorite air with remarkable deliberation surprised by this burst of larklike melody and jarred by a sardonic note in its cheerfulness they turn and look inquiringly at him but he is busy with his paper and nothing comes of their movement  octavius recovering himself does she give any reason  tanner reason an insult is not a reason ann forbids her to be alone with me on any occasion says i am not a fit person for a young girl to be with what do you think of your paragon now  octavius you must remember that she has a very heavy responsibility now that her father is dead mrs whitefield is too weak to control rhoda  tanner staring at him in short you agree with ann  octavius no but i think i understand her you must admit that your views are hardly suited for the formation of a young girls mind and character  tanner i admit nothing of the sort i admit that the formation of a young ladys mind and character usually consists in telling her lies but i object to the particular lie that i am in the habit of abusing the confidence of girls  octavius ann doesnt say that jack  tanner what else does she mean  straker catching sight of ann coming from the house miss whitefield gentlemen he dismounts and strolls away down the avenue with the air of a man who knows he is no longer wanted  ann coming between octavius and tanner good morning jack i have come to tell you that poor rhoda has got one of her headaches and cannot go out with you today in the car it is a cruel disappointment to her poor child  tanner what do you say now tavy  octavius surely you cannot misunderstand jack ann is showing you the kindest consideration even at the cost of deceiving you  ann what do you mean  tanner would you like to cure rhodas headache ann  ann of course  tanner then tell her what you said just now and add that you arrived about two minutes after i had received her letter and read it  ann rhoda has written to you  tanner with full particulars  octavius never mind him ann you were right quite right ann was only doing her duty jack and you know it doing it in the kindest way too  ann going to octavius how kind you are tavy how helpful how well you understand  octavius beams  tanner ay tighten the coils you love her tavy dont you  octavius she knows i do  ann hush for shame tavy  tanner oh i give you leave i am your guardian and i commit you to tavys care for the next hour  ann no jack i must speak to you about rhoda ricky will you go back to the house and entertain your american friend hes rather on mammas hands so early in the morning she wants to finish her housekeeping  octavius i fly dearest ann he kisses her hand  ann tenderly ricky ticky tavy  he looks at her with an eloquent blush and runs off  tanner bluntly now look here ann this time youve landed yourself and if tavy were not in love with you past all salvation hed have found out what an incorrigible liar you are  ann you misunderstand jack i didnt dare tell tavy the truth  tanner no your daring is generally in the opposite direction what the devil do you mean by telling rhoda that i am too vicious to associate with her how can i ever have any human or decent relations with her again now that you have poisoned her mind in that abominable way  ann i know you are incapable of behaving badly  tanner then why did you lie to her  ann i had to  tanner had to  ann mother made me  tanner his eye flashing ha i might have known it the mother always the mother  ann it was that dreadful book of yours you know how timid mother is all timid women are conventional we must be conventional jack or we are so cruelly so vilely misunderstood even you who are a man cannot say what you think without being misunderstood and vilifiedyes i admit it i have had to vilify you do you want to have poor rhoda misunderstood and vilified to the same way would it be right for mother to let her expose herself to such treatment before she is old enough to judge for herself  tanner in short the way to avoid misunderstanding is for everybody to lie and slander and insinuate and pretend as hard as they can that is what obeying your mother comes to  ann i love my mother jack  tanner working himself up into a sociological rage is that any reason why you are not to call your soul your own oh i protest against this vile abjection of youth to age look at fashionable society as you know it what does it pretend to be an exquisite dance of nymphs what is it a horrible procession of wretched girls each in the claws of a cynical cunning avaricious disillusioned ignorantly experienced foulminded old woman whom she calls mother and whose duty it is to corrupt her mind and sell her to the highest bidder why do these unhappy slaves marry anybody however old and vile sooner than not marry at all because marriage is their only means of escape from these decrepit fiends who hide their selfish ambitions their jealous hatreds of the young rivals who have supplanted them under the mask of maternal duty and family affection such things are abominable the voice of nature proclaims for the daughter a fathers care and for the son a mothers the law for father and son and mother and daughter is not the law of love it is the law of revolution of emancipation of final supersession of the old and wornout by the young and capable i tell you the first duty of manhood and womanhood is a declaration of independence the man who pleads his fathers authority is no man the woman who pleads her mothers authority is unfit to bear citizens to a free people  ann watching him with quiet curiosity i suppose you will go in seriously for politics some day jack  tanner heavily let down eh what wh collecting his scattered wits what has that got to do with what i have been saying  ann you talk so well  tanner talk talk it means nothing to you but talk well go back to your mother and help her to poison rhodas imagination as she has poisoned yours it is the tame elephants who enjoy capturing the wild ones  ann i am getting on yesterday i was a boa constrictor today i am an elephant  tanner yes so pack your trunk and begone i have no more to say to you  ann you are so utterly unreasonable and impracticable what can i do  tanner do break your chains go your way according to your own conscience and not according to your mothers get your mind clean and vigorous and learn to enjoy a fast ride in a motor car instead of seeing nothing in it but an excuse for a detestable intrigue come with me to marseilles and across to algiers and to biskra at sixty miles an hour come right down to the cape if you like that will be a declaration of independence with a vengeance you can write a book about it afterwards that will finish your mother and make a woman of you  ann thoughtfully i dont think there would be any harm in that jack you are my guardian you stand in my fathers place by his own wish nobody could say a word against our travelling together it would be delightful thank you a thousand times jack ill come  tanner aghast youll come  ann of course  tanner but he stops utterly appalled then resumes feebly no look here ann if theres no harm in it theres no point in doing it  ann how absurd you are you dont want to compromise me do you  tanner yes thats the whole sense of my proposal  ann you are talking the greatest nonsense and you know it you would never do anything to hurt me  tanner well if you dont want to be compromised dont come  ann with simple earnestness yes i will come jack since you wish it you are my guardian and think we ought to see more of one another and come to know one another better gratefully its very thoughtful and very kind of you jack to offer me this lovely holiday especially after what i said about rhoda you really are goodmuch better than you think when do we start  tanner but  the conversation is interrupted by the arrival of mrs whitefield from the house she is accompanied by the american gentleman and followed by ramsden and octavius  hector malone is an eastern american but he is not at all ashamed of his nationality this makes english people of fashion think well of him as of a young fellow who is manly enough to confess to an obvious disadvantage without any attempt to conceal or extenuate it they feel that he ought not to be made to suffer for what is clearly not his fault and make a point of being specially kind to him his chivalrous manners to women and his elevated moral sentiments being both gratuitous and unusual strike them as being a little unfortunate and though they find his vein of easy humor rather amusing when it has ceased to puzzle them as it does at first they have had to make him understand that he really must not tell anecdotes unless they are strictly personal and scandalous and also that oratory is an accomplishment which belongs to a cruder stage of civilization than that in which his migration has landed him on these points hector is not quite convinced he still thinks that the british are apt to make merits of their stupidities and to represent their various incapacities as points of good breeding english life seems to him to suffer from a lack of edifying rhetoric which he calls moral tone english behavior to show a want of respect for womanhood english pronunciation to fail very vulgarly in tackling such words as world girl bird etc english society to be plain spoken to an extent which stretches occasionally to intolerable coarseness and english intercourse to need enlivening by games and stories and other pastimes so he does not feel called upon to acquire these defects after taking great paths to cultivate himself in a first rate manner before venturing across the atlantic to this culture he finds english people either totally indifferent as they very commonly are to all culture or else politely evasive the truth being that hectors culture is nothing but a state of saturation with our literary exports of thirty years ago reimported by him to be unpacked at a moments notice and hurled at the head of english literature science and art at every conversational opportunity the dismay set up by these sallies encourages him in his belief that he is helping to educate england when he finds people chattering harmlessly about anatole france and nietzsche he devastates them with matthew arnold the autocrat of the breakfast table and even macaulay and as he is devoutly religious at bottom he first leads the unwary by humorous irreverences to wave popular theology out of account in discussing moral questions with him and then scatters them in confusion by demanding whether the carrying out of his ideals of conduct was not the manifest object of god almighty in creating honest men and pure women the engaging freshness of his personality and the dumbfoundering staleness of his culture make it extremely difficult to decide whether he is worth knowing for whilst his company is undeniably pleasant and enlivening there is intellectually nothing new to be got out of him especially as he despises politics and is careful not to talk commercial shop in which department he is probably much in advance of his english capitalist friends he gets on best with romantic christians of the amoristic sect hence the friendship which has sprung up between him and octavius  in appearance hector is a neatly built young man of twentyfour with a short smartly trimmed black beard clear well shaped eyes and an ingratiating vivacity of expression he is from the fashionable point of view faultlessly dressed as he comes along the drive from the house with mrs whitefield he is sedulously making himself agreeable and entertaining and thereby placing on her slender wit a burden it is unable to bear an englishman would let her alone accepting boredom and indifference of their common lot and the poor lady wants to be either let alone or let prattle about the things that interest her  ramsden strolls over to inspect the motor car octavius joins hector  ann pouncing on her mother joyously oh mamma what do you think jack is going to take me to nice in his motor car isnt it lovely i am the happiest person in london  tanner desperately mrs whitefield objects i am sure she objects doesnt she ramsden  ramsden i should think it very likely indeed  ann you dont object do you mother  mrs whitefield i object why should i i think it will do you good ann trotting over to tanner i meant to ask you to take rhoda out for a run occasionally she is too much in the house but it will do when you come back  tanner abyss beneath abyss of perfidy  ann hastily to distract attention from this outburst oh i forgot you have not met mr malone mr tanner my guardian mr hector malone  hector pleased to meet you mr tanner i should like to suggest an extension of the travelling party to nice if i may  ann oh were all coming thats understood isnt it  hector i also am the modest possessor of a motor car if miss robinson will allow me the privilege of taking her my car is at her service  octavius violet  general constraint  ann subduedly come mother we must leave them to talk over the arrangements i must see to my travelling kit  mrs whitefield looks bewildered but ann draws her discreetly away and they disappear round the corner towards the house  hector i think i may go so far as to say that i can depend on miss robinsons consent  continued embarrassment  octavius im afraid we must leave violet behind there are circumstances which make it impossible for her to come on such an expedition  hector amused and not at all convinced too american eh must the young lady have a chaperone  octavius its not that maloneat least not altogether  hector indeed may i ask what other objection applies  tanner impatiently oh tell him tell him we shall never be able to keep the secret unless everybody knows what it is mr malone if you go to nice with violet you go with another mans wife she is married  hector thunderstruck you dont tell me so  tanner we do in confidence  ramsden with an air of importance lest malone should suspect a misalliance her marriage has not yet been made known she desires that it shall not be mentioned for the present  hector i shall respect the ladys wishes would it be indiscreet to ask who her husband is in case i should have an opportunity of consulting him about this trip  tanner we dont know who he is  hector retiring into his shell in a very marked manner in that case i have no more to say  they become more embarrassed than ever  octavius you must think this very strange  hector a little singular pardon me for saving so  ramsden half apologetic half huffy the young lady was married secretly and her husband has forbidden her it seems to declare his name it is only right to tell you since you are interested in misserin violet  octavius sympathetically i hope this is not a disappointment to you  hector softened coming out of his shell again well it is a blow i can hardly understand how a man can leave a wife in such a position surely its not customary its not manly its not considerate  octavius we feel that as you may imagine pretty deeply  ramsden testily it is some young fool who has not enough experience to know what mystifications of this kind lead to  hector with strong symptoms of moral repugnance i hope so a man need be very young and pretty foolish too to be excused for such conduct you take a very lenient view mr ramsden too lenient to my mind surely marriage should ennoble a man  tanner sardonically ha  hector am i to gather from that cacchination that you dont agree with me mr tanner  tanner drily get married and try you may find it delightful for a while you certainly wont find it ennobling the greatest common measure of a man and a woman is not necessarily greater than the mans single measure  hector well we think in america that a womans moral number is higher than a mans and that the purer nature of a woman lifts a man right out of himself and makes him better than he was  octavius with conviction so it does  tanner no wonder american women prefer to live in europe its more comfortable than standing all their lives on an altar to be worshipped anyhow violets husband has not been ennobled so whats to be done  hector shaking his head i cant dismiss that mans conduct as lightly as you do mr tanner however ill say no more whoever he is hes miss robinsons husband and i should be glad for her sake to think better of him  octavius touched for he divines a secret sorrow im very sorry malone very sorry  hector gratefully youre a good fellow robinson thank you  tanner talk about something else violets coming from the house  hector i should esteem it a very great favor men if you would take the opportunity to let me have a few words with the lady alone i shall have to cry off this trip and its rather a delicate  ramsden glad to escape say no more come tanner come tavy he strolls away into the park with octavius and tanner past the motor car  violet comes down the avenue to hector  violet are they looking  hector no  she kisses him  violet have you been telling lies for my sake  hector lying lying hardly describes it i overdo it i get carried away in an ecstasy of mendacity violet i wish youd let me own up  violet instantly becoming serious and resolute no no hector you promised me not to  hector ill keep my promise until you release me from it but i feel mean lying to those men and denying my wife just dastardly  violet i wish your father were not so unreasonable  hector hes not unreasonable hes right from his point of view he has a prejudice against the english middle class  violet its too ridiculous you know how i dislike saying such things to you hector but if i were tooh well no matter  hector i know if you were to marry the son of an english manufacturer of office furniture your friends would consider it a misalliance and heres my silly old dad who is the biggest office furniture man in the world would show me the door for marrying the most perfect lady in england merely because she has no handle to her name of course its just absurd but i tell you violet i dont like deceiving him i feel as if i was stealing his money why wont you let me own up  violet we cant afford it you can be as romantic as you please about love hector but you mustnt be romantic about money  hector divided between his uxoriousness and his habitual elevation of moral sentiment thats very english appealing to her impulsively violet dads bound to find us out some day  violet oh yes later on of course but dont lets go over this every time we meet dear you promised  hector all right all right i  violet not to be silenced it is i and not you who suffer by this concealment and as to facing a struggle and poverty and all that sort of thing i simply will not do it its too silly  hector you shall not ill sort of borrow the money from my dad until i get on my own feet and then i can own up and pay up at the same time  violet alarmed and indignant do you mean to work do you want to spoil our marriage  hector well i dont mean to let marriage spoil my character your friend mr tanner has got the laugh on me a bit already about that and  violet the beast i hate jack tanner  hector magnanimously oh hes all right he only needs the love of a good woman to ennoble him besides hes proposed a motoring trip to nice and im going to take you  violet how jolly  hector yes but how are we going to manage you see theyve warned me off going with you so to speak theyve told me in confidence that youre married thats just the most overwhelming confidence ive ever been honored with  tanner returns with straker who goes to his car  tanner your car is a great success mr malone your engineer is showing it off to mr ramsden  hector eagerlyforgetting himself lets come vi  violet coldly warning him with her eyes i beg your pardon mr malone i did not quite catch  hector recollecting himself i ask to be allowed the pleasure of showing you my little american steam car miss robinson  violet i shall be very pleased they go off together down the avenue  tanner about this trip straker  straker preoccupied with the car yes  tanner miss whitefield is supposed to be coming with me  straker so i gather  tanner mr robinson is to be one of the party  straker yes  tanner well if you can manage so as to be a good deal occupied with me and leave mr robinson a good deal occupied with miss whitefield he will be deeply grateful to you  straker looking round at him evidently  tanner evidently your grandfather would have simply winked  straker my grandfather would have touched his at  tanner and i should have given your good nice respectful grandfather a sovereign  straker five shillins more likely he leaves the car and approaches tanner what about the ladys views  tanner she is just as willing to be left to mr robinson as mr robinson is to be left to her straker looks at his principal with cool scepticism then turns to the car whistling his favorite air stop that aggravating noise what do you mean by it straker calmly resumes the melody and finishes it tanner politely hears it out before he again addresses straker this time with elaborate seriousness enry i have ever been a warm advocate of the spread of music among the masses but i object to your obliging the company whenever miss whitefields name is mentioned you did it this morning too  straker obstinately its not a bit o use mr robinson may as well give it up first as last  tanner why  straker garn you know why course its not my business but you neednt start kiddin me about it  tanner i am not kidding i dont know why  straker cheerfully sulky oh very well all right it aint my business  tanner impressively i trust enry that as between employer and engineer i shall always know how to keep my proper distance and not intrude my private affairs on you even our business arrangements are subject to the approval of your trade union but dont abuse your advantages let me remind you that voltaire said that what was too silly to be said could be sung  straker it wasnt voltaire it was bow mar shay  tanner i stand corrected beaumarchais of course now you seem to think that what is too delicate to be said can be whistled unfortunately your whistling though melodious is unintelligible come theres nobody listening neither my genteel relatives nor the secretary of your confounded union as man to man enry why do you think that my friend has no chance with miss whitefield  straker cause shes arter summun else  tanner bosh who else  straker you  tanner me  straker mean to tell me you didnt know oh come mr tanner  tanner in fierce earnest are you playing the fool or do you mean it  straker with a flash of temper im not playin no fool more coolly why its as plain as the nose on your face if you aint spotted that you dont know much about these sort of things serene again excuse me you know mr tanner but you asked me as man to man and i told you as man to man  tanner wildly appealing to the heavens then ii am the bee the spider the marked down victim the destined prey  straker i dunno about the bee and the spider but the marked down victim thats what you are and no mistake and a jolly good job for you too i should say  tanner momentously henry straker the moment of your life has arrived  straker what dymean  tanner that record to biskra  straker eagerly yes  tanner break it  straker rising to the height of his destiny dymean it  tanner i do  straker when  tanner now is that machine ready to start  straker quailing but you cant  tanner cutting him short by getting into the car off we go first to the bank for money then to my rooms for my kit then to your rooms for your kit then break the record from london to dover or folkestone then across the channel and away like mad to marseilles gibraltar genoa any port from which we can sail to a mahometan country where men are protected from women  straker garn youre kiddin  tanner resolutely stay behind then if you wont come ill do it alone he starts the motor  straker running after him here mister arf a mo steady on he scrambles in as the car plunges forward     act iii  evening in the sierra nevada rolling slopes of brown with olive trees instead of apple trees in the cultivated patches and occasional prickly pears instead of gorse and bracken in the wilds higher up tall stone peaks and precipices all handsome and distinguished no wild nature here rather a most aristocratic mountain landscape made by a fastidious artistcreator no vulgar profusion of vegetation even a touch of aridity in the frequent patches of stones spanish magnificence and spanish economy everywhere  not very far north of a spot at which the high road over one of the passes crosses a tunnel on the railway from malaga to granada is one of the mountain amphitheatres of the sierra looking at it from the wide end of the horseshoe one sees a little to the right in the face of the cliff a romantic cave which is really an abandoned quarry and towards the left a little hill commanding a view of the road which skirts the amphitheatre on the left maintaining its higher level on embankments and on an occasional stone arch on the hill watching the road is a man who is either a spaniard or a scotchman probably a spaniard since he wears the dress of a spanish goatherd and seems at home in the sierra nevada but very like a scotchman for all that in the hollow on the slope leading to the quarrycave are about a dozen men who as they recline at their cave round a heap of smouldering white ashes of dead leaf and brushwood have an air of being conscious of themselves as picturesque scoundrels honoring the sierra by using it as an effective pictorial background as a matter of artistic fact they are not picturesque and the mountains tolerate them as lions tolerate lice an english policeman or poor law guardian would recognize them as a selected band of tramps and ablebodied paupers  this description of them is not wholly contemptuous whoever has intelligently observed the tramp or visited the ablebodied ward of a workhouse will admit that our social failures are not all drunkards and weaklings some of them are men who do not fit the class they were born into precisely the same qualities that make the educated gentleman an artist may make an uneducated manual laborer an ablebodied pauper there are men who fall helplessly into the workhouse because they are good far nothing but there are also men who are there because they are strongminded enough to disregard the social convention obviously not a disinterested one on the part of the ratepayer which bids a man live by heavy and badly paid drudgery when he has the alternative of walking into the workhouse announcing himself as a destitute person and legally compelling the guardians to feed clothe and house him better than he could feed clothe and house himself without great exertion when a man who is born a poet refuses a stool in a stockbrokers office and starves in a garret spunging on a poor landlady or on his friends and relatives rather than work against his grain or when a lady because she is a lady will face any extremity of parasitic dependence rather than take a situation as cook or parlormaid we make large allowances for them to such allowances the ablebodied pauper and his nomadic variant the tramp are equally entitled  further the imaginative man if his life is to be tolerable to him must have leisure to tell himself stories and a position which lends itself to imaginative decoration the ranks of unskilled labor offer no such positions we misuse our laborers horribly and when a man refuses to be misused we have no right to say that he is refusing honest work let us be frank in this matter before we go on with our play so that we may enjoy it without hypocrisy if we were reasoning farsighted people four fifths of us would go straight to the guardians for relief and knock the whole social system to pieces with most beneficial reconstructive results the reason we do got do this is because we work like bees or ants by instinct or habit not reasoning about the matter at all therefore when a man comes along who can and does reason and who applying the kantian test to his conduct can truly say to us if everybody did as i do the world would be compelled to reform itself industrially and abolish slavery and squalor which exist only because everybody does as you do let us honor that man and seriously consider the advisability of following his example such a man is the ablebodied ableminded pauper were he a gentleman doing his best to get a pension or a sinecure instead of sweeping a crossing nobody would blame him for deciding that so long as the alternative lies between living mainly at the expense of the community and allowing the community to live mainly at his it would be folly to accept what is to him personally the greater of the two evils  we may therefore contemplate the tramps of the sierra without prejudice admitting cheerfully that our objectsbriefly to be gentlemen of fortuneare much the same as theirs and the difference in our position and methods merely accidental one or two of them perhaps it would be wiser to kill without malice in a friendly and frank manner for there are bipeds just as there are quadrupeds who are too dangerous to be left unchained and unmuzzled and these cannot fairly expect to have other mens lives wasted in the work of watching them but as society has not the courage to kill them and when it catches them simply wreaks on them some superstitious expiatory rites of torture and degradation and than lets them loose with heightened qualifications for mischief it is just as well that they are at large in the sierra and in the hands of a chief who looks as if he might possibly on provocation order them to be shot  this chief seated in the centre of the group on a squared block of stone from the quarry is a tall strong man with a striking cockatoo nose glossy black hair pointed beard upturned moustache and a mephistophelean affectation which is fairly imposing perhaps because the scenery admits of a larger swagger than piccadilly perhaps because of a certain sentimentality in the man which gives him that touch of grace which alone can excuse deliberate picturesqueness his eyes and mouth are by no means rascally he has a fine voice and a ready wit and whether he is really the strongest man in the party or not he looks it he is certainly the best fed the best dressed and the best trained the fact that he speaks english is not unexpected in spite of the spanish landscape for with the exception of one man who might be guessed as a bullfighter ruined by drink and one unmistakable frenchman they are all cockney or american therefore in a land of cloaks and sombreros they mostly wear seedy overcoats woollen mufflers hard hemispherical hats and dirty brown gloves only a very few dress after their leader whose broad sombrero with a cocks feather in the band and voluminous cloak descending to his high boots are as unenglish as possible none of them are armed and the ungloved ones keep their hands in their pockets because it is their national belief that it must be dangerously cold in the open air with the night coming on it is as warm an evening as any reasonable man could desire  except the bullfighting inebriate there is only one person in the company who looks more than say thirtythree he is a small man with reddish whiskers weak eyes and the anxious look of a small tradesman in difficulties he wears the only tall hat visible it shines in the sunset with the sticky glow of some sixpenny patent hat reviver often applied and constantly tending to produce a worse state of the original surface than the ruin it was applied to remedy he has a collar and cuff of celluloid and his brown chesterfield overcoat with velvet collar is still presentable he is preeminently the respectable man of the party and is certainly over forty possibly over fifty he is the corner man on the leaders right opposite three men in scarlet ties on his left one of these three is the frenchman of the remaining two who are both english one is argumentative solemn and obstinate the other rowdy and mischievous  the chief with a magnificent fling of the end of his cloak across his left shoulder rises to address them the applause which greets him shows that he is a favorite orator  the chief friends and fellow brigands i have a proposal to make to this meeting we have now spent three evenings in discussing the question have anarchists or socialdemocrats the most personal courage we have gone into the principles of anarchism and socialdemocracy at great length the cause of anarchy has been ably represented by our one anarchist who doesnt know what anarchism means laughter  the anarchist rising a point of order mendoza  mendoza forcibly no by thunder your last point of order took half an hour besides anarchists dont believe in order  the anarchist mild polite but persistent he is in fact the respectable looking elderly man in the celluloid collar and cuffs that is a vulgar error i can prove  mendoza order order  the others shouting order order sit down chair shut up  the anarchist is suppressed  mendoza on the other hand we have three socialdemocrats among us they are not on speaking terms and they have put before us three distinct and incompatible views of socialdemocracy  the majority shouting assent hear hear so we are right  the rowdy socialdemocrat smarting under oppression you aint no christian youre a sheeny you are  mendoza with crushing magnanimity my friend i am an exception to all rules it is true that i have the honor to be a jew and when the zionists need a leader to reassemble our race on its historic soil of palestine mendoza will not be the last to volunteer sympathetic applausehear hear etc but i am not a slave to any superstition i have swallowed all the formulas even that of socialism though in a sense once a socialist always a socialist  the socialdemocrats hear hear  mendoza but i am well aware that the ordinary maneven the ordinary brigand who can scarcely be called an ordinary man hear hearis not a philosopher common sense is good enough for him and in our business affairs common sense is good enough for me well what is our business here in the sierra nevada chosen by the moors as the fairest spot in spain is it to discuss abstruse questions of political economy no it is to hold up motor cars and secure a more equitable distribution of wealth  the sulky socialdemocrat all made by labor mind you  mendoza urbanely undoubtedly all made by labor and on its way to be squandered by wealthy vagabonds in the dens of vice that disfigure the sunny shores of the mediterranean we intercept that wealth we restore it to circulation among the class that produced it and that chiefly needs itthe working class we do this at the risk of our lives and liberties by the exercise of the virtues of courage endurance foresight and abstinenceespecially abstinence i myself have eaten nothing but prickly pears and broiled rabbit for three days  the sulky socialdemocrat stubbornly no more aint we  mendoza indignantly have i taken more than my share  the sulky socialdemocrat unmoved why should you  the anarchist why should he not to each according to his needs from each according to his means  the frenchman shaking his fist at the anarchist fumiste  mendoza diplomatically i agree with both of you  the genuinely english brigands hear hear bravo mendoza  mendoza what i say is let us treat one another as gentlemen and strive to excel in personal courage only when we take the field  the rowdy socialdemocrat derisively shikespear  a whistle comes from the goatherd on the hill he springs up and points excitedly forward along the road to the north  the goatherd automobile automobile he rushes down the hill and joins the rest who all scramble to their feet  mendoza in ringing tones to arms who has the gun  the sulky socialdemocrat handing a rifle to mendoza here  mendoza have the nails been strewn in the road  the rowdy socialdemocrat two ahnces of em  mendoza good to the frenchman with me duval if the nails fail puncture their tires with a bullet he gives the rifle to duval who follows him up the hill mendoza produces an opera glass the others hurry across to the road and disappear to the north  mendoza on the hill using his glass two only a capitalist and his chauffeur they look english  duval angliche aoh yess cochons handling the rifle faut tire nestcepas  mendoza no the nails have gone home their tire is down they stop  duval shouting to the others fondez sur eux nom de dieu  mendoza rebuking his excitement du calme duval keep your hair on they take it quietly let us descend and receive them  mendoza descends passing behind the fire and coming forward whilst tanner and straker in their motoring goggles leather coats and caps are led in from the road by brigands  tanner is this the gentleman you describe as your boss does he speak english  the rowdy socialdemocrat course he does ydont suppowz we hinglishmen lets ahrselves be bossed by a bloomin spenniard do you  mendoza with dignity allow me to introduce myself mendoza president of the league of the sierra posing loftily i am a brigand i live by robbing the rich  tanner promptly i am a gentleman i live by robbing the poor shake hands  the english socialdemocrats hear hear  general laughter and good humor tanner and mendoza shake hands the brigands drop into their former places  straker ere where do i come in  tanner introducing my friend and chauffeur  the sulky socialdemocrat suspiciously well which is he friend or showfoor it makes all the difference you know  mendoza explaining we should expect ransom for a friend a professional chauffeur is free of the mountains he even takes a trifling percentage of his princpals ransom if he will honor us by accepting it  straker i see just to encourage me to come this way again well ill think about it  duval impulsively rushing across to straker mon frere he embraces him rapturously and kisses him on both cheeks  straker disgusted ere git out dont be silly who are you pray  duval duval socialdemocrat  straker oh youre a socialdemocrat are you  the anarchist he means that he has sold out to the parliamentary humbugs and the bourgeoisie compromise that is his faith  duval furiously i understand what he say he say bourgeois he say compromise jamais de la vie miserable menteur  straker see here captain mendoza ow much o this sort o thing do you put up with here are we avin a pleasure trip in the mountains or are we at a socialist meetin  the majority hear hear shut up chuck it sit down etc etc the socialdemocrats and the anarchist are hurtled into the background straker after superintending this proceeding with satisfaction places himself on mendozas left tanner being on his right  mendoza can we offer you anything broiled rabbit and prickly pears  tanner thank you we have dined  mendoza to his followers gentlemen business is over for the day go as you please until morning  the brigands disperse into groups lazily some go into the cave others sit down or lie down to sleep in the open a few produce a pack of cards and move off towards the road for it is now starlight and they know that motor cars have lamps which can be turned to account for lighting a card party  straker calling after them dont none of you go fooling with that car dye hear  mendoza no fear monsieur le chauffeur the first one we captured cured us of that  straker interested what did it do  mendoza it carried three brave comrades of ours who did not know how to stop it into granada and capsized them opposite the police station since then we never touch one without sending for the chauffeur shall we chat at our ease  tanner by all means  tanner mendoza and straker sit down on the turf by the fire mendoza delicately waives his presidential dignity of which the right to sit on the squared stone block is the appanage by sitting on the ground like his guests and using the stone only as a support for his back  mendoza it is the custom in spain always to put off business until tomorrow in fact you have arrived out of office hours however if you would prefer to settle the question of ransom at once i am at your service  tanner tomorrow will do for me i am rich enough to pay anything in reason  mendoza respectfully much struck by this admission you are a remarkable man sir our guests usually describe themselves as miserably poor  tanner pooh miserably poor people dont own motor cars  mendoza precisely what we say to them  tanner treat us well we shall not prove ungrateful  straker no prickly pears and broiled rabbits you know dont tell me you cant do us a bit better than that if you like  mendoza wine kids milk cheese and bread can be procured for ready money  straker graciously now youre talking  tanner are you all socialists here may i ask  mendoza repudiating this humiliating misconception oh no no no nothing of the kind i assure you we naturally have modern views as to the justice of the existing distribution of wealth otherwise we should lose our selfrespect but nothing that you could take exception to except two or three faddists  tanner i had no intention of suggesting anything discreditable in fact i am a bit of a socialist myself  straker drily most rich men are i notice  mendoza quite so it has reached us i admit it is in the air of the century  straker socialism must be looking up a bit if your chaps are taking to it  mendoza that is true sir a movement which is confined to philosophers and honest men can never exercise any real political influence there are too few of them until a movement shows itself capable of spreading among brigands it can never hope for a political majority  tanner but are your brigands any less honest than ordinary citizens  mendoza sir i will be frank with you brigandage is abnormal abnormal professions attract two classes those who are not good enough for ordinary bourgeois life and those who are too good for it we are dregs and scum sir the dregs very filthy the scum very superior  straker take care some o the dregsll hear you  mendoza it does not matter each brigand thinks himself scum and likes to hear the others called dregs  tanner come you are a wit mendoza inclines his head flattered may one ask you a blunt question  mendoza as blunt as you please  tanner how does it pay a man of your talent to shepherd such a flock as this on broiled rabbit and prickly pears i have seen men less gifted and ill swear less honest supping at the savoy on foie gras and champagne  mendoza pooh they have all had their turn at the broiled rabbit just as i shall have my turn at the savoy indeed i have had a turn there alreadyas waiter  tanner a waiter you astonish me  mendoza reflectively yes i mendoza of the sierra was a waiter hence perhaps my cosmopolitanism with sudden intensity shall i tell you the story of my life  straker apprehensively if it aint too long old chap  tanner interrupting him tshsh you are a philistine henry you have no romance in you to mendoza you interest me extremely president never mind henry he can go to sleep  mendoza the woman i loved  straker oh this is a love story is it right you are go on i was only afraid you were going to talk about yourself  mendoza myself i have thrown myself away for her sake that is why i am here no matter i count the world well lost for her she had i pledge you my word the most magnificent head of hair i ever saw she had humor she had intellect she could cook to perfection and her highly strung temperament made her uncertain incalculable variable capricious cruel in a word enchanting  straker a six shillin novel sort o woman all but the cookin er name was lady gladys plantagenet wasnt it  mendoza no sir she was not an earls daughter photography reproduced by the halftone process has made me familiar with the appearance of the daughters of the english peerage and i can honestly say that i would have sold the lot faces dowries clothes titles and all for a smile from this woman yet she was a woman of the people a worker otherwiselet me reciprocate your bluntnessi should have scorned her  tanner very properly and did she respond to your love  mendoza should i be here if she did she objected to marry a jew  tanner on religious grounds  mendoza no she was a freethinker she said that every jew considers in his heart that english people are dirty in their habits  tanner surprised dirty  mendoza it showed her extraordinary knowledge of the world for it is undoubtedly true our elaborate sanitary code makes us unduly contemptuous of the gentile  tanner did you ever hear that henry  straker ive heard my sister say so she was cook in a jewish family once  mendoza i could not deny it neither could i eradicate the impression it made on her mind i could have got round any other objection but no woman can stand a suspicion of indelicacy as to her person my entreaties were in vain she always retorted that she wasnt good enough for me and recommended me to marry an accursed barmaid named rebecca lazarus whom i loathed i talked of suicide she offered me a packet of beetle poison to do it with i hinted at murder she went into hysterics and as i am a living man i went to america so that she might sleep without dreaming that i was stealing upstairs to cut her throat in america i went out west and fell in with a man who was wanted by the police for holding up trains it was he who had the idea of holding up motors carsin the south of europe a welcome idea to a desperate and disappointed man he gave me some valuable introductions to capitalists of the right sort i formed a syndicate and the present enterprise is the result i became leader as the jew always becomes leader by his brains and imagination but with all my pride of race i would give everything i possess to be an englishman i am like a boy i cut her name on the trees and her initials on the sod when i am alone i lie down and tear my wretched hair and cry louisa  straker startled louisa  mendoza it is her namelouisalouisa straker  tanner straker  straker scrambling up on his knees most indignantly look here louisa straker is my sister see wot do you mean by gassin about her like this wot she got to do with you  mendoza a dramatic coincidence you are enry her favorite brother  straker oo are you callin enry what call have you to take a liberty with my name or with hers for two pins id punch your fat ed so i would  mendoza with grandiose calm if i let you do it will you promise to brag of it afterwards to her she will be reminded of her mendoza that is all i desire  tanner this is genuine devotion henry you should respect it  straker fiercely funk more likely  mendoza springing to his feet funk young man i come of a famous family of fighters and as your sister well knows you would have as much chance against me as a perambulator against your motor car  straker secretly daunted but rising from his knees with an air of reckless pugnacity i aint afraid of you with your louisa louisa miss straker is good enough for you i should think  mendoza i wish you could persuade her to think so  straker exasperated here  tanner rising quickly and interposing oh come henry even if you could fight the president you cant fight the whole league of the sierra sit down again and be friendly a cat may look at a king and even a president of brigands may look at your sister all this family pride is really very old fashioned  straker subdued but grumbling let him look at her but wot does he mean by makin out that she ever looked at im reluctantly resuming his couch on the turf ear him talk one ud think she was keepin company with him he turns his back on them and composes himself to sleep  mendoza to tanner becoming more confidential as he finds himself virtually alone with a sympathetic listener in the still starlight of the mountains for all the rest are asleep by this time it was just so with her sir her intellect reached forward into the twentieth century her social prejudices and family affections reached back into the dark ages ah sir how the words of shakespear seem to fit every crisis in our emotions       i loved louisa 40000 brothers      could not with all their quantity of love      make up my sum  and so on i forget the rest call it madness if you willinfatuation i am an able man a strong man in ten years i should have owned a firstclass hotel i met her and you see i am a brigand an outcast even shakespear cannot do justice to what i feel for louisa let me read you some lines that i have written about her myself however slight their literary merit may be they express what i feel better than any casual words can he produces a packet of hotel bills scrawled with manuscript and kneels at the fire to decipher them poking it with a stick to make it glow  tanner clapping him rudely on the shoulder put them in the fire president  mendoza startled eh  tanner you are sacrificing your career to a monomania  mendoza i know it  tanner no you dont no man would commit such a crime against himself if he really knew what he was doing how can you look round at these august hills look up at this divine sky taste this finely tempered air and then talk like a literary hack on a second floor in bloomsbury  mendoza shaking his head the sierra is no better than bloomsbury when once the novelty has worn off besides these mountains make you dream of womenof women with magnificent hair  tanner of louisa in short they will not make me dream of women my friend i am heartwhole  mendoza do not boast until morning sir this is a strange country for dreams  tanner well we shall see goodnight he lies down and composes himself to sleep  mendoza with a sigh follows his example and for a few moments there is peace in the sierra then mendoza sits up suddenly and says pleadingly to tanner  mendoza just allow me to read a few lines before you go to sleep i should really like your opinion of them  tanner drowsily go on i am listening  mendoza i saw thee first in whitsun week louisa louisa  tanner roaring himself my dear president louisa is a very pretty name but it really doesnt rhyme well to whitsun week  mendoza of course not louisa is not the rhyme but the refrain  tanner subsiding ah the refrain i beg your pardon go on  mendoza perhaps you do not care for that one i think you will like this better he recites in rich soft tones and to slow time       louisa i love thee      i love thee louisa      louisa louisa louisa i love thee      one name and one phrase make my music      louisa louisa louisa louisa i love thee        mendoza thy lover      thy lover mendoza      mendoza adoringly lives for louisa      theres nothing but that in the world for mendoza      louisa louisa mendoza adores thee  affected there is no merit in producing beautiful lines upon such a name louisa is an exquisite name is it not  tanner all but asleep responds with a faint groan  mendoza       o wert thou louisa      the wife of mendoza      mendozas louisa louisa mendoza      how blest were the life of louisas mendoza      how painless his longing of love for louisa  that is real poetryfrom the heartfrom the heart of hearts dont you think it will move her  no answer  resignedly asleep as usual doggrel to all the world heavenly music to me idiot that i am to wear my heart on my sleeve he composes himself to sleep murmuring louisa i love thee i love thee louisa louisa louisa louisa i  straker snores rolls over on his side and relapses into sleep stillness settles on the sierra and the darkness deepens the fire has again buried itself in white ash and ceased to glow the peaks show unfathomably dark against the starry firmament but now the stars dim and vanish and the sky seems to steal away out of the universe instead of the sierra there is nothing omnipresent nothing no sky no peaks no light no sound no time nor space utter void then somewhere the beginning of a pallor and with it a faint throbbing buzz as of a ghostly violoncello palpitating on the same note endlessly a couple of ghostly violins presently take advantage of this bass  a staff of music is supplied here  and therewith the pallor reveals a man in the void an incorporeal but visible man seated absurdly enough on nothing for a moment he raises his head as the music passes him by then with a heavy sigh he droops in utter dejection and the violins discouraged retrace their melody in despair and at last give it up extinguished by wailings from uncanny wind instruments thus  more music  it is all very odd one recognizes the mozartian strain and on this hint and by the aid of certain sparkles of violet light in the pallor the mans costume explains itself as that of a spanish nobleman of the xvxvi century don juan of course but where why how besides in the brief lifting of his face now hidden by his hat brim there was a curious suggestion of tanner a more critical fastidious handsome face paler and colder without tanners impetuous credulity and enthusiasm and without a touch of his modern plutocratic vulgarity but still a resemblance even an identity the name too don juan tenorio john tanner where on earthor elsewherehave we got to from the xx century and the sierra  another pallor in the void this time not violet but a disagreeable smoky yellow with it the whisper of a ghostly clarionet turning this tune into infinite sadness  here there is another musical staff  the yellowish pallor moves there is an old crone wandering in the void bent and toothless draped as well as one can guess in the coarse brown frock of some religious order she wanders and wanders in her slow hopeless way much as a wasp flies in its rapid busy way until she blunders against the thing she seeks companionship with a sob of relief the poor old creature clutches at the presence of the man and addresses him in her dry unlovely voice which can still express pride and resolution as well as suffering  the old woman excuse me but i am so lonely and this place is so awful  don juan a new comer  the old woman yes i suppose i died this morning i confessed i had extreme unction i was in bed with my family about me and my eyes fixed on the cross then it grew dark and when the light came back it was this light by which i walk seeing nothing i have wandered for hours in horrible loneliness  don juan sighing ah you have not yet lost the sense of time one soon does in eternity  the old woman where are we  don juan in hell  the old woman proudly hell i in hell how dare you  don juan unimpressed why not senora  the old woman you do not know to whom you are speaking i am a lady and a faithful daughter of the church  don juan i do not doubt it  the old woman but how then can i be in hell purgatory perhaps i have not been perfect who has but hell oh you are lying  don juan hell senora i assure you hell at its best that is its most solitarythough perhaps you would prefer company  the old woman but i have sincerely repented i have confessed  don juan how much  the old woman more sins than i really committed i loved confession  don juan ah that is perhaps as bad as confessing too little at all events senora whether by oversight or intention you are certainly damned like myself and there is nothing for it now but to make the best of it  the old woman indignantly oh and i might have been so much wickeder all my good deeds wasted it is unjust  don juan no you were fully and clearly warned for your bad deeds vicarious atonement mercy without justice for your good deeds justice without mercy we have many good people here  the old woman were you a good man  don juan i was a murderer  the old woman a murderer oh how dare they send me to herd with murderers i was not as bad as that i was a good woman there is some mistake where can i have it set right  don juan i do not know whether mistakes can be corrected here probably they will not admit a mistake even if they have made one  the old woman but whom can i ask  don juan i should ask the devil senora he understands the ways of this place which is more than i ever could  the old woman the devil i speak to the devil  don juan in hell senora the devil is the leader of the best society  the old woman i tell you wretch i know i am not in hell  don juan how do you know  the old woman because i feel no pain  don juan oh then there is no mistake you are intentionally damned  the old woman why do you say that  don juan because hell senora is a place for the wicked the wicked are quite comfortable in it it was made for them you tell me you feel no pain i conclude you are one of those for whom hell exists  the old woman do you feel no pain  don juan i am not one of the wicked senora therefore it bores me bores me beyond description beyond belief  the old woman not one of the wicked you said you were a murderer  don juan only a duel i ran my sword through an old man who was trying to run his through me  the old woman if you were a gentleman that was not a murder  don juan the old man called it murder because he was he said defending his daughters honor by this he meant that because i foolishly fell in love with her and told her so she screamed and he tried to assassinate me after calling me insulting names  the old woman you were like all men libertines and murderers all all all  don juan and yet we meet here dear lady  the old woman listen to me my father was slain by just such a wretch as you in just such a duel for just such a cause i screamed it was my duty my father drew on my assailant his honor demanded it he fell that was the reward of honor i am here in hell you tell me that is the reward of duty is there justice in heaven  don juan no but there is justice in hell heaven is far above such idle human personalities you will be welcome in hell senora hell is the home of honor duty justice and the rest of the seven deadly virtues all the wickedness on earth is done in their name where else but in hell should they have their reward have i not told you that the truly damned are those who are happy in hell  the old woman and are you happy here  don juan springing to his feet no and that is the enigma on which i ponder in darkness why am i here i who repudiated all duty trampled honor underfoot and laughed at justice  the old woman oh what do i care why you are here why am i here i who sacrificed all my inclinations to womanly virtue and propriety  don juan patience lady you will be perfectly happy and at home here as with the poet hell is a city much like seville  the old woman happy here where i am nothing where i am nobody  don juan not at all you are a lady and wherever ladies are is hell do not be surprised or terrified you will find everything here that a lady can desire including devils who will serve you from sheer love of servitude and magnify your importance for the sake of dignifying their servicethe best of servants  the old woman my servants will be devils  don juan have you ever had servants who were not devils  the old woman never they were devils perfect devils all of them but that is only a manner of speaking i thought you meant that my servants here would be real devils  don juan no more real devils than you will be a real lady nothing is real here that is the horror of damnation  the old woman oh this is all madness this is worse than fire and the worm  don juan for you perhaps there are consolations for instance how old were you when you changed from time to eternity  the old woman do not ask me how old i was as if i were a thing of the past i am 77  don juan a ripe age senora but in hell old age is not tolerated it is too real here we worship love and beauty our souls being entirely damned we cultivate our hearts as a lady of 77 you would not have a single acquaintance in hell  the old woman how can i help my age man  don juan you forget that you have left your age behind you in the realm of time you are no more 77 than you are 7 or 17 or 27  the old woman nonsense  don juan consider senora was not this true even when you lived on earth when you were 70 were you really older underneath your wrinkles and your grey hams than when you were 30  the old woman no younger at 30 i was a fool but of what use is it to feel younger and look older  don juan you see senora the look was only an illusion your wrinkles lied just as the plump smooth skin of many a stupid girl of 17 with heavy spirits and decrepit ideas lies about her age well here we have no bodies we see each other as bodies only because we learnt to think about one another under that aspect when we were alive and we still think in that way knowing no other but we can appear to one another at what age we choose you have but to will any of your old looks back and back they will come  the old woman it cannot be true  don juan try  the old woman seventeen  don juan stop before you decide i had better tell you that these things are a matter of fashion occasionally we have a rage for 17 but it does not last long just at present the fashionable age is 40or say 37 but there are signs of a change if you were at all goodlooking at 27 i should suggest your trying that and setting a new fashion  the old woman i do not believe a word you are saying however 27 be it whisk the old woman becomes a young one and so handsome that in the radiance into which her dull yellow halo has suddenly lightened one might almost mistake her for ann whitefield  don juan dona ana de ulloa  ana what you know me  don juan and you forget me  ana i cannot see your face he raises his hat don juan tenorio monster you who slew my father even here you pursue me  don juan i protest i do not pursue you allow me to withdraw going  ana reining his arm you shall not leave me alone in this dreadful place  don juan provided my staying be not interpreted as pursuit  ana releasing him you may well wonder how i can endure your presence my dear dear father  don juan would you like to see him  ana my father here  don juan no he is in heaven  ana i knew it my noble father he is looking down on us now what must he feel to see his daughter in this place and in conversation with his murderer  don juan by the way if we should meet him  ana how can we meet him he is in heaven  don juan he condescends to look in upon us here from time to time heaven bores him so let me warn you that if you meet him he will be mortally offended if you speak of me as his murderer he maintains that he was a much better swordsman than i and that if his foot had not slipped he would have killed me no doubt he is right i was not a good fencer i never dispute the point so we are excellent friends  ana it is no dishonor to a soldier to be proud of his skill in arms  don juan you would rather not meet him probably  ana how dare you say that  don juan oh that is the usual feeling here you may remember that on earththough of course we never confessed itthe death of anyone we knew even those we liked best was always mingled with a certain satisfaction at being finally done with them  ana monster never never  don juan placidly i see you recognize the feeling yes a funeral was always a festivity in black especially the funeral of a relative at all events family ties are rarely kept up here your father is quite accustomed to this he will not expect any devotion from you  ana wretch i wore mourning for him all my life  don juan yes it became you but a life of mourning is one thing an eternity of it quite another besides here you are as dead as he can anything be more ridiculous than one dead person mourning for another do not look shocked my dear ana and do not be alarmed there is plenty of humbug in hell indeed there is hardly anything else but the humbug of death and age and change is dropped because here we are all dead and all eternal you will pick up our ways soon  ana and will all the men call me their dear ana  don juan no that was a slip of the tongue i beg your pardon  ana almost tenderly juan did you really love me when you behaved so disgracefully to me  don juan impatiently oh i beg you not to begin talking about love here they talk of nothing else but loveits beauty its holiness its spirituality its devil knows whatexcuse me but it does so bore me they dont know what theyre talking about i do they think they have achieved the perfection of love because they have no bodies sheer imaginative debauchery faugh  ana has even death failed to refine your soul juan has the terrible judgment of which my fathers statue was the minister taught you no reverence  don juan how is that very flattering statue by the way does it still come to supper with naughty people and cast them into this bottomless pit  ana it has been a great expense to me the boys in the monastery school would not let it alone the mischievous ones broke it and the studious ones wrote their names on it three new noses in two years and fingers without end i had to leave it to its fate at last and now i fear it is shockingly mutilated my poor father  don juan hush listen two great chords rolling on syncopated waves of sound break forth d minor and its dominant a round of dreadful joy to all musicians ha mozarts statue music it is your father you had better disappear until i prepare him she vanishes  from the void comes a living statue of white marble designed to represent a majestic old man but he waives his majesty with infinite grace walks with a featherlike step and makes every wrinkle in his war worn visage brim over with holiday joyousness to his sculptor he owes a perfectly trained figure which he carries erect and trim and the ends of his moustache curl up elastic as watchsprings giving him an air which but for its spanish dignity would be called jaunty he is on the pleasantest terms with don juan his voice save for a much more distinguished intonation is so like the voice of roebuck ramsden that it calls attention to the fact that they are not unlike one another in spite of their very different fashion of shaving  don juan ah here you are my friend why dont you learn to sing the splendid music mozart has written for you  the statue unluckily he has written it for a bass voice mine is a counter tenor well have you repented yet  don juan i have too much consideration for you to repent don gonzalo if i did you would have no excuse for coming from heaven to argue with me  the statue true remain obdurate my boy i wish i had killed you as i should have done but for an accident then i should have come here and you would have had a statue and a reputation for piety to live up to any news  don juan yes your daughter is dead  the statue puzzled my daughter recollecting oh the one you were taken with let me see what was her name  don juan ana  the statue to be sure ana a goodlooking girl if i recollect aright have you warned whatshisnameher husband  don juan my friend ottavio no i have not seen him since ana arrived  ana comes indignantly to light  ana what does this mean ottavio here and your friend and you father have forgotten my name you are indeed turned to stone  the statue my dear i am so much more admired in marble than i ever was in my own person that i have retained the shape the sculptor gave me he was one of the first men of his day you must acknowledge that  ana father vanity personal vanity from you  the statue ah you outlived that weakness my daughter you must be nearly 80 by this time i was cut off by an accident in my 64th year and am considerably your junior in consequence besides my child in this place what our libertine friend here would call the farce of parental wisdom is dropped regard me i beg as a fellow creature not as a father  ana you speak as this villain speaks  the statue juan is a sound thinker ana a bad fencer but a sound thinker  ana horror creeping upon her i begin to understand these are devils mocking me i had better pray  the statue consoling her no no no my child do not pray if you do you will throw away the main advantage of this place written over the gate here are the words leave every hope behind ye who enter only think what a relief that is for what is hope a form of moral responsibility here there is no hope and consequently no duty no work nothing to be gained by praying nothing to be lost by doing what you like hell in short is a place where you have nothing to do but amuse yourself don juan sighs deeply you sigh friend juan but if you dwelt in heaven as i do you would realize your advantages  don juan you are in good spirits today commander you are positively brilliant what is the matter  the statue i have come to a momentous decision my boy but first where is our friend the devil i must consult him in the matter and ana would like to make his acquaintance no doubt  ana you are preparing some torment for me  don juan all that is superstition ana reassure yourself remember the devil is not so black as he is painted  the statue let us give him a call  at the wave of the statues hand the great chords roll out again but this time mozarts music gets grotesquely adulterated with gounods a scarlet halo begins to glow and into it the devil rises very mephistophelean and not at all unlike mendoza though not so interesting he looks older is getting prematurely bald and in spite of an effusion of goodnature and friendliness is peevish and sensitive when his advances are not reciprocated he does not inspire much confidence in his powers of hard work or endurance and is on the whole a disagreeably selfindulgent looking person but he is clever and plausible though perceptibly less well bred than the two other men and enormously less vital than the woman  the devil heartily have i the pleasure of again receiving a visit from the illustrious commander of calatrava coldly don juan your servant politely and a strange lady my respects senora  ana are you  the devil bowing lucifer at your service  ana i shall go mad  the devil gallantly ah senora do not be anxious you come to us from earth full of the prejudices and terrors of that priestridden place you have heard me ill spoken of and yet believe me i have hosts of friends there  ana yes you reign in their hearts  the devil shaking his head you flatter me senora but you are mistaken it is true that the world cannot get on without me but it never gives me credit for that in its heart it mistrusts and hates me its sympathies are all with misery with poverty with starvation of the body and of the heart i call on it to sympathize with joy with love with happiness with beauty  don juan nauseated excuse me i am going you know i cannot stand this  the devil angrily yes i know that you are no friend of mine  the statue what harm is he doing you juan it seems to me that he was talking excellent sense when you interrupted him  the devil warmly shaking the statues hand thank you my friend thank you you have always understood me he has always disparaged and avoided me  don juan i have treated you with perfect courtesy  the devil courtesy what is courtesy i care nothing for mere courtesy give me warmth of heart true sincerity the bond of sympathy with love and joy  don juan you are making me ill  the devil there appealing to the statue you hear sir oh by what irony of fate was this cold selfish egotist sent to my kingdom and you taken to the icy mansions of the sky  the statue i cant complain i was a hypocrite and it served me right to be sent to heaven  the devil why sir do you not join us and leave a sphere for which your temperament is too sympathetic your heart too warm your capacity for enjoyment too generous  the statue i have this day resolved to do so in future excellent son of the morning i am yours i have left heaven for ever  the devil again grasping his hand ah what an honor for me what a triumph for our cause thank you thank you and now my friendi may call you so at lastcould you not persuade him to take the place you have left vacant above  the statue shaking his head i cannot conscientiously recommend anybody with whom i am on friendly terms to deliberately make himself dull and uncomfortable  the devil of course not but are you sure he would be uncomfortable of course you know best you brought him here originally and we had the greatest hopes of him his sentiments were in the best taste of our best people you remember how he sang he begins to sing in a nasal operatic baritone tremulous from an eternity of misuse in the french manner       vivan le femmine      viva il buon vino  the statue taking up the tune an octave higher in his counter tenor       sostegno a gloria      dumanita  the devil precisely well he never sings for us now  don juan do you complain of that hell is full of musical amateurs music is the brandy of the damned may not one lost soul be permitted to abstain  the devil you dare blaspheme against the sublimest of the arts  don juan with cold disgust you talk like a hysterical woman fawning on a fiddler  the devil i am not angry i merely pity you you have no soul and you are unconscious of all that you lose now you senor commander are a born musician how well you sing mozart would be delighted if he were still here but he moped and went to heaven curious how these clever men whom you would have supposed born to be popular here have turned out social failures like don juan  don juan i am really very sorry to be a social failure  the devil not that we dont admire your intellect you know we do but i look at the matter from your own point of view you dont get on with us the place doesnt suit you the truth is you havei wont say no heart for we know that beneath all your affected cynicism you have a warm one  don juan shrinking dont please dont  the devil nettled well youve no capacity for enjoyment will that satisfy you  don juan it is a somewhat less insufferable form of cant than the other but if youll allow me ill take refuge as usual in solitude  the devil why not take refuge in heaven thats the proper place for you to ana come senora could you not persuade him for his own good to try a change of air  ana but can he go to heaven if he wants to  the devil whats to prevent him  ana can anybodycan i go to heaven if i want to  the devil rather contemptuously certainly if your taste lies that way  ana but why doesnt everybody go to heaven then  the statue chuckling i can tell you that my dear its because heaven is the most angelically dull place in all creation thats why  the devil his excellency the commander puts it with military bluntness but the strain of living in heaven is intolerable there is a notion that i was turned out of it but as a matter of fact nothing could have induced me to stay there i simply left it and organized this place  the statue i dont wonder at it nobody could stand an eternity of heaven  the devil oh it suits some people let us be just commander it is a question of temperament i dont admire the heavenly temperament i dont understand it i dont know that i particularly want to understand it but it takes all sorts to make a universe there is no accounting for tastes there are people who like it i think don juan would like it  don juan butpardon my franknesscould you really go back there if you desired to or are the grapes sour  the devil back there i often go back there have you never read the book of job have you any canonical authority for assuming that there is any barrier between our circle and the other one  ana but surely there is a great gulf fixed  the devil dear lady a parable must not be taken literally the gulf is the difference between the angelic and the diabolic temperament what more impassable gulf could you have think of what you have seen on earth there is no physical gulf between the philosophers class room and the bull ring but the bull fighters do not come to the class room for all that have you ever been in the country where i have the largest followingengland there they have great racecourses and also concert rooms where they play the classical compositions of his excellencys friend mozart those who go to the racecourses can stay away from them and go to the classical concerts instead if they like there is no law against it for englishmen never will be slaves they are free to do whatever the government and public opinion allows them to do and the classical concert is admitted to be a higher more cultivated poetic intellectual ennobling place than the racecourse but do the lovers of racing desert their sport and flock to the concert room not they they would suffer there all the weariness the commander has suffered in heaven there is the great gulf of the parable between the two places a mere physical gulf they could bridge or at least i could bridge it for them the earth is full of devils bridges but the gulf of dislike is impassable and eternal and that is the only gulf that separates my friends here from those who are invidiously called the blest  ana i shall go to heaven at once  the statue my child one word of warning first let me complete my friend lucifers similitude of the classical concert at every one of those concerts in england you will find rows of weary people who are there not because they really like classical music but because they think they ought to like it well there is the same thing in heaven a number of people sit there in glory not because they are happy but because they think they owe it to their position to be in heaven they are almost all english  the devil yes the southerners give it up and join me just as you have done but the english really do not seem to know when they are thoroughly miserable an englishman thinks he is moral when he is only uncomfortable  the statue in short my daughter if you go to heaven without being naturally qualified for it you will not enjoy yourself there  ana and who dares say that i am not naturally qualified for it the most distinguished princes of the church have never questioned it i owe it to myself to leave this place at once  the devil offended as you please senora i should have expected better taste from you  ana father i shall expect you to come with me you cannot stay here what will people say  the statue people why the best people are hereprinces of the church and all so few go to heaven and so many come here that the blest once called a heavenly host are a continually dwindling minority the saints the fathers the elect of long ago are the cranks the faddists the outsiders of today  the devil it is true from the beginning of my career i knew that i should win in the long run by sheer weight of public opinion in spite of the long campaign of misrepresentation and calumny against me at bottom the universe is a constitutional one and with such a majority as mine i cannot be kept permanently out of office  don juan i think ana you had better stay here  ana jealously you do not want me to go with you  don juan surely you do not want to enter heaven in the company of a reprobate like me  ana all souls are equally precious you repent do you not  don juan my dear ana you are silly do you suppose heaven is like earth where people persuade themselves that what is done can be undone by repentance that what is spoken can be unspoken by withdrawing it that what is true can be annihilated by a general agreement to give it the lie no heaven is the home of the masters of reality that is why i am going thither  ana thank you i am going to heaven for happiness i have had quite enough of reality on earth  don juan then you must stay here for hell is the home of the unreal and of the seekers for happiness it is the only refuge from heaven which is as i tell you the home of the masters of reality and from earth which is the home of the slaves of reality the earth is a nursery in which men and women play at being heros and heroines saints and sinners but they are dragged down from their fools paradise by their bodies hunger and cold and thirst age and decay and disease death above all make them slaves of reality thrice a day meals must be eaten and digested thrice a century a new generation must be engendered ages of faith of romance and of science are all driven at last to have but one prayer make me a healthy animal but here you escape the tyranny of the flesh for here you are not an animal at all you are a ghost an appearance an illusion a convention deathless ageless in a word bodiless there are no social questions here no political questions no religious questions best of all perhaps no sanitary questions here you call your appearance beauty your emotions love your sentiments heroism your aspirations virtue just as you did on earth but here there are no hard facts to contradict you no ironic contrast of your needs with your pretensions no human comedy nothing but a perpetual romance a universal melodrama as our german friend put it in his poem the poetically nonsensical here is good sense and the eternal feminine draws us ever upward and onwithout getting us a step farther and yet you want to leave this paradise  ana but if hell be so beautiful as this how glorious must heaven be  the devil the statue and don juan all begin to speak at once in violent protest then stop abashed  don juan i beg your pardon  the devil not at all i interrupted you  the statue you were going to say something  don juan after you gentlemen  the devil to don juan you have been so eloquent on the advantages of my dominions that i leave you to do equal justice to the drawbacks of the alternative establishment  don juan in heaven as i picture it dear lady you live and work instead of playing and pretending you face things as they are you escape nothing but glamor and your steadfastness and your peril are your glory if the play still goes on here and on earth and all the world is a stage heaven is at least behind the scenes but heaven cannot be described by metaphor thither i shall go presently because there i hope to escape at last from lies and from the tedious vulgar pursuit of happiness to spend my eons in contemplation  the statue ugh  don juan senor commander i do not blame your disgust a picture gallery is a dull place for a blind man but even as you enjoy the contemplation of such romantic mirages as beauty and pleasure so would i enjoy the contemplation of that which interests me above all things namely life the force that ever strives to attain greater power of contemplating itself what made this brain of mine do you think not the need to move my limbs for a rat with half my brains moves as well as i not merely the need to do but the need to know what i do lest in my blind efforts to live i should be slaying myself  the statue you would have slain yourself in your blind efforts to fence but for my foot slipping my friend  don juan audacious ribald your laughter will finish in hideous boredom before morning  the statue ha ha do you remember how i frightened you when i said something like that to you from my pedestal in seville it sounds rather flat without my trombones  don juan they tell me it generally sounds flat with them commander  ana oh do not interrupt with these frivolities father is there nothing in heaven but contemplation juan  don juan in the heaven i seek no other joy but there is the work of helping life in its struggle upward think of how it wastes and scatters itself how it raises up obstacles to itself and destroys itself in its ignorance and blindness it needs a brain this irresistible force lest in its ignorance it should resist itself what a piece of work is man says the poet yes but what a blunderer here is the highest miracle of organization yet attained by life the most intensely alive thing that exists the most conscious of all the organisms and yet how wretched are his brains stupidity made sordid and cruel by the realities learnt from toil and poverty imagination resolved to starve sooner than face these realities piling up illusions to hide them and calling itself cleverness genius and each accusing the other of its own defect stupidity accusing imagination of folly and imagination accusing stupidity of ignorance whereas alas stupidity has all the knowledge and imagination all the intelligence  the devil and a pretty kettle of fish they make of it between them did i not say when i was arranging that affair of fausts that all mans reason has done for him is to make him beastlier than any beast one splendid body is worth the brains of a hundred dyspeptic flatulent philosophers  don juan you forget that brainless magnificence of body has been tried things immeasurably greater than man in every respect but brain have existed and perished the megatherium the icthyosaurus have paced the earth with sevenleague steps and hidden the day with cloud vast wings where are they now fossils in museums and so few and imperfect at that that a knuckle bone or a tooth of one of them is prized beyond the lives of a thousand soldiers these things lived and wanted to live but for lack of brains they did not know how to carry out their purpose and so destroyed themselves  the devil and is man any the less destroying himself for all this boasted brain of his have you walked up and down upon the earth lately i have and i have examined mans wonderful inventions and i tell you that in the arts of life man invents nothing but in the arts of death he outdoes nature herself and produces by chemistry and machinery all the slaughter of plague pestilence and famine the peasant i tempt today eats and drinks what was eaten and drunk by the peasants of ten thousand years ago and the house he lives in has not altered as much in a thousand centuries as the fashion of a ladys bonnet in a score of weeks but when he goes out to slay he carries a marvel of mechanism that lets loose at the touch of his finger all the hidden molecular energies and leaves the javelin the arrow the blowpipe of his fathers far behind in the arts of peace man is a bungler i have seen his cotton factories and the like with machinery that a greedy dog could have invented if it had wanted money instead of food i know his clumsy typewriters and bungling locomotives and tedious bicycles they are toys compared to the maxim gun the submarine torpedo boat there is nothing in mans industrial machinery but his greed and sloth his heart is in his weapons this marvellous force of life of which you boast is a force of death man measures his strength by his destructiveness what is his religion an excuse for hating me what is his law an excuse for hanging you what is his morality gentility an excuse for consuming without producing what is his art an excuse for gloating over pictures of slaughter what are his politics either the worship of a despot because a despot can kill or parliamentary cockfighting i spent an evening lately in a certain celebrated legislature and heard the pot lecturing the kettle for its blackness and ministers answering questions when i left i chalked up on the door the old nursery sayingask no questions and you will be told no lies i bought a sixpenny family magazine and found it full of pictures of young men shooting and stabbing one another i saw a man die he was a london bricklayers laborer with seven children he left seventeen pounds club money and his wife spent it all on his funeral and went into the workhouse with the children next day she would not have spent sevenpence on her childrens schooling the law had to force her to let them be taught gratuitously but on death she spent all she had their imagination glows their energies rise up at the idea of death these people they love it and the more horrible it is the more they enjoy it hell is a place far above their comprehension they derive their notion of it from two of the greatest fools that ever lived an italian and an englishman the italian described it as a place of mud frost filth fire and venomous serpents all torture this ass when he was not lying about me was maundering about some woman whom he saw once in the street the englishman described me as being expelled from heaven by cannons and gunpowder and to this day every briton believes that the whole of his silly story is in the bible what else he says i do not know for it is all in a long poem which neither i nor anyone else ever succeeded in wading through it is the same in everything the highest form of literature is the tragedy a play in which everybody is murdered at the end in the old chronicles you read of earthquakes and pestilences and are told that these showed the power and majesty of god and the littleness of man nowadays the chronicles describe battles in a battle two bodies of men shoot at one another with bullets and explosive shells until one body runs away when the others chase the fugitives on horseback and cut them to pieces as they fly and this the chronicle concludes shows the greatness and majesty of empires and the littleness of the vanquished over such battles the people run about the streets yelling with delight and egg their governments on to spend hundreds of millions of money in the slaughter whilst the strongest ministers dare not spend an extra penny in the pound against the poverty and pestilence through which they themselves daily walk i could give you a thousand instances but they all come to the same thing the power that governs the earth is not the power of life but of death and the inner need that has nerved life to the effort of organizing itself into the human being is not the need for higher life but for a more efficient engine of destruction the plague the famine the earthquake the tempest were too spasmodic in their action the tiger and crocodile were too easily satiated and not cruel enough something more constantly more ruthlessly more ingeniously destructive was needed and that something was man the inventor of the rack the stake the gallows and the electrocutor of the sword and gun above all of justice duty patriotism and all the other isms by which even those who are clever enough to be humanely disposed are persuaded to become the most destructive of all the destroyers  don juan pshaw all this is old your weak side my diabolic friend is that you have always been a gull you take man at his own valuation nothing would flatter him more than your opinion of him he loves to think of himself as bold and bad he is neither one nor the other he is only a coward call him tyrant murderer pirate bully and he will adore you and swagger about with the consciousness of having the blood of the old sea kings in his veins call him liar and thief and he will only take an action against you for libel but call him coward and he will go mad with rage he will face death to outface that stinging truth man gives every reason for his conduct save one every excuse for his crimes save one every plea for his safety save one and that one is his cowardice yet all his civilization is founded on his cowardice on his abject tameness which he calls his respectability there are limits to what a mule or an ass will stand but man will suffer himself to be degraded until his vileness becomes so loathsome to his oppressors that they themselves are forced to reform it  the devil precisely and these are the creatures in whom you discover what you call a life force  don juan yes for now comes the most surprising part of the whole business  the statue whats that  don juan why that you can make any of these cowards brave by simply putting an idea into his head  the statue stuff as an old soldier i admit the cowardice its as universal as sea sickness and matters just as little but that about putting an idea into a mans head is stuff and nonsense in a battle all you need to make you fight is a little hot blood and the knowledge that its more dangerous to lose than to win  don juan that is perhaps why battles are so useless but men never really overcome fear until they imagine they are fighting to further a universal purposefighting for an idea as they call it why was the crusader braver than the pirate because he fought not for himself but for the cross what force was it that met him with a valor as reckless as his own the force of men who fought not for themselves but for islam they took spain from us though we were fighting for our very hearths and homes but when we too fought for that mighty idea a catholic church we swept them back to africa  the devil ironically what you a catholic senor don juan a devotee my congratulations  the statue seriously come come as a soldier i can listen to nothing against the church  don juan have no fear commander this idea of a catholic church will survive islam will survive the cross will survive even that vulgar pageant of incompetent schoolboyish gladiators which you call the army  the statue juan you will force me to call you to account for this  don juan useless i cannot fence every idea for which man will die will be a catholic idea when the spaniard learns at last that he is no better than the saracen and his prophet no better than mahomet he will arise more catholic than ever and die on a barricade across the filthy slum he starves in for universal liberty and equality  the statue bosh  don juan what you call bosh is the only thing men dare die for later on liberty will not be catholic enough men will die for human perfection to which they will sacrifice all their liberty gladly  the devil ay they will never be at a loss for an excuse for killing one another  don juan what of that it is not death that matters but the fear of death it is not killing and dying that degrade us but base living and accepting the wages and profits of degradation better ten dead men than one live slave or his master men shall yet rise up father against son and brother against brother and kill one another for the great catholic idea of abolishing slavery  the devil yes when the liberty and equality of which you prate shall have made free white christians cheaper in the labor market than by auction at the block  don juan never fear the white laborer shall have his turn too but i am not now defending the illusory forms the great ideas take i am giving you examples of the fact that this creature man who in his own selfish affairs is a coward to the backbone will fight for an idea like a hero he may be abject as a citizen but he is dangerous as a fanatic he can only be enslaved whilst he is spiritually weak enough to listen to reason i tell you gentlemen if you can show a man a piece of what he now calls gods work to do and what he will later on call by many new names you can make him entirely reckless of the consequences to himself personally  ana yes he shirks all his responsibilities and leaves his wife to grapple with them  the statue well said daughter do not let him talk you out of your common sense  the devil alas senor commander now that we have got on to the subject of woman he will talk more than ever however i confess it is for me the one supremely interesting subject  don juan to a woman senora mans duties and responsibilities begin and end with the task of getting bread for her children to her man is only a means to the end of getting children and rearing them  ana is that your idea of a womans mind i call it cynical and disgusting materialism  don juan pardon me ana i said nothing about a womans whole mind i spoke of her view of man as a separate sex it is no more cynical than her view of herself as above all things a mother sexually woman is natures contrivance for perpetuating its highest achievement sexually man is womans contrivance for fulfilling natures behest in the most economical way she knows by instinct that far back in the evolutional process she invented him differentiated him created him in order to produce something better than the singlesexed process can produce whilst he fulfils the purpose for which she made him he is welcome to his dreams his follies his ideals his heroisms provided that the keystone of them all is the worship of woman of motherhood of the family of the hearth but how rash and dangerous it was to invent a separate creature whose sole function was her own impregnation for mark what has happened first man has multiplied on her hands until there are as many men as women so that she has been unable to employ for her purposes more than a fraction of the immense energy she has left at his disposal by saving him the exhausting labor of gestation this superfluous energy has gone to his brain and to his muscle he has become too strong to be controlled by her bodily and too imaginative and mentally vigorous to be content with mere selfreproduction he has created civilization without consulting her taking her domestic labor for granted as the foundation of it  ana that is true at all events  the devil yes and this civilization what is it after all  don juan after all an excellent peg to hang your cynical commonplaces on but before all it is an attempt on mans part to make himself something more than the mere instrument of womans purpose so far the result of lifes continual effort not only to maintain itself but to achieve higher and higher organization and completer selfconsciousness is only at best a doubtful campaign between its forces and those of death and degeneration the battles in this campaign are mere blunders mostly won like actual military battles in spite of the commanders  the statue that is a dig at me no matter go on go on  don juan it is a dig at a much higher power than you commander still you must have noticed in your profession that even a stupid general can win battles when the enemys general is a little stupider  the statue very seriously most true juan most true some donkeys have amazing luck  don juan well the life force is stupid but it is not so stupid as the forces of death and degeneration besides these are in its pay all the time and so life wins after a fashion what mere copiousness of fecundity can supply and mere greed preserve we possess the survival of whatever form of civilization can produce the best rifle and the best fed riflemen is assured  the devil exactly the survival not of the most effective means of life but of the most effective means of death you always come back to my point in spite of your wrigglings and evasions and sophistries not to mention the intolerable length of your speeches  don juan oh come who began making long speeches however if i overtax your intellect you can leave us and seek the society of love and beauty and the rest of your favorite boredoms  the devil much offended this is not fair don juan and not civil i am also on the intellectual plane nobody can appreciate it more than i do i am arguing fairly with you and i think utterly refuting you let us go on for another hour if you like  don juan good let us  the statue not that i see any prospect of your coming to any point in particular juan still since in this place instead of merely killing time we have to kill eternity go ahead by all means  don juan somewhat impatiently my point you marbleheaded old masterpiece is only a step ahead of you are we agreed that life is a force which has made innumerable experiments in organizing itself that the mammoth and the man the mouse and the megatherium the flies and the fleas and the fathers of the church are all more or less successful attempts to build up that raw force into higher and higher individuals the ideal individual being omnipotent omniscient infallible and withal completely unilludedly selfconscious in short a god  the devil i agree for the sake of argument  the statue i agree for the sake of avoiding argument  ana i most emphatically disagree as regards the fathers of the church and i must beg you not to drag them into the argument  don juan i did so purely for the sake of alliteration ana and i shall make no further allusion to them and now since we are with that exception agreed so far will you not agree with me further that life has not measured the success of its attempts at godhead by the beauty or bodily perfection of the result since in both these respects the birds as our friend aristophanes long ago pointed out are so extraordinarily superior with their power of flight and their lovely plumage and may i add the touching poetry of their loves and nestings that it is inconceivable that life having once produced them should if love and beauty were her object start off on another line and labor at the clumsy elephant and the hideous ape whose grandchildren we are  ana aristophanes was a heathen and you juan i am afraid are very little better  the devil you conclude then that life was driving at clumsiness and ugliness  don juan no perverse devil that you are a thousand times no life was driving at brainsat its darling object an organ by which it can attain not only selfconsciousness but selfunderstanding  the statue this is metaphysics juan why the devil shouldto the devil i beg your pardon  the devil pray dont mention it i have always regarded the use of my name to secure additional emphasis as a high compliment to me it is quite at your service commander  the statue thank you thats very good of you even in heaven i never quite got out of my old military habits of speech what i was going to ask juan was why life should bother itself about getting a brain why should it want to understand itself why not be content to enjoy itself  don juan without a brain commander you would enjoy yourself without knowing it and so lose all the fun  the statue true most true but i am quite content with brain enough to know that im enjoying myself i dont want to understand why in fact id rather not my experience is that ones pleasures dont bear thinking about  don juan that is why intellect is so unpopular but to life the force behind the man intellect is a necessity because without it he blunders into death just as life after ages of struggle evolved that wonderful bodily organ the eye so that the living organism could see where it was going and what was coming to help or threaten it and thus avoid a thousand dangers that formerly slew it so it is evolving today a minds eye that shall see not the physical world but the purpose of life and thereby enable the individual to work for that purpose instead of thwarting and baffling it by setting up shortsighted personal aims as at present even as it is only one sort of man has ever been happy has ever been universally respected among all the conflicts of interests and illusions  the statue you mean the military man  don juan commander i do not mean the military man when the military man approaches the world locks up its spoons and packs off its womankind no i sing not arms and the hero but the philosophic man he who seeks in contemplation to discover the inner will of the world in invention to discover the means of fulfilling that will and in action to do that will by the sodiscovered means of all other sorts of men i declare myself tired theyre tedious failures when i was on earth professors of all sorts prowled round me feeling for an unhealthy spot in me on which they could fasten the doctors of medicine bade me consider what i must do to save my body and offered me quack cures for imaginary diseases i replied that i was not a hypochondriac so they called me ignoramus and went their way the doctors of divinity bade me consider what i must do to save my soul but i was not a spiritual hypochondriac any more than a bodily one and would not trouble myself about that either so they called me atheist and went their way after them came the politician who said there was only one purpose in nature and that was to get him into parliament i told him i did not care whether he got into parliament or not so he called me mugwump and went his way then came the romantic man the artist with his love songs and his paintings and his poems and with him i had great delight for many years and some profit for i cultivated my senses for his sake and his songs taught me to hear better his paintings to see better and his poems to feel more deeply but he led me at last into the worship of woman  ana juan  don juan yes i came to believe that in her voice was all the music of the song in her face all the beauty of the painting and in her soul all the emotion of the poem  ana and you were disappointed i suppose well was it her fault that you attributed all these perfections to her  don juan yes partly for with a wonderful instinctive cunning she kept silent and allowed me to glorify her to mistake my own visions thoughts and feelings for hers now my friend the romantic man was often too poor or too timid to approach those women who were beautiful or refined enough to seem to realize his ideal and so he went to his grave believing in his dream but i was more favored by nature and circumstance i was of noble birth and rich and when my person did not please my conversation flattered though i generally found myself fortunate in both  the statue coxcomb  don juan yes but even my coxcombry pleased well i found that when i had touched a womans imagination she would allow me to persuade myself that she loved me but when my suit was granted she never said i am happy my love is satisfied she always said first at last the barriers are down and second when will you come again  ana that is exactly what men say  don juan i protest i never said it but all women say it well these two speeches always alarmed me for the first meant that the ladys impulse had been solely to throw down my fortifications and gain my citadel and the second openly announced that henceforth she regarded me as her property and counted my time as already wholly at her disposal  the devil that is where your want of heart came in  the statue shaking his head you shouldnt repeat what a woman says juan  ana severely it should be sacred to you  the statue still they certainly do always say it i never minded the barriers but there was always a slight shock about the other unless one was very hard hit indeed  don juan then the lady who had been happy and idle enough before became anxious preoccupied with me always intriguing conspiring pursuing watching waiting bent wholly on making sure of her preyi being the prey you understand now this was not what i had bargained for it may have been very proper and very natural but it was not music painting poetry and joy incarnated in a beautiful woman i ran away from it i ran away from it very often in fact i became famous for running away from it  ana infamous you mean  don juan i did not run away from you do you blame me for running away from the others  ana nonsense man you are talking to a woman of 77 now if you had had the chance you would have run away from me tooif i had let you you would not have found it so easy with me as with some of the others if men will not be faithful to their home and their duties they must be made to be i daresay you all want to marry lovely incarnations of music and painting and poetry well you cant have them because they dont exist if flesh and blood is not good enough for you you must go without thats all women have to put up with fleshandblood husbandsand little enough of that too sometimes and you will have to put up with fleshandblood wives the devil looks dubious the statue makes a wry face i see you dont like that any of you but its true for all that so if you dont like it you can lump it  don juan my dear lady you have put my whole case against romance into a few sentences that is just why i turned my back on the romantic man with the artist nature as he called his infatuation i thanked him for teaching me to use my eyes and ears but i told him that his beauty worshipping and happiness hunting and woman idealizing was not worth a dump as a philosophy of life so he called me philistine and went his way  ana it seems that woman taught you something too with all her defects  don juan she did more she interpreted all the other teaching for me ah my friends when the barriers were down for the first time what an astounding illumination i had been prepared for infatuation for intoxication for all the illusions of loves young dream and lo never was my perception clearer nor my criticism more ruthless the most jealous rival of my mistress never saw every blemish in her more keenly than i i was not duped i took her without chloroform  ana but you did take her  don juan that was the revelation up to that moment i had never lost the sense of being my own master never consciously taken a single step until my reason had examined and approved it i had come to believe that i was a purely rational creature a thinker i said with the foolish philosopher i think therefore i am it was woman who taught me to say i am therefore i think and also i would think more therefore i must be more  the statue this is extremely abstract and metaphysical juan if you would stick to the concrete and put your discoveries in the form of entertaining anecdotes about your adventures with women your conversation would be easier to follow  don juan bah what need i add do you not understand that when i stood face to face with woman every fibre in my clear critical brain warned me to spare her and save myself my morals said no my conscience said no my chivalry and pity for her said no my prudent regard for myself said no my ear practised on a thousand songs and symphonies my eye exercised on a thousand paintings tore her voice her features her color to shreds i caught all those telltale resemblances to her father and mother by which i knew what she would be like in thirty years time i noted the gleam of gold from a dead tooth in the laughing mouth i made curious observations of the strange odors of the chemistry of the nerves the visions of my romantic reveries in which i had trod the plains of heaven with a deathless ageless creature of coral and ivory deserted me in that supreme hour i remembered them and desperately strove to recover their illusion but they now seemed the emptiest of inventions my judgment was not to be corrupted my brain still said no on every issue and whilst i was in the act of framing my excuse to the lady life seized me and threw me into her arms as a sailor throws a scrap of fish into the mouth of a seabird  the statue you might as well have gone without thinking such a lot about it juan you are like all the clever men you have more brains than is good for you  the devil and were you not the happier for the experience senor don juan  don juan the happier no the wiser yes that moment introduced me for the first time to myself and through myself to the world i saw then how useless it is to attempt to impose conditions on the irresistible force of life to preach prudence careful selection virtue honor chastity  ana don juan a word against chastity is an insult to me  don juan i say nothing against your chastity senora since it took the form of a husband and twelve children what more could you have done had you been the most abandoned of women  ana i could have had twelve husbands and no children thats what i could have done juan and let me tell you that that would have made all the difference to the earth which i replenished  the statue bravo ana juan you are floored quelled annihilated  don juan no for though that difference is the true essential differencedona ana has i admit gone straight to the real pointyet it is not a difference of love or chastity or even constancy for twelve children by twelve different husbands would have replenished the earth perhaps more effectively suppose my friend ottavio had died when you were thirty you would never have remained a widow you were too beautiful suppose the successor of ottavio had died when you were forty you would still have been irresistible and a woman who marries twice marries three times if she becomes free to do so twelve lawful children borne by one highly respectable lady to three different fathers is not impossible nor condemned by public opinion that such a lady may be more law abiding than the poor girl whom we used to spurn into the gutter for bearing one unlawful infant is no doubt true but dare you say she is less selfindulgent  ana she is less virtuous that is enough for me  don juan in that case what is virtue but the trade unionism of the married let us face the facts dear ana the life force respects marriage only because marriage is a contrivance of its own to secure the greatest number of children and the closest care of them for honor chastity and all the rest of your moral figments it cares not a rap marriage is the most licentious of human institutions  ana juan  the statue protesting really  don juan determinedly i say the most licentious of human institutions that is the secret of its popularity and a woman seeking a husband is the most unscrupulous of all the beasts of prey the confusion of marriage with morality has done more to destroy the conscience of the human race than any other single error come ana do not look shocked you know better than any of us that marriage is a mantrap baited with simulated accomplishments and delusive idealizations when your sainted mother by dint of scoldings and punishments forced you to learn how to play half a dozen pieces on the spinet which she hated as much as you didhad she any other purpose than to delude your suitors into the belief that your husband would have in his home an angel who would fill it with melody or at least play him to sleep after dinner you married my friend ottavio well did you ever open the spinet from the hour when the church united him to you  ana you are a fool juan a young married woman has something else to do than sit at the spinet without any support for her back so she gets out of the habit of playing  don juan not if she loves music no believe me she only throws away the bait when the bird is in the net  ana bitterly and men i suppose never throw off the mask when their bird is in the net the husband never becomes negligent selfish brutaloh never  don juan what do these recriminations prove ana only that the hero is as gross an imposture as the heroine  ana it is all nonsense most marriages are perfectly comfortable  don juan perfectly is a strong expression ana what you mean is that sensible people make the best of one another send me to the galleys and chain me to the felon whose number happens to be next before mine and i must accept the inevitable and make the best of the companionship many such companionships they tell me are touchingly affectionate and most are at least tolerably friendly but that does not make a chain a desirable ornament nor the galleys an abode of bliss those who talk most about the blessings of marriage and the constancy of its vows are the very people who declare that if the chain were broken and the prisoners left free to choose the whole social fabric would fly asunder you cannot have the argument both ways if the prisoner is happy why lock him in if he is not why pretend that he is  ana at all events let me take an old womans privilege again and tell you flatly that marriage peoples the world and debauchery does not  don juan how if a time comes when this shall cease to be true do you not know that where there is a will there is a waythat whatever man really wishes to do he will finally discover a means of doing well you have done your best you virtuous ladies and others of your way of thinking to bend mans mind wholly towards honorable love as the highest good and to understand by honorable love romance and beauty and happiness in the possession of beautiful refined delicate affectionate women you have taught women to value their own youth health shapeliness and refinement above all things well what place have squalling babies and household cares in this exquisite paradise of the senses and emotions is it not the inevitable end of it all that the human will shall say to the human brain invent me a means by which i can have love beauty romance emotion passion without their wretched penalties their expenses their worries their trials their illnesses and agonies and risks of death their retinue of servants and nurses and doctors and schoolmasters  the devil all this senor don juan is realized here in my realm  don juan yes at the cost of death man will not take it at that price he demands the romantic delights of your hell whilst he is still on earth well the means will be found the brain will not fail when the will is in earnest the day is coming when great nations will find their numbers dwindling from census to census when the six roomed villa will rise in price above the family mansion when the viciously reckless poor and the stupidly pious rich will delay the extinction of the race only by degrading it whilst the boldly prudent the thriftily selfish and ambitious the imaginative and poetic the lovers of money and solid comfort the worshippers of success art and of love will all oppose to the force of life the device of sterility  the statue that is all very eloquent my young friend but if you had lived to anas age or even to mine you would have learned that the people who get rid of the fear of poverty and children and all the other family troubles and devote themselves to having a good time of it only leave their minds free for the fear of old age and ugliness and impotence and death the childless laborer is more tormented by his wifes idleness and her constant demands for amusement and distraction than he could be by twenty children and his wife is more wretched than he i have had my share of vanity for as a young man i was admired by women and as a statue i am praised by art critics but i confess that had i found nothing to do in the world but wallow in these delights i should have cut my throat when i married anas motheror perhaps to be strictly correct i should rather say when i at last gave in and allowed anas mother to marry mei knew that i was planting thorns in my pillow and that marriage for me a swaggering young officer thitherto unvanquished meant defeat and capture  ana scandalized father  the statue i am sorry to shock you my love but since juan has stripped every rag of decency from the discussion i may as well tell the frozen truth  ana hmf i suppose i was one of the thorns  the statue by no means you were often a rose you see your mother had most of the trouble you gave  don juan then may i ask commander why you have left heaven to come here and wallow as you express it in sentimental beatitudes which you confess would once have driven you to cut your throat  the statue struck by this egad thats true  the devil alarmed what you are going back from your word to don juan and all your philosophizing has been nothing but a mask for proselytizing to the statue have you forgotten already the hideous dulness from which i am offering you a refuge here to don juan and does your demonstration of the approaching sterilization and extinction of mankind lead to anything better than making the most of those pleasures of art and love which you yourself admit refined you elevated you developed you  don juan i never demonstrated the extinction of mankind life cannot will its own extinction either in its blind amorphous state or in any of the forms into which it has organized itself i had not finished when his excellency interrupted me  the statue i begin to doubt whether you ever will finish my friend you are extremely fond of hearing yourself talk  don juan true but since you have endured so much you may as well endure to the end long before this sterilization which i described becomes more than a clearly foreseen possibility the reaction will begin the great central purpose of breeding the race ay breeding it to heights now deemed superhuman that purpose which is now hidden in a mephitic cloud of love and romance and prudery and fastidiousness will break through into clear sunlight as a purpose no longer to be confused with the gratification of personal fancies the impossible realization of boys and girls dreams of bliss or the need of older people for companionship or money the plainspoken marriage services of the vernacular churches will no longer be abbreviated and half suppressed as indelicate the sober decency earnestness and authority of their declaration of the real purpose of marriage will be honored and accepted whilst their romantic vowings and pledgings and untildeathdouspartings and the like will be expunged as unbearable frivolities do my sex the justice to admit senora that we have always recognized that the sex relation is not a personal or friendly relation at all  ana not a personal or friendly relation what relation is more personal more sacred more holy  don juan sacred and holy if you like ana but not personally friendly your relation to god is sacred and holy dare you call it personally friendly in the sex relation the universal creative energy of which the parties are both the helpless agents overrides and sweeps away all personal considerations and dispenses with all personal relations the pair may be utter strangers to one another speaking different languages differing in race and color in age and disposition with no bond between them but a possibility of that fecundity for the sake of which the life force throws them into one anothers arms at the exchange of a glance do we not recognize this by allowing marriages to be made by parents without consulting the woman have you not often expressed your disgust at the immorality of the english nation in which women and men of noble birth become acquainted and court each other like peasants and how much does even the peasant know of his bride or she of him before he engages himself why you would not make a man your lawyer or your family doctor on so slight an acquaintance as you would fall in love with and marry him  ana yes juan we know the libertines philosophy always ignore the consequences to the woman  don juan the consequences yes they justify her fierce grip of the man but surely you do not call that attachment a sentimental one as well call the policemans attachment to his prisoner a love relation  ana you see you have to confess that marriage is necessary though according to you love is the slightest of all the relations  don juan how do you know that it is not the greatest of all the relations far too great to be a personal matter could your father have served his country if he had refused to kill any enemy of spain unless he personally hated him can a woman serve her country if she refuses to marry any man she does not personally love you know it is not so the woman of noble birth marries as the man of noble birth fights on political and family grounds not on personal ones  the statue impressed a very clever point that juan i must think it over you are really full of ideas how did you come to think of this one  don juan i learnt it by experience when i was on earth and made those proposals to ladies which though universally condemned have made me so interesting a hero of legend i was not infrequently met in some such way as this the lady would say that she would countenance my advances provided they were honorable on inquiring what that proviso meant i found that it meant that i proposed to get possession of her property if she had any or to undertake her support for life if she had not that i desired her continual companionship counsel and conversation to the end of my days and would bind myself under penalties to be always enraptured by them and above all that i would turn my back on all other women for ever for her sake i did not object to these conditions because they were exorbitant and inhuman it was their extraordinary irrelevance that prostrated me i invariably replied with perfect frankness that i had never dreamt of any of these things that unless the ladys character and intellect were equal or superior to my own her conversation must degrade and her counsel mislead me tha t her constant companionship might for all i knew become intolerably tedious to me that i could not answer for my feelings for a week in advance much less to the end of my life that to cut me off from all natural and unconstrained relations with the rest of my fellow creatures would narrow and warp me if i submitted to it and if not would bring me under the curse of clandestinity that finally my proposals to her were wholly unconnected with any of these matters and were the outcome of a perfectly simple impulse of my manhood towards her womanhood  ana you mean that it was an immoral impulse  don juan nature my dear lady is what you call immoral i blush for it but i cannot help it nature is a pandar time a wrecker and death a murderer i have always preferred to stand up to those facts and build institutions on their recognition you prefer to propitiate the three devils by proclaiming their chastity their thrift and their loving kindness and to base your institutions on these flatteries is it any wonder that the institutions do not work smoothly  the statue what used the ladies to say juan  don juan oh come confidence for confidence first tell me what you used to say to the ladies  the statue i oh i swore that i would be faithful to the death that i should die if they refused me that no woman could ever be to me what she was  ana she who  the statue whoever it happened to be at the time my dear i had certain things i always said one of them was that even when i was eighty one white hair of the woman i loved would make me tremble more than the thickest gold tress from the most beautiful young head another was that i could not bear the thought of anyone else being the mother of my children  don juan revolted you old rascal  the statue stoutly not a bit for i really believed it with all my soul at the moment i had a heart not like you and it was this sincerity that made me successful  don juan sincerity to be fool enough to believe a ramping stamping thumping lie that is what you call sincerity to be so greedy for a woman that you deceive yourself in your eagerness to deceive her sincerity you call it  the statue oh damn your sophistries i was a man in love not a lawyer and the women loved me for it bless them  don juan they made you think so what will you say when i tell you that though i played the lawyer so callously they made me think so too i also had my moments of infatuation in which i gushed nonsense and believed it sometimes the desire to give pleasure by saying beautiful things so rose in me on the flood of emotion that i said them recklessly at other times i argued against myself with a devilish coldness that drew tears but i found it just as hard to escape in the one case as in the others when the ladys instinct was set on me there was nothing for it but lifelong servitude or flight  ana you dare boast before me and my father that every woman found you irresistible  don juan am i boasting it seems to me that i cut the most pitiable of figures besides i said when the ladys instinct was set on me it was not always so and then heavens what transports of virtuous indignation what overwhelming defiance to the dastardly seducer what scenes of imogen and iachimo  ana i made no scenes i simply called my father  don juan and he came sword in hand to vindicate outraged honor and morality by murdering me  the statue murdering what do you mean did i kill you or did you kill me  don juan which of us was the better fencer  the statue i was  don juan of course you were and yet you the hero of those scandalous adventures you have just been relating to us you had the effrontery to pose as the avenger of outraged morality and condemn me to death you would have slain me but for an accident  the statue i was expected to juan that is how things were arranged on earth i was not a social reformer and i always did what it was customary for a gentleman to do  don juan that may account for your attacking me but not for the revolting hypocrisy of your subsequent proceedings as a statue  the statue that all came of my going to heaven  the devil i still fail to see senor don juan that these episodes in your earthly career and in that of the senor commander in any way discredit my view of life here i repeat you have all that you sought without anything that you shrank from  don juan on the contrary here i have everything that disappointed me without anything that i have not already tried and found wanting i tell you that as long as i can conceive something better than myself i cannot be easy unless i am striving to bring it into existence or clearing the way for it that is the law of my life that is the working within me of lifes incessant aspiration to higher organization wider deeper intenser selfconsciousness and clearer selfunderstanding it was the supremacy of this purpose that reduced love for me to the mere pleasure of a moment art for me to the mere schooling of my faculties religion for me to a mere excuse for laziness since it had set up a god who looked at the world and saw that it was good against the instinct in me that looked through my eyes at the world and saw that it could be improved i tell you that in the pursuit of my own pleasure my own health my own fortune i have never known happiness it was not love for woman that delivered me into her hands it was fatigue exhaustion when i was a child and bruised my head against a stone i ran to the nearest woman and cried away my pain against her apron when i grew up and bruised my soul against the brutalities and stupidities with which i had to strive i did again just what i had done as a child i have enjoyed too my rests my recuperations my breathing times my very prostrations after strife but rather would i be dragged through all the circles of the foolish italians inferno than through the pleasures of europe that is what has made this place of eternal pleasures so deadly to me it is the absence of this instinct in you that makes you that strange monster called a devil it is the success with which you have diverted the attention of men from their real purpose which in one degree or another is the same as mine to yours that has earned you the name of the tempter it is the fact that they are doing your will or rather drifting with your want of will instead of doing their own that makes them the uncomfortable false restless artificial petulant wretched creatures they are  the devil mortified senor don juan you are uncivil to my friends  don juan pooh why should i be civil to them or to you in this palace of lies a truth or two will not hurt you your friends are all the dullest dogs i know they are not beautiful they are only decorated they are not clean they are only shaved and starched they are not dignified they are only fashionably dressed they are not educated they are only college passmen they are not religious they are only pewrenters they are not moral they are only conventional they are not virtuous they are only cowardly they are not even vicious they are only frail they are not artistic they are only lascivious they are not prosperous they are only rich they are not loyal they are only servile not dutiful only sheepish not public spirited only patriotic not courageous only quarrelsome not determined only obstinate not masterful only domineering not selfcontrolled only obtuse not selfrespecting only vain not kind only sentimental not social only gregarious not considerate only polite not intelligent only opinionated not progressive only factious not imaginative only superstitious not just only vindictive not generous only propitiatory not disciplined only cowed and not truthful at allliars every one of them to the very backbone of their souls  the statue your flow of words is simply amazing juan how i wish i could have talked like that to my soldiers  the devil it is mere talk though it has all been said before but what change has it ever made what notice has the world ever taken of it  don juan yes it is mere talk but why is it mere talk because my friend beauty purity respectability religion morality art patriotism bravery and the rest are nothing but words which i or anyone else can turn inside out like a glove were they realities you would have to plead guilty to my indictment but fortunately for your selfrespect my diabolical friend they are not realities as you say they are mere words useful for duping barbarians into adopting civilization or the civilized poor into submitting to be robbed and enslaved that is the family secret of the governing caste and if we who are of that caste aimed at more life for the world instead of at more power and luxury for our miserable selves that secret would make us great now since i being a nobleman am in the secret too think how tedious to me must be your unending cant about all these moralistic figments and how squalidly disastrous your sacrifice of your lives to them if you even believed in your moral game enough to play it fairly it would be interesting to watch but you dont you cheat at every trick and if your opponent outcheats you you upset the table and try to murder him  the devil on earth there may be some truth in this because the people are uneducated and cannot appreciate my religion of love and beauty but here  don juan oh yes i know here there is nothing but love and beauty ugh it is like sitting for all eternity at the first act of a fashionable play before the complications begin never in my worst moments of superstitious terror on earth did i dream that hell was so horrible i live like a hairdresser in the continual contemplation of beauty toying with silken tresses i breathe an atmosphere of sweetness like a confectioners shopboy commander are there any beautiful women in heaven  the statue none absolutely none all dowdies not two pennorth of jewellery among a dozen of them they might be men of fifty  don juan i am impatient to get there is the word beauty ever mentioned and are there any artistic people  the statue i give you my word they wont admire a fine statue even when it walks past them  don juan i go  the devil don juan shall i be frank with you  don juan were you not so before  the devil as far as i went yes but i will now go further and confess to you that men get tired of everything of heaven no less than of hell and that all history is nothing but a record of the oscillations of the world between these two extremes an epoch is but a swing of the pendulum and each generation thinks the world is progressing because it is always moving but when you are as old as i am when you have a thousand times wearied of heaven like myself and the commander and a thousand times wearied of hell as you are wearied now you will no longer imagine that every swing from heaven to hell is an emancipation every swing from hell to heaven an evolution where you now see reform progress fulfilment of upward tendency continual ascent by man on the stepping stones of his dead selves to higher things you will see nothing but an infinite comedy of illusion you will discover the profound truth of the saying of my friend koheleth that there is nothing new under the sun vanitas vanitatum  don juan out of all patience by heaven this is worse than your cant about love and beauty clever dolt that you are is a man no better than a worm or a dog than a wolf because he gets tired of everything shall he give up eating because he destroys his appetite in the act of gratifying it is a field idle when it is fallow can the commander expend his hellish energy here without accumulating heavenly energy for his next term of blessedness granted that the great life force has hit on the device of the clockmakers pendulum and uses the earth for its bob that the history of each oscillation which seems so novel to us the actors is but the history of the last oscillation repeated nay more that in the unthinkable infinitude of time the sun throws off the earth and catches it again a thousand times as a circus rider throws up a ball and that the total of all our epochs is but the moment between the toss and the catch has the colossal mechanism no purpose  the devil none my friend you think because you have a purpose nature must have one you might as well expect it to have fingers and toes because you have them  don juan but i should not have them if they served no purpose and i my friend am as much a part of nature as my own finger is a part of me if my finger is the organ by which i grasp the sword and the mandoline my brain is the organ by which nature strives to understand itself my dogs brain serves only my dogs purposes but my brain labors at a knowledge which does nothing for me personally but make my body bitter to me and my decay and death a calamity were i not possessed with a purpose beyond my own i had better be a ploughman than a philosopher for the ploughman lives as long as the philosopher eats more sleeps better and rejoices in the wife of his bosom with less misgiving this is because the philosopher is in the grip of the life force this life force says to him i have done a thousand wonderful things unconsciously by merely willing to live and following the line of least resistance now i want to know myself and my destination and choose my path so i have made a special braina philosophers brainto grasp this knowledge for me as the husbandmans hand grasps the plough for me and this says the life force to the philosopher must thou strive to do for me until thou diest when i will make another brain and another philosopher to carry on the work  the devil what is the use of knowing  don juan why to be able to choose the line of greatest advantage instead of yielding in the direction of the least resistance does a ship sail to its destination no better than a log drifts nowhither the philosopher is natures pilot and there you have our difference to be in hell is to drift to be in heaven is to steer  the devil on the rocks most likely  don juan pooh which ship goes oftenest on the rocks or to the bottomthe drifting ship or the ship with a pilot on board  the devil well well go your way senor don juan i prefer to be my own master and not the tool of any blundering universal force i know that beauty is good to look at that music is good to hear that love is good to feel and that they are all good to think about and talk about i know that to be well exercised in these sensations emotions and studies is to be a refined and cultivated being whatever they may say of me in churches on earth i know that it is universally admitted in good society that the prince of darkness is a gentleman and that is enough for me as to your life force which you think irresistible it is the most resistible thing in the world for a person of any character but if you are naturally vulgar and credulous as all reformers are it will thrust you first into religion where you will sprinkle water on babies to save their souls from me then it will drive you from religion into science where you will snatch the babies from the water sprinkling and inoculate them with disease to save them from catching it accidentally then you will take to politics where you will become the catspaw of corrupt functionaries and the henchman of ambitious humbugs and the end will be despair and decrepitude broken nerve and shattered hopes vain regrets for that worst and silliest of wastes and sacrifices the waste and sacrifice of the power of enjoyment in a word the punishment of the fool who pursues the better before he has secured the good  don juan but at least i shall not be bored the service of the life force has that advantage at all events so fare you well senor satan  the devil amiably fare you well don juan i shall often think of our interesting chats about things in general i wish you every happiness heaven as i said before suits some people but if you should change your mind do not forget that the gates are always open here to the repentant prodigal if you feel at any time that warmth of heart sincere unforced affection innocent enjoyment and warm breathing palpitating reality  don juan why not say flesh and blood at once though we have left those two greasy commonplaces behind us  the devil angrily you throw my friendly farewell back in my teeth then don juan  don juan by no means but though there is much to be learnt from a cynical devil i really cannot stand a sentimental one senor commander you know the way to the frontier of hell and heaven be good enough to direct me  the statue oh the frontier is only the difference between two ways of looking at things any road will take you across it if you really want to get there  don juan good saluting dona ana senora your servant  ana but i am going with you  don juan i can find my own way to heaven ana but i cannot find yours he vanishes  ana how annoying  the statue calling after him bon voyage juan he wafts a final blast of his great rolling chords after him as a parting salute a faint echo of the first ghostly melody comes back in acknowledgment ah there he goes puffing a long breath out through his lips whew how he does talk theyll never stand it in heaven  the devil gloomily his going is a political defeat i cannot keep these life worshippers they all go this is the greatest loss i have had since that dutch painter wenta fellow who would paint a hag of 70 with as much enjoyment as a venus of 20  the statue i remember he came to heaven rembrandt  the devil ay rembrandt there a something unnatural about these fellows do not listen to their gospel senor commander it is dangerous beware of the pursuit of the superhuman it leads to an indiscriminate contempt for the human to a man horses and dogs and cats are mere species outside the moral world well to the superman men and women are a mere species too also outside the moral world this don juan was kind to women and courteous to men as your daughter here was kind to her pet cats and dogs but such kindness is a denial of the exclusively human character of the soul  the statue and who the deuce is the superman  the devil oh the latest fashion among the life force fanatics did you not meet in heaven among the new arrivals that german polish madmanwhat was his name nietzsche  the statue never heard of him  the devil well he came here first before he recovered his wits i had some hopes of him but he was a confirmed life force worshipper it was he who raked up the superman who is as old as prometheus and the 20th century will run after this newest of the old crazes when it gets tired of the world the flesh and your humble servant  the statue superman is a good cry and a good cry is half the battle i should like to see this nietzsche  the devil unfortunately he met wagner here and had a quarrel with him  the statue quite right too mozart for me  the devil oh it was not about music wagner once drifted into life force worship and invented a superman called siegfried but he came to his senses afterwards so when they met here nietzsche denounced him as a renegade and wagner wrote a pamphlet to prove that nietzsche was a jew and it ended in nietzsches going to heaven in a huff and a good riddance too and now my friend let us hasten to my palace and celebrate your arrival with a grand musical service  the statue with pleasure youre most kind  the devil this way commander we go down the old trap he places himself on the grave trap  the statue good reflectively all the same the superman is a fine conception there is something statuesque about it he places himself on the grave trap beside the devil it begins to descend slowly red glow from the abyss ah this reminds me of old times  the devil and me also  ana stop the trap stops  the devil you senora cannot come this way you will have an apotheosis but you will be at the palace before us  ana that is not what i stopped you for tell me where can i find the superman  the devil he is not yet created senora  the statue and never will be probably let us proceed the red fire will make me sneeze they descend  ana not yet created then my work is not yet done crossing herself devoutly i believe in the life to come crying to the universe a fathera father for the superman  she vanishes into the void and again there is nothing all existence seems suspended infinitely then vaguely there is a live human voice crying somewhere one sees with a shock a mountain peak showing faintly against a lighter background the sky has returned from afar and we suddenly remember where we were the cry becomes distinct and urgent it says automobile automobile the complete reality comes back with a rush in a moment it is full morning in the sierra and the brigands are scrambling to their feet and making for the road as the goatherd runs down from the hill warning them of the approach of another motor tanner and mendoza rise amazedly and stare at one another with scattered wits straker sits up to yawn for a moment before he gets on his feet making it a point of honor not to show any undue interest in the excitement of the bandits mendoza gives a quick look to see that his followers are attending to the alarm then exchanges a private word with tanner  mendoza did you dream  tanner damnably did you  mendoza yes i forget what you were in it  tanner so were you amazing  mendoza i warned you a shot is heard from the road dolts they will play with that gun the brigands come running back scared who fired that shot to duval was it you  duval breathless i have not shoot dey shoot first  anarchist i told you to begin by abolishing the state now we are all lost  the rowdy socialdemocrat stampeding across the amphitheatre run everybody  mendoza collaring him throwing him on his back and drawing a knife i stab the man who stirs he blocks the way the stampede it checked what has happened  the sulky socialdemocrat a motor  the anarchist three men  duval deux femmes  mendoza three men and two women why have you not brought them here are you afraid of them  the rowdy one getting up thyve a hescort ow deooh luts ook it mendowza  the sulky one two armored cars full o soldiers at the end o the valley  anarchist the shot was fired in the air it was a signal  straker whistles his favorite air which falls on the ears of the brigands like a funeral march  tanner it is not an escort but an expedition to capture you we were advised to wait for it but i was in a hurry  the rowdy one in an agony of apprehension and ow my good lord ere we are wytin for em luts tike to the mahntns  mendoza idiot what do you know about the mountains are you a spaniard you would be given up by the first shepherd you met besides we are already within range of their rifles  the rowdy one bat  mendoza silence leave this to me to tanner comrade you will not betray us  straker oo are you

comrade we have spent a pleasant evening with you that is all  straker i gev my and to nobody see  mendoza turning on him impressively young man if i am tried i shall plead guilty and explain what drove me from england home and duty do you wish to have the respectable name of straker dragged through the mud of a spanish criminal court the police will search me they will find louisas portrait it will be published in the illustrated papers you blench it will be your doing remember  straker with baffled rage i dont care about the court its avin our name mixed up with yours that i object to you blackmailin swine you  mendoza language unworthy of louisas brother but no matter you are muzzled that is enough for us he turns to face his own men who back uneasily across the amphitheatre towards the cave to take refuge behind him as a fresh party muffled for motoring comes from the road in riotous spirits ann who makes straight for tanner comes first then violet helped over the rough ground by hector holding her right hand and ramsden her left mendoza goes to his presidential block and seats himself calmly with his rank and file grouped behind him and his staff consisting of duval and the anarchist on his right and the two socialdemocrats on his left supporting him in flank  ann its jack  tanner caught  hector why certainly it is i said it was you tanner weve just been stopped by a puncture the road is full of nails  violet what are you doing here with all these men  ann why did you leave us without a word of warning  hector i want that bunch of roses miss whitefield to tanner when we found you were gone miss whitefield bet me a bunch of roses my car would not overtake yours before you reached monte carlo  tanner but this is not the road to monte carlo  hector no matter miss whitefield tracked you at every stopping place she is a regular sherlock holmes  tanner the life force i am lost  octavius bounding gaily down from the road into the amphitheatre and coming between tanner and straker i am so glad you are safe old chap we were afraid you had been captured by brigands  ramsden who has been staring at mendoza i seem to remember the face of your friend here mendoza rises politely and advances with a smile between ann and ramsden  hector why so do i  octavius i know you perfectly well sir but i cant think where i have met you  mendoza to violet do you remember me madam  violet oh quite well but i am so stupid about names  mendoza it was at the savoy hotel to hector you sir used to come with this lady violet to lunch to octavius you sir often brought this lady ann and her mother to dinner on your way to the lyceum theatre to ramsden you sir used to come to supper with dropping his voice to a confidential but perfectly audible whisper several different ladies  ramsden angrily well what is that to you pray  octavius why violet i thought you hardly knew one another before this trip you and malone  violet vexed i suppose this person was the manager  mendoza the waiter madam i have a grateful recollection of you all i gathered from the bountiful way in which you treated me that you all enjoyed your visits very much  violet what impertinence she turns her back on him and goes up the hill with hector  ramsden that will do my friend you do not expect these ladies to treat you as an acquaintance i suppose because you have waited on them at table  mendoza pardon me it was you who claimed my acquaintance the ladies followed your example however this display of the unfortunate manners of your class closes the incident for the future you will please address me with the respect due to a stranger and fellow traveller he turns haughtily away and resumes his presidential seat  tanner there i have found one man on my journey capable of reasonable conversation and you all instinctively insult him even the new man is as bad as any of you enry you have behaved just like a miserable gentleman  straker gentleman not me  ramsden really tanner this tone  ann dont mind him granny you ought to know him by this time she takes his arm and coaxes him away to the hill to join violet and hector octavius follows her doglike  violet calling from the hill here are the soldiers they are getting out of their motors  duval panicstricken oh nom de dieu  the anarchist fools the state is about to crush you because you spared it at the prompting of the political hangerson of the bourgeoisie  the sulky socialdemocrat argumentative to the last on the contrary only by capturing the state machine  the anarchist it is going to capture you  the rowdy socialdemocrat his anguish culminating ow chock it wot are we ere for wot are we wytin for  mendoza between his teeth goon talk politics you idiots nothing sounds more respectable keep it up i tell you  the soldiers line the road commanding the amphitheatre with their rifles the brigands struggling with an overwhelming impulse to hide behind one another look as unconcerned as they can mendoza rises superbly with undaunted front the officer in command steps down from the road in to the amphitheatre looks hard at the brigands and then inquiringly at tanner  the officer who are these men senor ingles  tanner my escort  mendoza with a mephistophelean smile bows profoundly an irrepressible grin runs from face to face among the brigands they touch their hats except the anarchist who defies the state with folded arms     act iv  the garden of a villa in granada whoever wishes to know what it is like must go to granada and see one may prosaically specify a group of hills dotted with villas the alhambra on the top of one of the hills and a considerable town in the valley approached by dusty white roads in which the children no matter what they are doing or thinking about automatically whine for halfpence and reach out little clutching brown palms for them but there is nothing in this description except the alhambra the begging and the color of the roads that does not fit surrey as well as spain the difference is that the surrey hills are comparatively small and ugly and should properly be called the surrey protuberances but these spanish hills are of mountain stock the amenity which conceals their size does not compromise their dignity  this particular garden is on a hill opposite the alhambra and the villa is as expensive and pretentious as a villa must be if it is to be let furnished by the week to opulent american and english visitors if we stand on the lawn at the foot of the garden and look uphill our horizon is the stone balustrade of a flagged platform on the edge of infinite space at the top of the hill between us and this platform is a flower garden with a circular basin and fountain in the centre surrounded by geometrical flower beds gravel paths and clipped yew trees in the genteelest order the garden is higher than our lawn so we reach it by a few steps in the middle of its embankment the platform is higher again than the garden from which we mount a couple more steps to look over the balustrade at a fine view of the town up the valley and of the hills that stretch away beyond it to where in the remotest distance they become mountains on our left is the villa accessible by steps from the left hand corner of the garden returning from the platform through the garden and down again to the lawn a movement which leaves the villa behind us on our right we find evidence of literary interests on the part of the tenants in the fact that there is no tennis net nor set of croquet hoops but on our left a little iron garden table with books on it mostly yellowbacked and a chair beside it a chair on the right has also a couple of open books upon it there are no newspapers a circumstance which with the absence of games might lead an intelligent spectator to the most far reaching conclusions as to the sort of people who live in the villa such speculations are checked however on this delightfully fine afternoon by the appearance at a little gate in a paling an our left of henry straker in his professional costume he opens the gate for an elderly gentleman and follows him on to the lawn  this elderly gentleman defies the spanish sun in a black frock coat tall silk bat trousers in which narrow stripes of dark grey and lilac blend into a highly respectable color and a black necktie tied into a bow over spotless linen probably therefore a man whose social position needs constant and scrupulous affirmation without regard to climate one who would dress thus for the middle of the sahara or the top of mont blanc and since he has not the stamp of the class which accepts as its lifemission the advertizing and maintenance of first rate tailoring and millinery he looks vulgar in his finery though in a working dress of any kind he would look dignified enough he is a bullet cheeked man with a red complexion stubbly hair smallish eyes a hard mouth that folds down at the corners and a dogged chin the looseness of skin that comes with age has attacked his throat and the laps of his cheeks but he is still hard as an apple above the mouth so that the upper half of his face looks younger than the lower he has the selfconfidence of one who has made money and something of the truculence of one who has made it in a brutalizing struggle his civility having under it a perceptible menace that he has other methods in reserve if necessary withal a man to be rather pitied when he is not to be feared for there is something pathetic about him at times as if the huge commercial machine which has worked him into his frock coat had allowed him very little of his own way and left his affections hungry and baffled at the first word that falls from him it is clear that he is an irishman whose native intonation has clung to him through many changes of place and rank one can only guess that the original material of his speech was perhaps the surly kerry brogue but the degradation of speech that occurs in london glasgow dublin and big cities generally has been at work on it so long that nobody but an arrant cockney would dream of calling it a brogue now for its music is almost gone though its surliness is still perceptible straker as a very obvious cockney inspires him with implacable contempt as a stupid englishman who cannot even speak his own language properly straker on the other hand regards the old gentlemans accent as a joke thoughtfully provided by providence expressly for the amusement of the british race and treats him normally with the indulgence due to an inferior and unlucky species but occasionally with indignant alarm when the old gentleman shows signs of intending his irish nonsense to be taken seriously  straker ill go tell the young lady she said youd prefer to stay here he turns to go up through the garden to the villa  malone who has been looking round him with lively curiosity the young lady thats miss violet eh  straker stopping on the steps with sudden suspicion well you know dont you  malone do i  straker his temper rising well do you or dont you  malone what business is that of yours  straker now highly indignant comes back from the steps and confronts the visitor  straker ill tell you what business it is of mine miss robinson  malone interrupting oh her name is robinson is it thank you  straker why you dont know even her name  malone yes i do now that youve told me  straker after a moment of stupefaction at the old mans readiness in repartee look here what do you mean by gittin into my car and lettin me bring you here if youre not the person i took that note to  malone who else did you take it to pray  straker i took it to mr ector malone at miss robinsons request see miss robinson is not my principal i took it to oblige her i know mr malone and he aint you not by a long chalk at the hotel they told me that your name is ector malone  malone hector malone  straker with calm superiority hector in your own country thats what comes o livin in provincial places like ireland and america over here youre ector if you avnt noticed it before you soon will  the growing strain of the conversation is here relieved by violet who has sallied from the villa and through the garden to the steps which she now descends coming very opportunely between malone and straker  violet to straker did you take my message  straker yes miss i took it to the hotel and sent it up expecting to see young mr malone then out walks this gent and says its all right and hell come with me so as the hotel people said he was mr ector malone i fetched him and now he goes back on what he said but if he isnt the gentleman you meant say the word its easy enough to fetch him back again  malone i should esteem it a great favor if i might have a short conversation with you madam i am hectors father as this bright britisher would have guessed in the course of another hour or so  straker coolly defiant no not in another year or so when weve ad you as long to polish up as weve ad im perhaps youll begin to look a little bit up to is mark at present you fall a long way short youve got too many aitches for one thing to violet amiably all right miss you want to talk to him i shant intrude he nods affably to malone and goes out through the little gate in the paling  violet very civilly i am so sorry mr malone if that man has been rude to you but what can we do he is our chauffeur  malone your what  violet the driver of our automobile he can drive a motor car at seventy miles an hour and mend it when it breaks down we are dependent on our motor cars and our motor cars are dependent on him so of course we are dependent on him  malone ive noticed madam that every thousand dollars an englishman gets seems to add one to the number of people hes dependent on however you neednt apologize for your man i made him talk on purpose by doing so i learnt that youre staying here in grannida with a party of english including my son hector  violet conversationally yes we intended to go to nice but we had to follow a rather eccentric member of our party who started first and came here wont you sit down she clears the nearest chair of the two books on it  malone impressed by this attention thank you he sits down examining her curiously as she goes to the iron table to put down the books when she turns to him again he says miss robinson i believe  violet sitting down yes  malone taking a letter from his pocket your note to hector runs as follows violet is unable to repress a start he pauses quietly to take out and put on his spectacles which have gold rims dearest they have all gone to the alhambra for the afternoon i have shammed headache and have the garden all to myself jump into jacks motor straker will rattle you here in a jiffy quick quick quick your loving violet he looks at her but by this time she has recovered herself and meets his spectacles with perfect composure he continues slowly now i dont know on what terms young people associate in english society but in america that note would be considered to imply a very considerable degree of affectionate intimacy between the parties  violet yes i know your son very well mr malone have you any objection  malone somewhat taken aback no no objection exactly provided it is understood that my son is altogether dependent on me and that i have to be consulted in any important step he may propose to take  violet i am sure you would not be unreasonable with him mr malone  malone i hope not miss robinson but at your age you might think many things unreasonable that dont seem so to me  violet with a little shrug oh well i suppose theres no use our playing at cross purposes mr malone hector wants to marry me  malone i inferred from your note that he might well miss robinson he is his own master but if he marries you he shall not have a rap from me he takes off his spectacles and pockets them with the note  violet with some severity that is not very complimentary to me mr malone  malone i say nothing against you miss robinson i daresay you are an amiable and excellent young lady but i have other views for hector  violet hector may not have other views for himself mr malone  malone possibly not then he does without me thats all i daresay you are prepared for that when a young lady writes to a young man to come to her quick quick quick money seems nothing and love seems everything  violet sharply i beg your pardon mr malone i do not think anything so foolish hector must have money  malone staggered oh very well very well no doubt he can work for it  violet what is the use of having money if you have to work for it she rises impatiently its all nonsense mr malone you must enable your son to keep up his position it is his right  malone grimly i should not advise you to marry him on the strength of that right miss robinson  violet who has almost lost her temper controls herself with an effort unclenches her fingers and resumes her seat with studied tranquillity and reasonableness  violet what objection have you to me pray my social position is as good as hectors to say the least he admits it  malone shrewdly you tell him so from time to time eh hectors social position in england miss robinson is just what i choose to buy for him i have made him a fair offer let him pick out the most historic house castle or abbey that england contains the day that he tells me he wants it for a wife worthy of its traditions i buy it for him and give him the means of keeping it up  violet what do you mean by a wife worthy of its traditions cannot any well bred woman keep such a house for him  malone no she must be born to it  violet hector was not born to it was he  malone his granmother was a barefooted irish girl that nursed me by a turf fire let him marry another such and i will not stint her marriage portion let him raise himself socially with my money or raise somebody else so long as there is a social profit somewhere ill regard my expenditure as justified but there must be a profit for someone a marriage with you would leave things just where they are  violet many of my relations would object very much to my marrying the grandson of a common woman mr malone that may be prejudice but so is your desire to have him marry a title prejudice  malone rising and approaching her with a scrutiny in which there is a good deal of reluctant respect you seem a pretty straightforward downright sort of a young woman  violet i do not see why i should be made miserably poor because i cannot make profits for you why do you want to make hector unhappy  malone he will get over it all right enough men thrive better on disappointments in love than on disappointments in money i daresay you think that sordid but i know what im talking about my father died of starvation in ireland in the black 47 maybe youve heard of it  violet the famine  malone with smouldering passion no the starvation when a country is full of food and exporting it there can be no famine my father was starved dead and i was starved out to america in my mothers arms english rule drove me and mine out of ireland well you can keep ireland i and my like are coming back to buy england and well buy the best of it i want no middle class properties and no middle class women for hector thats straightforward isnt it like yourself  violet icily pitying his sentimentality really mr malone i am astonished to hear a man of your age and good sense talking in that romantic way do you suppose english noblemen will sell their places to you for the asking  malone i have the refusal of two of the oldest family mansions in england one historic owner cant afford to keep all the rooms dusted the other cant afford the death duties what do you say now  violet of course it is very scandalous but surely you know that the government will sooner or later put a stop to all these socialistic attacks on property  malone grinning dy think theyll be able to get that done before i buy the houseor rather the abbey theyre both abbeys  violet putting that aside rather impatiently oh well let us talk sense mr malone you must feel that we havent been talking sense so far  malone i cant say i do i mean all i say  violet then you dont know hector as i do he is romantic and faddyhe gets it from you i fancyand he wants a certain sort of wife to take care of him not a faddy sort of person you know  malone somebody like you perhaps  violet quietly well yes but you cannot very well ask me to undertake this with absolutely no means of keeping up his position  malone alarmed stop a bit stop a bit where are we getting to im not aware that im asking you to undertake anything  violet of course mr malone you can make it very difficult for me to speak to you if you choose to misunderstand me  malone half bewildered i dont wish to take any unfair advantage but we seem to have got off the straight track somehow  straker with the air of a man who has been making haste opens the little gate and admits hector who snorting with indignation comes upon the lawn and is making for his father when violet greatly dismayed springs up and intercepts him straker doer not wait at least he does not remain visibly within earshot  violet oh how unlucky now please hector say nothing go away until i have finished speaking to your father  hector inexorably no violet i mean to have this thing out right away he puts her aside passes her by and faces his father whose cheeks darken as his irish blood begins to simmer dad youve not played this hand straight  malone hwat dymean  hector youve opened a letter addressed to me youve impersonated me and stolen a march on this lady thats dishonorable  malone threateningly now you take care what youre saying hector take care i tell you  hector i have taken care i am taking care im taking care of my honor and my position in english society  malone hotly your position has been got by my money do you know that  hector well youve just spoiled it all by opening that letter a letter from an english lady not addressed to youa confidential letter a delicate letter a private letter opened by my father thats a sort of thing a man cant struggle against in england the sooner we go back together the better he appeals mutely to the heavens to witness the shame and anguish of two outcasts  violet snubbing him with an instinctive dislike for scene making dont be unreasonable hector it was quite natural of mr malone to open my letter his name was on the envelope  malone there youve no common sense hector i thank you miss robinson  hector i thank you too its very kind of you my father knows no better  malone furiously clenching his fists hector  hector with undaunted moral force oh its no use hectoring me a private letters a private letter dad you cant get over that  malone raising his voice i wont be talked back to by you dy hear  violet ssh please please here they all come  father and son checked glare mutely at one another as tanner comes in through the little gate with ramsden followed by octavius and ann  violet back already  tanner the alhambra is not open this afternoon  violet what a sell  tanner passes on and presently finds himself between hector and a strange elder both apparently on the verge of personal combat he looks from one to the other for an explanation they sulkily avoid his eye and nurse their wrath in silence  ramsden is it wise for you to be out in the sunshine with such a headache violet  tanner have you recovered too malone  violet oh i forgot we have not all met before mr malone wont you introduce your father  hector with roman firmness no i will not he is no father of mine  malone very angry you disown your dad before your english friends do you  violet oh please dont make a scene  ann and octavius lingering near the gate exchange an astonished glance and discreetly withdraw up the steps to the garden where they can enjoy the disturbance without intruding on their way to the steps ann sends a little grimace of mute sympathy to violet who is standing with her back to the little table looking on in helpless annoyance as her husband soars to higher and higher moral eminences without the least regard to the old mans millions  hector im very sorry miss robinson but im contending for a principle i am a son and i hope a dutiful one but before everything im a man and when dad treats my private letters as his own and takes it on himself to say that i shant marry you if i am happy and fortunate enough to gain your consent then i just snap my fingers and go my own way  tanner marry violet  ramsden are you in your senses  tanner do you forget what we told you  hector recklessly i dont care what you told me  ramsden scandalized tut tut sir monstrous he flings away towards the gate his elbows quivering with indignation  tanner another madman these men in love should be locked up he gives hector up as hopeless and turns away towards the garden but malone taking offence in a new direction follows him and compels him by the aggressivenes of his tone to stop  malone i dont understand this is hector not good enough for this lady pray  tanner my dear sir the lady is married already hector knows it and yet he persists in his infatuation take him home and lock him up  malone bitterly so this is the highborn social tone ive spoilt by my ignorant uncultivated behavior makin love to a married woman he comes angrily between hector and violet and almost bawls into hectors left ear youve picked up that habit of the british aristocracy have you  hector thats all right dont you trouble yourself about that ill answer for the morality of what im doing  tanner coming forward to hectors right hand with flashing eyes well said malone you also see that mere marriage laws are not morality i agree with you but unfortunately violet does not  malone i take leave to doubt that sir turning on violet let me tell you mrs robinson or whatever your right name is you had no right to send that letter to my son when you were the wife of another man  hector outraged this is the last straw dad you have insulted my wife  malone your wife  tanner you the missing husband another moral impostor he smites his brow and collapses into malones chair  malone youve married without my consent  ramsden you have deliberately humbugged us sir  hector here i have had just about enough of being badgered violet and i are married thats the long and the short of it now what have you got to sayany of you  malone i know what ive got to say shes married a beggar  hector no shes married a worker his american pronunciation imparts an overwhelming intensity to this simple and unpopular word i start to earn my own living this very afternoon  malone sneering angrily yes youre very plucky now because you got your remittance from me yesterday or this morning i reckon wait til its spent you wont be so full of cheek then  hector producing a letter from his pocketbook here it is thrusting it on his father now you just take your remittance and yourself out of my life im done with remittances and im done with you i dont sell the privilege of insulting my wife for a thousand dollars  malone deeply wounded and full of concern hector you dont know what poverty is  hector fervidly well i want to know what it is i wantbe a man violet you come along with me to your own home ill see you through  octavius jumping down from the garden to the lawn and running to hectors left hand i hope youll shake hands with me before you go hector i admire and respect you more than i can say he is affected almost to tears as they shake hands  violet also almost in tears but of vexation oh dont be an idiot tavy hectors about as fit to become a workman as you are  tanner rising from his chair on the other ride of hector never fear theres no question of his becoming a navvy mrs malone to hector theres really no difficulty about capital to start with treat me as a friend draw on me  octavius impulsively or on me  malone with fierce jealousy who wants your dirty money who should he draw on but his own father tanner and octavius recoil octavius rather hurt tanner consoled by the solution of the money difficulty violet looks up hopefully hector dont be rash my boy im sorry for what i said i never meant to insult violet i take it all back shes just the wife you want there  hector patting him on the shoulder well thats all right dad say no more were friends again only i take no money from anybody  malone pleading abjectly dont be hard on me hector id rather you quarrelled and took the money than made friends and starved you dont know what the world is i do  hector no no no thats fixed thats not going to change he passes his father inexorably by and goes to violet come mrs malone youve got to move to the hotel with me and take your proper place before the world  violet but i must go in dear and tell davis to pack wont you go on and make them give you a room overlooking the garden for me ill join you in half an hour  hector very well youll dine with us dad wont you  malone eager to conciliate him yes yes  hector see you all later he waves his hand to ann who has now been joined by tanner octavius and ramsden in the garden and goes out through the little gate leaving his father and violet together on the lawn  malone youll try to bring him to his senses violet i know you will  violet i had no idea he could be so headstrong if he goes on like that what can i do  malone dont be discurridged domestic pressure may be slow but its sure youll wear him down promise me you will  violet i will do my best of course i think its the greatest nonsense deliberately making us poor like that  malone of course it is  violet after a moments reflection you had better give me the remittance he will want it for his hotel bill ill see whether i can induce him to accept it not now of course but presently  malone eagerly yes yes yes thats just the thing he hands her the thousand dollar bill and adds cunningly yunderstand that this is only a bachelor allowance  violet coolly oh quite she takes it thank you by the way mr malone those two houses you mentionedthe abbeys  malone yes  violet dont take one of them until ive seen it one never knows what may be wrong with these places  malone i wont ill do nothing without consulting you never fear  violet politely but without a ray of gratitude thanks that will be much the best way she goes calmly back to the villa escorted obsequiously by malone to the upper end of the garden  tanner drawing ramsdens attention to malones cringing attitude as he takes leave of violet and that poor devil is a billionaire one of the master spirits of the age led on a string like a pug dog by the first girl who takes the trouble to despise him i wonder will it ever come to that with me he comes down to the lawn  ramsden following him the sooner the better for you  malone clapping his hands as he returns through the garden thatll be a grand woman for hector i wouldnt exchange her for ten duchesses he descends to the lawn and comes between tanner and ramsden  ramsden very civil to the billionaire its an unexpected pleasure to find you in this corner of the world mr malone have you come to buy up the alhambra  malone well i dont say i mightnt i think i could do better with it than the spanish government but thats not what i came about to tell you the truth about a month ago i overheard a deal between two men over a bundle of shares they differed about the price they were young and greedy and didnt know that if the shares were worth what was bid for them they must be worth what was asked the margin being too small to be of any account you see to amuse meself i cut in and bought the shares well to this day i havent found out what the business is the office is in this town and the name is mendoza limited now whether mendozas a mine or a steamboat line or a bank or a patent article  tanner hes a man i know him his principles are thoroughly commercial let us take you round the town in our motor mr malone and call on him on the way  malone if youll be so kind yes and may i ask who  tanner mr roebuck ramsden a very old friend of your daughterinlaw  malone happy to meet you mr ramsden  ramsden thank you mr tanner is also one of our circle  malone glad to know you also mr tanner  tanner thanks malone and ramsden go out very amicably through the little gate tanner calls to octavius who is wandering in the garden with ann tavy tavy comes to the steps tanner whispers loudly to him violet has married a financier of brigands tanner hurries away to overtake malone and ramsden ann strolls to the steps with an idle impulse to torment octavius  ann wont you go with them tavy  octavius tears suddenly flushing his eyes you cut me to the heart ann by wanting me to go he comes down on the lawn to hide his face from her she follows him caressingly  ann poor ricky ticky tavy poor heart  octavius it belongs to you ann forgive me i must speak of it i love you you know i love you  ann whats the good tavy you know that my mother is determined that i shall marry jack  octavius amazed jack  ann it seems absurd doesnt it  octavius with growing resentment do you mean to say that jack has been playing with me all this time that he has been urging me not to marry you because he intends to marry you himself  ann alarmed no no you mustnt lead him to believe that i said that i dont for a moment think that jack knows his own mind but its clear from my fathers will that he wished me to marry jack and my mother is set on it  octavius but you are not bound to sacrifice yourself always to the wishes of your parents  ann my father loved me my mother loves me surely their wishes are a better guide than my own selfishness  octavius oh i know how unselfish you are ann but believe methough i know i am speaking in my own interestthere is another side to this question is it fair to jack to marry him if you do not love him is it fair to destroy my happiness as well as your own if you can bring yourself to love me  ann looking at him with a faint impulse of pity tavy my dear you are a nice creaturea good boy  octavius humiliated is that all  ann mischievously in spite of her pity thats a great deal i assure you you would always worship the ground i trod on wouldnt you  octavius i do it sounds ridiculous but its no exaggeration i do and i always shall  ann always is a long word tavy you see i shall have to live up always to your idea of my divinity and i dont think i could do that if we were married but if i marry jack youll never be disillusionedat least not until i grow too old  octavius i too shall grow old ann and when i am eighty one white hair of the woman i love will make me tremble more than the thickest gold tress from the most beautiful young head  ann quite touched oh thats poetry tavy real poetry it gives me that strange sudden sense of an echo from a former existence which always seems to me such a striking proof that we have immortal souls  octavius do you believe that is true  ann tavy if it is to become true you must lose me as well as love me  octavius oh he hastily sits down at the little table and covers his face with his hands  ann with conviction tavy i wouldnt for worlds destroy your illusions i can neither take you nor let you go i can see exactly what will suit you you must be a sentimental old bachelor for my sake  octavius desperately ann ill kill myself  ann oh no you wont that wouldnt be kind you wont have a bad time you will be very nice to women and you will go a good deal to the opera a broken heart is a very pleasant complaint for a man in london if he has a comfortable income  octavius considerably cooled but believing that he is only recovering his selfcontrol i know you mean to be kind ann jack has persuaded you that cynicism is a good tonic for me he rises with quiet dignity  ann studying him slyly you see im disillusionizing you already thats what i dread  octavius you do not dread disillusionizing jack  ann her face lighting up with mischievous ecstasywhispering i cant he has no illusions about me i shall surprise jack the other way getting over an unfavorable impression is ever so much easier than living up to an ideal oh i shall enrapture jack sometimes  octavius resuming the calm phase of despair and beginning to enjoy his broken heart and delicate attitude without knowing it i dont doubt that you will enrapture him always and hethe foolthinks you would make him wretched  ann yes thats the difficulty so far  octavius heroically shall i tell him that you love  ann quickly oh no hed run away again  octavius shocked ann would you marry an unwilling man  ann what a queer creature you are tavy theres no such thing as a willing man when you really go for him she laughs naughtily im shocking you i suppose but you know you are really getting a sort of satisfaction already in being out of danger yourself  octavius startled satisfaction reproachfully you say that to me  ann well if it were really agony would you ask for more of it  octavius have i asked for more of it  ann you have offered to tell jack that i love him thats selfsacrifice i suppose but there must be some satisfaction in it perhaps its because youre a poet you are like the bird that presses its breast against the sharp thorn to make itself sing  octavius its quite simple i love you and i want you to be happy you dont love me so i cant make you happy myself but i can help another man to do it  ann yes it seems quite simple but i doubt if we ever know why we do things the only really simple thing is to go straight for what you want and grab it i suppose i dont love you tavy but sometimes i feel as if i should like to make a man of you somehow you are very foolish about women  octavius almost coldly i am content to be what i am in that respect  ann then you must keep away from them and only dream about them i wouldnt marry you for worlds tavy  octavius i have no hope ann i accept my ill luck but i dont think you quite know how much it hurts  ann you are so softhearted its queer that you should be so different from violet violets as hard as nails  octavius oh no i am sure violet is thoroughly womanly at heart  ann with some impatience why do you say that is it unwomanly to be thoughtful and businesslike and sensible do you want violet to be an idiotor something worse like me  octavius something worselike you what do you mean ann  ann oh well i dont mean that of course but i have a great respect for violet she gets her own way always  octavius sighing so do you  ann yes but somehow she gets it without coaxingwithout having to make people sentimental about her  octavius with brotherly callousness nobody could get very sentimental about violet i think pretty as she is  ann oh yes they could if she made them  octavius but surely no really nice woman would deliberately practise on mens instincts in that way  ann throwing up her hands oh tavy tavy ricky ticky tavy heaven help the woman who marries you  octavius his passion reviving at the name oh why why why do you say that dont torment me i dont understand  ann suppose she were to tell fibs and lay snares for men  octavius do you think i could marry such a womani who have known and loved you  ann hm well at all events she wouldnt let you if she were wise so thats settled and now i cant talk any more say you forgive me and that the subject is closed  octavius i have nothing to forgive and the subject is closed and if the wound is open at least you shall never see it bleed  ann poetic to the last tavy goodbye dear she pats his check has an impulse to kiss him and then another impulse of distaste which prevents her finally runs away through the garden and into the villa  octavius again takes refuge at the table bowing his head on his arms and sobbing softly mrs whitefield who has been pottering round the granada shops and has a net full of little parcels in her hand comes in through the gate and sees him  mrs whitefield running to him and lifting his head whats the matter tavy are you ill  octavius no nothing nothing  mrs whitefield still holding his head anxiously but youre crying is it about violets marriage  octavius no no who told you about violet  mrs whitefield restoring the head to its owner i met roebuck and that awful old irishman are you sure youre not ill whats the matter  octavius affectionately its nothingonly a mans broken heart doesnt that sound ridiculous  mrs whitefield but what is it all about has ann been doing anything to you  octavius its not anns fault and dont think for a moment that i blame you  mrs whitefield startled for what  octavius pressing her hand consolingly for nothing i said i didnt blame you  mrs whitefield but i havent done anything whats the matter  octavius smiling sadly cant you guess i daresay you are right to prefer jack to me as a husband for ann but i love ann and it hurts rather he rises and moves away from her towards the middle of the lawn  mrs whitefield following him hastily does ann say that i want her to marry jack  octavius yes she has told me  mrs whitefield thoughtfully then im very sorry for you tavy its only her way of saying she wants to marry jack little she cares what i say or what i want  octavius but she would not say it unless she believed it surely you dont suspect ann ofof deceit  mrs whitefield well never mind tavy i dont know which is best for a young man to know too little like you or too much like jack  tanner returns  tanner well ive disposed of old malone ive introduced him to mendoza limited and left the two brigands together to talk it out hullo tavy anything wrong  octavius i must go wash my face i see to mrs whitefield tell him what you wish to tanner you may take it from me jack that ann approves of it  tanner puzzled by his manner approves of what  octavius of what mrs whitefield wishes he goes his way with sad dignity to the villa  tanner to mrs whitefield this is very mysterious what is it you wish it shall be done whatever it is  mrs whitefield with snivelling gratitude thank you jack she sits down tanner brings the other chair from the table and sits close to her with his elbows on his knees giving her his whole attention i dont know why it is that other peoples children are so nice to me and that my own have so little consideration for me its no wonder i dont seem able to care for ann and rhoda as i do for you and tavy and violet its a very queer world it used to be so straightforward and simple and now nobody seems to think and feel as they ought nothing has been right since that speech that professor tyndall made at belfast  tanner yes life is more complicated than we used to think but what am i to do for you  mrs whitefield thats just what i want to tell you of course youll marry ann whether i like it myself or not  tanner starting it seems to me that i shall presently be married to ann whether i like it myself or not  mrs whitefield peacefully oh very likely you will you know what she is when she has set her mind on anything but dont put it on me thats all i ask tavy has just let out that shes been saying that i am making her marry you and the poor boy is breaking his heart about it for he is in love with her himself though what he sees in her so wonderful goodness knows i dont its no use telling tavy that ann puts things into peoples heads by telling them that i want them when the thought of them never crossed my mind it only sets tavy against me but you know better than that so if you marry her dont put the blame on me  tanner emphatically i havent the slightest intention of marrying her  mrs whitefield slyly shed suit you better than tavy shed meet her match in you jack id like to see her meet her match  tanner no man is a match for a woman except with a poker and a pair of hobnailed boots not always even then anyhow i cant take the poker to her i should be a mere slave  mrs whitefield no shes afraid of you at all events you would tell her the truth about herself she wouldnt be able to slip out of it as she does with me  tanner everybody would call me a brute if i told ann the truth about herself in terms of her own moral code to begin with ann says things that are not strictly true  mrs whitefield im glad somebody sees she is not an angel  tanner in shortto put it as a husband would put it when exasperated to the point of speaking outshe is a liar and since she has plunged tavy head over ears in love with her without any intention of marrying him she is a coquette according to the standard definition of a coquette as a woman who rouses passions she has no intention of gratifying and as she has now reduced you to the point of being willing to sacrifice me at the altar for the mere satisfaction of getting me to call her a liar to her face i may conclude that she is a bully as well she cant bully men as she bullies women so she habitually and unscrupulously uses her personal fascination to make men give her whatever she wants that makes her almost something for which i know no polite name  mrs whitefield in mild expostulation well you cant expect perfection jack  tanner i dont but what annoys me is that ann does i know perfectly well that all this about her being a liar and a bully and a coquette and so forth is a trumpedup moral indictment which might be brought against anybody we all lie we all bully as much as we dare we all bid for admiration without the least intention of earning it we all get as much rent as we can out of our powers of fascination if ann would admit this i shouldnt quarrel with her but she wont if she has children shell take advantage of their telling lies to amuse herself by whacking them if another woman makes eyes at me shell refuse to know a coquette she will do just what she likes herself whilst insisting on everybody else doing what the conventional code prescribes in short i can stand everything except her confounded hypocrisy thats what beats me  mrs whitefield carried away by the relief of hearing her own opinion so eloquently expressed oh she is a hypocrite she is she is isnt she  tanner then why do you want to marry me to her  mrs whitefield querulously there now put it on me of course i never thought of it until tavy told me she said i did but you know im very fond of tavy hes a sort of son to me and i dont want him to be trampled on and made wretched  tanner whereas i dont matter i suppose  mrs whitefield oh you are different somehow you are able to take care of yourself youd serve her out and anyhow she must marry somebody  tanner aha there speaks the life instinct you detest her but you feel that you must get her married  mrs whitefield rising shocked do you mean that i detest my own daughter surely you dont believe me to be so wicked and unnatural as that merely because i see her faults  tanner cynically you love her then  mrs whitefield why of course i do what queer things you say jack we cant help loving our own blood relations  tanner well perhaps it saves unpleasantness to say so but for my part i suspect that the tables of consanguinity have a natural basis in a natural repugnance he rises  mrs whitefield you shouldnt say things like that jack i hope you wont tell ann that i have been speaking to you i only wanted to set myself right with you and tavy i couldnt sit mumchance and have everything put on me  tanner politely quite so  mrs whitefield dissatisfied and now ive only made matters worse tavys angry with me because i dont worship ann and when its been put into my head that ann ought to marry you what can i say except that it would serve her right  tanner thank you  mrs whitefield now dont be silly and twist what i say into something i dont mean i ought to have fair play  ann comes from the villa followed presently by violet who is dressed for driving  ann coming to her mothers right hand with threatening suavity well mamma darling you seem to be having a delightful chat with jack we can hear you all over the place  mrs whitefield appalled have you overheard  tanner never fear ann is onlywell we were discussing that habit of hers just now she hasnt heard a word  mrs whitefield stoutly i dont care whether she has or not i have a right to say what i please  violet arriving on the lawn and coming between mrs whitefield and tanner ive come to say goodbye im off for my honeymoon  mrs whitefield crying oh dont say that violet and no wedding no breakfast no clothes nor anything  violet petting her it wont be for long  mrs whitefield dont let him take you to america promise me that you wont  violet very decidedly i should think not indeed dont cry dear im only going to the hotel  mrs whitefield but going in that dress with your luggage makes one realizeshe chokes and then breaks out again how i wish you were my daughter violet  violet soothing her there there so i am ann will be jealous  mrs whitefield ann doesnt care a bit for me  ann fie mother come now you mustnt cry any more you know violet doesnt like it mrs whitefzeld dries her eyes and subsides  violet goodbye jack  tanner goodbye violet  violet the sooner you get married too the better you will be much less misunderstood  tanner restively i quite expect to get married in the course of the afternoon you all seem to have set your minds on it  violet you might do worse to mrs whitefield putting her arm round her let me take you to the hotel with me the drive will do you good come in and get a wrap she takes her towards the villa  mrs whitefield as they go up through the garden i dont know what i shall do when you are gone with no one but ann in the house and she always occupied with the men its not to be expected that your husband will care to be bothered with an old woman like me oh you neednt tell me politeness is all very well but i know what people thinkshe talks herself and violet out of sight and hearing  ann musing on violets opportune advice approaches tanner examines him humorously for a moment from toe to top and finally delivers her opinion  ann violet is quite right you ought to get married  tanner explosively ann i will not marry you do you hear i wont wont wont wont wont marry you  ann placidly well nobody axd you sir she said sir she said sir she said so thats settled  tanner yes nobody has asked me but everybody treats the thing as settled its in the air when we meet the others go away on absurd pretexts to leave us alone together ramsden no longer scowls at me his eye beams as if he were already giving you away to me in church tavy refers me to your mother and gives me his blessing straker openly treats you as his future employer it was he who first told me of it  ann was that why you ran away  tanner yes only to be stopped by a lovesick brigand and run down like a truant schoolboy  ann well if you dont want to be married you neednt be she turns away from him and sits down much at her ease  tanner following her does any man want to be hanged yet men let themselves be hanged without a struggle for life though they could at least give the chaplain a black eye we do the worlds will not our own i have a frightful feeling that i shall let myself be married because it is the worlds will that you should have a husband  ann i daresay i shall someday  tanner but why meme of all men marriage is to me apostasy profanation of the sanctuary of my soul violation of my manhood sale of my birthright shameful surrender ignominious capitulation acceptance of defeat i shall decay like a thing that has served its purpose and is done with i shall change from a man with a future to a man with a past i shall see in the greasy eyes of all the other husbands their relief at the arrival of a new prisoner to share their ignominy the young men will scorn me as one who has sold out to the young women i who have always been an enigma and a possibility shall be merely somebody elses propertyand damaged goods at that a secondhand man at best  ann well your wife can put on a cap and make herself ugly to keep you in countenance like my grandmother  tanner so that she may make her triumph more insolent by publicly throwing away the bait the moment the trap snaps on the victim  ann after all though what difference would it make beauty is all very well at first sight but who ever looks at it when it has been in the house three days i thought our pictures very lovely when papa bought them but i havent looked at them for years you never bother about my looks you are too well used to me i might be the umbrella stand  tanner you lie you vampire you lie  ann flatterer why are you trying to fascinate me jack if you dont want to marry me  tanner the life force i am in the grip of the life force  ann i dont understand in the least it sounds like the life guards  tanner why dont you marry tavy he is willing can you not be satisfied unless your prey struggles  ann turning to him as if to let him into a secret tavy will never marry havent you noticed that that sort of man never marries  tanner what a man who idolizes women who sees nothing in nature but romantic scenery for love duets tavy the chivalrous the faithful the tenderhearted and true tavy never marry why he was born to be swept up by the first pair of blue eyes he meets in the street  ann yes i know all the same jack men like that always live in comfortable bachelor lodgings with broken hearts and are adored by their landladies and never get married men like you always get married  tanner smiting his brow how frightfully horribly true it has been staring me in the face all my life and i never saw it before  ann oh its the same with women the poetic temperaments a very nice temperament very amiable very harmless and poetic i daresay but its an old maids temperament  tanner barren the life force passes it by  ann if thats what you mean by the life force yes  tanner you dont care for tavy  ann looking round carefully to make sure that tavy is not within earshot no  tanner and you do care for me  ann rising quietly and shaking her finger at him now jack behave yourself  tanner infamous abandoned woman devil  ann boaconstrictor elephant  tanner hypocrite  ann softly i must be for my future husbands sake  tanner for mine correcting himself savagely i mean for his  annignoring the correction yes for yours you had better marry what you call a hypocrite jack women who are not hypocrites go about in rational dress and are insulted and get into all sorts of hot water and then their husbands get dragged in too and live in continual dread of fresh complications wouldnt you prefer a wife you could depend on  tanner no a thousand times no hot water is the revolutionists element you clean men as you clean milkpails by scalding them  ann cold water has its uses too its healthy  tanner despairingly oh you are witty at the supreme moment the life force endows you with every quality well i too can be a hypocrite your fathers will appointed me your guardian not your suitor i shall be faithful to my trust  ann in low siren tones he asked me who would i have as my guardian before he made that will i chose you  tanner the will is yours then the trap was laid from the beginning  ann concentrating all her magic from the beginning from our childhoodfor both of usby the life force  tanner i will not marry you i will not marry you  ann oh you will you will  tanner i tell you no no no  ann i tell you yes yes yes  tanner no  ann coaxingimploringalmost exhausted yes before it is too late for repentance yes  tanner struck by the echo from the past when did all this happen to me before are we two dreaming  ann suddenly losing her courage with an anguish that she does not conceal no we are awake and you have said no that is all  tanner brutally well  ann well i made a mistake you do not love me  tanner seizing her in his arms it is false i love you the life force enchants me i have the whole world in my arms when i clasp you but i am fighting for my freedom for my honor for myself one and indivisible  ann your happiness will be worth them all  tanner you would sell freedom and honor and self for happiness  ann it will not be all happiness for me perhaps death  tanner groaning oh that clutch holds and hurts what have you grasped in me is there a fathers heart as well as a mothers  ann take care jack if anyone comes while we are like this you will have to marry me  tanner if we two stood now on the edge of a precipice i would hold you tight and jump  ann panting failing more and more under the strain jack let me go i have dared so frightfullyit is lasting longer than i thought let me go i cant bear it  tanner nor i let it kill us  ann yes i dont care i am at the end of my forces i dont care i think i am going to faint  at this moment violet and octavius come from the villa with mrs whitefield who is wrapped up for driving simultaneously malone and ramsden followed by mendoza and straker come in through the little gate in the paling tanner shamefacedly releases ann who raises her hand giddily to her forehead  malone take care somethings the matter with the lady  ramsden what does this mean  violet running between ann and tanner are you ill  ann reeling with a supreme effort i have promised to marry jack she swoons violet kneels by her and chafes her band tanner runs round to her other hand and tries to lift her bead octavius goes to violets assistance but does not know what to do mrs whitefield hurries back into the villa octavius malone and ramsden run to ann and crowd round her stooping to assist straker coolly comes to anns feet and mendoza to her head both upright and selfpossessed  straker now then ladies and gentlemen she dont want a crowd round her she wants airall the air she can git if you please gents malone and ramsden allow him to drive them gently past ann and up the lawn towards the garden where octavius who has already become conscious of his uselessness joins them straker following them up pauses for a moment to instruct tanner dont lift er ed mr tanner let it go flat sos the blood can run back into it  mendoza he is right mr tanner trust to the air of the sierra he withdraws delicately to the garden steps  tanner rising i yield to your superior knowledge of physiology henry he withdraws to the corner of the lawn and octavius immediately hurries down to him  tavy aside to tanner grasping his hand jack be very happy  tanner aside to tavy i never asked her it is a trap for me he goes up the lawn towards the garden octavius remains petrified  mendoza intercepting mrs whitefield who comes from the villa with a glass of brandy what is this madam he takes it from her  mrs whitefield a little brandy  mendoza the worst thing you could give her allow me he swallows it trust to the air of the sierra madam  for a moment the men all forget ann and stare at mendoza  ann in violets ear clutching her round the neck violet did jack say anything when i fainted  violet no  ann ah with a sigh of intense relief she relapses  mrs whitefield oh shes fainted again  they are about to rush back to her but mendoza stops them with a warning gesture  ann supine no i havent im quite happy  tanner suddenly walking determinedly to her and snatching her hand from violet to feel her pulse why her pulse is positively bounding come getup what nonsense up with you he gets her up summarily  ann yes i feel strong enough now but you very nearly killed me jack for all that  malone a rough wooer eh theyre the best sort miss whitefield i congratulate mr

desires ramsden it is very easy for you to call me a happy man you are only a spectator i am one of the principals and i know better ann stop tempting tavy and come back to me  ann complying you are absurd jack she takes his proffered arm  tanner continuing i solemnly say that i am not a happy man ann looks happy but she is only triumphant successful victorious that is not happiness but the price for which the strong sell their happiness what we have both done this afternoon is to renounce tranquillity above all renounce the romantic possibilities of an unknown future for the cares of a household and a family i beg that no man may seize the occasion to get half drunk and utter imbecile speeches and coarse pleasantries at my expense we propose to furnish our own house according to our own taste and i hereby give notice that the seven or eight travelling clocks the four or five dressing cases the salad bowls the carvers and fish slices the copy of tennyson in extra morocco and all
