crusade of the excelsior     part i in bonds     chapter i  a crusader and a sign   it was the 4th of august 1854 off cape corrientes morning was breaking over a heavy sea and the closelyreefed topsails of a barque that ran before it bearing down upon the faint outline of the mexican coast already the white peak of colima showed ghostlike in the east already the long sweep of the pacific was gathering strength and volume as it swept uninterruptedly into the opening gulf of california  as the cold light increased it could be seen that the vessel showed evidence of a long voyage and stress of weather she had lost one of her spars and her starboard davits rolled emptily nevertheless her rigging was taut and shipshape and her decks scrupulously clean indeed in that uncertain light the only moving figure besides the two motionless shadows at the wheel was engaged in scrubbing the quarterdeckwhich with its grated settees and stacked campchairs seemed to indicate the presence of cabin passengers for the barque excelsior from new york to san francisco had discharged the bulk of her cargo at callao and had extended her liberal cabin accommodation to swell the feverish californian immigration still in its height  suddenly there was a slight commotion on deck an order issued from some invisible depth of the cabin was so unexpected that it had to be repeated sternly and peremptorily a bustle forward ensued two or three other shadows sprang up by the bulwarks then the two men bent over the wheel the excelsior slowly swung round on her heel and with a parting salutation to the coast bore away to the northwest and the open sea again  whats up now growled one of the men at the wheel to his companion as they slowly eased up on the helm  taint the skippers for hes drunk as a biled owl and aint stirred out of his bunk since eight bells said the other its the first mates orders but i reckon its the senors idea  then we aint goin on to mazatlan  not this trip i reckon said the third mate joining them  why  the third mate turned and pointed to leeward the line of coast had already sunk enough to permit the faint silhouette of a trail of smoke to define the horizon line of sky  steamer goin in eh  yes dye seeit might be too hot in there  then the jigs up  no suthins to be donenorth of st lucas hush  he made a gesture of silence although the conversation since he had joined them had been carried on in a continuous whisper a figure evidently a passenger had appeared on deck one or two of the foreignlooking crew who had drawn near the group with a certain undue and irregular familiarity now slunk away again  the passenger was a shrewd exact rectangularlooking man who had evidently never entirely succumbed to the freedom of the sea either in his appearance or habits he had not even his sea legs yet and as the barque with the full swell of the pacific now on her weather bow was plunging uncomfortably he was fain to cling to the stanchions this did not however prevent him from noticing the change in her position and captiously resenting it  look hereyou i say what have we turned round for were going away from the land aint we going on to mazatlan  the two men at the wheel looked silently forward with that exasperating unconcern of any landsmans interest peculiar to marine officials the passenger turned impatiently to the third mate  but this aint right you know it was understood that we were going into mazatlan ive got business there  my orders sir said the mate curtly turning away  the practical passenger had been observant enough of seagoing rules to recognize that this reason was final and that it was equally futile to demand an interview with the captain when that gentleman was not visibly on duty he turned angrily to the cabin again  you look disturbed my dear banks i trust you havent slept badly said a very gentle voice from the quarterrail near him or perhaps the ships going about has upset you its a little rougher on this tack  thats just it returned banks sharply we have gone about and were not going into mazatlan at all its scandalous ill speak to the captainill complain to the consigneesive got business at mazatlani expect lettersi  business my dear fellow continued the voice in gentle protest youll have time for business when you get to san francisco and as for letterstheyll follow you there soon enough come over here my boy and say hail and farewell to the mexican coastto the land of montezuma and pizarro come here and see the mountain range from which balboa feasted his eyes on the broad pacific come  the speaker though apparently more at his ease at sea was in dress and appearance fully as unnautical as banks as he leaned over the railing his white closefitting trousers and small patentleather boots gave him a jaunty halfmilitary air which continued up to the second button of his black frockcoat and then so utterly changed its character that it was doubtful if a greater contrast could be conceived than that offered by the widely spread lapels of his coat his low turneddown collar loosely knotted silk handkerchief and the round smoothshaven gentle pacific face above them his straight long black hair shining as if from recent immersion was tucked carefully behind his ears and hung in a heavy even semicircular fringe around the back of his neck where his tall hat usually rested as if to leave his forehead meekly exposed to celestial criticism when he had joined the ship at callao his fellowpassengers rashly trusting to the momentary suggestion of his legs on the gangplank had pronounced him military meeting him later at dinner they had regarded the mild methodistic contour of his breast and shoulders above the table and entertained the wild idea of asking him to evoke a blessing to complete the confusion of his appearance he was called senor perkins for no other reason apparently than his occasional but masterful use of the spanish vernacular  steadying himself by one of the quarter stanchions he waved his right hand oratorically towards the sinking coast  look at it sir one of the finest countries that ever came from the hand of the creator a land overflowing with milk and honey containing sir in that one mountain range the products of the three zonesand yet the abode of the oppressed and downtrodden the land of faction superstition tyranny and political revolution  thats all very well said banks irritably but mazatlan is a wellknown commercial port and has english and american correspondents theres a branch of that boston firmpotter potts  potterthere the new line of steamers is going to stop there regularly  senor perkins soft black eyes fell for an instant as if accidentally on the third mate but the next moment he laughed and throwing back his head inhaled with evident relish a long breath of the sharp salt air  ah he said enthusiastically thats better than all the business you can pick up along a malarious coast open your mouth and try to take in the free breath of the glorious north pacific ah isnt it glorious  wheres the captain said banks with despairing irritation i want to see him  the captain said senor perkins with a bland forgiving smile and a slight lowering of his voice is i fear suffering from an accident of hospitality and keeps his stateroom the captain is a good fellow continued perkins with gentle enthusiasm a good sailor and careful navigator and exceedingly attentive to his passengers i shall certainly propose getting up some testimonial for him  but if hes shut up in his stateroom whos giving the orders began banks angrily  senor perkins put up a small wellkept hand deprecatingly  really my dear boy i suppose the captain cannot be omnipresent some discretion must be left to the other officers they probably know his ideas and what is to be done better than we do you business men trouble yourselves too much about these things you should take them more philosophically for my part i always confide myself trustingly to these people i enter a ship or railroad car with perfect faith i say to myself this captain or this conductor is a responsible man selected with a view to my safety and comfort he understands how to procure that safety and that comfort better than i do he worries himself he spends hours and nights of vigil to look after me and carry me to my destination why should i worry myself who can only assist him by passive obedience why but here he was interrupted by a headlong plunge of the excelsior a feminine shriek that was half a laugh the rapid patter of small feet and sweep of flying skirts down the slanting deck and the sudden and violent contact of a pretty figure  the next moment he had forgotten his philosophy and his companion his business both flew to the assistance of the fair intruder who albeit the least injured of the trio clung breathlessly to the bulwarks  miss keene ejaculated both gentlemen  oh dear i beg your pardon said the young lady reddening with a naive mingling of hilarity and embarrassment but it seemed so stuffy in the cabin and it seemed so easy to get out on deck and pull myself up by the railings and just as i got up here i suddenly seemed to be sliding down the roof of a house  and now that youre here your courage should be rewarded said the senor gallantly assisting her to a settee which he lashed securely you are perfectly safe now he added holding the end of the rope in his hand to allow a slight sliding movement of the seat as the vessel rolled and here is a glorious spectacle for you look the sun is just rising  the young girl glanced over the vast expanse before her with sparkling eyes and a suddenly awakened fancy that checked her embarrassed smile and fixed her pretty parted lips with wonder the level rays of the rising sun striking the white crests of the lifted waves had suffused the whole ocean with a pinkish opal color the darker parts of each wave seemed broken into facets instead of curves and glittered sharply the sea seemed to have lost its fluidity and become vitreous so much so that it was difficult to believe that the waves which splintered across the excelsiors bow did not fall upon her deck with the ring of shattered glass  sindbads valley of diamonds said the young girl in an awed whisper  its a cross sea in the gulf of california so the mate says said banks practically but i dont see why we     the gulf of california repeated the young girl while a slight shade of disappointment passed over her bright face are we then so near  not the california you mean my dear young lady broke in senor perkins but the old peninsula of california which is still a part of mexico it terminates in cape st lucas a hundred miles from here but its still a far cry to san francisco which is in upper california but i fancy you dont seem as anxious as our friend mr banks to get to your journeys end he added with paternal blandness  the look of relief which had passed over miss keenes truthful face gave way to one of slight embarrassment  it hasnt seemed long she said hastily and then added as if to turn the conversation what is this peninsula i remember it on our map at school  its not of much account interrupted banks positively there aint a place on it you ever heard of its a kind of wilderness  i differ from you said senor perkins gravely there are i have been told some old mexican settlements along the coast and there is no reason why the country shouldnt be fruitful but you may have a chance to judge for yourself he continued beamingly since we are not going into mazatlan we may drop in at some of those places for water its all on our way and we shall save the three days we would have lost had we touched mazatlan that he added answering an impatient interrogation in banks eye at least is the captains idea i reckon he laughed and went on still gaylybut whats the use of anticipating why should we spoil any little surprise that our gallant captain may have in store for us ive been trying to convert this business man to my easy philosophy miss keene but he is incorrigible he is actually lamenting his lost chance of hearing the latest news at mazatlan and getting the latest market quotations instead of offering a thanksgiving for another uninterrupted day of freedom in this glorious air  with a half humorous extravagance he unloosed his already loose necktie turned his byron collar still lower and squared his shoulders ostentatiously to the sea breeze accustomed as his two companions were to his habitually extravagant speech it did not at that moment seem inconsistent with the intoxicating morning air and the exhilaration of sky and wave a breath of awakening and resurrection moved over the face of the waters recreation and newborn life sparkled everywhere the past night seemed forever buried in the vast and exundating sea the reefs had been shaken out and every sail set to catch the steadier breeze of the day and as the quickening sun shone upon the dazzling canvas that seemed to envelop them they felt as if wrapped in the purity of a baptismal robe  nevertheless miss keenes eyes occasionally wandered from the charming prospect towards the companionladder presently she became ominously and ostentatiously interested in the view again and at the same moment a young mans head and shoulders appeared above the companionway with a bound he was on the slanting deck moving with the agility and adaptability of youth and approached the group he was quite surprised to find miss keene there so early and miss keene was equally surprised at his appearance notwithstanding the phenomenon had occurred with singular regularity for the last three weeks the two spectators of this gentle comedy received it as they had often received it before with a mixture of apparent astonishment and patronizing unconsciousness and after a decent interval moved away together leaving the young people alone  the hesitancy and awkwardness which usually followed the first moments of their charming isolation were this morning more than usually prolonged  it seems we are not going into mazatlan after all said miss keene at last without lifting her conscious eyes from the sea  no returned the young fellow quickly i heard all about it down below and we had quite an indignation meeting over it i believe mrs markham wanted to head a deputation to wait upon the captain in his berth it seems that the first officer or whosoever is running the ship has concluded weve lost too much time already and were going to strike a beeline for cape st lucas and give mazatlan the goby well save four days by it i suppose it dont make any difference to you miss keene does it  i oh no said the girl hastily  im rather sorry he said hesitatingly  indeed are you tired of the ship she asked saucily  no he replied bluntly but it would have given us four more days togetherfour more days before we separated  he stopped with a heightened color there was a moment of silence and the voices of senor perkins and mr banks in political discussion on the other side of the deck came faintly miss keene laughed  we are a long way from san francisco yet and you may think differently  never he said impulsively  he had drawn closer to her as if to emphasize his speech she cast a quick glance across the deck towards the two disputants and drew herself gently away  do you know she said suddenly with a charming smile which robbed the act of its sting i sometimes wonder if i am really going to san francisco i dont know how it is but somehow i never can see myself there  i wish you did for im going there he replied boldly  without appearing to notice the significance of his speech she continued gravely  i have been so strongly impressed with this feeling at times that it makes me quite superstitious when we had that terrible storm after we left callao i thought it meant thatthat we were all going down and we should never be heard of again  as long as we all went together he said i dont know that it would be the worst thing that could happen i remember that storm miss keene and i rememberhe stopped timidly  what she replied raising her smiling eyes for the first time to his earnest face  i remember sitting up all night near your stateroom with a cork jacket and lots of things id fixed up for you and thinking id die before i trusted you alone in the boat to those rascally lascars of the crew  but how would you have prevented it asked miss keene with a compassionate and halfmaternal amusement  i dont know exactly he said coloring but id have lashed you to some spar or made a raft and got you ashore on some island  and poor mrs markham and mrs brimmeryoud have left them to the boats and the lascars i suppose smiled miss keene  oh somebody would have looked after mrs markham and mrs brimmer wouldnt have gone with anybody that wasnt well connected but whats the use of talking he added ruefully nothing has happened and nothing is going to happen you will see yourself in san francisco even if you dont see me there youre going to a rich brother miss keene who has friends of his own and who wont care to know a poor fellow whom you tolerated on the passage but who dont move in mrs brimmers set and whom mr banks wouldnt indorse commercially  ah you dont know my brother mr brace  nor do you very well miss keene you were saying only last night you hardly remembered him  the young girl sighed  i was very young when he went west she said explanatorily but i dare say i shall recall him what i meant is that he will be very glad to know that i have been so happy here and he will like all those who have made me so  then you have been happy  yes very she had withdrawn her eyes and was looking vaguely towards the companionway everybody has been so kind to me  and you are grateful to all  yes  equally  the ship gave a sudden forward plunge miss keene involuntarily clutched the air with her little hand that had been resting on the settee between them and the young man caught it in his own  equally he repeated with an assumed playfulness that half veiled his anxiety equallyfrom the beaming senor perkins who smiles on all to the gloomy mr hurlstone who smiles on no one  she quickly withdrew her hand and rose i smell the breakfast she said laughingly dont be horrified mr brace but im very hungry she laid the hand she had withdrawn lightly on his arm now help me down to the cabin     chapter ii  another portent   the saloon of the excelsior was spacious for the size of the vessel and was furnished in a style superior to most passengerships of that epoch the sun was shining through the sliding windows upon the fresh and neatly arranged breakfasttable but the presence of the ominous stormracks and partitions for glass and china and the absence of the more delicate passengers still testified to the potency of the gulf of california even those present wore an air of fatigued discontent and the conversation had that jerky interjectional quality which belonged to people with a common grievance but a different individual experience mr winslow had been unable to shave mrs markham incautiously and surreptitiously opening a porthole in her stateroom for a whiff of fresh air while dressing had been shocked by the intrusion of the pacific ocean and was obliged to summon assistance and change her dress jack crosby who had attired himself for tropical shoregoing in white ducks and patent leathers shivered in the keen northwest trades and bewailed the cheap cigars he had expected to buy at mazatlan the entrance of miss keene who seemed to bring with her the freshness and purity of the dazzling outer air stirred the younger men into some gallant attention embarrassed however by a sense of selfreproach  senor perkins alone retained his normal serenity already seated at the table between the two fairheaded children of mrs brimmer he was benevolently performing parental duties in her absence and gently supervising and preparing their victuals even while he carried on an ethnological and political discussion with mrs markham  ah my dear lady continued the senor as he spread a hot biscuit with butter and currant jelly for the youngest miss brimmer i am afraid that with the fastidiousness of your sex you allow your refined instincts against a race who only mix with ours in a menial capacity to prejudice your views of their ability for enlightened selfgovernment that may be true of the aborigines of the old worldlike our friends the lascars among the crew  theyre so snaky dark and deceitfullooking interrupted mrs markham  i might differ from you there and say that the higher blonde types like the anglosaxonto say nothing of the wily greekswere the deceitful races it might be difficult for any of us to say what a sly and deceitful man should be like  oor not detheitfuloor a dood man interpolated the youngest miss brimmer fondly regarding the biscuit  thank you missie beamed the senor but to return our lascar friends mrs markham belong to an earlier asiatic type of civilization already decayed or relapsed to barbarism while the aborigines of the new world now existing have never known itor like the aztecs have perished with it the modern north american aborigine has not yet got beyond the tribal condition mingled with caucasian blood as he is in mexico and central america he is perfectly capable of selfgovernment  then why has he never obtained it asked mrs markham  he has always been oppressed and kept down by colonists of the latin races he has been little better than a slave to his oppressor for the last two centuries said senor perkins with a slight darkening of his soft eyes  injins is pizen whispered mr winslow to miss keene  who would be free you know the poet says ought themselves to light out from the shoulder and all that sort of thing suggested crosby with cheerful vagueness  true but a little assistance and encouragement from mankind generally would help them continued the senor ah my dear mrs markham if they could even count on the intelligent sympathy of women like yourself their independence would be assured and think what a proud privilege to have contributed to such a result to have assisted at the birth of the ideal american republic for such it would bea republic of one blood one faith one history  what on earth or sea ever set the old man off again inquired crosby in an aggrieved whisper its two weeks since hes given us any central american independent flapdoodlelong enough for those nigger injins to have had half a dozen revolutions you know that the vessels that put into san juan have saluted one flag in the morning and have been fired at under another in the afternoon  hush said miss keene hes so kind look at him now taking off the pinafores of those children and tidying them he is kinder to them than their nurse and more judicious than their mother and half his talk with mrs markham now is only to please her because she thinks she knows politics hes always trying to do good to somebody  thats so exclaimed brace eager to share miss keenes sentiments and hes so good to those outlandish niggers in the crew i dont see how the captain could get on with the crew without him hes the only one who can talk their gibberish and keep them quiet ive seen him myself quietly drop down among them when they were wrangling in my opinion continued the young fellow lowering his voice somewhat ostentatiously youll find out when we get to port that hes stopped the beginning of many a mutiny among them  i reckon theyd make short work of a man like him said winslow whose superciliousness was by no means lessened by the community of sentiment between miss keene and brace i reckon his political reforms and his poetical highfalutin wouldnt go as far in the forecastle among live men as it does in the cabin with a lot of women youll more likely find that hes been some sort of steward on a steamer and hes working his passage with us thats where he gets that smooth equallyattentivetoanybody sort of style the way he skirmished around mrs brimmer and mrs markham with a basin the other day when it was so rough convinced me it was a little too professional to suit my style  i suppose that was the reason why you went below so suddenly rejoined brace whose too sensitive blood was beginning to burn in his cheeks and eyes  its a shame to stay below this morning said miss keene instinctively recognizing the cause of the discord and its remedy im going on deck againif i can manage to get there  the three gentlemen sprang to accompany her and in their efforts to keep their physical balance and hers equally the social equilibrium was restored  by noon however the heavy crosssea had abated and the excelsior bore west when she once more rose and fell regularly on the long rhythmical swell of the pacific most of the passengers regained the deck even mrs brimmer and miss chubb ventured from their staterooms and were conveyed to and installed in some state on a temporary divan of cushions and shawls on the lee side for even in this small republic of equal cabin passengers the undemocratic and distinctionloving sex had managed to create a sham exclusiveness mrs brimmer as the daughter of a rich bostonian the sister of a prominent lawyer and the wife of a successful san francisco merchant who was popularly supposed to be partowner of the excelsior was recognized and alternately caressed and hated as their superior a majority of the male passengers owning no actual or prospective matrimonial subjection to those charming toadeaters i am afraid continued to enjoy a mild and debasing equality among themselves mitigated only by the concessions of occasional gallantry to them mrs brimmer was a rather pretty refined welldressed woman whose languid pallor aristocratic spareness and utter fastidiousness did not however preclude a certain nervous intensity which occasionally lit up her weary eyes with a dangerous phosphorescence under their brown fringes equally acceptable was miss chubb her friend and traveling companion a tall wellbred girl with faint salmonpink hair and complexion that darkened to a fiery brown in her shortsighted eyes  between these ladies and mrs markham and miss keene existed an enthusiastic tolerance which however could never be mistaken for a generous rivalry of the greater popularity of miss keene as the recognized belle of the excelsior there could be no question nor was there any from mrs brimmer and her friend the intellectual preeminence of mrs markham was equally and no less ostentatiously granted mrs markham is so clever i delight to hear you converse together mrs brimmer would say to senor perkins though im sure i hardly dare talk to her myself she might easily go into the lecturefieldperhaps she expects to do so in california my dear clarissato miss chubbdont she remind you a little of aunt jane winthrops governess whom we came so near taking to paris with us but couldnt on account of her defective french  when the excelsior banner and south sea bubble was published in lat 15 n and long 105 w to which mrs markham contributed the editorials and essays and senor perkins three columns of sentimental poetry mrs brimmer did not withhold her praise of the fair editor when the excelsior recrossed the line with a suitable tableau vivant and pageant and miss keene as california in white and blue welcomed from the hands of neptune senor perkins and amphitrite mrs markham her fair sister massachusetts mrs brimmer and new york miss chubb mrs brimmer was most enthusiastic of the beauty of miss keene  on the present morning mr banks found his disappointment at not going into mazatlan languidly shared by mrs brimmer that lady even made a place for him on the cushions beside her as she pensively expressed her belief that her husband would be still more disappointed  mr brimmer you know has correspondents at mazatlan and no doubt he has made particular arrangements for our reception and entertainment while there i should not wonder if he was very indignant and if as i fear the officials of the place knowing mr brimmers positionand my own connectionshave prepared to show us social courtesies it may be a graver affair i shouldnt be surprised if our government were obliged to take notice of it there is a captaingeneral of portisnt there i think my husband spoke of him  oh hes probably been shot long ago broke in mr crosby cheerfully they put in a new man every revolution if the wrong partys got in theyve likely shipped your husbands correspondent too and might be waiting to get a reception for you with nigger soldiers and ball cartridges shouldnt wonder if the skipper got wind of something of the kind and thats why he didnt put in if your husband hadnt been so well known you see we might have slipped in all right  mrs brimmer received this speech with the languid obliviousness of perception she usually meted out to this chartered jester  do you really think so mr crosby and would you have been afraid to leave your cabinor are you joking you know i never know when you are it is very dreadful either way  but here miss chubb with ready tact interrupted any possible retort from mr crosby  look she said pointing to some of the other passengers who at a little distance had grouped about the first mate in animated discussion i wonder what those gentlemen are so interested about do go and see  before he could reply mr winslow detaching himself from the group hurried towards them  heres a row hurlstone is missing cant be found anywhere they think hes fallen overboard  the two frightened exclamations from miss chubb and mrs brimmer diverted attention from the sudden paleness of miss keene who had impulsively approached them  impossible she said hurriedly  i fear it is so said brace who had followed winslow although he added in a lower tone with an angry glance at the latter that brute need not have blustered it out to frighten everybody theyre searching the ship again but there seems no hope he hasnt been seen since last night he was supposed to be in his stateroombut as nobody missed himyou know how odd and reserved he wasit was only when the steward couldnt find him and began to inquire that everybody remembered they hadnt seen him all day you are frightened miss keene pray sit down that fellow winslow ought to have had more sense  it seems so horrible that nobody knew it said the young girl shuddering that we sat here laughing and talking while perhaps he wasgood heavens whats that  a gruff order had been given in the bustle that ensued the ship began to fall off to leeward a number of the crew had sprung to the davits of the quarter boat  were going about and theyre lowering a boat thats all but its as good as hopeless said brace the accident must have happened before daylight or it would have been seen by the watch it was probably long before we came on deck he added gently so comfort yourself miss keene you could have seen nothing  it seems so dreadful murmured the young girl that he wasnt even missed why she said suddenly raising her soft eyes to brace you must have noticed his absence why even ishe stopped with a slight confusion that was however luckily diverted by the irrepressible winslow  the skippers been routed out at last and is giving orders he dont look as if his hat fitted him any too comfortably this morning does he he laughed as a stout grizzled man with congested face and eyes and a peremptory voice husky with alcoholic irritation suddenly appeared among the group by the wheel i reckon hes cursing his luck at having to heaveto and lose this wind  but for a human creatures life exclaimed mrs markham in horror  thats just it layingto now aint going to save anybodys life and he knows it hes doin it for show just for a clean record in the log and to satisfy you people here whod kick up a row if he didnt  then you believe hes lost said miss keene with glistening eyes  there aint a doubt of it returned winslow shortly  i dont agree with you said a gentle voice  they turned quickly towards the benevolent face of senor perkins who had just joined them  i differ from my young friend continued the senor courteously because the accident must have happened at about daybreak when we were close inshore it would not be impossible for a good swimmer to reach the land or even continued senor perkins in answer to the ray of hope that gleamed in miss keenes soft eyes for him to have been picked up by some passing vessel the smoke of a large steamer was sighted between us and the land at about that time  a steamer ejaculated banks eagerly that was one of the new line with the mails how provoking  he was thinking of his lost letters miss keene turned heartsick away worse than the ghastly interruption to their easy idyllic life was this grim revelation of selfishness she began to doubt if even the hysterical excitement of her sister passengers was not merely a pleasant titillation of their bored and inactive nerves  i believe the senor is right miss keene said brace taking her aside and ill tell you why he stopped looked around him and went on in a lower voice there are some circumstances about the affair which look more like deliberation than an accident he has left nothing behind him of any value or that gives any clue if it was a suicide he would have left some letter behind for somebodypeople always do you know at such timesand he would have chosen the open sea it seems more probable that he threw himself overboard with the intention of reaching the shore  but why should he want to leave the ship echoed the young girl simply  perhaps he found out that we were not going to mazatlan and this was his only chance it must have happened just as the ship went about and stood off from shore again  but i dont understand continued miss keene with a pretty knitting of her brows why he should be so dreadfully anxious to get ashore now  the young fellow looked at her with the superior smile of youthful sagacity  suppose he had particular reasons for not going to san francisco where our laws could reach him suppose he had committed some offense suppose he was afraid of being questioned or recognized  the young girl rose indignantly  this is really too shameful who dare talk like that  brace colored quickly  who why everybody he stammered for a moment abandoning his attitude of individual acumen its the talk of the ship  is it and before they know whether hes alive or deadperhaps even while he is still struggling with deathall they can do is to take his character away she repeated with flashing eyes  and im even worse than they are he returned his temper rising with his color i ought to have known i was talking to one of his friends instead of one whom i thought was mine i beg your pardon  he turned away as miss keene apparently not heeding his pique crossed the deck and entered into conversation with mrs markham  it is to be feared that she found little consolation among the other passengers or even those of her own sex whom this profound event had united in a certain freemasonry of sympathy and interestto the exclusion of their former cliques she soon learned as the return of the boats to the ship and the ship to her course might have clearly told her that there was no chance of recovering the missing passenger she learned that the theory advanced by brace was the one generally held by them but with an added romance of detail that excited at once their commiseration and admiration mrs brimmer remembered to have heard him the second or third night out from callao groaning in his stateroom but having mistakenly referred the emotion to ordinary seasickness she had no doubt lost an opportunity for confidential disclosure i am sure she added that had somebody as resolute and practical as you dear mrs markham approached him the next day he would have revealed his sorrow miss chubb was quite certain that she had seen him one night in tears by the quarter railing i saw his eyes glistening under his slouched hat as i passed i remember thinking at the time that he oughtnt to have been left alone with such a dreadful temptation before him to slip overboard and end his sorrow or his crime mrs markham also remembered that it was about five oclockor was it sixthat morning when she distinctly thought she had heard a splash and she was almost impelled to get up and look out of the bullseye she should never forgive herself for resisting that impulse for she was positive now that she would have seen his ghastly face in the water some indignation was felt that the captain after a cursory survey of his stateroom had ordered it to be locked until his fate was more positively known and the usual seals placed on his effects for their delivery to the authorities at san francisco it was believed that some clue to his secret would be found among his personal chattels if only in the form of a keepsake a locket or a bit of jewelry miss chubb had noticed that he wore a seal ring but not on the engagementfinger in some vague feminine way it was admitted without discussion that one of their own sex was mixed up in the affair and with the exception of miss keene general credence was given to the theory that mazatlan contained his loadstarthe fatal partner and accomplice of his crime the siren that allured him to his watery grave i regret to say that the facts gathered by the gentlemen were equally ineffective the steward who had attended the missing man was obliged to confess that their most protracted and confidential conversation had been on the comparative efficiency of ship biscuits and soda crackers mr banks who was known to have spoken to him could only remember that one warm evening in reply to a casual remark about the weather the missing man burying his ears further in the turnedup collar of his peajacket had stated it was cold enough to freeze the ears off a brass monkeya remark no doubt sir intended to convey a reason for his hiding his own only senor perkins retained his serene optimism unimpaired  take my word for it we shall yet hear good news of our missing friend let us at least believe it until we know otherwise ah my dear mrs markham why should the unknown always fill us with apprehension its surprises are equally often agreeable  but we have all been so happy before this and this seems such an unnecessary and cruel awakening said miss keene lifting her sad eyes to the speaker that i cant help thinking its the beginning of the end good heavens whats that  she had started at the dark figure of one of the foreignlooking sailors who seemed to have suddenly risen out of the deck beside them  the senor perkins he said with an apologetic gesture of his hand to his hatless head  you want me my good man asked senor perkins paternally  si senor the mate wishes to see the patrono he said in spanish  i will come presently  the sailor hesitated senor perkins took a step nearer to him benignantly the man raised his eyes to senor perkins and said  vigilancia  bueno returned the senor gently excuse me ladies for a moment  perhaps it is some news of poor mr hurlstone said miss keene with an instinctive girlish movement of hope  who knows returned senor perkins waving his hand as he gayly tripped after his guide let us believe in the best dear young lady the best     chapter iii  vigilancia   without exchanging another word with his escort senor perkins followed him to the main hatch where they descended and groped their way through the half obscurity of the lower deck here they passed one or two shadows that recognizing the senor seemed to draw aside in a half awed half suppressed shyness as of caged animals in the presence of their trainer at the forehatch they again descended passing a figure that appeared to be keeping watch at the foot of the ladder and almost instantly came upon a group lit up by the glare of a bullseye lantern it was composed of the first and second mate a viciouslooking peruvian sailor with a bandaged head and to the senors astonishment the missing passenger hurlstone seated on the deck heavily ironed  tell him what you know pedro said the first mate to the peruvian sailor curtly  it was just daybreak patrono before we put about began the man in spanish that i thought i saw some one gliding along towards the forehatch but i lost sight of him after we had tumbled up to go on the other tack i heard a noise in the forehold i went down and found him pointing to hurlstone hiding there he had some provisions stowed away beside him and that package i grabbed him patrono he broke away and struck me herehe pointed to his still wet bandageand would have got out overboard through the port but the second mate heard the row and came down just in time to stop him  when was this asked senor perkins  guardia di diana  you were chattering you fellows  quien sabe said the peruvian lifting his shoulders  how does he explain himself  he refuses to speak  take off his irons said senor perkins in english  butexpostulated the first mate with a warning gesture  i saidtake off his irons repeated senor perkins in a dry and unfamiliar voice  the two mates released the shackles the prisoner raised his eyes to senor perkins he was a slightly built man of about thirty fairhaired and hollowcheeked his short upper lip was lifted over his teeth as if from hurried or labored breathing but his features were regular and determined and his large blue eyes shone with a strange abstraction of courage and fatuity  that will do continued the senor in the same tone now leave him with me  the two mates looked at each other and hesitated but at a glance from perkins turned and ascended the ladder again the peruvian alone remained  go said the senor sharply  the man cast a vindictive look at the prisoner and retreated sullenly  did he tell you said the prisoner looking after the sailor grimly that i tried to bribe him to let me go but that i couldnt reach his figure he wanted too much he thought i had some stolen money or valuables here he added with a bitter laugh pointing to the package that lay beside him  and you hadnt said perkins shortly  no  i believe you and now my young friend said perkins with a singular return of his beaming gentleness since those two efficient and competent officers and this energetic but discourteous seaman are gone would you mind telling me what you were hiding for  the prisoner raised his eyes on his questioner for the last three weeks he had lived in the small community of which the senor was a prominent member but he scarcely recognized him now  what if i refuse he said  the senor shrugged his shoulders  those two excellent men would feel it their duty to bring the peruvian to the captain and i should be called to interpret to him  and i should throw myself overboard the first chance i got i would have done so ten minutes ago but the mate stopped me  his eye glistened with the same fatuous determination he had shown at first there was no doubt he would do as he said  i believe you would said the senor benevolently but i see no present necessity for that nor for any trouble whatever if you will kindly tell me what i am to say  the young mans eyes fell  i did try to conceal myself in the hold he said bluntly i intended to remain there hidden while the ship was at mazatlan i did not know until now that the vessel had changed her course  and how did you believe your absence would be accounted for asked the senor blandly  i thought it would be supposed that i had fallen overboard before we entered mazatlan  so that anybody seeking you there would not find you and you would be believed to be dead  yes he raised his eyes quickly to senor perkins again i am neither a thief nor a murderer he said almost savagely but i do not choose to be recognized by any one who knows me on this side of the grave  senor perkins eyes sought his and for an instant seemed to burn through the singular fatuous mist that veiled them  my friend he said cheerfully after a moments pause you have just had a providential escape i repeat ita most providential escape indeed if i were inclined to prophesy i would say you were a man reserved for some special good fortune  the prisoner stared at him with angry amazement  you are a confirmed somnambulist excuse me continued the senor with a soft deprecating gesture you are of course unaware of itmost victims of that singular complaint are or at least fail to recognize the extent of their aberration in your case it has only been indicated by a profound melancholy and natural shunning of society in a paroxysm of your disorder you rise in the night fully dress yourself and glide as unconsciously along the deck in pursuance of some vague fancy you pass the honest but energetic sailor who has just left us who thinks you are a phantom and fails to give the alarm you are precipitated by a lurch of the ship through an open hatchway the shock renders you insensible until you are discovered and restored  and who will believe this pretty story said the young man scornfully  the honest sailor who picked you up who has related it in his own picturesque tongue to me who will in turn interpret it to the captain and the other passengers replied senor perkins blandly  and what of the two mates who were here said the prisoner hesitatingly  they are two competent officers who are quite content to carry out the orders of their superiors and who understand their duty too well to interfere with the reports of their subordinates on which these orders are based mr brooks the first officer though fairly intelligent and a good reader of history is only imperfectly acquainted with the languages and mr mcarthys knowledge of spanish is confined to a few objurgations which generally preclude extended conversation  and who are you said hurlstone more calmly who are willing to do this for a stranger  a friendequally of yours the captains and the other passengers replied senor perkins pleasantly a man who believes you my dear sir and even if he did not sees no reason to interrupt the harmony that has obtained in our little community during our delightful passage were any scandal to occur were you to carry out your idea of throwing yourself overboard it would to say nothing of my personal regret produce a discord for which there is no necessity and from which no personal good can be derived here at least your secret is secure for even i do not ask what it is we meet here on an equality based on our own conduct and courtesy to each other limited by no antecedent prejudice and restrained by no thought of the future in a little while we shall be separatedwhy should it not be as friends why should we not look back upon our little world of this ship as a happy one  hurlstone gazed at the speaker with a troubled air it was once more the quaint benevolent figure whom he had vaguely noted among the other passengers and as vaguely despised he hesitated a moment and then half timidly half reservedly extended his hand  i thank you he said at least for not asking my secret perhaps if it was only  your ownyou might tell it interrupted the senor gayly i understand i see you recognize my principle there is no necessity of your putting yourself to that pain or another to that risk and now my young friend time presses i must say a word to our friends above who are waiting and i shall see that you are taken privately to your stateroom while most of the other passengers are still on deck if you would permit yourself the weakness of allowing the steward to carry or assist you it would be better let me advise you that the excitement of the last three hours has not left you in your full strength you must really give me the pleasure of spreading the glad tidings of your safety among the passengers who have been so terribly alarmed  they will undoubtedly be relieved said hurlstone with ironical bitterness  you wrong them returned the senor with gentle reproach especially the ladies  the voice of the first mate from above here checked his further speech and perhaps prevented him as he quickly reascended the upper deck from noticing the slight embarrassment of his prisoner  the senors explanations to the mate were evidently explicit and brief in a few moments he reappeared with the steward and his assistant  lean on these men he said to hurlstone significantly and do not overestimate your strength thank heaven no bones are broken and you are only bruised by the fall with a little rest i think we can get along without laying the captains medicinechest under contribution our kind friend mr brooks has had the lower deck cleared so that you may gain your stateroom without alarming the passengers or fatiguing yourself  he pressed hurlstones hand as the latter resigned himself to the steward and was half led half supported through the gloom of the lower deck senor perkins remained for an instant gazing after him with even more than his usual benevolence suddenly his arm was touched almost rudely he turned and encountered the lowering eyes of the peruvian sailor  and what is to be done for me said the man roughly in spanish  you  yes whos to pay for this he pointed to his bandaged head  without changing his bland expression senor perkins apparently allowed his soft black eyes to rest as if fondly on the angry pupils of the peruvian the eyes of the latter presently sought the ground  my dear yoto said senor perkins softly i scarcely think that this question of personal damage can be referred to the state i will however look into it meantime let me advise you to control your enthusiasm too much zeal in a subordinate is even more fatal than laxity for the rest son be vigilantand peaceful thou hast meant well much shall beforgiven thee for the present vamos  he turned on his heel and ascended to the upper deck here he found the passengers thrilling with a vague excitement a few brief orders a few briefer explanations dropped by the officers had already whetted curiosity to the keenest point the senor was instantly beset with interrogations gentle compassionate with wellrounded periods he related the singular accident that had befallen mr hurlstone and his providential escape from almost certain death at the most he has now only the exhaustion of the shock from which a day of perfect rest will recover him but he added deprecatingly at present he ought not to be disturbed or excited  the story was received by those fellowpassengers who had been strongest in their suspicions of hurlstones suicide or flight with a keen sense of discomfiture only mitigated by a humorous perception of the cause of the accident it was agreed that a man whose ludicrous infirmity had been the cause of putting the ship out of her course and the passengers out of their comfortable security could not be wronged by attributing to him manlier and more criminal motives a somnambulist on shipboard was clearly a humorous object who might however become a bore it all accounts for his being so deuced quiet and reserved in the daytime said crosby facetiously he couldnt keep it up the whole twentyfour hours if hed only given us a little more of his company when he was awake he wouldnt have gallivanted round at night and wed have been thirty miles nearer port equal amusement was created by the humorous suggestion that the unfortunate man had never been entirely awake during the voyage and that he would now probably for the first time really make the acquaintance of his fellowvoyagers listening to this badinage with bland tolerance senor perkins no doubt felt that for the maintenance of that perfect amity he so ardently apostrophized it was just as well that hurlstone was in his stateroom and out of hearing  he would have been more satisfied however had he been permitted to hear the feminine comments on this incident in the eyes of the lady passengers mr hurlstone was more a hero than ever his mysterious malady invested him with a vague and spiritual interest his escape from the awful fate reserved to him in their excited fancy gave him the eclat of having actually survived it while the supposed real incident of his fall through the hatchway lent him the additional lustre of a wounded and crippled man that prostrate condition of active humanity which so irresistibly appeals to the feminine imagination as segregating their victim from the distractions of his own sex and as it were delivering him helpless into their hands was at once their opportunity and his all the ladies volunteered to nurse him it was with difficulty that mrs brimmer and mrs markham reinforced with bandages flannels and liniments and supported by different theories could be kept from the door of his stateroom jellies potted meats and delicacies from their private stores appeared on trays at his bedside to be courteously declined by the senor perkins in his new functions of a benevolent type of sancho panza physician to say that this pleased the gentle optimism of the senor is unnecessary even while his companion writhed under the sting of this enforced compassion the good man beamed philosophically upon him  take care or i shall end this cursed farce in my own way said hurlstone ominously his eyes again filming with a vague desperation  my dear boy returned the senor gently reflect upon the situation your suffering real or implied produces in the hearts of these gentle creatures a sympathy which not only exalts and sustains their higher natures but i conscientiously believe gratifies and pleases their lower ones why should you deny them this opportunity of indulging their twofold organisms and beguiling the tedium of the voyage merely because of some erroneous exhibition of fact  later senor perkins might have added to this exposition the singularly stimulating effect which hurlstones supposed peculiarity had upon the feminine imagination but there were some secrets which were not imparted even to him and it was only to each other that the ladies confided certain details and reminiscences for it now appeared that they had all heard strange noises and stealthy steps at night and mrs brimmer was quite sure that on one occasion the handle of her stateroom door was softly turned mrs markham also remembered distinctly that only a week before being unable to sleep she had ventured out into the saloon in a dressinggown to get her diary which she had left with a portfolio on a chair that she had a sudden consciousness of another presence in the saloon although she could distinguish nothing by the dim light of the swinging lantern and that after quickly returning to her room she was quite positive she heard a door close but the most surprising reminiscence developed by the late incident was from mrs brimmers nurse susan as it apparently demonstrated the fact that mr hurlstone not only walked but talked in his sleep it possessed a more mysterious significance it seemed that susan was awakened one night by the sound of voices and opening her door softly saw a figure which she at first supposed to be the senor perkins but which she now was satisfied was poor mr hurlstone as there was no one else to be seen the voices must have proceeded from that single figure and being in a strange and unknown tongue were inexpressibly weird and awful when pressed to remember what was said she could only distinguish one worda womans namevirgilvigilno virginescia  it must have been one of those creatures at callao whose pictures you can buy for ten cents said mrs brimmer  if it is one of them susan must have made a mistake in the first two syllables of the name said mrs markham grimly  but surely miss keene said miss chubb turning to that young lady who had taken only the part of a passive listener to this colloquy and was gazing over the railing at the sinking sun surely you can tell us something about this poor young man if i dont mistake you are the only person he ever honored with his conversation  and only once i think said the young girl slightly coloring he happened to be sitting next to me on deck and i believe he spoke only out of politeness at least he seemed very quiet and reserved and talked on general topics and i thought very intelligently ishould have thoughti mean she continued hesitatinglyi thought he was an educated gentleman  that isnt at all inconsistent with photographs or sleepwalking said mrs brimmer with one of her vague simplicities uncle quincey brought home a whole sheaf of those women whom he said hed met and one of my cousins who was educated at heidelberg used to walk in his sleep as it were all over europe  did you notice anything queer in his eyes miss keene asked miss chubb vivaciously  miss keene had noticed that his eyes were his best feature albeit somewhat abstracted and melancholy but for some vague reason she could not explain herself she answered hurriedly that she had seen nothing very particular in them  well said mrs markham positively when hes able to be out again i shall consider it my duty to look him up and try to keep him sufficiently awake in the daytime to ensure his resting better at night  no one can do it dear mrs markham better than you and no one would think of misunderstanding your motives said mrs brimmer sweetly but its getting late and the air seems to be ever so much colder captain bunker says its because we are really nearing the californian coast it seems so odd mr brimmer wrote to me that it was so hot in sacramento that you could do something with eggs in the suni forget what  hatch them suggested miss chubb  i think so returned mrs brimmer rising let us go below  the three ladies rustled away but miss keene throwing a wrap around her shoulders lingered by the railing with one little hand supporting her round chin she leaned over the darkly heaving water she was thinking of her brief and only interview with that lonely man whose name was now in everybodys mouth but who until today had been passed over by them with an unconcern equal to his own and yet to her refined and delicately feminine taste there appeared no reason why he should not have mingled with his fellows and have accepted the homage from them that she was instinctively ready to give he seemed to her like a gentlemanand something more in her limited but joyous knowledge of the worlda knowledge gathered in the happy schoollife of an orphan who but faintly remembered and never missed a parents careshe knew nothing of the mysterious dominance of passion suffering or experience in fashioning the outward expression of men and saw only that mr hurlstone was unlike any other that unlikeness was fascinating he had said very little to her in that very brief period he had not talked to her with the general gallantry which she already knew her prettiness elicited without knowing why she felt there was a subtle flattery in his tacit recognition of that other self of which she as yet knew so little she could not remember what they had talked aboutnor why nor was she offended that he had never spoken to her since nor gone beyond a grave lifting of his hat to her when he passed     chapter iv  in the fog   by noon of the following day the coast of the peninsula of california had been sighted to leeward the lower temperature of the northwest trades had driven mrs brimmer and miss chubb into their staterooms to consult their wardrobes in view of an impending change from the light muslins and easy languid toilets of the tropics that momentous question for the moment held all other topics in abeyance and even mrs markham and miss keene though they still kept the deck in shawls and wraps sighed over this feminine evidence of the gentle passing of their summer holiday the gentlemen had already mounted their peajackets and overcoats with the single exception of senor perkins who in chivalrous compliment to the elements still bared his unfettered throat and forehead to the breeze the aspect of the coast as seen from the excelsiors deck seemed to bear out mr banks sweeping indictment of the day before a few low domelike hills yellow and treeless as sand dunes scarcely raised themselves above the horizon the air too appeared to have taken upon itself a dry asperity the sun shone with a hard practical brilliancy miss keene raised her eyes to senor perkins with a pretty impatience that she sometimes indulged in as one of the privileges of accepted beauty and petted youth  i dont think much of your peninsula she said poutingly it looks dreadfully flat and uninteresting it was a great deal nicer on the other coast or even at sea  perhaps you are judging hastily my dear young friend said senor perkins with habitual tolerance i have heard that behind those hills and hidden from sight in some of the canyons are perfect little edens of beauty and fruitfulness they are like some ardent natures that cover their approaches with the ashes of their burntup fires but only do it the better to keep intact their glowing vivifying central heat  how very poetical mr perkins said mrs markham with blunt admiration you ought to put that into verse  i have returned senor perkins modestly they are some reflections oni hardly dare call them an apostrophe tothe crater of colima if you will permit me to read them to you this evening i shall be charmed i hope also to take that opportunity of showing you the verses of a gifted woman not yet known to fame mrs euphemia mcorkle of peoria illinois  mrs markham coughed slightly the gifted mcorkle was already known to her through certain lines quoted by the senor and the entire cabin had one evening fled before a larger and more ambitious manuscript of the fair illinoisian miss keene who dreaded the reappearance of this poetical phantom that seemed to haunt the senors fancy could not however forget that she had been touched on that occasion by a kindly moisture of eye and tremulousness of voice in the reader and in spite of the hopeless bathos of the composition she had forgiven him though she did not always understand senor perkins she liked him too well to allow him to become ridiculous to others and at the present moment she promptly interposed with a charming assumption of coquetry  you forget that you promised to let me read the manuscript first and in private and that you engaged to give me my revenge at chess this evening but do as you like you are all fast becoming faithless i suppose it is because our holiday is drawing to a close and we shall soon forget we ever had any or be ashamed we ever played so long everybody seems to be getting nervous and fidgety and preparing for civilization again mr banks for the last few days has dressed himself regularly as if he were going down town to his office and writes letters in the corner of the saloon as if it were a countinghouse mr crosby and mr winslow do nothing but talk of their prospects and i believe they are drawing up articles of partnership together here is mr brace frightening me by telling me that my brother will lock me up to keep the rich miners from laying their bags of gold dust at my feet and mrs brimmer and miss chubb assure me that i havent a decent gown to go ashore in  you forget mr hurlstone said brace with illconcealed bitterness he seems to have time enough on his hands and i dare say would sympathize with you you women like idle men  if we do its because only the idle men have the time to amuse us retorted miss keene but she added with a laugh i suppose im getting nervous and fidgety myself for i find myself every now and then watching the officers and men and listening to the orders as if something were going to happen again i never felt so before i never used to have the least concern in what you call the working of the ship and nowher voice which had been half playful half pettish suddenly became graveand nowlook at the mate and those men forward there certainly is something going on or is going to happen what are they looking at  the mate had clambered halfway up the main ratlines and was looking earnestly to windward two or three of the crew on the forecastle were gazing in the same direction the group of cabinpassengers on the quarterdeck following their eyes saw what appeared to be another low shore on the opposite bow  why theres another coast there said mrs markham  its a fogbank said senor perkins gravely he quickly crossed the deck exchanged a few words with the officer and returned miss keene who had felt a sense of relief nevertheless questioned his face as he again stood beside her but he had recovered his beaming cheerfulness its nothing to alarm you he said answering her glance but it may mean delay if we cant get out of it you dont mind that i know  no replied the young girl smiling besides it would be a new experience weve had winds and calmswe only want fog now to complete our adventures unless its going to make everybody cross she continued with a mischievous glance at brace  youll find it wont improve the temper of the officers said crosby who had joined the group theres nothing sailors hate more than a fog they can go to sleep in a hurricane between the rolls of a ship but a fog keeps them awake its the one thing they cant shirk theres the skipper tumbled up too the old man looks wrathy dont he but its no use now were going slap into it and the winds failing  it was true in the last few moments all that vast glistening surface of metallic blue which stretched so far to windward appeared to be slowly eaten away as if by some dull corroding acid the distant horizon line of sea and sky was still distinct and sharply cut but the whole water between them had grown gray as if some invisible shadow had passed in midair across it the actual fog bank had suddenly lost its resemblance to the shore had lifted as a curtain and now seemed suspended over the ship gradually it descended the topgallant and topsails were lost in this mysterious vapor yet the horizon line still glimmered faintly then another mist seemed to rise from the sea and meet it in another instant the deck whereon they stood shrank to the appearance of a raft adrift in a faint gray sea with the complete obliteration of all circumambient space the wind fell their isolation was complete  it was notable that the first and most peculiar effect of this misty environment was the absolute silence the empty invisible sails above did not flap the sheets and halyards hung limp even the faint creaking of an unseen block overhead was so startling as to draw every eye upwards muffled orders from viewless figures forward were obeyed by phantoms that moved noiselessly through the gray sea that seemed to have invaded the deck even the passengers spoke in whispers or held their breath in passive groups as if fearing to break a silence so replete with awe and anticipation it was next noticed that the vessel was subjected to some vague motion the resistance of the water had ceased the waves no longer hissed under her bows or nestled and lapped under her counter a dreamy irregular and listless rocking had taken the place of the regular undulations at times a faint and half delicious vertigo seemed to overcome their senses the ship was drifting  captain bunker stood near the bitts where his brief orders were transmitted to the man at the almost useless wheel at his side senor perkins beamed with unshaken serenity and hopefully replied to the captains half surly half anxious queries  by the chart we should be well east of los lobos island dye see he said impatiently you dont happen to remember the direction of the current off shore when you were running up here  its five years ago said the senor modestly but i remember we kept well to the west to weather cape st eugenio my impression is that there was a strong northwesterly current setting north of ballenos bay  and were in it now said captain bunker shortly how near st roque does it set  within a mile or two i should keep away more to the west said senor perkins and clear  i aint asking you to run the ship interrupted captain bunker sharply hows her head now mr brooks  the seamen standing near cast a rapid glance at senor perkins but not a muscle of his bland face moved or betrayed a consciousness of the insult whatever might have been the feeling towards him at that moment the sailorsafter their fashionadmired their captain strong masterful and imperious the danger that had cleared his eye throat and brain and left him once more the daring and skillful navigator they knew wiped out of their shallow minds the vicious habit that had sunk him below their level  it had now become perceptible to even the inexperienced eyes of the passengers that the excelsior was obeying some new and profound impulse the vague drifting had ceased and in its place had come a mysterious but regular movement in which the surrounding mist seemed to participate until fog and vessel moved together towards some unseen but welldefined bourne in vain had the boats of the excelsior manned by her crew endeavored with a towingline to check or direct the inexplicable movement in vain had captain bunker struggled with all the skilled weapons of seamanship against his invincible foe wrapped in the impenetrable fog the ship moved ghostlike to what seemed to be her doom  the anxiety of the officers had not as yet communicated itself to the passengers those who had been most nervous in the ordinary onset of wind and wave looked upon the fog as a phenomenon whose only disturbance might be delay to miss keene this conveyed no annoyance rather that placid envelopment of cloud soothed her fancy she submitted herself to its soft embraces and to the mysterious onward movement of the ship as if it were part of a youthful dream once she thought of the ship of sindbad and that fatal loadstone mountain with an awe that was however half a pleasure  you are not frightened miss keene said a voice near her  she started slightly it was the voice of mr hurlstone so thick was the fog that his face and figure appeared to come dimly out of it like a part of her dreaming fancy without replying to his question she said quickly  you are better then mr hurlstone wewe were all so frightened for you  an angry shadow crossed his thin face and he hesitated after a pause he recovered himself and said  i was saying you were taking all this very quietly i dont think theres much danger myself and if we should go ashore here  well suggested miss keene ignoring this first intimation of danger in her surprise at the mans manner  well we should all be separated only a few days earlier thats all  more frightened at the strange bitterness of his voice than by the sense of physical peril she was vaguely moving away towards the dimly outlined figures of her companions when she was arrested by a voice forward there was a slight murmur among the passengers  what did he say asked miss keene what are breakers ahead  hurlstone did not reply  where away asked a second voice  the murmur still continuing captain bunkers hoarse voice pierced the gloomsilence fore and aft  the first voice repeated faintly  on the larboard bow  there was another silence again the voice repeated as if mechanically  breakers  where away  on the starboard beam  we are in some passage or channel said hurlstone quietly  the young girl glanced round her and saw for the first time that in one of those inexplicable movements she had not understood the other passengers had been withdrawn into a limited space of the deck as if through some authoritative orders while she and her companion had been evidently overlooked a couple of sailors who had suddenly taken their positions by the quarterboats strengthened the accidental separation  is there some one taking care of you he asked half hesitatingly mr braceperkinsor  no she replied quickly why  well we are very near the boat in an emergency and you might allow me to stay here and see you safe in it  but the other ladies mrs markham and  theyll take their turn after you he said grimly picking up a wrap from the railing and throwing it over her shoulders  buti dont understand she stammered more embarrassed by the situation than by any impending peril  there is very little danger i think he added impatiently there is scarcely any sea the ship has very little way on and these breakers are not over rocks listen  she tried to listen at first she heard nothing but the occasional low voice of command near the wheel then she became conscious of a gentle soothing murmur through the fog to the right she had heard such a murmuring accompaniment to her girlish dreams at newport on a still summer night there was nothing to frighten her but it increased her embarrassment  and you she said awkwardly raising her soft eyes  oh if you are all going off in the boats by jove i think ill stick to the ship he returned with a frankness that would have been rude but for its utter abstraction  miss keene was silent the ship moved gently onward the monotonous cry of the leadsman in the chains was the only sound audible the soundings were indicating shoaler water although the murmuring of the surf had been left far astern the almost imperceptible darkening of the mist on either beam seemed to show that the excelsior was entering some landlocked passage the movement of the vessel slackened the tide was beginning to ebb suddenly a wave of faroff clamor faint but sonorous broke across the ship there was an interval of breathless silence and then it broke again and more distinctly it was the sound of bells  the thrill of awe which passed through passengers and crew at this spiritual challenge from the vast and intangible void around them had scarcely subsided when the captain turned to senor perkins with a look of surly interrogation the senor brushed his hat further back on his head wiped his brow and became thoughtful  its too far south for rosario he said deprecatingly and the only other mission i know of is san carlos and thats far inland but that is the angelus and those are mission bells surely  the captain turned to mr brooks the voice of invisible command again passed along the deck and with a splash in the water and the rattling of chains the excelsior swung slowly round on her anchor on the bosom of what seemed a placid bay  miss keene who in her complete absorption had listened to the phantom bells with an almost superstitious exaltation had forgotten the presence of her companion and now turned towards him but he was gone the imminent danger he had spoken of half slightingly he evidently considered as past he had taken the opportunity offered by the slight bustle made by the lowering of the quarterboat and the departure of the mate on a voyage of discovery to mingle with the crowd and regain his stateroom with the anchoring of the vessel the momentary restraint was relaxed the passengers were allowed to pervade the deck and mrs markham and mr brace simultaneously rushed to miss keenes side  we were awfully alarmed for you my dear said mrs markham until we saw you had a protector do tell mewhat did he say he must have thought the danger great to have broken the senors orders and come upon deck what did he talk about  with a vivid recollection in her mind of mr hurlstones contemptuous ignoring of the other ladies miss keene became slightly embarrassed her confusion was not removed by the consciousness that the jealous eyes of brace were fixed upon her  perhaps he thought it was night and walked upon deck in his sleep remarked brace sarcastically hes probably gone back to bed  he offered me his protection very politely and begged to remain to put me in the boat in case of danger said miss keene recovering herself and directing her reply to mrs markham i think that others have made me the same kind of offerwho were wide awake she added mischievously to brace  i wouldnt be too sure that they were not foolishly dreaming too returned brace in a lower voice  i should think we all were asleep or dreaming here said mrs markham briskly nobody seems to know where we are and the only man who might guess itsenor perkinshas gone off in the boat with the mate  were not a mile from shore and a catholic church said crosby who had joined them i just left mrs brimmer who is very high church you know quite overcome by these angelus bells shes been entreating the captain to let her go ashore for vespers it wouldnt be a bad idea if we could only see what sort of a place weve got to it wouldnt do to go feeling round the settlement in the darkwould it hallo whats that oh by jove thatll finish mrs brimmer sure  hush said miss keene impulsively  he stopped the longdrawn cadence of a chant in thin clear soprano voices swept through the fog from the invisible shore rose high above the ship and then fell dying away with immeasurable sweetness and melancholy even when it had passed a lingering melody seemed to fill the deck two or three of the foreign sailors crossed themselves devoutly the other passengers withheld their speech and looked at each other afraid to break the charm by speech they listened again but in vain an infinite repose followed that seemed to pervade everything  it was broken at last by the sound of oars in their rowlocks the boat was returning but it was noticed that the fog had slightly lifted from the surface of the water for the boat was distinctly visible two cables length from the ship as she approached and it was seen that besides the first officer and senor perkins there were two strangers in the boat everybody rushed to the side for a nearer view of those strange inhabitants of the unknown shore but the boats crew suddenly ceased rowing and lay on their oars until an indistinct hail and reply passed between the boat and ship there was a bustle forward an unexpected thunder from the excelsiors eightpounder at the bow port captain bunker and the second mate ranged themselves at the companionway and the passengers for the first time became aware that they were participating at the reception of visitors of distinction as two strange and bizarre figures stepped upon the deck     chapter v  todos santos   it was evident that the two strangers represented some exalted military and ecclesiastical authority this was shown in their dressa longforgotten half mediaeval costume that to the imaginative spectator was perfectly in keeping with their mysterious advent and to the more practical as startling as a masquerade the foremost figure wore a broadbrimmed hat of soft felt with tarnished gold lace and a dark feather tucked in its recurved flap a short cloak of fine black cloth thrown over one shoulder left a buff leathern jacket and breeches ornamented with large round silver buttons exposed until they were met by high boots of untanned yellow buckskin that reached halfway up the thigh a broad baldric of green silk hung from his shoulder across his breast and supported at his side a long sword with an enormous basket hilt through which somewhat coquettishly peeped a white lace handkerchief tall and erect in spite of the grizzled hair and irongray moustaches and wrinkled face of a man of sixty he suddenly halted on the deck with a military precision that made the jingling chains and bits of silver on his enormous spurs ring again he was followed by an ecclesiastic of apparently his own age but smoothly shaven clad in a black silk sotana and sash and wearing the oldfashioned oblong curlbrimmed hat sacred to don basilo of the modern opera behind him appeared the genial face of senor perkins shining with the benignant courtesy of a master of ceremonies  if this is a fair sample of the circus ashore ill take two tickets whispered crosby who had recovered his audacity  i have the inexpressible honor said senor perkins to captain bunker with a gracious wave of his hand towards the extraordinary figures to present you to the illustrious don miguel briones comandante of the presidio of todos santos at present hidden in the fog and the very reverend and pious padre esteban of the mission of todos santos likewise invisible when i state to you he continued with a slight lifting of his voice so as to include the curious passengers in his explanation that with very few exceptions this is the usual condition of the atmosphere at the entrance to the mission and presidio of todos santos and that the last exception took place thirtyfive years ago when a ship entered the harbor you will understand why these distinguished gentlemen have been willing to waive the formality of your waiting upon them first and have taken the initiative the illustrious comandante has been generous to exempt you from the usual port regulations and to permit you to wood and to water  what port regulation is he talking of asked captain bunker testily  the mexican regulations forbidding any foreign vessel to communicate with the shore returned senor perkins deprecatingly  never heard of em when were they given  the senor turned and addressed a few words to the commander who stood apart in silent dignity  in 1792  in whatis he mad said bunker does he know what year this is  the illustrious commander believes it to be the year of grace 1854 answered senor perkins quietly in the case of the only two vessels who have touched here since 1792 the order was not carried out because they were mexican coasters the illustrious comandante explains that the order he speaks of as on record distinctly referred to the ship columbia which belonged to the general washington  general washington echoed bunker angrily staring at the senor whats this stuff do you mean to say they dont know any history later than our old revolutionary war havent they heard of the united states among them nor californiathat we took from them during the late war  nor how we licked em out of their boots and thats saying a good deal whispered crosby glancing at the comandantes feet  senor perkins raised a gentle deprecating hand  for fifty years the presidio and the mission of todos santos have had but this communication with the outer world he said blandly hidden by impenetrable fogs from the ocean pathway at their door cut off by burning and sterile deserts from the surrounding country they have preserved a trust and propagated a faith in enforced but not unhappy seclusion the wars that have shaken mankind the dissensions that have even disturbed the serenity of their own nation on the mainland have never reached them here left to themselves they have created a blameless arcadia and an ideal community within an extent of twenty square leagues why should we disturb their innocent complacency and tranquil enjoyment by information which cannot increase and might impair their present felicity why should we dwell upon a late political and international episode which while it has been a benefit to us has been a humiliation to them as a nation and which might not only imperil our position as guests but interrupt our practical relations to the wood and water with which the country abounds  he paused and before the captain could speak turned to the silent commander addressed him in a dozen phrases of fluent and courteous spanish and once more turned to captain bunker  i have told him you are touched to the heart with his courtesy which you recognize as coming from the fit representative of the great mexican nation he reciprocates your fraternal emotion and begs you to consider the presidio and all that it contains at your disposition and the disposition of your friendsthe passengers particularly those fair ladies said senor perkins turning with graceful promptitude towards the group of lady passengers and slightly elevating himself on the tips of his neat boots whose white hands he kisses and at whose feet he lays the devotion of a mexican caballero and officer  he waved his hand towards the comandante who stepping forward swept the deck with his plumed hat before each of the ladies in solemn succession recovering himself he bowed more stiffly to the male passengers picked his handkerchief out of the hilt of his sword gracefully wiped his lips pulled the end of his long gray moustache and became again rigid  the reverend father continued senor perkins turning towards the priest regrets that the rules of his order prevent his extending the same courtesy to these ladies at the mission but he hopes to meet them at the presidio and they will avail themselves of his aid and counsel there and everywhere  father esteban following the speakers words with a gracious and ready smile at once moved forward among the passengers offering an antique snuffbox to the gentlemen or passing before the ladies with slightly uplifted benedictory palms and a caressing paternal gesture mrs brimmer having essayed a french sentence was delighted and half frightened to receive a response from the ecclesiastic and speedily monopolized him until he was summoned by the commander to the returning boat  a most accomplished man my dear said mrs brimmer as the excelsiors cannon again thundered after the retiring oars like all of his order he says although don miguel does not speak french that his secretary does and we shall have no difficulty in making ourselves understood  then you really intend to go ashore said miss keene timidly  decidedly returned mrs brimmer potentially it would be most unpolite not to say insulting if we did not accept the invitation you have no idea of the strictness of spanish etiquette besides he may have heard of mr brimmer  as his last information was only up to 1792 he might have forgotten it said crosby gravely so perhaps it would be safer to go on the general invitation  as mr brimmers ancestors came over on the mayflower long before 1792 it doesnt seem so very impossible if it comes to that said mrs brimmer with her usual unanswerable naivete provided always that you are not joking mr crosby one never knows when you are serious  mrs brimmer is quite right we must all go this is no mere formality said senor perkins who had returned to the ladies indeed i have myself promised the comandante to bring you he turned towards miss keene if you will permit mrs markham and myself to act as your escort it was don miguels express request  a slight flush of pride suffused the cheek of the young girl but the next moment she turned diffidently towards mrs brimmer  we must all go together she said shall we not  you see your triumphs have begun already said brace with a nervous smile you need no longer laugh at me for predicting your fate in san francisco  miss keene cast a hurried glance around her in the faint hopeshe scarcely knew whythat mr hurlstone had overheard the senors invitation nor could she tell why she was disappointed at not seeing him but he had not appeared on deck during the presence of their strange visitors nor was he in the boat which half an hour later conveyed her to the shore he must have either gone in one of the other boats or fulfilled his strange threat of remaining on the ship  the boats pulled away together towards the invisible shore piloted by captain bunker the first officer and senor perkins in the foremost boat it had grown warmer and the fog that stole softly over them touched their faces with the tenderness of caressing fingers miss keene wrapped up in the stern sheets of the boat gave way to the dreamy influence of this weird procession through the water retaining only perception enough to be conscious of the singular illusions of the mist that alternately thickened and lightened before their bow at times it seemed as if they were driving full upon a vast pier or breakwater of cold gray granite that opening to let the foremost boat pass closed again before them at times it seemed as if they had diverged from their course and were once more upon the open sea the horizon a faroff line of vanishing color at times faint lights seemed to pierce the gathering darkness or to move like willowisps across the smooth surface when suddenly the keel grated on the sand a narrow but perfectly well defined strip of palpable strand appeared before them they could faintly discern the moving lower limbs of figures whose bodies were still hidden in the mist then they were lifted from the boats the first few steps on dry land carried them out of the fog that seemed to rise like a sloping roof from the waters edge leaving them under its canopy in the full light of actual torches held by a group of picturesquely dressed people before the vista of a faintly lit narrow ascending street the dim twilight of the closing day lingered under this roof of fog which seemed to hang scarcely a hundred feet above them and showed a wall or rampart of brown adobe on their right that extended nearly to the water to the left at the distance of a few hundred yards another low brown wall appeared above it rose a fringe of foliage and more distant and indistinct two white towers that were lost in the nebulous gray  one of the figures dressed in green jackets who seemed to be in authority now advanced and after a moments parley with senor perkins while the excelsiors passengers were being collected from the different boats courteously led the way along the wall of the fortification presently a low opening or gateway appeared followed by the challenge of a greenjacketed sentry and the sentence dios y libertad it was repeated in the interior of a dusky courtyard surrounded by a low corridor where a dozen greenjacketed men of aboriginal type and complexion carrying antique flintlocks were drawn up as a guard of honor  the comandante said senor perkins directs me to extend his apologies to the senor capitano bunker for withholding the salute which is due alike to his country himself and his fair company but fifty years of uninterrupted peace and fog have left his cannon inadequate to polite emergencies and firmly fixed the tampion of his saluting gun but he places the presidio at your disposition you will be pleased to make its acquaintance while it is still light and he will await you in the guardroom  left to themselves the party dispersed like dismissed schoolchildren through the courtyard and corridors and in the enjoyment of their release from a months confinement on shipboard stretched their cramped limbs over the ditches walls and parapets to the edge of the glacis  everywhere a ruin that was picturesque a decay that was refined and gentle a neglect that was graceful met the eye the sharp exterior and reentering angles were softly rounded and obliterated by overgrowths of semitropical creepers the abatis was filled by a natural brake of scruboak and manzanita the clematis flung its long scaling ladders over the escarpment until nature slowly but securely investing the doomed fortress had lifted a victorious banner of palm from the conquered summit of the citadel some strange convulsions of the earth had completed the victory the barbette guns of carved and antique bronze commemorating fruitless and longforgotten triumphs were dismounted one turned in the cheeks of its carriage had a trunnion raised piteously in the air like an amputated stump another sinking through its rotting chassis had buried itself to its chase in the crumbling adobe wall but above and beyond this gentle chaos of defense stretched the real ramparts and escarpments of todos santosthe impenetrable and unassailable fog corroding its brass and iron with saline breath rotting its wood with unending shadow sapping its adobe walls with perpetual moisture and nourishing the obliterating vegetation with its quickening blood as if laughing to scorn the puny embattlements of menit still bent around the crumbling ruins the tender grace of an invisible but allencompassing arm  senor perkins who had acted as cicerone to the party pointed out these various mutations with no change from his usual optimism  protected by their peculiar isolation during the late war there was no necessity for any real fortification of the place nevertheless it affords some occupation and position for our kind friend don miguel and so serves a beneficial purpose this little gun he continued stopping to attentively examine a small but beautifully carved bronze sixpounder which showed indications of better care than the others seems to be the salutinggun don miguel spoke of for the last fifty years it has spoken only the language of politeness and courtesy and yet through want of care the tampion as you see has become swollen and choked in its mouth  how true in a larger sense murmured mrs markham the habit of courtesy alone preserves the fluency of the heart  i know you two are saying something very clever said mrs brimmer whose small french slippers and silk stockings were beginning to show their inadequacy to a twilight ramble in the fog but i am so slow and i never catch the point do repeat it slowly  the senor was only showing us how they managed to shut up a smooth bore in this country said crosby gravely i wonder when were going to have dinner i suppose old don quixote will trot out some of his senoritas i want to see those choir girls that sang so stunningly a while ago  i suppose you mean the boysfor theyre all boys in the catholic choirsbut then perhaps you are joking again do tell me if you are for this is really amusing i may laughmaynt i as the discomfited humorist fell again to the rear amidst the laughter of the others mrs brimmer continued naively to senor perkinsof course as don miguel is a widower there must be daughters or sistersinlaw who will meet us why the priest you knoweven hemust have nieces really its a serious questionif we are to accept his hospitality in a social way why dont you ask him she said pointing to the greenjacketed subaltern who was accompanying them  senor perkins looked half embarrassed  repeat your question my dear lady and i will translate it  ask him if there are any women at the presidio  senor perkins drew the subaltern aside presently he turned to mrs brimmer  he says there are four the wife of the baker the wife of the saddler the daughter of the trumpeter and the niece of the cook  good heavens we cant meet them said mrs brimmer  senor perkins hesitated  perhaps i ought to have told you he said blandly that the old spanish notions of etiquette are very strict the wives of the officials and higher classes do not meet strangers on a first visit unless they are well known  that isnt it said winslow joining them excitedly ive heard the whole story its a good joke banks has been bragging about us all and saying that these ladies had husbands who were great merchants and as these chaps consider that all trade is vulgar you know they believe we are not fit to associate with their women dont you see all except onemiss keene shes considered all right shes to be introduced to the commanders women and to the sister of the alcalde  she will do nothing of the kind said miss keene indignantly if these ladies are not to be received with me well all go back to the ship together  she spoke with a quick and perfectly unexpected resolution and independence so foreign to her usual childlike half dependent character that her hearers were astounded senor perkins gazed at her thoughtfully brace crosby and winslow admiringly her sister passengers with doubt and apprehension  there must be some mistake said senor perkins gently i will inquire  he was absent but a few moments when he returned his face was beaming  its a ridiculous misapprehension our practical friend banks in his zealous attempts to impress the comandantes secretary who knows a little english with the importance of mr brimmers position as a large commission merchant has i fear conveyed only the idea that he was a kind of pawnbroker while mr markhams trade in hides has established him as a tanner and mr banks own flour speculations of which he is justly proud have been misinterpreted by him as the work of a successful baker  and what idea did he convey about you asked crosby audaciously it might be interesting to us to know for our own satisfaction  i fear they did not do me the honor to inquire replied senor perkins with imperturbable goodhumor there are some persons you know who carry all their worldly possessions palpably about with them i am one of them call me a citizen of the world with a strong leniency towards young and struggling nationalities a traveler at home anywhere a delighted observer of all things an admirer of brave men the devoted slave of charming womenand you have in one word a passenger of the good ship excelsior  for the first time miss keene noticed a slight irony in senor perkins superabundant fluency and that he did not conceal his preoccupation over the silent saluting gun he was still admiring the approach of don miguel and padre esteban with a small bevy of ladies however quickly changed her thoughts and detached the senor from her side her first swift feminine impression of the fair strangers was that they were plain and dowdy an impression fully shared by the other lady passengers but her second observation that they were more gentle fascinating childlike and feminine than her own countrywomen was purely her own their loose undulating figures guiltless of stays their extravagance of short white heavily flounced skirt which looked like a petticoat their lightly wrapped formless and hooded shoulders and heads lent a suggestion of dishabille that mrs brimmer at once resented  they might at least have dressed themselves she whispered to mrs markham  i really believe returned mrs markham theyve got no bodices on  the introductions over a polyglot conversation ensued in french by the padre and mrs brimmer and in broken english by miss chubb miss keene and the other passengers with the commanders secretary varied by occasional scraps of college latin from mr crosby the whole aided by occasional appeals to senor perkins the darkness increasing the party reentered the courtyard and passing through the lowstudded guardroom entered another corridor which looked upon a second court enclosed on three sides the fourth opening upon a broad plaza evidently the public resort of the little town encompassing this open space a few redtiled roofs could be faintly seen in the gathering gloom chocolate and thin spiced cakes were served in the veranda pending the preparations for a more formal banquet already miss keene had been singled out from her companions for the special attentions of her hosts male and female to her embarrassment and confusion already dona isabel the sister of the alcalde had drawn her aside and with caressing frankness had begun to question her in broken english  but miss keene is no name the dona keene is of nothing  well you may call me eleanor if you like said miss keene smiling  dona leonorso that is good said dona isabel clapping her hands like a child but how are you  i beg your pardon said miss keene greatly amused but i dont understand  ah caramba what are you little one seeing that her guest still looked puzzled she continuedah mother of god why are your friends so polite to you why does every one love you so  do they well stammered miss keene with one of her rare dazzling smiles and her cheeks girlishly rosy with naive embarrassment i suppose they think i am pretty  pretty ah yes you are said dona isabel gazing at her curiously but it is not all that  what is it then asked miss keene demurely  you are aadama de grandeza     chapter vi  hail and farewell   supper was served in the inner room opening from the corridor lit by a few swinging lanterns of polished horn and a dozen wax candles of sacerdotal size and suggestion the apartment though spacious was low and cryptlike and was not relieved by the two deep ovenlike hearths that warmed it without the play of firelight but when the company had assembled it was evident that the velvet jackets gold lace silver buttons and red sashes of the entertainers not only lost their tawdry and theatrical appearance in the half decorous and thoughtful gloom but actually seemed more in harmony with it than the modern dresses of the guests it was the excelsior party who looked strange and bizarre in these surroundings to the sensitive fancy of miss keene mrs brimmers parisian toilet had an air of provincial assumption her own pretty zouave jacket and black silk skirt horrified her with its apparent ostentatious eccentricity and mrs markham and miss chubb seemed dowdy and overdressed beside the satin mantillas and black lace of the senoritas nor were the gentlemen less outres the stiff correctness of mr banks and the lighter foppishness of winslow and crosby not to mention senor perkins more pronounced unconventionality appeared as burlesques of their own characters in a play the crowning contrast was reached by captain bunker who in accordance with the habits of the mercantile marine of that period when in port wore a shoregoing suit of black broadcloth with a tall hat high shirt collar and diamond pin seated next to the commander it was no longer don miguel who looked oldfashioned it was captain bunker who appeared impossible  nevertheless as the meal progressed lightened by a sweet native wine made from the mission grape and stimulated by champagnea present of captain bunker from the cabin lockers of the excelsiorthis contrast and much of the restraint that it occasioned seemed to melt away the passengers became talkative the commander and his friends unbent and grew sympathetic and inquiring the temptation to recite the news of the last half century and to recount the wonderful strides of civilization in that time was too great to be resisted by the excelsior party that some of themnotwithstanding the caution of senor perkinsapproached dangerously near the subject of the late war between the united states and mexico of which todos santos was supposed to be still ignorant or that crosby in particular seized upon this opportunity for humorous exaggeration may be readily imagined but as the translation of the humorists speech as well as the indiscretions of his companions were left to the senor in spanish and to mrs brimmer and miss keene in french any imminent danger to the harmony of the evening was averted don ramon ramirez the alcalde a youngish man of evident distinction sat next to miss keene and monopolized her conversation with a certain curiosity that was both grave and childish in its frank trustfulness some of his questions were so simple and incompatible with his apparent intelligence that she unconsciously lowered her voice in answering them in dread of the ridicule of her companions she could not resist the impression which repeatedly obtruded upon her imagination that the entire population of todos santos were a party of lost children forgotten by their parents and grown to man and womanhood in utter ignorance of the world  the commander had half informally drunk the health of captain bunker without rising from his seat when to miss keenes alarm captain bunker staggered to his feet he had been drinking freely as usual but he was bent on indulging a loquacity which his discipline on shipboard had hitherto precluded and which had perhaps strengthened his solitary habit his speech was voluble and incoherent complimentary and tactless kindly and aggressive courteous and dogmatic it was left to senor perkins to translate it to the eye and ear of his host without incongruity or offense this he did so admirably as to elicit not only the applause of the foreigners who did not understand english but of his own countrymen who did not understand spanish  i feel said senor perkins in graceful peroration that i have done poor justice to the eloquence of this gallant sailor my unhappy translation cannot offer you that voice at times trembling with generous emotion and again inaudible from excessive modesty in the presence of this illustrious assemblythose limbs that waver and bend under the undulations of the chivalrous sentiment which carries him away as if he were still on that powerful element he daily battles with and conquers  but when coffee and sweets were reached the crowning triumph of senor perkins oratory was achieved after an impassioned burst of enthusiasm towards his hosts in their own tongue he turned towards his own party with bland felicity  and how is it with us dear friends we find ourselves not in the port we were seeking not in the goal of our ambition the haven of our hopes but on the shores of the decaying past ever drifting on one of those                         shifting      currents of the restless main  if our fascinating friend mrs brimmer will permit us to use the words of her accomplished fellowtownsman h w longfellow of bostonwe find ourselves borne not to the busy hum and clatter of modern progress but to the soft cadences of a dying crusade and the hush of ecclesiastical repose in place of the busy marts of commerce and the towering chimneys of labor we have the ruined embattlements of a warlike age and the crumbling church of an ancient mission towards the close of an eventful voyage during which we have been guided by the skillful hand and watchful eye of that gallant navigator captain bunker we have turned aside from our onward course of progress to look back for a moment upon the faded footprints of those who have so long preceded us who have lived according to their lights and whose record is now before us as i have just stated our journey is near its end and we may in some sense look upon this occasion with its sumptuous entertainment and its goodly company of gallant men and fair women as a parting banquet our voyage has been a successful one i do not now especially speak of the daring speculations of the distinguished husband of a beautiful lady whose delightful society is known to us allneed i say i refer to quincy brimmer esq of boston loud applausewhose successful fulfillment of a contract with the peruvian government and the landing of munitions of war at callao has checked the uprising of the quinquinambo insurgents i do not refer especially to our keensighted business friend mr banks applause who by buying up all the flour in callao and shipping it to california has virtually starved into submission the revolutionary party of ariquipai do not refer to these admirable illustrations of the relations of commerce and politics for this my friendsthis is history and beyond my feeble praise let me rather speak of the social and literary triumphs of our little community of our floating arcadiamay i say olympus where shall we find another minerva like mrs markham another thalia like miss chubb another juno like mrs brimmer worthy of the jovelike quincy brimmer another queen of love and beauty likelikecontinued the gallant senor with an effective oratorical pause and a profound obeisance to miss keene like one whose mantling maiden blushes forbid me to name prolonged applause where shall we find more worthy mortals to worship them than our young friends the handsome brace the energetic winslow the humorous crosby when we look back upon our concerts and plays our minstrel entertainments with the incomparable performances of our friend crosby as brother bones our recitations to which the genius of mrs mcorkle of peoria illinois has lent her charm and her manuscript a burlesque start of terror from crosby i am forcibly impelled to quote the impassioned words from that gifted woman       when idly lifes barque on the billows of time        drifts hither and yon by eternitys sea      on the swift feet of verse and the pinions of rhyme        my thoughts ulricardo fly ever to thee  whos ulricardo interrupted crosby with assumed eagerness followed by a hush from the ladies  perhaps i should have anticipated our friends humorous question said senor perkins with unassailable goodhumor ulricardo though not my own name is a poetical substitute for it and a mere figure of apostrophe the poem is personal to myself he continued with a slight increase of color in his smooth cheek which did not escape the attention of the ladiespurely as an exigency of verse and that the inspired authoress might more easily express herself to a friend my acquaintance with mrs mcorkle has been only epistolary pardon this digression my friends but an allusion to the muse of poetry did not seem to me to be inconsistent with our gathering here let me briefly conclude by saying that the occasion is a happy and memorable one i think i echo the sentiment of all present when i add that it is one which will not be easily forgotten by either the grateful guests whose feelings i have tried to express or the chivalrous hosts whose kindness i have already so feebly translated  in the applause that followed and the clicking of glasses senor perkins slipped away he mingled a moment with some of the other guests who had already withdrawn to the corridor lit a cigar and then passed through a narrow doorway on to the ramparts here he strolled to some distance as if in deep thought until he reached a spot where the crumbling wall and its fallen debris afforded an easy descent into the ditch following the ditch he turned an angle and came upon the beach and the low sound of oars in the invisible offing a whistle brought the boat to his feet and without a word he stepped into the stern sheets a few strokes of the oars showed him that the fog had lifted slightly from the water and a green light hanging from the side of the excelsior could be plainly seen ten minutes more steady pulling placed him on her deck where the second officer stood with a number of the sailors listlessly grouped around him  the landing has been completed said senor perkins interrogatively  all except one boatload more which waits to take your final instructions said the mate the men have growled a little about it he added in a lower tone they dont want to lose anything it seems he continued with a half sarcastic laugh  senor perkins smiled peculiarly  i am sorry to disappoint them whos that in the boat he asked suddenly  the mate followed the senors glance  it is yoto he says he is going ashore and you will not forbid him  senor perkins approached the ships side  come here he said to the man  the peruvian sailor rose but did not make the slightest movement to obey the command  you say you are going ashore said perkins blandly  yes patrono  what for  to follow himthe thief the assassinwho struck me here he pointed to his head he has escaped again with his booty  you are very foolish my yoto he is no thief and has no booty they will put you in prison not him  you say so said the man surlily perhaps they will hear mefor other things he added significantly  and for this you would abandon the cause  the man shrugged his shoulders  why not he glanced meaningly at two of his companions who had approached the side perhaps others would who is sending the booty ashore eh  come out of that boat said the senor leaning over the bulwarks with folded arms and his eyes firmly fixed on the man  the man did not move but the senors hand suddenly flew to the back of his neck smote violently downwards and sent eighteen inches of glittering steel hurtling through the air the bowieknife entered the upturned throat of the man and buried itself halfway to the hilt without a gasp or groan he staggered forward caught wildly at the side of the ship and disappeared between the boat and the vessel  my lads said senor perkins turning with a gentle smile towards the faces that in the light of the swinging lantern formed a ghastly circle around him when i boarded this ship that had brought aid and succor to our oppressors at callao i determined to take possession of it peacefully without imperiling the peace and property of the innocent passengers who were intrusted to its care and without endangering your own lives or freedom but i made no allowance for traitors the blood that has been shed tonight has not been spilt in obedience to my orders nor to the cause that we serve it was from defiance of it and the real and only culprit has just atoned for it  he stopped and then stepped back from the gangway as if to leave it open to the men  what i have done he continued calmly i do not ask you to consider either as an example or a warning you are free to do what he would have done he repeated with a wave of his hand towards the open gangway and the empty boat you are free to break your contract and leave the ship and i give you my word that i will not lift a hand to prevent it but if you stay with me he said suddenly turning upon them a face as livid as their own i swear by the living god that if between this and the accomplishment of my design you as much as shirk or question any order given by me you shall die the death of that dog who went before you choose as you pleasebut quickly  the mate was the first to move without a word he crossed over to the senors side the men hesitated a moment longer until one with a strange foreign cry threw himself on his knees before the senor ejaculating pardon pardon the others followed some impulsively catching at the hand that had just slain their comrade and covering it with kisses  pardon patronowe are yours  you are the states said senor perkins coldly with every vestige of his former urbanity gone from his colorless face enough go back to your duty he watched them slink away and then turned to the mate get the last boatload ready and report to me  from that moment another power seemed to dominate the ship the men no longer moved listlessly or slunk along the deck with perfunctory limbs a feverish haste and eagerness possessed them the boat was quickly loaded and the mysterious debarkation completed in rapidity and silence this done the fog once more appeared to rise from the water and softly encompass the ship until she seemed to be obliterated from its face in this vague obscurity from time to time the faint rattling of chains was heard the soft creaking of blocks and later on the regular rise and fall of oars and then the darkness fell heavier the sounds became more and more indistinct and were utterly lost  ashore however the lanterns still glittered brightly in the courtyard of the presidio the noise of laughter and revel still came from the supperroom and later the tinkling of guitars and rhythmical clapping hands showed that the festivities were being wound up by a characteristic fandango captain bunker succumbed early to his potations of fiery aguardiente and was put to bed in the room of the commander to whom he had sworn eternal friendship and alliance it was long past midnight before the other guests were disposed of in the various quarters of the presidio but to the ladies were reserved the more ostentatious hospitalities of the alcalde himself the walls of whose ambitious hacienda raised themselves across the plaza and overlooked the gardens of the mission  it was from one of the deep quaintly barred windows of the hacienda that miss keene gazed thoughtfully on the night unable to compose herself to sleep an antique guestchamber had been assigned to her in deference to her wish to be alone for which she had declined the couch and vivacious prattle of her new friend dona isabel the events of the day had impressed her more deeply than they had her companions partly from her peculiar inexperience of the world and partly from her singular sensitiveness to external causes the whole quaint story of the forgotten and isolated settlement which had seemed to the other passengers as a trivial and half humorous incident affected her imagination profoundly when she could escape the attentions of her entertainers or the frivolities of her companions she tried to touch the faroff past on the wings of her fancy she tried to imagine the life of those people forgetting the world and forgotten by it she endeavored to picture the fifty years of solitude amidst these decaying ruins over which even ambition had crumbled and fallen it seemed to her the true conventual seclusion from the world without the loss of kinship or home influences she contrasted it with her boardingschool life in the fashionable seminary she wondered what she would have become had she been brought up here she thought of the happy ignorance of dona isabel andshuddered and yet she felt herself examining the odd furniture of the room with an equally childlike and admiring curiosity and these people looked upon her as a superior being  from the deep embrasure of the window she could see the tops of the pear and olive trees in the misty light of an invisible moon that suffused the old mission garden with an ineffable and angelic radiance to her religious fancy it seemed to be a spiritual effusion of the church itself enveloping the two gray domeshaped towers with an atmosphere and repose of its own until it became the incarnate mystery and passion where it stood  she was suddenly startled by a moving shadow beside the wall almost immediately below herthe figure of a man he was stealing cautiously towards the church as if to gain the concealment of the shrubbery that grew beside it and furtively glancing from side to side looked towards her window she unconsciously drew back forgetting at the moment that her light was extinguished and that it was impossible for the stranger to see her but she had seen him and in that instant recognized mr hurlstone  then he had come ashore and secretly for the other passengers believed him still on the ship but what was he doing thereand why had he not appeared with the others at the entertainment she could understand his avoidance of them from what she knew of his reserved and unsocial habits but when he could so naturally have remained on shipboard she could not at first conceive why he should wish to prowl around the town at the risk of detection the idea suddenly occurred to her that he had had another attack of his infirmity and was walking in his sleep and for an instant she thought of alarming the house that some one might go to his assistance but his furtive movements had not the serene impassibility of the somnambulist another thought withheld her he had looked up at her window did he know she was there a faint stirring of shame and pleasure sent a slight color to her cheek but he had gained the corner of the shrubbery and was lost in the shadow she turned from the window a gentle sense of vague and half maternal pity suffused her soft eyes as she at last sought her couch and fell into a deep slumber  towards daybreak a wind arose over the sleeping town and far outlying waters it breathed through the leaves of the mission garden brushed away the clinging mists from the angles of the towers and restored the sharp outlines of the ruined fortifications it swept across the unruffled sea to where the excelsior cradled in the softly heaving bay had peacefully swung at anchor on the previous night and lifted the snowy curtain of the fog to seaward as far as the fringe of surf a league away  but the cradle of the deep was emptythe ship was gone     chapter vii  the gentle castaways   miss keene was awakened from a heavy sleep by a hurried shake of her shoulder and an indefinite feeling of alarm opening her eyes she was momentarily dazed by the broad light of day and the spectacle of mrs brimmer pale and agitated in a halfspanish dishabille standing at her bedside  get up and dress yourself my dear at once she said hurriedly but at the same time attentively examining miss keenes clothes that were lying on the chair and thank heaven you came here in an afternoon dress and not in an evening costume like mine for something awful has happened and heaven only knows whether well ever see a stitch of our clothes again  what has happened asked miss keene impatiently sitting up in bed more alarmed at the unusual circumstance of mrs brimmers unfinished toilet than at her incomplete speech  what indeed nobody knows but its something awfula mutiny or shipwreck or piracy but theres your friend the commander calling out the troops and such a set of christy minstrels you never saw before theres the alcalde summoning the council theres mr banks raving and running round for a steamboatas if these people ever heard of such a thingand captain bunker what with rage and drink gone off in a fit of delirium tremens and locked up in his room and the excelsior gonethe lord knows where  gone repeated miss keene hurrying on her clothes impossible what does father esteban tell you what does dona isabel say  thats the most horrible part of it do you know those wretched idiots believe its some political revolution among ourselves like their own miserable government i believe that baby isabel thinks that king george and washington have something to do with it at any rate theyre anxious to know to what side you belong so for goodness sake if you have to humor them say were all on the same sidei mean dont you and mrs markham go against miss chubb and me  scarcely knowing whether to laugh or cry at mrs brimmers incoherent statement miss keene hastily finished dressing as the door flew open to admit the impulsive dona isabel and her sister juanita the two mexican girls threw themselves in miss keenes arms and then suddenly drew back with a movement of bashful and diffident respect  do pray ask them for i darent whispered mrs brimmer trying to clasp a mantilla around her how this thing is worn and if they havent got something like a decent bonnet to lend me for a day or two  the senora has not then heard that her goods and all the goods of the senores and senoras have been discovered safely put ashore at the embarcadero  no said mrs brimmer eagerly  ah yes responded dona isabel since the senora is not of the revolutionary party  mrs brimmer cast a supplicatory look at miss keene and hastily quitted the room miss keene would have as quickly followed her but the young ramirez girls threw themselves again tragically upon her breast and with a mysterious gesture of silence whispered  fear nothing excellencia we are yourswe will die for you no matter what don ramon or the comandante or the ayuntamiento shall decide trust us little onepardonexcellencia we mean  what is the matter said miss keene now thoroughly alarmed and releasing herself from the twining arms about her for heavens sake let me go i must see somebody where iswhere is mrs markham  the markham is it the severe oneas thussaid dona isabel striking an attitude of infantine portentousness  yes said miss keene smiling in spite of her alarm  she is arrested  arrested said eleanor keene her cheeks aflame with indignation for what who dare do this thing  the comandante she has a missivea despatch from the insurrectionaries  without another word and feeling that she could stand the suspense no longer miss keene forced her way past the young girls unheeding their cries of consternation and apology and quickly reached the patio a single glance showed her that mrs brimmer was gone with eyes and cheeks still burning she swept past the astounded peons through the gateway into the open plaza only one idea filled her mindto see the commander and demand the release of her friend how she should do it with what arguments she should enforce her demand never occurred to her she did not even think of asking the assistance of mr brace mr crosby or any of her fellowpassengers the consciousness of some vague crisis that she alone could meet possessed her completely  the plaza was swarming with a strange rabble of peons and soldiery of dark lowering faces oddlooking weapons and costumes mules mustangs and cattlea heterogeneous mass swayed by some fierce excitement that she saw none of the excelsior party among them did not surprise her an instinct of some catastrophe more serious than mrs brimmers vague imaginings frightened but exalted her with head erect leveled brows and bright determined eyes she walked deliberately into the square the crowd parted and gave way before this beautiful girl with her bared head and its invincible crest of chestnut curls presently they began to follow her with a compressed murmur of admiration until before she was halfway across the plaza the sentries beside the gateway of the presidio were astonished at the vision of a fairhaired and triumphant pallas who appeared to be leading the entire population of todos santos to victorious attack in vain a solitary bugle blew in vain the rolling drum beat an alarm the sympathetic guard only presented arms as miss keene flushed and excited her eyes darkly humid with gratified pride swept past them into the actual presence of the bewildered and indignant comandante  the only feminine consciousness she retained was that she was more relieved at her deliverance from the wild cattle and unbroken horses of her progress than from the indians and soldiers  i want to see mrs markham and to know by what authority she is arrested said miss keene boldly  the senor comandante can hold no conference with you until you disperse your party interpreted the secretary  she was about to hurriedly reply that she knew nothing of the crowd that had accompanied her but she was withheld by a newlyborn instinct of tact  how do i know that i shall not be arrested like my friend she said quickly she is as innocent as myself  the comandante pledges himself as a hidalgo that you shall not be harmed  her first impulse was to advance to the nearest intruders at the gate and say do go away please but she was doubtful of its efficiency and was already too exalted by the situation to be satisfied with its prosaic weakness but her newly developed diplomacy again came to her aid you may tell them so if you choose i cannot answer for them she said with apparent dark significance  the secretary advanced on the corridor and exchanged a few words with her more impulsive followers miss keene goddesslike and beautiful remained erect behind him and sent them a dazzling smile and ravishing wave of her little hand the crowd roared with an effusive and bovine delight that half frightened her and with a dozen viva la reyna americanas she was hurried by the comandante into the guardroom  you ask to know of what the senora markham is accused said the commander more gently she has received correspondence from the pirateperkins  the pirateperkins said miss keene with indignant incredulity  the buccaneer who wrote that letter read it to her manuel  the secretary took his eyes from the young girls glowing face coughed slightly and then read as follows   on board the excelsior of the quinquinambo independent states navy august 8 1854  to captain bunkersir     but this is not addressed to you interrupted miss keene indignantly  the captain bunker is a raving madman said the commander gravely read on  the color gradually faded from the young girls cheek as the secretary continued in a monotonous voice  i have the honor to inform you that the barque excelsior was on the 8th of july 1854 and the first year of the quinquinambo independence formally condemned by the federal council of quinquinambo for having aided and assisted the enemy with munitions of war and supplies against the law of nations and the tacit and implied goodwill between the republic of the united states and the struggling confederacies of south america and that in pursuance thereof and under the law of reprisals and letters of marque was taken possession of by me yesterday the goods and personal effects belonging to the passengers and yourself have been safely landed at the embarcadero of todos santosa neutral portby my directions my interpretation of the orders of the federal council excepting innocent noncombatants and their official protector from confiscation or amercement  i take the liberty of requesting you to hand the inclosed order on the treasury of the quinquinambo confederate states to don miguel briones in payment of certain stores and provisions and of a piece of ordnance known as the saluting cannon of the presidio of todos santos vigilancia  your obedient servant  leonidas bolivar perkins  generalissimo commanding land and sea forces quinquinambo independent states   in her consternation at this fuller realization of the vague catastrophe miss keene still clung to the idea that had brought her there  but mrs markham has nothing to do with all this  then why does she refuse to give up her secret correspondence with the pirate perkins returned the secretary  miss keene hesitated had mrs markham any previous knowledge of the senors real character  why dont you arrest the men she said scornfully there is mr banks mr crosby mr winslow and mr brace she uttered the last name more contemptuously as she thought of that young gentlemans protestations and her present unprotected isolation  they are already arrested and removed to san antonio a league hence returned the secretary it is fact enough that they have confessed that their government has seized the mexican province of california and that they were on their way to take possession of it  miss keenes heart sank  but you knew all this yesterday she faltered and our war with mexico is all over years ago  we did not know it last night at the banquet senora nor would we have known it but for this treason and division in your own party  a sudden light flashed upon miss keenes mind she now comprehended the advances of dona isabel extravagant and monstrous as it seemed these people evidently believed that a revolution had taken place in the united states that the two opposing parties had been represented by the passengers of the excelsior and that one party had succeeded headed by the indomitable perkins if she could be able to convince them of their blunder would it be wise to do so she thought of mrs brimmers supplication to be ranged on her side and realized with feminine quickness that the situation might be turned to her countrymens advantage but which side had todos santos favored it was left to her womans wit to discover this and conceive a plan to rescue her helpless companions  her suspense was quickly relieved the commander and his secretary exchanged a few words  the comandante will grant dona leonoras request said the secretary if she will answer a question  what is it responded miss keene with inward trepidation  the senora markham is perhaps beloved by the pirate perkins  in spite of her danger in spite of the uncertain fate hanging over her party miss keene could with difficulty repress a half hysterical inclination to laugh even then it escaped in a sudden twinkle of her eye which both the commander and his subordinate were quick to notice as she replied demurely perhaps  it was enough for the commander a gleam of antique archness and venerable raillery lit up his murky tobaccocolored pupils a spasm of gallantry crossed the face of the secretary  ahwhat would youit is the way of the world said the commander we comprehend come  he led the way across the corridor and suddenly opened a small barred door whatever preconceived idea miss keene may have had of her unfortunate countrywoman immured in a noisome cell and guarded by a stern jailer was quite dissipated by the soft misty sunshine that flowed in through the open door the prison of mrs markham was a part of the old glacis which had been allowed to lapse into a wild garden that stretched to the edge of the sea there was a summerhouse built onand partly froma crumbling bastion and here under the shade of tropical creepers the melancholy captive was comfortably writing with her portable desk on her knee and a travelingbag at her feet a saratoga trunk of obtrusive proportions stood in the centre of the peaceful vegetation like a newly raised altar to an unknown deity the only suggestion of martial surveillance was an indian soldier whose musket reposing on the ground near mrs markham he had exchanged for the rude mattock with which he was quietly digging  the two women with a cry of relief flew into each others arms the commander and his secretary discreetly retired to an angle of the wall  i find everything as i left it my dear even to my slipperbag said mrs markham theyve forgotten nothing  but you are a captive said eleanor what does it mean  nothing my dear i gave them a piece of my mind said mrs markham looking however as if that mental offering had by no means exhausted her capital and i have written six pages to the governor at mazatlan and a full account to mr markham  and they wont get them in thirty years said miss keene impetuously but where is this letter from senor perkins and for heavens sake tell me if you had the least suspicion before of anything that has happened  not in the least the man is mad my dear and i really believe driven so by that absurd illinois womans poetry did you ever see anything so ridiculousand shameful tooas the ulricardo business i dont wonder he colored so  miss keene winced with annoyance was everybody going crazy or was there anything more in this catastrophe that had only enfeebled the minds of her countrywomen for here was the severe strongminded mrs markham actually preoccupied like mrs brimmer with utterly irrelevant particulars and apparently powerless to grasp the fact that they were abandoned on a half hostile strand and cut off by half a century from the rest of the world  as to the letter said mrs markham quietly there it is theres nothing in it that might not have been written by a friend  miss keene took the letter it was written in a delicate almost feminine hand she could not help noticing that in one or two instances corrections had been made and blots carefully removed with an eraser   midnight on the excelsior  my friend when you receive this i shall probably be once more on the bosom of that mysterious and mighty element whose majesty has impressed us whose poetry we have loved and whose moral lessons i trust have not been entirely thrown away upon us i go to the deliverance of one of those oppressed nations whose history i have often recited to you and in whose destiny you have from time to time expressed a womanly sympathy while it is probable therefore that my motives may not be misunderstood by you or even other dear friends of the excelsior it is by no means impossible that the celerity and unexpectedness of my action may not be perfectly appreciated by the careless mind and may seem to require some explanation let me then briefly say that the idea of debarking your goods and chattels and parting from your delightful company at todos santos only occurred to me on our unexpectedshall i say providentialarrival at that spot and the necessity of expedition forbade me either inviting your cooperation or soliciting your confidence human intelligence is variously constitutedor to use a more homely phrase many men have many mindsand it is not impossible that a premature disclosure of my plans might have jeopardized that harmony which you know it has been my desire to promote it was my original intention to have landed you at mazatlan a place really inferior in climate and natural attractions to todo santos although perhaps more easy of access and egress but the presence of an american steamer in the offing would have invested my enterprise with a certain publicity foreign i think to all our tastes taking advantage therefore of my knowledge of the peninsular coast and the pardonable ignorance of captain bunker i endeavored through my faithful subordinates to reach a less known port and a coast rarely frequented by reason of its prevailing fog here occurred one of those dispensations of an overruling power which dear friend we have so often discussed we fell in with an unknown current and were guided by a mysterious hand into the bay of todos santos  you know of my belief in the infinite wisdom and benignity of events you have dear friend with certain feminine limitations shared it with me could there have been a more perfect illustration of it than the power that led us here on a shore historic in interest beautiful in climate hospitable in its people utterly freed from external influences and absolutely without a compromising future you are landed my dear friend with your youthful companions from the crumbling ruins of a decaying past you are called to construct an arcadia of your own the rudiments of a new civilization are within your grasp the cost of existence is comparatively trifling the various sums you have with you which even in the chaos of revolution i have succeeded in keeping intact will more than suffice to your natural wants for years to come were i not already devoted to the task of freeing quinquinambo i should willingly share this elysium with you all but to use the glowing words of mrs mcorkle slightly altering the refrain       ah stay me not  with flying feet      oer desert sands i rush to greet      my fate my love my life my sweet        quinquinambo  i venture to intrust to your care two unpublished manuscripts of that gifted woman the dangers that may environ my present mission the vicissitudes of battle by sea or land forbid my imperiling their natural descent to posterity you my dear friend will preserve them for the ages to come occasionally refreshing yourself from time to time from that parnassian spring  adieu my friend i look around the familiar cabin and miss your gentle faces i feel as jason might have felt alone on the deck of the argo when his companions were ashore except that i know of no circean influences to mar their destiny in examining the staterooms to see if my orders for the complete restoration of passengers property had been carried out i allowed myself to look into yours lying alone forgotten and overlooked i saw a peculiar jet hairpin which i think i have observed in the coils of your tresses may i venture to keep this gentle instrument as a reminder of the superior intellect it has so often crowned adieu my friend  ever yours leonidas bolivar perkins   well said mrs markham impatiently as miss keene remained motionless with the letter in her hand  it seems like a ridiculous nightmare i cant understand it at all the man that wrote this letter may be madbut he is neither a pirate nor a thiefand yet  he a pirate echoed mrs markham indignantly hes nothing of the kind its not even his fault  not his fault repeated miss keene are you mad too  nonor a fool my dear dont you see its all the fault of banks and brimmer for compromising the vessel of that stupid drunken captain for permitting it senor perkins is a liberator a patriot who has periled himself and his country to treat us magnanimously dont you see it its like that banks and that mrs brimmer to call him a pirate ive a good mind to give the commander my opinion of them  hush said miss keene with a sudden recollection of the commanders suspicions for heavens sake you do not know what you are saying look they were talking with that strange man and now they are coming this way  the commander and his secretary approached them they were both more than usually grave but the look of inquiry and suspicion with which they regarded the two women was gone from their eyes  the senor comandante says you are free senoras and begs you will only decide whether you will remain his guests or the guests of the alcalde but for the present he cannot allow you any communication with the prisoners of san antonio  there is further news said miss keene faintly with a presentiment of worse complications  there is a body from the excelsior has been washed on shore  the two women turned pale  in the pocket of the murdered man is an accusation against one senor hurlstone who was concealed on the ship who came not ashore openly with the other passengers but who escaped in secret and is now hiding somewhere in todos santos  and you suspect him of this infamous act said eleanor forgetting all prudence in her indignation you are deceiving yourself he is as innocent as i am  the commander and the secretary smiled sapiently but gently  the senor comandante believes you dona leonora the senor hurlstone is innocent of the piracy he is of a surety the leader of the opposition     chapter viii  in sanctuary   when james hurlstone reached the shelter of the shrubbery he leaned exhaustedly against the adobe wall and looked back upon the garden he had just traversed at its lower extremity a tall hedge of cactus reinforced the crumbling wall with a cheval de frise of bristling thorns it was through a gap in this green barrier that he had found his way a few hours before as his torn clothes still testified at one side ran the low wall of the alcaldes casa a mere line of dark shadow in that strange diaphanous mist that seemed to suffuse all objects the gnarled and twisted branches of peartrees gouty with old age bent so low as to impede any progress under their formal avenues out of a tangled labyrinth of figtrees here and there a single plume of feathery palm swam in a drowsy upper radiance the shrubbery around him of some unknown variety exhaled a faint perfume he put out his hand to grasp what appeared to be a young catalpa and found it the trunk of an enormous passion vine that creeping softly upward had at last invaded the very belfry of the dim tower above him and touching it his soul seemed to be lifted with it out of the shadow  the great hush and quiet that had fallen like a benediction on every sleeping thing around him the deep and passionless repose that seemed to drop from the bending boughs of the venerable trees the cool restful earthy breath of the shadowed mold beneath him touched only by a faint jessaminelike perfume as of a dead passion lulled the hurried beatings of his heart and calmed the feverish tremor of his limbs he allowed himself to sink back against the wall his hands tightly clasped before him gradually the set abstracted look of his eyes faded and became suffused as if moistened by that celestial mist then he rose quickly drew his sleeve hurriedly across his lashes and began slowly to creep along the wall again  either the obscurity of the shrubbery became greater or he was growing preoccupied but in steadying himself by the wall he had without perceiving it put his hand upon a rude door that yielding to his pressure opened noiselessly into a dark passage without apparent reflection he entered followed the passage a few steps until it turned abruptly turning with it he found himself in the body of the mission church of todos santos a swinginglamp that burned perpetually before an effigy of the virgin mother threw a faint light on the single rosewindow behind the high altar another suspended in a low archway apparently lit the open door of the passage towards the refectory by the stronger light of the latter hurlstone could see the barbaric red and tarnished gold of the rafters that formed the straight roof the walls were striped with equally bizarre coloring half moorish and half indian a few hangings of dyed and painted cloths with heavy fringes were disposed on either side of the chancel like the flaps of a wigwam and the aboriginal suggestion was further repeated in a quantity of colored beads and seashells that decked the communionrails the stations of the cross along the walls were commemorated by paintings evidently by a native artistto suit the same barbaric taste while a larger picture of san francisco dassisis under the choir seemed to belong to an older and more artistic civilization but the sombre halflight of the two lamps mellowed and softened the harsh contrast of these details until the whole body of the church appeared filled with a vague harmonious shadow the air heavy with the odors of past incense seemed to be a part of that expression as if the solemn and sympathetic twilight became palpable in each deep longdrawn inspiration  again overcome by the feeling of repose and peacefulness hurlstone sank upon a rude settle and bent his head and folded arms over a low railing before him how long he sat there allowing the subtle influence to transfuse and possess his entire being he did not know the faint twitter of birds suddenly awoke him looking up he perceived that it came from the vacant square of the tower above him open to the night and suffused with its mysterious radiance in another moment the roof of the church was swiftly crossed and recrossed with tiny and adventurous wings the mysterious light had taken an opaline color morning was breaking  the slow rustling of a garment accompanied by a soft but heavy tread sounded from the passage he started to his feet as the priest whom he had seen on the deck of the excelsior entered the church from the refectory the padre was alone at the apparition of a stranger torn and disheveled he stopped involuntarily and cast a hasty look towards the heavy silver ornaments on the altar hurlstone noticed it and smiled bitterly  dont alarm yourself i only sought this place for shelter  he spoke in frenchthe language he had heard padre esteban address to mrs brimmer but the priests quick eye had already detected his own mistake he lifted his hand with a sublime gesture towards the altar and said  you are right where should you seek shelter but here  the reply was so unexpected that hurlstone was silent his lips quivered slightly  and if it were sanctuary i was seeking he said  you would first tell me why you sought it said padre esteban gently  hurlstone looked at him irresolutely for a moment and then said with the hopeless desperation of a man anxious to anticipate his fate  i am a passenger on the ship you boarded yesterday i came ashore with the intention of concealing myself somewhere here until she had sailed when i tell you that i am not a fugitive from justice that i have committed no offense against the ship or her passengers nor have i any intention of doing so but that i only wish concealment from their knowledge for twentyfour hours you will know enough to understand that you run no risk in giving me assistance i can tell you no more  i did not see you with the other passengers either on the ship or ashore said the priest how did you come here  i swam ashore before they left i did not know they had any idea of landing here i expected to be the only one and there would have been no need for concealment then but i am not lucky he added with a bitter laugh  the priest glanced at his garments which bore the traces of the sea but remained silent  do you think i am lying  the old priest lifted his head with a gesture  not to mebut to god  the young man followed the gesture and glanced around the barbaric church with a slight look of scorn but the profound isolation the mystic seclusion and above all the complete obliteration of that world and civilization he shrank from and despised again subdued and overcame his rebellious spirit he lifted his eyes to the priest  nor to god he said gravely  then why withhold anything from him here said the priest gently  i am not a catholici do not believe in confession said hurlstone doggedly turning aside  but padre esteban laid his large brown hand on the young mans shoulder touched by some occult suggestion in its soft contact he sank again into his seat  yet you ask for the sanctuary of his housea sanctuary bought by that contrition whose first expression is the bared and open soul to the first worldly shelter you soughtthe peons hut or the alcaldes casayou would have thought it necessary to bring a story you would not conceal from the physician whom you asked for balsam either the wound the symptoms or the cause enough he said kindly as hurlstone was about to reply you shall have your request you shall stay here i will be your physician and will salve your wounds if any poison i know not of rankle there you will not blame me son but perhaps you will assist me to find it i will give you a secluded cell in the dormitory until the ship has sailed and then  he dropped quietly on the settle took the young mans hand paternally in his own and gazed into his eyes as if he read his soul  and then    ah yes    what then hurlstone glanced once more around him he thought of the quiet night of the great peace that had fallen upon him since he had entered the garden and the promise of a greater peace that seemed to breathe with the incense from those venerable walls he thought of that crumbling barrier that even in its ruin seemed to shut out more completely than anything he had conceived his bitter past and the bitter world that recalled it he thought of the long days to come when forgetting and forgotten he might find a new life among these simple aliens themselves forgotten by the world he had thought of this once before in the garden it occurred to him again in this lethelike oblivion of the little church in the kindly pressure of the priests hand the ornaments no longer looked uncouth and barbaricrather they seemed full of some new spiritual significance he suddenly lifted his eyes to padre esteban and half rising to his feet said  are we alone  we are it is a halfhour yet before mass said the priest  my story will not last so long said the young man hurriedly as if fearing to change his mind hear me thenit is no crime nor offense to any one more than that it concerns no one but myselfit is of  a woman said the priest softly so we will sit down my son  he lifted his hand with a soothing gesturethe movement of a physician who has just arrived at an easy diagnosis of certain uneasy symptoms there was also a slight suggestion of an habitual toleration as if even the seclusion of todos santos had not been entirely free from the invasion of the primal passion  hurlstone waited for an instant but then went on rapidly  it is of a woman who has cursed my life blasted my prospects and ruined my youth a woman who gained my early affection only to blight and wither it a woman who should be nearer to me and dearer than all else and yet who is further than the uttermost depths of hell from me in sympathy or feeling a woman that i should cleave to but from whom i have been flying ready to face shame disgrace oblivion even that death which alone can part us for that woman ismy wife  he stopped out of breath with fixed eyes and a rigid mouth father esteban drew a snuffbox from his pocket and a large handkerchief after blowing his nose violently he took a pinch of snuff wiped his lip and replaced the box  a bad habit my son he said apologetically but an old mans weakness go on  i met her first five years agothe wife of another man dont misjudge me it was no lawless passion it was a friendship i believed due to her intellectual qualities as much as to her womanly fascinations for i was a young student lodging in the same house with her in an academic town before i ever spoke to her of love she had confided to me her own unhappinessthe uncongeniality of her married life the harshness and even brutality of her husband even a man less in love than i was could have seen the truth of thisthe contrast of the coarse sensual and vulgar man with an apparently refined and intelligent woman but any one else except myself would have suspected that such a union was not merely a sacrifice of the woman i believed her it was not until long afterwards that i learned that her marriage had been a condonation of her youthful errors by a complaisant bridegroom that her character had been saved by a union that was a mutual concession but i loved her madly and when she finally got a divorce from her uncongenial husband i believed it less an expression of her love for me than an act of justice i did not know at the time that they had arranged the divorce together as they had arranged their marriage by equal concessions  i was the only son of a widowed mother whose instincts were from the first opposed to my friendship with this woman and what she prophetically felt would be its result unfortunately both she and my friends were foolish enough to avow their belief that the divorce was obtained solely with a view of securing me as a successor and it was this argument more than any other that convinced me of my duty to protect her enough i married not only in spite of all oppositionbut because of it  my mother would have reconciled herself to the marriage but my wife never forgave the opposition and by some hellish instinct divining that her power over me might be weakened by maternal influence precipitated a quarrel which forever separated us with the little capital left by my father divided between my mother and myself i took my wife to a western city our small income speedily dwindled under the debts of her former husband which she had assumed to purchase her freedom i endeavored to utilize a good education and some accomplishments in music and the languages by giving lessons and by contributing to the press in this my wife first made a show of assisting me but i was not long in discovering that her intelligence was superficial and shallow and that the audacity of expression which i had believed to be originality of conviction was simply shamelessness and a desire for notoriety she had a facility in writing sentimental poetry which had been efficacious in her matrimonial confidences but which editors of magazines and newspapers found to be shallow and insincere to my astonishment she remained unaffected by this as she was equally impervious to the slights and sneers that continually met us in society at last the inability to pay one of her former husbands claims brought to me a threat and an anonymous letter i laid them before her when a scene ensued which revealed the blindness of my folly in all its hideous hopelessness she accused me of complicity in her divorce and deception in regard to my own fortune in a speech whose language was a horrible revelation of her early habits she offered to arrange a divorce from me as she had from her former husband she gave as a reason her preference for another and her belief that the scandal of a suit would lend her a certain advertisement and prestige it was a combination of messalina and mrs jarley  pardon i remember not a madame jarley said the priest  of viciousness and commercial calculation continued hurlstone hurriedly i dont remember what happened she swore that i struck her perhapsgod knows but she failed even before a western jury to convict me of cruelty the judge that thought me half insane would not believe me brutal and her application for divorce was lost  i need not tell you that the same friends who had opposed my marriage now came forward to implore me to allow her to break our chains i refused i swear to you it was from no lingering love for her for her presence drove me mad it was from no instinct of revenge or jealousy for i should have welcomed the man who would have taken her out of my life and memory but i could not bear the idea of taking her first husbands place in her hideous comedy i could not purchase my freedom at that priceat any price i was told that i could get a divorce against her and stand forth before the world untrammeled and unstained but i could not stand before myself in such an attitude i knew that the shackles i had deliberately forged could not be loosened except by death i knew that the stains of her would cling to me and become a part of my own sin even as the sea i plunged into yesterday to escape her though it has dried upon me has left its bitter salt behind  when she knew my resolve she took her revenge by dragging my name through the successive levels to which she descended under the plea that the hardlyearned sum i gave to her maintenance apart from me was not sufficient she utilized her undoubted beauty and more doubtful talent in amateur entertainmentsand finally on the stage she was openly accompanied by her lover who acted as her agent in the hope of goading me to a divorce suddenly she disappeared i thought she had forgotten me i obtained an honorable position in new york one night i entered a theater devoted to burlesque opera and the exhibition of a popular actress known as the western thalia whose beautiful and audaciously draped figure was the talk of the town i recognized my wife in this star of nudity more than that she recognized me the next day in addition to the usual notice the real name of the actress was given in the morning papers with a sympathizing account of her romantic and unfortunate marriage i renounced my position and taking advantage of an offer from an old friend in california resolved to join him secretly there my mother had died brokenhearted i was alone in the world but my wife discovered my intention and when i reached callao i heard that she had followed me by way of the isthmus of panama and that probably she would anticipate me in mazatlan where we were to stop the thought of suicide haunted me during the rest of that horrible voyage only my belief that she would make it appear as a tacit confession of my guilt saved me from that last act of weakness  he stopped and shuddered padre esteban again laid his hand softly upon him  it was god who spared you that sacrifice of soul and body he said gently  i thought it was god that suggested to me to take the simulation of that act the means of separating myself from her forever when we neared mazatlan i conceived the idea of hiding myself in the hold of the excelsior until she had left that port in the hope that it would be believed that i had fallen overboard i succeeded in secreting myself but was discovered at the same time that the unexpected change in the ships destination rendered concealment unnecessary as we did not put in at mazatlan nobody suspected my discovery in the hold to be anything but the accident that i gave it out to be i felt myself saved the confrontation of the woman at mazatlan but i knew she would pursue me to san francisco  the strange dispensation of providence that brought us into this unknown port gave me another hope of escape and oblivion while you and the commander were boarding the excelsior i slipped from the cabinwindow into the water i was a good swimmer and reached the shore in safety i concealed myself in the ditch of the presidio until i saw the passengers boats returning with them when i sought the safer shelter of this mission i made my way through a gap in the hedge and lay under your olivetrees hearing the voices of my companions beyond the walls till past midnight i then groped my way along the avenue of peartrees till i came to another wall and a door that opened to my accidental touch i entered and found myself here you know the rest  he had spoken with the rapid and unpent fluency of a man who cared more to relieve himself of an oppressive burden than to impress his auditor yet the restriction of a foreign tongue had checked repetition or verbosity without imagination he had been eloquent without hopefulness he had been convincing father esteban rose holding both his hands  my son in the sanctuary which you have claimed there is no divorce the woman who has ruined your life could not be your wife as long as her first husband lives she is forever his wife bound by a tie which no human law can sever     chapter ix  an openair prison   an hour after mass father esteban had quietly installed hurlstone in a small celllike apartment off the refectory the household of the priest consisted of an old indian woman of fabulous age and miraculous propriety two indian boys who served at mass a gardener and a muleteer the first three who were immediately in attendance upon the priest were cognizant of a strangers presence but under instructions from the reverend padre were loyally and superstitiously silent the vocations of the gardener and muleteer made any intrusion from them impossible a breakfast of fruit tortillas chocolate and red wine of which hurlstone partook sparingly and only to please his entertainer nevertheless seemed to restore his strength as it did the padres equanimity for the old man had been somewhat agitated during mass and except that his early morning congregation was mainly composed of indians muleteers and small venders his abstraction would have been noticed with ready tact he had not attempted by further questioning to break the taciturnity into which hurlstone had relapsed after his emotional confession and the priests abrupt halfabsolution was it possible he regretted his confidence or was it possible that his first free and untrammeled expression of his wrongs had left him with a haunting doubt of their real magnitude  lie down here my son said the old ecclesiastic pointing to a small pallet in the corner and try to restore in the morning what you have taken from the night manuela will bring your clothes when they are dried and mended meantime shift for yourself in pepitos serape and calzas i will betake me to the comandante and the alcalde to learn the dispositions of your party when the ship will sail and if your absence is suspected peace be with you son manuela attend to the caballero and see you chatter not  without doubting the substantial truth of his guests story the good padre esteban was not unwilling to have it corroborated by such details as he thought he could collect among the excelsiors passengers his own experience in the confessional had taught him the unreliability of human evidence and the vagaries of both conscientious and unconscious suppression that a young goodlooking and accomplished caballero should have been the victim of not one but even many erotic episodes did not strike the holy father as being peculiar but that he should have been brought by a solitary unfortunate attachment to despair and renunciation of the world appeared to him marvelous he was not unfamiliar with the remorse of certain gallants for peccadillos with other mens wives but this americanos selfabasement for the sins of his own wifeas he foolishly claimed her to bewhom he hated and despised struck father esteban as a miracle open to suspicion was there anything else in these somewhat commonplace details of vulgar and low intrigue than what he had told the priest were all these americano husbands as sensitive and as gloomily selfsacrificing and expiating it did not appear so from the manners and customs of the othersfrom those easy matrons whose complacent husbands had abandoned them to the long companionship of youthful cavaliers on adventurous voyages from those audacious virgins who had the freedom of married women surely this was not a pious and sensitive race passionately devoted to their domestic affections the young stranger must be either deceiving himor an exception to his countrymen  and if he was that exceptionwhat then an idea which had sprung up in father estebans fancy that morning now took possession of it with the tenacity of a growth on fertile virgin soil the good father had been devoted to the conversion of the heathen with the fervor of a oneideaed man but his successes had been among the indiansa guileless harmless race who too often confounded the practical benefits of civilization with the abstract benefits of the church and their instruction had been simple and coercive there had been no necessity for argument or controversy the worthy priests skill in polemical warfare and disputation had never been brought into play the comandante and alcalde were as punctiliously orthodox as himself and the small traders and artisans were hopelessly docile and submissive the march of science which had been stopped by the local fogs of todos santos some fifty years had not disturbed the simple aesculapius of the province with heterodox theories he still purged and bled like sangrado and met the priest at the deathbed of his victims with a pious satisfaction that had no trace of skeptical contention in fact the gentle mission of todos santos had hitherto presented no field for the good fathers exalted ambition nor the display of his powers as a zealot and here was a splendid opportunity  the conversion of this dark impulsive hysterical stranger would be a gain to the fold and a triumph worthy of his steel more than that if he had judged correctly of this young mans mind and temperament they seemed to contain those elements of courage and sacrificial devotion that indicated the missionary priesthood with such a subaltern what might not he father esteban accomplish looking further into the future what a glorious successor might be left to his unfinished work on todos santos  buried in these reflections padre esteban sauntered leisurely up the garden that gradually ascended the slight elevation on which the greater part of the pueblo was built through a low gateway in the wall he passed on to the crest of the one straggling street of todos santos on either side of him were ranged the low onestoried deepwindowed adobe fondas and artisans dwellings with lowpitched roofs of dull red pipelike tiles absorbed in his fanciful dreams he did not at first notice that those dwellings appeared deserted and that even the posada opposite him whose courtyard was usually filled with lounging muleteers was empty and abandoned looking down the street towards the plaza he became presently aware of some undefined stirring in the peaceful hamlet there was an unusual throng in the square and afar on that placid surface of the bay from which the fog had lifted the two or three fishingboats of todos santos were vaguely pulling but the strange ship was gone  a feeling of intense relief and satisfaction followed father esteban pulled out his snuffbox and took a long and complacent pinch but his relief was quickly changed to consternation as an armed cavalcade rapidly wheeled out of the plaza and cantered towards him with the unmistakable spectacle of the male passengers of the excelsior riding two and two and guarded by double files of dragoons on each side  at a sign from the priest the subaltern reined in his mustang halted the convoy and saluted respectfully to the astonishment of the prisoners the clerical authority of todos santos evidently dominated the military renewed hope sprang up in the hearts of the excelsior party  what have we here asked padre esteban  a revolution your reverence among the americanos with robbery of the presidio salutinggun a grave affair your reverence has been sent for by the comandante i am taking these men to san antonio to await the decision of the council  and the ship  gone your reverence one of the parties has captured it  and these  are the legitimists your reverence at least they have confessed to have warred with mexico and invaded californiathe brigands  the priest remained lost for a moment in blank and bitter amazement banks took advantage of the pause to edge his way to the front  ask him some of you he said turning to brace and crosby when this dd farce will be over and where we can find the head manthe boss idiot of this foolery  let him put it milder whispered winslow you got us into trouble enough with your tongue already  crosby hesitated a moment  quand finira ce drole representationetetqui est ce qui est lentrepreneur he said dubiously  the priest stared these americans were surely cooler and less excitable than his strange guest a thought struck him  how many are still in the ship he asked gently  nobody but perkins and that piratical crew of niggers  and that infernal hurlstone added winslow  the priest pricked up his ears  hurlstone he repeated  yesa passenger like ourselves as we supposed but we are satisfied now he was in the conspiracy from the beginning translated crosby painfully  look at his strange disappearancea regular putup job broke in brace in english without reference to the padres not comprehending him so that he and perkins could shut themselves up together without suspicion  never mind hurlstone now hes gone and were here said banks angrily ask the parson as a gentleman and a christian what sort of a hole weve got into anyhow how far is the next settlement  crosby put the question the subaltern lit a cigarette  there is no next settlement the pueblo ends at san antonio  and whats beyond that  the ocean  and whats south  the desertone cannot pass it  and north  the desert  and east  the desert too  then how do you get away from here  we do not get away  and how do you communicate with mexicowith your government  when a ship comes  and when does a ship come  quien sabe  the officer threw away his cigarette  i say youll tell the commander that all this is illegal and that im going to complain to our government continued banks hurriedly  i go to speak to the comandante responded the priest gravely  and tell him that if he touches a hair of the ladies heads well have his own scalp interrupted brace impetuously  even crosbys diplomatic modification of this speech did not appear entirely successful  the mexican soldier wars not with women said the priest coldly adieu messieurs  the cavalcade moved on the excelsior passengers at once resumed their chorus of complaint tirade and aggressive suggestion heedless of the soldiers who rode stolidly on each side  to think we havent got a single revolver among us said brace despairingly  we might each grab a carbine from these nigger fellows said crosby eying them contemplatively  and if they didnt burst and we werent shot by the next patrol and if wed calculated to be mean enough to run away from the womenwhere would we escape to asked banks curtly hold on at least until we get an ultimatum from that commodious ass at the presidio then well anticipate the foolkiller if you like my opinion is they arent in any great hurry to try anything on us just yet  and i say lie low and keep dark until they show their hand added winslow who had no relish for an indiscriminate scrimmage and had his own ideas of placating their captors  nevertheless by degrees they fell into a silence partly the effect of the strangely enervating air the fog had completely risen from the landscape and hung high in midair through which an intense sun shorn of its fierceness diffused a lambent warmth and a yellowish unctuous light as if it had passed through amber the bay gleamed clearly and distinctly not a shadow flecked its surface to the gray impenetrable rampart of fog that stretched like a granite wall before its entrance on one side of the narrow road billows of monstrous grain undulated to the crest of the low hills that looked like larger undulations of the soil furrowed by bosky canadas or shining arroyos banks was startled into a burst of professional admiration  theres enough grain there to feed a thousand todos santos and raised too with tools like that he continued pointing to a primitive plow that lay on the wayside formed by a single forked root a passing oxcart whose creaking wheels were made of a solid circle of wood apparently sawn from an ordinary log again plunged him into cogitation here and there little areas of the rudest cultivation broke into a luxuriousness of orange lime and fig trees the joyous earth at the slightest provocation seemed to smile and dimple with fruit and flowers everywhere the rare beatitudes of todos santos revealed and repeated its simple story the fructifying influence of earth and sky the intervention of a vaporous veil between a fiery sun and fiery soil the combination of heat and moisture purified of feverish exhalations and made sweet and wholesome by the saline breath of the mighty sea had been the beneficent legacy of their isolation the munificent compensation of their oblivion  a gradual and gentle ascent at the end of two hours brought the cavalcade to a halt upon a rugged upland with semitropical shrubbery and here and there larger trees from the tierra templada in the evergreens or madrono a few low huts and corrals and a rambling hacienda were scattered along the crest and in the midst arose a little votive chapel flanked by peartrees near the roadside were the crumbling edges of some longforgotten excavation crosby gazed at it curiously touching the arm of the officer he pointed to it  una mina de plata said the officer sententiously  a mine of some kindsilver i bet said crosby turning to the others is it goodbuenoyou know he continued to the officer with vague gesticulations  en tiempos pasados returned the officer gravely  i wonder what that means said winslow  but before crosby could question further the subaltern signaled to them to dismount they did so and their horses were led away to a little declivity whence came the sound of running water left to themselves the americans looked around them the cavalcade seemed to have halted near the edge of a precipitous ridge the evident termination of the road but the view that here met their eyes was unexpected and startling  the plateau on which they stood seemed to drop suddenly away leaving them on the rocky shore of a monotonous and farstretching sea of waste and glittering sand not a vestige nor trace of vegetation could be seen except an occasional ridge of straggling pallid bushes raised in hideous simulation of the broken crest of a ghostly wave on either side as far as the eye could reach the hollow empty vision extendedthe interminable desert stretched and panted before them  its the jumpingoff place i reckon said crosby and theyve brought us here to show us how small is our chance of getting away but he added turning towards the plateau again what are they doing now pon my soul i believe theyre going offand leaving us  the others turned as he spoke it was true the dragoons were coolly galloping off the way they came taking with them the horses the americans had just ridden  i call that cool said crosby it looks deuced like as if we were to be left here to graze like cattle  perhaps thats their idea of a prison in this country said banks theres certainly no chance of our breaking jail in that direction he added pointing to the desert and we cant follow them without horses  and i dare say theyve guarded the pass in the road lower down said winslow  we ought to be able to hold our own here until night said brace and then make a dash into todos santos get hold of some arms and join the ladies  the women are all right said crosby impatiently and are better treated than if we were with them suppose instead of maundering over them we reconnoitre and see what we can do here im getting devilishly hungry they cant mean to starve us and if they do i dont intend to be starved as long as there is anything to be had by buying or stealing come along theres sure to be fruit near that old chapel and i saw some chickens in the bush near those huts first lets see if theres any one about i dont see a soul  the little plateau indeed seemed deserted in vain they shouted their voices were lost in the echoless air they examined one by one the few thatched huts they were open contained one or two rude articles of furniturea bed a bench and tablewere scrupulously cleanand empty they next inspected the chapel it was tawdry and barbaric in ornament but the candlesticks and crucifix and the basin for holy water were of heavily beaten silver the same thought crossed their mindsthe abandoned mine at the roadside  bananas oranges and pricklypears growing within the cactushedge of the chapel partly mollified their thirst and hunger and they turned their steps towards the long rambling barracklooking building with its low windows and redtiled roof which they had first noticed here too the tenement was deserted and abandoned but there was evidence of some previous and more ambitious preparation in a long dormitory off the corridor a number of scrupulously clean beds were ranged against the whitewashed walls with spotless benches and tables to the complete astonishment and bewilderment of the party another room fitted up as a kitchen with the simpler appliances of housekeeping revealed a larder filled with provisions and meal a shout from winslow who had penetrated the inner courtyard however drew them to a more remarkable spectacle their luggage and effects from the cabins of the excelsior were there carefully piled in the antique oxcart that had evidently that morning brought them from todos santos  theres no mistake said brace with a relieved look after a hurried survey of the trunks they have only brought our baggage the ladies have evidently had the opportunity of selecting their own things  crosby told you theyd be all right said banks and as for ourselves i dont see why we cant be pretty comfortable here and all the better for our being alone i shall take an opportunity of looking around a bit it strikes me that there are some resources in this country that might pay to develop  and i shall have a look at that playedout mine said crosby if its been worked as they work the land theyve left about as much in it as theyve taken out  thats all well enough said brace drawing a dull vermilioncolored stone from his pocket but heres something i picked up just now that aint played out nor even the value of it suspected by those fellows thats cinnabarquicksilver oreand a big per cent of it too and if theres as much of it here as the indications show you could buy up all your silver mines in the country with it  if i were you id put up a notice on a post somewhere as they do in california and claim discovery said banks seriously theres no knowing how this thing may end we may not get away from here for some time yet and if the government will sell the place cheap it wouldnt be a bad spec to buy it form a kind of excelsior company among ourselves you know and go shares  the four men looked earnestly at each other already the lost excelsior and her mutinous crew were forgotten even the incidents of the morningtheir arrest the uncertainty of their fate and the fact that they were in the hands of a hostile communityappeared but as trivial preliminaries to the new life that opened before them they suddenly became graver than they had ever beeneven in the moment of peril  i dont see why we shouldnt said brace quickly we started out to do that sort of thing in california and i reckon if wed found such a spot as this on the sacramento or american river wed have been content we can take turns at housekeeping prospect a little and enter into negotiations with the government im for offering them a fair sum for this ridge and all it contains at once  the only thing against that said crosby slowly is the probability that it is already devoted to some other use by the government ever since weve been here ive been thinkingi dont know whythat weve been put in a sort of quarantine the desertion of the place the half hospital arrangements of this building and the means they have taken to isolate us from themselves must mean something ive read somewhere that in these outoftheway spots in the tropics they have a place where they put the fellows with malarious or contagious diseases i dont want to frighten you boys but ive an idea that were in a sort of lazaretto and the people outside wont trouble us often     chapter x  todos santos solves the mystery   notwithstanding his promise and the summons of the council father esteban on parting with the excelsior prisoners in the san antonio road did not proceed immediately to the presence of the comandante partly anxious to inform himself more thoroughly regarding hurlstones antecedents before entering upon legislative functions that might concern him partly uneasy at braces allusion to any possible ungentleness in the treatment of the fair americanas and partly apprehensive that mrs brimmer might seek him at the mission in the present emergency the good father turned his steps towards the alcaldes house  mrs brimmer in a becoming morning wrapper half reclining in an indian hammock in the corridor supported by miss chubb started at his approach so did the young alcalde sympathetically seated at her side padre esteban for an instant was himself embarrassed mrs brimmer quickly recovered her usual bewildering naivete  i knew you would come but if you hadnt i should have mustered courage enough to go with miss chubb to find you at the mission she said half coquettishly not but that don ramon has been all kindness and consideration but you know one always clings to ones spiritual adviser in such an emergency and although there are differences of opinion between us i think i may speak to you as freely as i would speak to my dear friend dr potts of trinity chapel of course you dont know him but you couldnt have helped liking him hes so gentle so tactful so refined but do tell me the fullest particulars of this terrible calamity that has happened so awkwardly tell me all i fear that don ramon out of kindness has not told me everything i have been perfectly frank i told him everythingwho i am who mr brimmer is and given him even the connections of my friend miss chubb i can do no more but you will surely have no difficulty in finding some one in todos santos who has heard of the quincys and brimmers ive no doubt that there are books in your library that mention them of course i can say nothing of the other passengers except that mr brimmer would not have probably permitted me to associate with any notorious persons i confess nowi think i told you once before clarissathat i greatly doubted captain bunkers ability  ah murmured don ramon  to make a social selection continued mrs brimmer he may have been a good sailor and boxed his compass but he lacked a knowledge of the world of the other passengers i can truly say i know nothing i cannot think that mr crosbys sense of humor led him into bad associations or that he ever went beyond verbal impropriety certainly nothing in miss keenes character has led me to believe she could so far forget what was due to herself and to us as to address a lawless mob in the streets as she did just now although her friend mrs markham as i just told don ramon is an advocate of womens rights and female suffrage and i believe she contemplates addressing the public from the lecturers platform  it isnt possible interrupted don ramon excitedly in mingled horror of the masculinely rampant mrs markham and admiration of the fascinatingly feminine mrs brimmer a lady cannot be an oratora haranguer of men  not in society responded mrs brimmer with a sigh and i do not remember to have met the lady before the fact is she does not move in our circlein the upper classes  the alcalde exchanged a glance with the padre  ah you have classes and she is of a distinct class perhaps  decidedly said mrs brimmer promptly  pardon me said padre esteban with gentle persuasiveness but you are speaking of your fellowpassengers know you not then of one hurlstone who is believed to be still in the ship excelsior and perhaps of the party who seized it  mr hurlstoneit is possible but i know really nothing of him said mrs brimmer carelessly i dont think clarissa did eitherdid you dear even in our enforced companionship we had to use some reserve and we may have drawn the line at him he was a friend of miss keenes indeed she was the only one who seemed to know him  and she is now here asked the padre eagerly  no she is with her friend the senora markham at the presidio the comandante has given her the disposition of his house said don ramon with a glance of grave archness at mrs brimmer it is not known which is the most favored the eloquent orator or the beautiful and daring leader  mrs markham is a married woman said mrs brimmer severely and of course she can do as she pleases but it is far different with miss keene i should scarcely consider it proper to expose miss chubb to the hospitality of a single man without other women and i cannot understand how she could leave the companionship and protection of your lovely sisters  the priest here rose and with formal politeness excused himself urging the peremptory summons of the council  i scarcely expected indeed to have had the pleasure of seeing my colleague here he added with quiet suavity turning to the alcalde  i have already expressed my views to the comandante said the official with some embarrassment and my attendance will hardly be required  the occasional misleading phosphorescence of mrs brimmers quiet eyes early alluded to in these pages did not escape father estebans quick perception at that moment however he preferred to leave his companion to follow its aberrations rather than to permit that fair ignis fatuus to light him on his way by it  but my visit to you father esteban she began sweetly is only postponed  until i have the pleasure of anticipating it here said the priest with paternal politeness bending before the two ladies but for the present au revoir  it would be an easy victory to win this discreetly emotional americana to the church said father esteban to himself as he crossed the plaza but if i mistake not she would not cease to be a disturbing element even there however she is not such as would give this hurlstone any trouble it seems i must look elsewhere for the brains of this party and to find a solution of this young mans mystery and if i judge correctly it is with this beautiful young agitator of revolutions and her oratorical duenna i must deal  he entered the low gateway of the presidio unchallenged and even traversed the courtyard without meeting a soul the guard and sentries had evidently withdrawn to their habitual peaceful vocations and the former mediaeval repose of the venerable building had returned there was no one in the guardroom but as the priest turned back to the corridor his quick ear was suddenly startled by the unhallowed and inconsistent sounds of a guitar a monotonous voice alsothe comandantes evidentlywas raised in a thin high recitative  the padre passed hastily through the guardroom and opened the door of the passage leading to the garden slope here an extraordinary group presented itself to his astonished eyes in the shadow of a palmtree mrs markham seated on her saratoga trunk as on a throne was gazing blandly down upon the earnest features of the commander who at her feet guitar in hand was evidently repeating some musical composition his subaltern sat near him divided in admiration of his chief and the guest miss keene at a little distance aided by the secretary was holding an animated conversation with a short stout sancho panzalooking man whom the padre recognized as the doctor of todos santos  at the apparition of the reverend father the commander started the subaltern stared and even the secretary and the doctor looked discomposed  i am decidedly de trop this morning soliloquized the ecclesiastic but miss keene cut short his reflection by running to him frankly with outstretched hand  i am so glad that you have come she said with a youthful unrestrained earnestness that was as convincing as it was fascinating for you will help me to persuade this gentleman that poor captain bunker is suffering more from excitement of mind than body and that bleeding him is more than folly  the mans veins are in a burning fever and delirium from aguardiente said the little doctor excitedly and the fire must first be put out by the lancet  he is only crazy with remorse for having lost his ship through his own carelessness and the treachery of others said miss keene doughtily  he is a maniac and will kill himself unless his fever is subdued persisted the doctor  and you would surely kill him by your way of subduing it said the young girl boldly better for him a disgraced man of honor to die by his own hand than to be bled like a calf into a feeble and helpless dissolution i would if i were in his placeif i had to do it by tearing off the bandages  she made a swift half unconscious gesture of her little hand and stopped her beautiful eyes sparkling her thin pink nostrils dilated her red lips parted her round throat lifted in the air and one small foot advanced before her the men glanced hurriedly at each other and then fixed their eyes upon her with a rapt yet frightened admiration to their simple minds it was anarchy and revolution personified beautiful and victorious  ah said the secretary to padre esteban in spanish it is true she knows not fear she was in the room alone with the madman he would let none approach but her she took a knife from himelse the medico had suffered  he recognized her you see ah they know her power said the comandante joining the group  you will help me father esteban said the young girl letting the fire of her dark eyes soften to a look of almost childish appealyou will help me to intercede for him it is the restraint only that is killing himthat is goading him to madness think of him fatherthink of him ruined and disgraced dying to retrieve himself by any reckless action any desperate chance of recovery and yet locked up where he can do nothingattempt nothingnot even lift a hand to pursue the man who has helped to bring him to this  but he can do nothing the ship is gone remonstrated the comandante  yes the ship is gone but the ocean is still there said miss keene  but he has no boat  he will find or make one  and the fog conceals the channel  he can go where they have gone or meet their fate you do not know my countrymen senor comandante she said proudly  ah yespardon they are at san antoniothe baker the buffoon the two young men who dig they are already baking and digging and joking we have it from my officer who has just returned  miss keene bit her pretty lips  they think it is a mistake they cannot believe that any intentional indignity is offered them she said quietly perhaps it is well they do not  they desired me to express their condolences to the senora said the padre with exasperating gentleness and were relieved to be assured by me of your perfect security in the hands of these gentlemen  miss keene raised her clear eyes to the ecclesiastic that accomplished diplomat of todos santos absolutely felt confused under the cool scrutiny of this girls unbiased and unsophisticated intelligence  then you have seen them she said and you know their innocence and the utter absurdity of this surveillance  i have not seen them all said the priest softly there is still anothera senor hurlstonewho is missing is he not  it was not in the possibility of eleanor keenes truthful blood to do other than respond with a slight color to this question she had already concealed from every one the fact of having seen the missing man in the mission garden the evening before it did not however prevent her the next moment from calmly meeting the glance of the priest as she answered gravely  i believe so but i cannot see what that has to do with the detention of the others  much perhaps it has been said that you alone my child were in the confidence of this man  who dared say that exclaimed miss keene in english forgetting herself in her indignation  if its anything meanits mrs brimmer ill bet a cooky said mrs markham whose linguistic deficiencies had debarred her from the previous conversation  you have only continued the priest without noticing the interruption to tell us what you know of this hurlstones plansof his complicity with senor perkins or he added significantly his opposition to themto insure that perfect justice shall be done to all  relieved that the question involved no disclosure of her only secret regarding hurlstone miss keene was about to repeat the truth that she had no confidential knowledge of him or of his absurd alleged connection with senor perkins when with an instinct of tact she hesitated might she not serve them alleven hurlstone himselfby saying nothing and leaving the burden of proof to their idiotic accusers was she altogether sure that hurlstone was entirely ignorant of senor perkins plans or might he not have refused at the last moment to join in the conspiracy and so left the ship  i will not press you for your answer now said the priest gently but you will not i know keep back anything that may throw a light on this sad affair and perhaps help to reinstate your friend mr hurlstone in his real position  if you ask me if i believe that mr hurlstone had anything to do with this conspiracy i should say unhesitatingly that i do not and more i believe that he would have jumped overboard rather than assent to so infamous an act said the young girl boldly  then you think he had no other motive for leaving the ship said the priest slowly  decidedly not she stopped a curious anxious look in the padres persistent eyes both annoyed and frightened her what other motive could he have she said coldly  father estebans face lightened  i only ask because i think you would have known it thank you for the assurance all the same and in return i promise you i will use my best endeavors with the comandante for your friend the captain bunker adieu my daughter adieu madame markham he said as taking the arm of don miguel he turned with him and the doctor towards the guardroom the secretary lingered behind for a moment  fear nothing he said in whispered english to miss keene i ruy sanchez shall make you free of capitano bunkers cell and passed on  well said mrs markham when the two women were alone again i dont pretend to fathom the befogged brains of todos santos but as far as i can understand their grownup childs play they are making believe this unfortunate mr hurlstone who may be dead for all we know is in revolt against the united states government which is supposed to be represented by senor perkins and the excelsiorthink of that  but perkins signed himself of the quinquinambo navy said miss keene wonderingly  that is firmly believed by those idiots to be one of our states remember they know nothing of what has happened anywhere in the last fifty years i dare say they never heard of filibusters like perkins and they couldnt comprehend him if they had ive given up trying to enlighten them and i think theyre grateful for it it makes their poor dear heads ache  and it is turning mine but for heavens sake tell me what part i am supposed to act in this farce said miss keene  you are the friend and colleague of hurlstone dont you see said mrs markham you are two beautiful young patriotsdont blush my dearendeared to each other and a common cause and ready to die for your country in opposition to perkins and the faintheartedness of such neutrals as mrs brimmer miss chubb the poor captain and all the men whom they have packed off to san antonio  impossible said miss keene yet with an uneasy feeling that it not only was possible but that she herself had contributed something to the delusion but how do they account for my friendship with youyou who are supposed to be a correspondentan accomplice of perkins  no no returned mrs markham with a half serious smile i am not allowed that honor i am presumed to be only the disconsolate dulcinea of perkins abandoned by him pitied by you and converted to the true faithat least that is what i make out from the broken english of that little secretary of the commander  miss keene winced  thats all my fault dear she said suddenly entwining her arms round mrs markham and hiding her half embarrassed smile on the shoulder of her strongminded friend they suggested it to me and i half assented to save you please forgive me  dont think i am blaming you my dear eleanor said mrs markham for heavens sake assent to the wildest and most extravagant hypothesis they can offer if it will leave us free to arrange our own plans for getting away i begin to think we were not a very harmonious party on the excelsior and most of our troubles here are owing to that we forget we have fallen among a lot of original saints as guileless and as unsophisticated as our first parents who know nothing of our customs and antecedents they have accepted us on what they believe to be our own showing from first to last weve underrated them forgetting they are in the majority we cant expect to correct the ignorance of fifty years in twentyfour hours and i for one shant attempt it id much rather trust to the character those people would conceive of me from their own consciousness than to one mrs brimmer or mr winslow would give of me from this moment ive taken a firm resolve to leave my reputation and the reputation of my friends entirely in their hands if you are wise you will do the same they are inclined to worship youdont hinder them my belief is if we only take things quietly we might find worse places to be stranded on than todos santos if mrs brimmer and those men of ours who i dare say have acted as silly as the mexicans themselves will only be quiet we can have our own way here yet  and poor captain bunker said miss keene  it seems hard to say it but in my opinion he is better under lock and key for everybodys good at present hed be a firebrand in the town if he got away meantime let us go to our room it is about the time when everybody is taking a siesta and for two hours thank heaven were certain nothing more can happen  ill join you in a moment said miss keene  her quick ear had caught the sound of voices approaching as mrs markham disappeared in the passage the commander and his party reappeared from the guardroom taking leave of padre esteban the secretary as he passed miss keene managed to add to his formal salutation the whispered wordswhen the angelus rings i will await you before the grating of his prison  padre esteban was too preoccupied to observe this incident as soon as he quitted the presidio he hastened to the mission with a disquieting fear that his strange guest might have vanished but crossing the silent refectory and opening the door of the little apartment he was relieved to find him stretched on the pallet in a profound slumber the peacefulness of the venerable walls had laid a gentle finger on his weary eyelids  the padre glanced round the little cell and back again at the handsome suffering face that seemed to have found surcease and rest in the narrow walls with a stirring of regret but the next moment he awakened the sleeper and in the briefest almost frigid sentences related the events of the morning  the young man rose to his feet with a bitter laugh  you see he said god is against me and yet a few hours ago i dared to think that he had guided me to a haven of rest and forgetfulness  have you told the truth to him and to me said the priest sternly or have youa mere political refugeetaken advantage of an old mans weakness to forge a foolish lie of sentimental passion  what do you mean said hurlstone turning upon him almost fiercely  the priest rose and drawing a folded paper from his bosom opened it before the eyes of his indignant guest  remember what you told me last night in the sacred confidences of yonder holy church and hear what you really are from the lips of the council of todos santos  smoothing out the paper he read slowly as follows   whereas it being presented to an emergency council held at the presidio of todos santos that the foreign barque excelsior had mutinied discharged her captain and passengers and escaped from the waters of the bay it was on examination found and decreed that the said barque was a vessel primarily owned by a foreign power then and there confessed and admitted to be at war with mexico and equipped to invade one of her northern provinces but that the god of liberty and justice awakening in the breasts of certain patriotsto wit the heroic senor diego hurlstone and the invincible dona leonorthe courage and discretion to resist the tyranny and injustice of their oppressors caused them to mutiny and abandon the vessel rather than become accomplices in the company of certain neutral and noncombatant traders and artisans severally known as brace banks winslow and crosby and certain aristocrats known as senoras brimmer and chubb in consideration thereof it is decreed by the council of todos santos that asylum refuge hospitality protection amity and alliance be offered and extended to the patriots senor diego hurlstone dona leonor and a certain duenna susana markham particularly attached to dona leonors person and that war reprisal banishment and death be declared against senor perkins his unknown aiders and abettors and that for the purposes of probation and in the interests of clemency provisional parole shall be extended to the alleged neutralsbrace banks crosby and winslowwithin the limits and boundaries of the lazaretto of san antonio until their neutrality shall be established and pending the further pleasure of the council and it is further decreed and declared that one capitano bunker formerly of the excelsior but now a maniac and lunaticbeing irresponsible and visited of god shall be exempted from the ordinances of this decree until his reason shall be restored and during that interval subjected to the ordinary remedial and beneficent restraint of civilization and humanity by order of the council  the signatures and rubrics of  don miguel briones  comandante  padre esteban  of the order of san francisco dassisis  don ramon ramirez  alcalde of the pueblo of todos santos     chapter xi  the captain follows his ship   when padre esteban had finished reading the document he laid it down and fixed his eyes on the young man hurlstone met his look with a glance of impatient disdain  what have you to say to this asked the ecclesiastic a little impressed by his manner  that as far as it concerns myself it is a farrago of absurdity if i were the person described there why should i have sought you with what you call a lie of sentimental passion when i could have claimed protection openly with my sister patriot he added with a bitter laugh  because you did not know then the sympathy of the people nor the decision of the council said the priest  but i know it now and i refuse to accept it  you refusetoto accept it echoed the priest  i do he walked towards the door before i go let me thank you for the few hours rest and security that you have given to one who may be a cursed man yet is no impostor but i do not blame you for doubting one who talks like a desperate man yet lacks the courage of desperation goodby  where are you going  what matters there is a safer protection and security to be found than even that offered by the council of todos santos  his eyes were averted but not before the priest had seen them glaze again with the same gloomy absorption that had horrified him in the church the evening before father esteban stepped forward and placed his soft hand on hurlstones shoulder  look at me dont turn your face aside but hear me for i believe your story  without raising his eyes the young man lifted father estebans hand from his shoulder pressed it lightly and put it quietly aside  i thank you he said for keeping at least that unstained memory of me but it matters little now goodby  he had his hand upon the door but the priest again withheld him  when i tell you i believe your story it is only to tell you more i believe that god has directed your wayward wandering feet here to his house that you may lay down the burden of your weak and suffering manhood before his altar and become once more a child of his i stand here to offer you not a refuge of a day or a night but for all time not a hidingplace from man or woman but from yourself my sonyourself your weak and mortal self more fatal to you than all i stand here to open for you not only the door of this humble cell but that of his yonder blessed mansion you shall share my life with me you shall be one of my disciples you shall help me strive for other souls as i have striven for yours the protection of the church which is allpowerful shall be around you if you wish to be known you shall hide yourself in its mysteries if you wish to be forgotten you shall be my child my companion my friend all that my age can give you shall be yours while i live and it shall be your place one day to take up my unfinished work when it falls from these palsied hands forever  you are mistaken said the young man coldly i came to you for human aid and thank you for what you have granted me i have not been presumptuous enough to ask more nor to believe myself a fitting subject for conversion i am weak but not weak enough to take advantage of the mistaken kindness of either the temporal council of todos santos or its spiritual head he opened the door leading into the garden forget and forgive me father esteban and let me say farewell  stop said the ecclesiastic raising himself to his full height and stepping before hurlstone then if you will not hear me in the name of your father who lives in the name of your father who is dead i command you to stay i stand here today in the place of that man i never knewto hold back his son from madness and crime think of me as of him whom you loved and grant to an old man who might have had a son as old as you the right of throwing a fathers protecting arm around you  there was a moments silence  what do you want me to do said hurlstone suddenly lifting his now moist and glistening eyes upon the old man  give me your word of honor that for twentyfour hours you will remain as you arepledging yourself to nothingonly promising to commit no act take no step without consulting me you will not be sought here nor yet need you keep yourself a prisoner in these gloomy wallsexcept that by exposing yourself to the people now you might be compromised to some course that you are not ready to take  i promise said hurlstone  he turned and held out both his hands but father esteban anticipated him with a paternal gesture of uplifted and opened arms and for an instant the young mans forehead was bowed on the priests shoulder  father esteban gently raised the young mans head  you will take a pasear in the garden until the angelus rings my son while the air is sweet and wholesome and think this over remember that you may accept the hospitality of the council without sin of deception you were not in sympathy with either the captors of the excelsior or their defeated party for you would have flown from both you of all your party now in todos santos are most in sympathy with us you have no cause to love your own people you have abandoned them for us go my son and meditate upon my words i will fetch you from yonder slope in time for the evening refection  hurlstone bowed his head and turned his irresolute feet towards the upper extremity of the garden indicated by the priest which seemed to offer more seclusion and security than the avenue of peartrees he was dazed and benumbed the old dogged impulses of selfdestructionrevived by the priests reproaches but checked by the vision of his dead and forgotten father which the priests words had called upgave way in turn to his former despair with it came a craving for peace and rest so insidious that in some vague fear of yielding to it he quickened his pace as if to increase his distance from the church and its apostle he was almost out of breath when he reached the summit and turned to look back upon the mission buildings and the straggling street of the pueblo which now for the first time he saw skirted the wall of the garden in its descent towards the sea he had not known the full extent of todos santos before when he swam ashore he had landed under a crumbling outwork of the fort he gazed now with curious interest over the hamlet that might have been his home he looked over the redtiled roofs and further on to the shining bay shut in by the impenetrable rampart of fog he might have found rest and oblivion here but for the intrusion of those fellowpassengers to share his exile and make it intolerable how he hated and loathed them all yet the next moment he found himself scrutinizing the street and plaza below him for a glimpse of his countrywomen whom he knew were still in the town or vainly endeavoring to locate their habitation among the redtiled roofs and that frank cleareyed girlmiss keeneshe who had seemed to vaguely pity himshe was somewhere here tooselected by the irony of fate to be his confederate he could not help thinking of her beauty and kindness now with a vague curiosity that was half an uneasiness it had not struck him before but if he were to accept the ridiculous attitude forced upon him by todos santos its absurdity as well as its responsibility would become less odious by sharing it with another perhaps it might be to her advantageand if so would he be justified in exposing its absurdity he would have to see her firstand if he did how would he explain his real position a returning wave of bitterness threw him back into his old despair  the twilight had slowly gathered over the view as he gazedor rather a luminous concentration above the pueblo and bay had left the outer circle of fog denser and darker emboldened by the apparent desertion of the embarcadero he began to retrace his steps down the slope keeping close to the wall so as to avoid passing before the church again or a closer contact with the gardener among the vines in this way he reached the path he had skirted the night before and stopped almost under the shadow of the alcaldes house it was here he had rested and hiddenhere he had tasted the first sweets of isolation and oblivion in the dreamy gardenhere he had looked forward to peace with the passing of the shipand now the sound of voices and laughter suddenly grated upon his ear he had heard those voices before their distinctness startled him until he became aware that he was standing before a broken halfrotting door that permitted a glimpse of the courtyard of the neighboring house he glided quickly past it without pausing but in that glimpse beheld mrs brimmer and miss chubb half reclining in the corridorin the attitude he had often seen them on the deck of the shiptalking and laughing with a group of mexican gallants a feeling of inconceivable loathing and aversion took possession of him was it to this he was returning after his despairing search for oblivion their empty idle laughter seemed to ring mockingly in his ears as he hurried on scarce knowing whither until he paused before the broken cactus hedge and crumbling wall that faced the embarcadero a glance over the hedge showed him that the strip of beach was deserted he looked up the narrow street it was empty a few rapid strides across it gained him the shadow of the seawall of the presidio unchecked and unhindered the ebbing tide had left a foot or two of narrow shingle between the sea and the wall he crept along this until a hundred yards distant the seawall reentered inland around a bastion at the entrance of a moat half filled at high tide by the waters of the bay but now a ditch of shallow pools sand and debris he leaned against the bastion and looked over the softly darkening water  how quiet it looked and under that vaporous veil how profound and inscrutable how easy to slip into its allembracing arms and sink into its yielding bosom leaving behind no stain trace or record a surer oblivion than the church which could not absolve memory grant forgetfulness nor even hide the ghastly footprints of its occupants here was obliteration but was he sure of that he thought of the body of the murdered peruvian laid out at the feet of the council by this same fickle and uncertain sea he thought of his own distorted face subjected to the cold curiosity of these aliens or the contemptuous pity of his countrymen but that could be avoided it was easy for hima good swimmerto reach a point far enough out in the channel for the ebbing tides to carry him past that barrier of fog into the open and obliterating ocean and then at least it might seem as if he had attempted to escapeindeed if he cared he might be able to keep afloat until he was picked up by some passing vessel bound to a distant land the selfdelusion pleased him and seemed to add the clinching argument to his resolution it was not suicide it was escapecertainly no more than escapehe intended and this miserable sophism of selfapology the last flashes of expiring conscience helped to light up his pale determined face with satisfaction he began coolly to divest himself of his coat  what was thatthe sound of some dislodged stones splashing in one of the pools further up he glanced hurriedly round the wall of the bastion a figure crouching against the side of the ditch as if concealing itself from observation on the glacis above was slowly approaching the sea suddenly when within a hundred yards of hurlstone it turned crossed the ditch rapidly mounted its crumbling sides and disappeared over the crest but in that hurried glimpse he had recognized captain bunker  the sudden and mysterious apparition of this man produced on hurlstone an effect that the most violent opposition could not have created without a thought of the terrible purpose it had interrupted and obeying some stronger instinct that had seized him he dashed down into the ditch and up to the crest again after captain bunker but he had completely disappeared a little lagoon making in from the bay on which a small fishingboat was riding and a solitary fisherman mending his nets on the muddy shore a few feet from it were all that was to be seen  he was turning back when he saw the object of his search creeping from some reeds on all fours with a stealthy pantherlike movement towards the unconscious fisherman before hurlstone could utter a cry bunker had sprung upon the unfortunate man thrown him to the earth rapidly rolled him over and over enwrapping him hand and foot in his own net and involving him hopelessly in its meshes tossing the helpless victimwho was apparently too stupefied to call outto one side he was rushing towards the boat when with a single bound hurlstone reached his side and laid his hand upon his shoulder  captain bunker for gods sake what are you doing  captain bunker turned slowly and without apparent concern towards his captor hurlstone fell back before the vacant lacklustre eyes that were fixed upon him  captain bunkers my name said the madman in a whisper lemuel bunker of nantucket hush dont waken him pointing to the prostrate fisherman ive put him to sleep im captain bunkerold drunken bunkerwho stole one ship from her owners and disgraced himself and now is going to steal anotherha ha let me go  captain bunker said hurlstone recovering himself in time to prevent the maniac from dashing into the water look at me dont you know me  yes yes youre one of old bunkers dogs kicked overboard by perkins im one of perkins dogs gone mad and locked up by perkins ha ha but i got out hush she let me out she thought i was going to see the boys at san antonio but im going off to see the old barque out there in the fog im going to chuck perkins overboard and the two mates let me go  he struggled violently hurlstone fearful of quitting his hold to release the fisherman whom captain bunker no longer noticed and not daring to increase the captains fury by openly calling to him beckoned the pinioned man to make an effort but paralyzed by fear the wretched captive remained immovable staring at the struggling men with the strength of desperation hurlstone at last forced the captain down upon his knees  listen captain well go togetheryou understand ill help youbut we must get a larger boat firstyou know  but they wont give it said captain bunker mysteriously didnt you hear the councilthe ownersthe underwriters say he lost his ship hes ruined and disgraced for rum all for rum and we want rum you know and its all over there in the excelsiors locker  yes yes said hurlstone soothingly but theres more in the bigger boat come with me well let the man loose and well make him show us his bigger boat  it was an unfortunate suggestion for the captain who had listened with an insane chuckle and allowed himself to be taken lightly by the hand again caught sight of the prostrate fisherman a yell broke from himhis former frenzy returned with a cry of treachery all hands on deck he threw off hurlstone and rushed into the water  help cried the young man springing after him it is madness he will kill himself  the water was shallow they were both wading they both reached the boat at the same time but the captain had scrambled into the sternsheets and cast loose the painter as hurlstone once more threw his arms about him  hear me captain ill go with you listen i know the way through the fog you understand ill pilot you he was desperate but no longer from despair of himself but of another he was reckless but only to save a madman from the fate that but a moment before he had chosen for himself  captain bunker seemed to soften get in forard he said in a lower voice hurlstone released his grasp but still clinging to the boat which had now drifted into deeper water made his way to the bow he was climbing over the thwarts when a horrified cry from the fisherman ashore and a jarring laugh in his ear caused him to look up but not in time to save himself the treacherous maniac had suddenly launched a blow from an oar at the unsuspecting man as he was rising to his knees it missed his head but fell upon his arm and shoulder precipitating him violently into the sea  stunned by the shock he sank at first like lead to the bottom when he rose again with his returning consciousness he could see that captain bunker had already hoisted sail and with the assistance of his oars was rapidly increasing his distance from the shore with his returning desperation he turned to strike out after him but groaned as his one arm sank powerless to his side a few strokes showed him the madness of the attempt a few more convinced him that he himself could barely return to the shore a sudden torpor had taken possession of himhe was sinking  with this thought a struggle for life began and this man who had just now sought death so eagerlywith no feeling of inconsistency with no physical fear of dissolution with only a vague blind dogged determination to live for some unknown purposea determination as vague and dogged as his former ideas of selfdestructionsummoned all his energies to reach the shore he struck out wildly desperately once or twice he thought he felt his feet touch the bottom only to find himself powerlessly dragged back towards the sea with a final superhuman effort he gained at last a foothold on the muddy strand and half scrambling half crawling sank exhaustedly beside the fishermans net but the fisherman was gone he attempted again to rise to his feet but a strange dizziness attacked him the darkening landscape with its contracting wall of fog the gloomy flat the still pale sea as yet unruffled by the faint land breeze that was slowly wafting the escaping boat into the shadowy offingall swam round him through the roaring in his ears he thought he heard drumbeats and the fanfare of a trumpet and voices the next moment he had lost all consciousness  when he came to he was lying in the guardroom of the presidio among the group of people who surrounded him he recognized the gaunt features of the commander the sympathetic eyes of father esteban and the fisherman who had disappeared when he rose on his elbow and attempted to lift himself feebly the fisherman with a cry of gratitude threw himself on his knees and kissed his helpless hand  he lives he lives your excellencies saints be praised he lives the herothe brave americanothe noble caballero who delivered me from the madman  who are you and whence come you demanded the commander of hurlstone with grave austerity  hurlstone hesitated the priest leaned forward with a half anxious half warning gesture there was a sudden rustle in the passage the crowd gave way as miss keene followed by mrs markham entered the young girls eyes caught those of the prostrate man with an impulsive cry she ran towards him  mr hurlstone  hurlstone echoed the group pressing nearer the astonished man  the comandante lifted his hand gravely with a gesture of silence and then slowly removed his plumed hat every head was instantly uncovered  long live our brave and noble ally don diego long live the beautiful dona leonor  a faint shade of sadness passed over the priests face he glanced from hurlstone to miss keene  then you have consented he whispered  hurlstone cast a rapid glance at eleanor keene  i consent     part ii freed     chapter i  the mourners at san francisco   the telegraph operator at the golden gate of san francisco had long since given up hope of the excelsior during the months of september and october 1854 stimulated by the promised reward and often by the actual presence of her owners he had shown zeal and hope in his scrutiny of the incoming ships the gaunt arms of the semaphore at fort point turned against the sunset sky had regularly recorded the smallest vessel of the whitewinged fleet which sought the portal of the bay during that eventful year of immigration but the excelsior was not amongst them at the close of the year 1854 she was a tradition by the end of january 1855 she was forgotten had she been engulfed in her own element she could not have been more completely swallowed up than in the changes of that shore she never reached whatever interest or hope was still kept alive in solitary breasts the world never knew by the significant irony of fate even the oldtime semaphore that should have signaled her was abandoned and forgotten  the mention of her namealbeit in a quiet unconcerned voicein the dresscircle of a san francisco theatre during the performance of a popular female star was therefore so peculiar that it could only have come from the lips of some one personally interested in the lost vessel yet the speaker was a youngish femininelooking man of about thirty notable for his beardlessness in the crowded circle of bearded and moustachioed californians and had been one of the most absorbed of the enthusiastic audience a weak smile of vacillating satisfaction and uneasiness played on his face during the plaudits of his fellowadmirers as if he were alternately gratified and annoyed it might have passed for a discriminating and truthful criticism of the performance which was a classical burlesque wherein the star displayed an unconventional frankness of shapely limbs and unrestrained gestures and glances but he applauded the more dubious parts equally with the audience he was evidently familiar with the performance for a look of eager expectation greeted most of the business either he had not come for the entire evening or he did not wish to appear as if he had as he sat on one of the back benches near the passage and frequently changed his place he was well even foppishly dressed for the period and appeared to be familiarly known to the loungers in the passage as a man of some social popularity  he had just been recognized by a man of apparently equal importance and distinction who had quietly and unconsciously taken a seat by his side and the recognition appeared equally unexpected and awkward the newcomer was the older and more decorouslooking with an added formality of manner and selfassertion that did not however conceal a certain habitual shrewdness of eye and lip he wore a full beard but the absence of a moustache left the upper half of his handsome and rather satirical mouth uncovered his dress was less pronounced than his companions but of a type of older and more established gentility  i was a little late coming from the office tonight said the younger man with an embarrassed laugh and i thought id drop in here on my way home pretty rough outside aint it  yes its raining and blowing so i thought i wouldnt go up to the plaza for a cab but wait here for the first one that dropped a fare at the door and take it on to the hotel  hold on and ill go with you said the young man carelessly i say brimmer he added after a pause with a sudden assumption of larger gayety theres nothing mean about belle montgomery eh shes a whole team and the little dog under the wagon aint she deuced pretty womanno makeup there eh  she certainly is a fine woman said brimmer gravely borrowing his companions lorgnette by the way markham do you usually keep an operaglass in your office in case of an emergency like this  i reckon it was forgotten in my overcoat pocket said markham with an embarrassed smile  left over from the last time said brimmer rising from his seat well im going nowi suppose ill have to try the plaza  hold on a moment shes coming on nowthere she is he stopped his anxious eyes fixed upon the stage brimmer turned at the same moment in no less interested absorption a quick hush ran through the theatre the men bent eagerly forward as the queen of olympus swept down to the footlights and with a ravishing smile seemed to envelop the whole theatre in a gracious caress  you know pon my word brimmer shes a very superior woman gasped markham excitedly when the goddess had temporarily withdrawn these fellows here he said indicating the audience contemptuously dont know herthink shes all that sort of thing you knowand come here just to look at her but shes very accomplishedin fact a kind of literary woman writes devilish good poetryonly took up the stage on account of domestic trouble drunken husband that beat herregular affecting story you know these sapheaded fools dont of course know that no sir shes a remarkable woman i say brimmer look here ihe hesitated and then went on more boldly as if he had formed a sudden resolution what have you got to do tonight  brimmer who had been lost in abstraction started slightly and said  ioh ive got an appointment with keene you know hes off by the steamerday after tomorrow  what hes not going off on that wildgoose chase after all why the mans got excelsior on the brain he stopped as he looked at brimmers cold face and suddenly colored i mean his planhis ideas all nonsenseyou know that  i certainly dont agree with him began brimmer gravely but  the idea interrupted markham encouraged by brimmers beginning of his knocking around the gulf of california and getting up an expedition to go inland just because a mailsteamer saw a barque like the excelsior off mazatlan last august as if the excelsior wouldnt have gone into mazatlan if it had been her i tell you what it is brimmer its mighty rough on you and me and it aint the square thing at allafter all weve done and the money weve spent and the nights weve sat up over the excelsiorto have this young fellow keene always putting up the bluff of his lost sister on us his lost sister indeed as if we hadnt any feelings  the two men looked at each other and each felt it incumbent to look down and sigh deeplynot hypocritically but perfunctorily as over a past grief although anger had been the dominant expression of the speaker  i was about to remark said brimmer practically that the insurance on the excelsior having been paid her loss is a matter of commercial record and that in a business point of view this plan of keenes aint worth looking at as a private matter of our own feelingspurely domestictheres no question but that we must sympathize with him although he refuses to let us join in the expenses  oh as to that said markham hurriedly i told him to draw on me for a thousand dollars last time i saw him no sir it aint that what gets me is this darned nagging and simpering around and opening old sores and putting on sentimental style and doing the bereaved business generally i reckon hed be even horrified to see you and me herethough it was just a chance with both of us  i think not said brimmer dryly he knows miss montgomery already theyre going by the same steamer  markham looked up quickly  impossible shes going by the other line to panama that ishe hesitatedi heard it from the agent  shes changed her mind so keene says returned brimmer shes going by way of nicaragua he stops at san juan to reconnoitre the coast up to mazatlan goodnight its no use waiting here for a cab any longer im off  hold on said markham struggling out of a sudden uneasy reflection i say brimmer he resumed with an enforced smile which he tried to make playful your engagement with keene wont keep you long what do you say to having a little supper with miss montgomery ehperfectly proper you knowat our hotel just a few friends eh  brimmers eyes and lips slightly contracted  i believe i am already invited he said quietly keene asked me in fact thats the appointment strange he didnt speak of you he added dryly  i suppose its some later arrangement markham replied with feigned carelessness do you know her  slightly  you didnt say so  you didnt ask me said brimmer she came to consult me about south american affairs it seems that filibuster general leonidas alias perkins whose little game we stopped by that peruvian contract actually landed in quinquinambo and established a government it seems she knows him has a great admiration for him as a liberator as she calls him i think they correspond  shes a wonderful woman by jingo brimmer id like to hear whom she dont know said markham beaming with a patronizing vanity theres you and theres that filibuster and old governor pico that shes just snatched baldheadedi mean you know that he recognizes her worth dont you see not like this cattle you see here  are you coming with me said brimmer gravely buttoning up his coat as if encasing himself in a panoply of impervious respectability  ill join you at the hotel said markham hurriedly theres a man over there in the parquet that i want to say a word to dont wait for me  with a slight inclination of the head mr brimmer passed out into the lobby erect selfpossessed and impeccable one or two of his commercial colleagues of maturer age who were loitering leisurely by the wall unwilling to compromise themselves by actually sitting down took heart of grace at this correct apparition brimmer nodded to them coolly as if on change and made his way out of the theatre he had scarcely taken a few steps before a furious onset of wind and rain drove him into a doorway for shelter at the same moment a slouching figure with a turnedup coatcollar slipped past him and disappeared in a passage at his right partly hidden by his lowered umbrella mr brimmer himself escaped notice but he instantly recognized his late companion markham as he resumed his way up the street he glanced into the passage halfway down a light flashed upon the legend stage entrance quincy brimmer with a faint smile passed on to his hotel  it was striking halfpast eleven when mr brimmer again issued from his room in the oriental and passed down a long corridor pausing a moment before a side hall that opened from it he cast a rapid look up and down the corridor and then knocked hastily at a door it was opened sharply by a ladys maid who fell back respectfully before mr brimmers allcorrect presence  half reclining on a sofa in the parlor of an elaborate suite of apartments was the woman whom mr brimmer had a few hours before beheld on the stage of the theatre lifting her eyes languidly from a book that lay ostentatiously on her lap she beckoned her visitor to approach she was a woman still young whose statuesque beauty had but slightly suffered from cosmetics late hours and the habitual indulgence of certain hysterical emotions that were not only inconsistent with the classical suggestions of her figure but had left traces not unlike the grosser excitement of alcoholic stimulation she looked like a tinted statue whose slight mutations through stress of time and weather had been unwisely repaired by freshness of color  i am such a creature of nerves she said raising a superb neck and extending a goddesslike arm that i am always perfectly exhausted after the performance i fly as you see to my first lovepoetryas soon as rosina has changed my dress it is not generally knownbut i dont mind telling youthat i often nerve myself for the effort of acting by reading some wellremembered passage from my favorite poets as i stand by the wings i quaff as one might say a single draught of the pierian spring before i go on  the exact relations between the humorous walk round in which miss montgomery usually made her first entrance and the volume of byron she held in her hand did not trouble mr brimmer so much as the beautiful arm with which she emphasized it neither did it strike him that the distinguishing indications of a poetic exaltation were at all unlike the effects of a grosser stimulant known as champagne cocktail on the less sensitive organization of her colleagues touched by her melancholy but fascinating smile he said gallantly that he had observed no sign of exhaustion or want of power in her performance that evening  then you were there she said fixing her eyes upon him with an expression of mournful gratitude you actually left your business and the calls of public duty to see the poor mountebank perform her nightly task  i was there with a friend of yours answered brimmer soberly who actually asked me to the supper to which mr keene had already invited me and which you had been kind enough to suggest to me a week ago  true i had forgotten said miss montgomery with a large goddesslike indifference that was more effective with the man before her than the most elaborate explanation you dont mind themdo youfor we are all friends together my position you know she added sadly prevents my always following my own inclinations or preferences poor markham i fear the world does not do justice to his gentle impressible nature i sympathize with him deeply we have both had our afflictions we have bothlost good heavens she exclaimed with a sudden exaggerated start of horror what have i done forgive my want of tact dear friend i had forgotten wretched being that i am that you too  she caught his hand in both hers and bowed her head over it as if unable to finish her sentence  brimmer who had been utterly mystified and amazed at this picture of markhams disconsolate attitude to the world and particularly to the woman before him was completely finished by this later tribute to his own affliction his usually composed features however easily took upon themselves a graver cast as he kept and pressed the warm hands in his own  fool that i was continued miss montgomery in thinking of poor markhams childlike open grief i forgot the deeper sorrow that the more manly heart experiences under an exterior that seems cold and impassible yes she said raising her languid eyes to brimmer i ought to have felt the throb of that volcano under its mask of snow you have taught me a lesson  withdrawing her hands hastily as if the volcano had shown some signs of activity she leaned back on the sofa again  you are not yet reconciled to mr keenes expedition then she asked languidly  i believe that everything has been already done said brimmer somewhat stiffly all sources of sensible inquiry have been exhausted by me but i envy keene the eminently practical advantages his impractical journey gives him he added arresting himself gallantly he goes with you  truly said miss montgomery with the melancholy abstraction of a stage soliloquy beyond obeying the dictates of his brotherly affection he gains no real advantage in learning whether his sister is alive or dead the surety of her death would not make him freer than he is nowfreer to absolutely follow the dictates of a new affection free to make his own life again it is a sister not a wife he seeks  mr brimmers forehead slightly contracted he leaned back a little more rigidly in his chair and fixed a critical half supercilious look upon her she did not seem to notice his almost impertinent scrutiny but sat silent with her eyes bent on the carpet in gloomy abstraction  can you keep a secret she said as if with a sudden resolution  yes said brimmer briefly without changing his look  you know i am a married woman you have heard the story of my wrongs  i have heard them said brimmer dryly  well the husband who abused and deserted me was i have reason to believe a passenger on the excelsior  mcorkleimpossible there was no such name on the passenger list  mcorkle repeated miss montgomery with a dissonant tone in her voice and a slight flash in her eyes what are you thinking of there never was a mr mcorkle it was one of my noms de plume and where did you hear it  i beg your pardon i must have got it from the press notices of your book of poetry i knew that montgomery was only a stage name and as it was necessary that i should have another in making the business investments you were good enough to charge me with i used what i thought was your real name it can be changed or you can sign mcorkle  let it go said miss montgomery resuming her former manner what matters i wish there was no such thing as business well she resumed after a pause my husbands name is hurlstone  but there was no hurlstone on the passenger list either said brimmer i knew them all and their friends  not in the list from the states but if he came on board at callao you wouldnt have known it i knew that he arrived there on the osprey a few days before the excelsior sailed  mr brimmers eyes changed their expression  and you want to find him  no she said with an actresss gesture i want to know the truth i want to know if i am still tied to this man or if i am free to follow the dictates of my own conscienceto make my life anewto becomeyou see i am not ashamed to say itto become the honest wife of some honest man  a divorce would suit your purpose equally said brimmer coldly it can be easily obtained  a divorce do you know what that means to a woman in my profession it is a badge of shamea certificate of disgracean advertisement to every miserable wretch who follows me with his advances that i have no longer the sanctity of girlhood nor the protection of a wife  there was tragic emotion in her voice there were tears in her eyes mr brimmer gazing at her with what he firmly thought to be absolute and incisive penetration did not believe either but like most practical analysts of the halfmotived sex he was only half right the emotion and the tears were as real as anything else in the woman under criticism notwithstanding that they were not as real as they would have been in the man who criticised he however did her full justice on a point where most men and all women misjudged her he believed that through instinct and calculation she had been materially faithful to her husband that this large goddesslike physique had all the impeccability of a goddess that the hysterical dissipation in which she indulged herself was purely mental and usurped and preoccupied all other emotions in this public exposition of her beauty there was no sense of shame for there was no sense of the passion it evoked and he was right but there he should have stopped unfortunately his masculine logic forced him to supply a reason for her coldness in the existence of some more absorbing passion he believed her ambitious and calculating she was neither he believed she might have made him an admirable copartner and practical helpmeet he was wrong  you know my secret now she continued you know why i am anxious to know my fate you understand now why i sympathize withshe stopped and made a half contemptuous gesturewith these men markham and keene they do not know it perhaps they prefer to listen to their own vanitythats the way of most men but you do know it and you have no excuse for misjudging me or undeceiving them she stopped and looked at the clock they will be here in five minutes do you wish them to find you already here  it is as you wish stammered brimmer completely losing his selfpossession  i have no wish she said with a sublime gesture of indifference if you wait you can entertain them here while rosina is dressing me in the next room we sup in the larger room across the hall  as she disappeared quincy brimmer rose irresolutely from his seat and checked a half uttered exclamation then he turned nervously to the parlordoor what a senseless idiot he had become he had never for an instant conceived the idea of making this preliminary confidential visit known to the others he had no wish to suggest the appearance of an assignation with the woman who rightly or wrongly was notorious he had nothing to gain by this voluntary assumption of a compromising attitude yet here he was hemr brimmerwith the appearance of being installed in her parlor receiving her visitors and dispensing her courtesies only a man recklessly in love would be guilty of such an indiscretioneven markhams feebleness had never reached this absurdity in the midst of his uneasiness there was a knock at the door he opened it himself nervously and sharply markhams selfsatisfied face drew back in alarm and embarrassment at the unexpected apparition the sight restored brimmers coolness and satirical selfpossession  iididnt know you were here stammered markham i left keene in your room  then why didnt you bring him along with you said brimmer maliciously go and fetch him  yes but he said you were to meet him there continued markham glancing around the empty room with a slight expression of relief  my watch was twenty minutes fast and i had given him up said brimmer with mendacious effrontery miss montgomery is dressing you can bring him here before she returns  markham flew uneasily down the corridor and quickly returned with a handsome young fellow of fiveandtwenty whose frank face was beaming with excitement and youthful energy the two elder men could not help regarding him with a mingled feeling of envy and compassion  did you tell brimmer yet said keene with animation  i havent had time hesitated markham the fact is brimmer i think of going with keene on this expedition  indeed said brimmer superciliously  yes said markham coloring slightly you see weve got news tell him dick  the storm cloud got in yesterday from valparaiso and central american ports said keene with glowing cheeks i boarded her as usual last night for information the mate says there is a story of a man picked up crazy in an open fishingboat somewhere off the peninsula and brought into hospital at san juan last august he recovered enough lately to tell his story and claim to be captain bunker of the excelsior whose crew mutinied and ran her ashore in a fog but the boat in which he was picked up was a mexican fishingboat and there was something revolutionary and political about the story so that the authorities detained him the consul has just been informed of the circumstances and has taken the matter in hand  its a queer story said brimmer gazing from the one to the other and i will look into it also tomorrow if it is true he added slowly i will go with you  richard keene extended his hand impulsively to his two elders  youll excuse me for saying it brimmerand you too markhambut this is just what ive been looking forward to not but what id have found nell without your assistance but you see boys it did look mighty mean in me to make more fuss about a sister than you would for your wives but now that its all settled  well go to supper said miss montgomery theatrically appearing at the door dick will give me his arm     chapter ii  the mourners at todos santos   there was a breath of spring in the soft morning air of todos santosa breath so subtle and odorous that it penetrated the veil of fog beyond the bay and for a moment lingered on the deck of a passing steamer like an arresting memory but only for an instant the ometepe bound from san francisco to san juan del norte with its four seekers of the excelsior rolled and plunged on its way unconsciously  within the bay and over the restful pueblo still dwelt the golden haze of its perpetual summer the two towers of the old mission church seemed to dissolve softly into the mellow upper twilight and the undulating valleys rolled their green waves up to the wooded heights of san antonio that still smiled down upon the arid pallid desert but although nature had not changed in the months that had passed since the advent of the excelsior there appeared some strange mutations in the town and its inhabitants on the beach below the presidio was the unfinished skeleton of a small seagoing vessel on rude stocks on the plaza rose the framed walls and roofless rafters of a wooden building near the embarcadero was the tall adobe chimney of some inchoate manufactory whose walls had half risen from their foundations but all of these objects had evidently succumbed to the drowsy influence of the climate and already had taken the appearances of later and less picturesque ruins of the past there were singular innovations in the costumes one or two umbrellas used as sunshades were seen upon the square a few small chip hats had taken the place of the stiff sombreros with an occasional tall white beaver while linen coat and nankeen trousers had at times usurped the short velvet jacket and loose calzas of the national costume  at san antonio the change was still more perceptible beside the yawning pit of the abandoned silver mine a straggling building arose filled with rude machinery bearing the legend painted in glowing letters excelsior silver mining co j crosby superintendent and in the midst of certain excavations assailing the integrity of the cliff itself was another small building scarcely larger than a sentrybox with the inscription office eleanor quicksilver smelting works  basking in that yellow morning sunlight with his back against his office mr brace was seated on the ground rolling a cigarette a few feet from him crosby extended on his back on the ground was lazily puffing rings of smoke into the still air both of these young gentlemen were dressed in exaggerated mexican costumes the silver buttons fringing the edge of crosbys calza open from the knee down to show a glimpse of the snowy undertrouser were richer and heavier than those usually worn while brace in addition to the crimson silk sash round his waist wore a crimson handkerchief around his head under his sombrero  pepes falling off in his tobacco said brace i think ill have to try some other fonda  hows banks getting on with his crop asked crosby you know he was going to revolutionize the business and cut out cuba on that hillside  oh the usual luck he couldnt get proper cultivators and the injins wouldnt work regular i must try and get hold of some of the comandantes stock but im out of favor with the old man since winslow and i wrecked that fishingboat on the rocks off yonder he always believed we were trying to run off like captain bunker thats why he stopped our shipbuilding i really believe  all the same we might have had it built and ready now but for our laziness we might have worked on it nights without their knowing it and slipped off some morning in the fog  and we wouldnt have got one of the women to go with us if we are getting shiftless hereand i dont say were notthese women have just planted themselves and have taken root but that aint all theres the influence of that infernal sneak hurlstone hes set the comandante against us you know he and the priest the comandante and nelly keene make up the real council of todos santos between them theyve shoved out the poor little alcalde whos ready to give up everything to dance attendance on mrs brimmer they run the whole concern and they give out that its owing to them that were given parole of the town and the privilege of spending our money and working these mines whod have thought that sneak hurlstone would have played his cards so well it makes me regularly sick to hear him called don diego  yet youre mightily tickled when that blackeyed sister of the alcalde calls you don carlos said crosby yawning  dona isabel said brace with some empressement is a lady of position and these are only her national courtesies  she just worships miss keene and i reckon she knows by this time all about your old attentions to her friend said crosby with lazy mischief  my attentions to miss keene were simply those of an ordinary acquaintance and were never as strongly marked as yours to mrs brimmer  who has deserted me as miss keene did you rejoined crosby  braces quick color had risen again and he would have made some sharp retort but the jingling of spurs caught his ear they both turned quickly and saw banks approaching he was dressed as a vaquero but with his companions like exaggeration of detail yet while his spurs were enormous and his sombrero unusually expansive he still clung to his high shirtcollars and accurately tied check cravat  well he said approaching them  well said crosby  well repeated brace  after this national salutation the three americans regarded each other silently  knocked off cultivating today queried crosby lighting a fresh cigarette  the peons have said banks its another saints day thats the fourth in two weeks leaves about two clear working days in each week counting for the days off when theyre getting over the effects of the others i tell you what sir the catholic religion is not suited to a working civilization or else the calendar ought to be overhauled and a lot of these saints put on the retired list its hard enough to have all the apostles on your payroll so to speak but to have a lot of fellows run in on you as saints and some of them not even men or women but ideas is piling up the agony i dont wonder they call the place all saints the only thing to do continued banks severely is to open communication with the desert and run in some of the heathen tribes outside ive made a proposition to the council offering to take five hundred of them in the raw unregenerate state and turn em over after a year to the church if i could get hurlstone to do some logrolling with that padre his friend i might get the bill through but im always put off till tomorrow everything here is hasta manana hasta manana always i believe when the last trump is sounded theyll say hasta manana what are you doing he said after a pause  waiting for your ship answered crosby sarcastically  well you can laugh gentlemenbut you wont have to wait long according to my calculations that mexican ship is about due now and i aint basing my figures on anything the mexican government is going to do or any commercial speculation im reckoning on the catholic church  the two men languidly looked towards him banks continued gravely  i made the proper inquiries and i find that the stock of rosaries scapularies blessed candles and other ecclesiastical goods is running low i find that just at the nick of time a fresh supply always comes from the bishop of guadalajara with instructions from the church now gentlemen my opinion is that the church and the church only knows the secret of the passage through the foggy channel and keeps it to itself i look at this commercially as a question of demand and supply well sir the only real trader here at todos santos is the church  then you dont take in account the interests of brimmer markham and keene said brace do you suppose theyre doing nothing  i dont say theyre not but youre confounding interests with instincts they havent got the instinct to find this place and all that theyve done and are doing is blind calculation just look at the facts as the filibuster who captured the excelsior of course changed her name her rigout and her flag and even got up a false register for her shes as good as lost as far as the world knows until she lands at quinquinambo then supposing shes found out and the whole story is knownalthough everythings against such a propositionthe news has got to go back to san francisco before the real search will be begun as to any clue that might come from captain bunker thats still more remote allowing he crossed the bar and got out of the channel he wasnt at the right time for meeting a passing steamer and the only coasters are mexican if he didnt die of delirium tremens or exposure and was really picked up in his senses by some other means he would have been back with succor before this if only to get our evidence to prove the loss of the vessel no sir sooner or later of course the san francisco crowd are bound to find us here and if it wasnt for my crops and our mine i wouldnt be in a hurry for them but our first hold is the church  he stopped crosby was asleep brace arose lazily lounged into his office and closed his desk  going to shut for the day said banks yawning  i reckon said brace dubiously i dont know but id take a little pasear into the town if i had my horse ready  take mine and ill trapse over on foot to the ranche with crosbyafter a spell youll find him under that big madrono if he has not already wound himself up with his lariat by walking round it those mexican horses cant go straight even when they grazethey must feed in a circle hes a little fresh so look out for him  all the better id like to get into town just after the siesta  siesta echoed banks lying comfortably down in the shade just vacated by brace thats another of their shiftless practices two hours out of every daythats a day out of the weekspent in a hammock and during business hours too its disgraceful sir simply disgraceful  he turned over and closed his eyes as if to reflect on its enormity  brace had no difficulty in finding the mare although some trouble in mounting her but like his companions having quickly adopted the habits of the country he had become a skillful and experienced horseman and the mustang after a few springless jumps which failed to unseat him submitted to his rider the young man galloped rapidly towards todos santos but when within a few miles of the pueblo he slackened his pace from the smiles and greetings of wayfarersamong whom were some pretty indian girls and mestizasit was evident that the handsome young foreigner who had paid them the compliment of extravagantly adopting their national costume was neither an unfamiliar nor an unpleasing spectacle when he reached the posada at the top of the hilly street he even carried his simulation of the local customs to the point of charging the veranda at full speed and pulling up suddenly at the threshold after the usual fashion of vaqueros the impetuous apparition brought a short stout man to the door who welcoming him with effusive politeness conducted him to an inner room that gave upon a green grass courtyard seated before a rude table sipping aguardiente was his countryman winslow and two traders of the pueblo they were evidently of the number already indicated who had adopted the american fashions senor ruiz wore a linen duster in place of his embroidered jacket and senor martinez had an american beard or goatee in imitation of mr banks the air was yellow with the fumes of tobacco through which the shrewd eyes of winslow gleamed murkily  this he said to his countryman in fluent if not elegant spanish indicating the gentleman who had imitated banks is a man of ideas and a power in todos santos he would control all the votes in his district if there were anything like popular suffrage here and he understands the american policy  senor martinez here hastened to inform mr brace that he had long cherished a secret and enthusiastic admiration for that grand and magnanimous nation of which his friend was such a noble representative that indeed he might say it was an inherited taste for had not his grandfather once talked with the american whaling capitano coffino and partaken of a subtle spirit known as errrum on his ship at acapulco  theres nothing mean about martinez said winslow to brace confidentially in english hes up to anything and ready from the word go dont you think hes a little like banks you knowa sort of mexican edition and there is ruiz hes a cattle dealer hed be a good friend of banks if banks wasnt so infernally selfopinionated but ruiz aint a fool either hes picked up a little englishgood american i meanfrom me already  senor ruiz here smiled affably to show his comprehension and added slowly with great gravity  it is of twentyfour year i have first time the amencano of your beautiful country known he have buy the hides and horns of the cattlefor his shiphere  here echoed brace i thought no american shipno ship at allhad been in here for fifty years  ruiz shrugged his shoulders and cast a glance at his friend martinez lowered his voice and lifted his eyelashes at the same moment and jerking his yellow tobaccostained thumb over his arm said  ahof a verityon the beachtwo leagues away  do you hear that said winslow turning complacently to brace and rising to his feet dont you see now what hogwash the commander alcalde and the priest have been cramming down our throats about this place being sealed up for fifty years what he says is all gospel truth thats what i wanted you fellows to hear and you might have heard before only you were afraid of compromising yourselves by talking with the people you get it into your headsand the comandante helped you to get it therethat todos santos was a sort of sleepy hollow and that no one knew anything of the political changes for the last fifty years well whats the fact ask ruiz there and martinez and theyll both tell you they know that mexico got her independence in 1826 and that the council keep it dark that they may perpetuate themselves they know he continued lowering his voice that the commanders commission from the old viceroy isnt worth the paper it is stamped upon  but what about the church asked brace hesitatingly remembering banks theory  the churchcaramba the priests were ever with the escossas the aristocrats and against the yorkenos the men of the republicthe people interrupted martinez vehemently they will not accept they will not proclaim the republic to the people they shut their eyes so they fold their hands so they say sicut era principio et nunc et semper in secula seculorum look you senor i am not of the churchno caramba i snap my fingers at the priests ah what they give one is food for the bulls horns believe mei have read tompano the american tompano  whos he asked brace  he means tom paine the age of reasonyou know said winslow gazing with a mixture of delight and patronizing pride at the radicals of todos santos oh hes no foolis martinez nor ruiz either and while youve been flirting with dona isabel and banks has been trying to logroll the padre and crosby going in for siestas ive found them out and there are a few morearent there ruiz  ruiz darted a mysterious glance at brace and apparently not trusting himself to speak checked off his ten fingers dramatically in the air thrice  as many of a surety god and liberty  but if this is so why havent they done something  senor martinez glanced at senor ruiz  hasta manana he said slowly  oh this is a case of hasta manana said brace somewhat relieved  they can wait returned winslow hurriedly its too big a thing to rush into without looking round you know what it means either todos santos is in rebellion against the present government of mexico or she is independent of any her present government in any event dont represent either the republic of mexico or the people of todos santosdont you see and in that case weve got as good a right here as any one  he speaks the truth said ruiz grasping a hand of brace and winslow each in this we areas brothers  god and liberty ejaculated martinez in turn seizing the other disengaged hands of the americans and completing the mystic circle  god and liberty echoed a thin chorus from their host and a few loungers who had entered unperceived  brace felt uneasy he was not wanting in the courage or daring of youth but it struck him that his attitude was by no means consistent with his attentions to dona isabel he managed to get winslow aside  this is all very well as a free lunch conspiracy but youre forgetting your parole he said in a low voice  we gave our parole to the present government when it no longer exists there will be no paroledont you see  then these fellows prefer waiting  until we can get outside help you understand the first american ship that comes in hereeh  brace felt relieved after all his position in regard to the alcaldes sister would not be compromised he might even be able to extend some protection over her and it would be a magnanimous revenge if he could even offer it to miss keene  i see you dont swear anybody to secrecy he said with a laugh shall i speak to crosby or will you  not yet hell only see something to laugh at and banks and martinez would quarrel at once and go back on each other no my idea is to let some outsider do for todos santos what perkins did for quinquinambo do you take  his long thin dyspeptic face lit up with a certain small political cunning and shrewdness that struck brace with a halfrespect  i say winslow youd have made a firstclass caucus leader in san francisco  winslow smiled complacently theres something better to play on here than ward politics he replied theres a material here thatlike the mine and the soilaint half developed i reckon i can show banks something that beats lobbying and logrolling for contracts ive let you into this thing to show you a sample of my prospecting keep it to yourself if you want it to pay dats me george goodby ill be out to the office tomorrow  he turned back towards his brother politicians with an expression of satisfied conceit that brace for a moment envied the latter even lingered on the veranda as if he would have asked winslow another question but looking at his watch he suddenly recollected himself and mounting his horse cantered down towards the plaza  the hour of siesta was not yet over and the streets were still desertedprobably the reason why the politicians of todos santos had chosen that hour for their half secret meeting at the corner of the plaza he dismounted and led his horse to the public hitchingpostgnawn and nibbled by the teeth of generations of mustangsand turned into the narrow lane flanked by the walls of the alcaldes garden halfway down he stopped before a slight breach in the upper part of the adobe barrier and looked cautiously around the long shadowed vista of the lane was unobstructed by any moving figure as far as the yellow light of the empty square beyond with a quick leap he gained the top of the wall and disappeared on the other aide     chapter iii  international courtesies   the garden over whose wall brace had mysteriously vanished was apparently as deserted as the lane and plaza without but its solitude was one of graceful shadow and restful loveliness a tropical luxuriance that had perpetuated itself year after year until it was half suffocated in its own overgrowth and strangled with its own beauty spread over a variegated expanse of starry flowers shimmering leaves and slender inextricable branches pierced here and there by towering rigid cactus spikes or the curved plumes of palms the repose of ages lay in its hushed groves its drooping vines its lifeless creepers the dry dust of its decaying leaves and branches mingled with the living perfumes like the spiced embalmings of a forgotten past  nevertheless this tranquillity after a few moments was singularly disturbed there was no breeze stirring and yet the long fronds of a large fan palm that stood near the breach in the wall began to move gently from right to left like the arms of some graceful semaphore and then as suddenly stopped almost at the same moment a white curtain listlessly hanging from a canopied balcony of the alcaldes house began to exhibit a like rhythmical and regular agitation then everything was motionless again an interval of perfect peace settled upon the garden it was broken by the apparition of brace under the balcony and the blackveiled and flowered head of dona isabel from the curtain above  crazy boy  senorita  hush i am coming down  you but dona ursula  there is no more dona ursula  wellyour duenna whoever she is  there is no duenna  what  hush up your tongue idiot boy this in english  the little black head and the rose on top of it disappeared brace drew himself up against the wall and waited the time seemed interminable impatiently looking up and down he at last saw dona isabel at a distance quietly and unconcernedly moving among the roses and occasionally stooping as if to pick them in an instant he was at her side  let me help you he said  she opened her little brownish palm  look in her hand were a few leaves of some herb it is for you  brace seized and kissed the hand  is it some lovetest  it is for what you call a julepcocktail she replied gravely he will remain in a glass with aguardiente you shall drink him with a straw my sister has said that ever where the americans go they expect him to arrive  i prefer to take him straight said brace laughing as he nibbled a limp leaf bruised by the hand of the young girl hes pleasanter and on the whole more wildly intoxicating this way but what about your duenna and how comes this blessed privilege of seeing you alone  dona isabel lifted her black eyes suddenly to brace  you do not comprehend then is it not then the custom of the americans is it not then that there is no duenna in your country  there are certainly no duennas in my country but who has changed the custom here  is it not true that in your country any married woman shall duenna the young senorita continued dona isabel without replying that any caballero and senorita shall see each other in the patio and not under a balconythat they may speak with the lips and not the fan  wellyes said brace  then my brother has arranged it as so he have much hear the dona barbara brimmer when she make talk of these things frequently and he is informed and impressed much he will truly have that you will come of the corridor and not the garden for me and that i shall have no duenna but the dona barbara this does not make you happy you american idiot boy  it did not the thought of carrying on a flirtation under the fastidious boston eye of mrs brimmer instead of under the discreet and mercenarily averted orbs of dona ursula did not commend itself pleasantly to brace  oh yes he returned quickly we will go into the corridor in the fashion of my country  yes said dona isabel dubiously  after we have walked in the garden in the fashion of yours thats only fair isnt it  yes said dona isabel gravely thats what the comandante will call international courtesy  the young man slipped his arm around the young diplomatists waist and they walked on in decorous silence under the orangetrees  it seems to me said brace presently that mrs brimmer has a good deal to say up your way  ah yes but what will you it is my brother who has love for her  but said brace stopping suddenly doesnt he know that she has a husband living  dona isabel lifted her lashes in childlike wonder  always you idiot american boy that is why ah mother of god my brother is discreet he is not a maniac like you to come after a silly muchacha like me  the response which brace saw fit to make to this statement elicited a sharp tap upon the knuckles from dona isabel  tell to me she said suddenly is not that a custom of your country  what that  no insensate to attend a married senora  not openly  ah that is wrong said dona isabel meditatively moving the point of her tiny slipper on the gravel then it is the young girl that shall come in the corridor and the married lady on the balcony  well yes  goodby ape  she ran swiftly down the avenue of palms to a small door at the back of the house turned blew a kiss over the edge of her fan to brace and disappeared he hesitated a moment or two then quickly rescaling the wall dropped into the lane outside followed it to the gateway of the casa and entered the patio as dona isabel decorously advanced from a darkened passage to the corridor although the hour of siesta had passed her sister miss chubb the alcalde and mrs brimmer were still lounging here on sofas and hammocks  it would have been difficult for a stranger at a first glance to discover the nationality of the ladies mrs brimmer and her friend miss chubb had entirely succumbed to the extreme dishabille of the spanish toiletnot without a certain languid grace on the part of mrs brimmer whose easy contour lent itself to the stayless bodice or a certain bashful youthful naivete on the part of miss chubb the rounded dazzling whiteness of whose neck and shoulders half pleased and half frightened her in her low white plain camisaunder the lace mantilla  it is such a pleasure to see you again mr brace said mrs brimmer languidly observing the young man through the sticks of her fan i was telling don ramon that i feared dona ursula had frightened you away i told him that your experience of american society might have caused you to misinterpret the habitual reserve of the castilian she continued with the air of being already an alien of her own country and i should be only too happy to undertake the chaperoning of both these young ladies in their social relations with our friends and how is dear mr banks and mr crosby whom i so seldom see now i suppose however business has its superior attractions  but don ramon with impulsive gallantry would notnay could notfor a moment tolerate a heresy so alarming it was simply wildly impossible for why in the presence of dona barbarait exists not in the heart of man  you cannot of course conceive it don ramon said mrs brimmer with an air of gentle suffering but i fear it is sadly true of the american gentlemen they become too absorbed in their business they forget their duty to our sex in their selfish devotion to affairs in which we are debarred from joining them and yet they wonder that we prefer the society of men who are removed by birth tradition and position from this degrading kind of selfishness  but that was scarcely true of your own husband he was not only a successful man in business but we can see that he was equally successful in his relations to at least one of the fastidious sex said brace maliciously glancing at don ramon  mrs brimmer received the innuendo with invulnerable simplicity  mr brimmer is i am happy to say not a business man he entered into certain contracts having more or less of a political complexion and carrying with them the genius but not the material results of trade that he is not a business manand a successful onemy position here at the present time is a sufficient proof she said triumphantly and i must also protest she added with a faint sigh against mr brimmer being spoken of in the past tense by anybody it is painfully premature and ominous  she drew her mantilla across her shoulders with an expression of shocked sensitiveness which completed the humiliation of brace and the subjugation of don ramon but unlike most of her sex she was wise in the moment of victory she cast a glance over her fan at brace and turned languidly to dona isabel  mr brace must surely want some refreshment after his long ride why dont you seize this opportunity to show him the garden and let him select for himself the herbs he requires for that dreadful american drink miss chubb and your sister will remain with me to receive the comandantes secretary and the doctor when they come  shes more than my match whispered brace to dona isabel as they left the corridor together i give in i dont understand her she frightens me  that is of your conscience it is that you would understand the dona leonoryour dear miss keenebetter ah silence imbecile this dona barbara is even as thou arta talking parrot she will have that the comandantes secretary manuel shall marry mees chubb and that the doctor shall marry my sister but she knows not that manuellisten so that you shall get sick at your heart and swallow your moustachiothat manuel loves the beautiful leonor and that leonor loves not him but don diego and that my sister loathes the little doctor and this dona barbara that makes your liver white would be a feeder of chickens with such barley as this ah come along  the arrival of the doctor and the comandantes secretary created another diversion and the pairing off of the two couples indicated by dona isabel for a stroll in the garden which was now beginning to recover from the still heat of midday this left don ramon and mrs brimmer alone in the corridor mrs brimmers indefinite languor generally accepted as some vague aristocratic condition of mind and body not permitting her to join them  there was a moment of dangerous silence the voices of the young people were growing fainter in the distance mrs brimmers eyes in the shadow of her fan were becoming faintly phosphorescent don ramons melancholy face which had grown graver in the last few moments approached nearer to her own  you are unhappy dona barbara the coming of this young cavalier your countryman revives your anxiety for your home you are thinking of this husband who comes not is it not so  i am thinking said mrs brimmer with a sudden revulsion of solid boston middleclass propriety shown as much in the dry new england asperity of voice that stung even through her drawling of the castilian speech as in anything she saidi am thinking that unless mr brimmer comes soon i and miss chubb shall have to abandon the hospitality of your house don ramon without looking upon myself as a widow or as indefinitely separated from mr brimmer the few words let fall by mr brace show me what might be the feelings of my countrymen on the subject however charming and considerate your hospitality has beenand i do not deny that it has been most grateful to mei feel i cannot continue to accept it in those equivocal circumstances i am speaking to a gentleman who with the instincts and chivalrous obligations of his order must sympathize with my own delicacy in coming to this conclusion and who will not take advantage of my confession that i do it with pain  she spoke with a dry alacrity and precision so unlike her usual languor and the suggestions of the costume and even the fan she still kept shading her faintly glowing eyes that the man before her was more troubled by her manner than her words which he had but imperfectly understood  you will leave herethis house he stammered  it is necessary she returned  but you shall listen to me first he said hurriedly hear me dona barbarai have a secreti will to you confess  you must confess nothing said mrs brimmer dropping her feet from the hammock and sitting up primly i meannothing i may not hear  the alcalde cast a look upon her at once blank and imploring  ah but you will hear he said after a pause there is a ship coming here in two weeks she will arrive none know it but myself the comandante and the padre it is a secret of the government she will come at night she will depart in the morning and no one else shall know it has ever been that she brings no one to todos santos that she takes no one from todos santos that is the law but i swear to you that she shall take you your children and your friend to acapulco in secret where you will be free you will join your husband you will be happy i will remain and i will die  it would have been impossible for any woman but mrs brimmer to have regarded the childlike earnestness and melancholy simplicity of this grownup man without a pang even this superior woman experienced a sensible awkwardness as she slipped from the hammock and regained an upright position  of course she began your offer is exceedingly generous and although i should not perhaps take a step of this kind without the sanction of mr brimmer and am not sure that he would not regard it as rash and premature i will talk it over with miss chubb for whom i am partially responsible nothing she continued with a sudden access of feeling would induce me for any selfish consideration to take any step that would imperil the future of that child towards whom i feel as a sister a slight suffusion glistened under her pretty brown lashes if anything should happen to her i would never forgive myself if i should be the unfortunate means of severing any ties that she may have formed i could never look her in the face again of course i can well understand that our presence here must be onerous to you and that you naturally look forward to any sacrificeeven that of the interests of your country and the defiance of its lawsto relieve you from a position so embarrassing as yours has become i only trust however that the ill effects you allude to as likely to occur to yourself after our departure may be exaggerated by your sensitive nature it would be an obligation added to the many that we owe you which mr brimmer would naturally find he could not returnand that i can safely say he would not hear of for a single moment  while speaking she had unconsciously laid aside her fan lifted her mantilla from her head with both hands and drawing it around her shoulders and under her lifted chin had crossed it over her bosom with a certain prim automatic gesture as if it had been the starched kerchief of some remote puritan ancestress with her arms still unconsciously crossed she stooped rigidly picked up her fan with three fingers as if it had been a prayerbook and with a slight inclination of her bared head with its accurately parted brown hair passed slowly out of the corridor  astounded bewildered yet conscious of some vague wound don ramon remained motionless staring after her straight retreating figure unable to follow closely either the meaning of her words or the logic of her reasoning he nevertheless comprehended the sudden change in her manner her voice and the frigid resurrection of a nature he had neither known nor suspected he looked blankly at the collapsed hammock as if he expected to find in its depths those sinuous graces languid fascinations and the soft half sensuous contour cast off by this vanishing figure of propriety  in the eight months of their enforced intimacy and platonic seclusion he had learned to love this naive insinuating woman whose frank simplicity seemed equal to his own without thought of reserve secrecy or deceit he had gradually been led to think of the absent husband with what he believed to be her own feelingsas of some impalpable fleshless ancestor from whose remote presence she derived power wealth and importance but to whom she owed only respect and certain obligations of honor equal to his own he had never heard her speak of her husband with love with sympathy with fellowship with regret she had barely spoken of him at all and then rather as an attractive factor in her own fascinations than a bar to a free indulgence in them he was as little in her way ashis children with what grace she had adapted herself to hisdon ramonslifeshe who frankly confessed she had no sympathy with her husbands with what languid enthusiasm she had taken up the customs of his country while deploring the habits of her own with what goddesslike indifference she had borne this interval of waiting and yet this womanwho had seemed the embodiment of romancehad received the announcement of his sacrificethe only revelation he allowed himself to make of his hopeless passionwith the frigidity of a duenna had he wounded her in some other unknown way was she mortified that he had not first declared his passionhe who had never dared to speak to her of love before perhaps she even doubted it in his ignorance of the world he had perhaps committed some grave offense he should not have let her go he should have questioned implored herthrown himself at her feet was it too late yet  he passed hurriedly into the formal little drawingroom whose bizarre coloring was still darkened by the closed blinds and dropped awnings that had shut out the heat of day she was not there he passed the open door of her room it was empty at the end of the passage a faint light stole from a door opening into the garden that was still ajar she must have passed out that way he opened it and stepped out into the garden  the sound of voices beside a ruined fountain a hundred yards away indicated the vicinity of the party but a single glance showed him that she was not among them so much the betterhe would find her alone cautiously slipping beside the wall of the house under the shadow of a creeper he gained the long avenue without attracting attention she was not there had she effectively evaded contact with the others by leaving the garden through the little gate in the wall that entered the mission enclosure it was partly open as if some one had just passed through he followed took a few steps and stopped abruptly in the shadow of one of the old peartrees a man and woman were standing an impulse of wild jealousy seized him he was about to leap forward but the next moment the measured voice of the comandante addressing mrs markham fell upon his ear he drew back with a sudden flush upon his face the comandante of todos santos in grave earnest accents was actually offering to mrs markham the same proposal that he don ramon had made to mrs brimmer but a moment ago  no one said the comandante sententiously will know it but myself you will leave the ship at acapulco you will rejoin your husband in good time you will be happy my child you will forget the old man who drags out the few years of loneliness still left to him in todos santos  forgetting himself don ramon leaned breathlessly forward to hear mrs markhams reply would she answer the comandante as dona barbara had answered him her words rose distinctly in the evening air  youre a gentleman don miguel briones and the least respect i can show a man of your kind is not to pretend that i dont understand the sacrifice youre making i shall always remember it as about the biggest compliment i ever received and the biggest risk that any manexcept oneever ran for me but as the man who ran that bigger risk isnt here to speak for himself and generally trusts his wife susan markham to speak for himits all the same as if he thanked you theres my hand don miguel shake it wellif you prefer itkiss it then theredont be a foolbut lets go back to miss keene     chapter iv  a gleam of sunshine   while these various passions had been kindled by her compatriots in the peaceful ashes of todos santos eleanor keene had moved among them indifferently and at times unconsciously the stranding of her young life on that unknown shore had not drawn her towards her fellowexiles and the circumstances which afterwards separated her from daily contact with them completed the social estrangement she found herself more in sympathy with the natives to whom she had shown no familiarity than with her own people who had mixed with them more or less contemptuously she found the naivete of dona isabel more amusing than the doubtful simplicity of that married ingenue mrs brimmer although she still met the young girls advances with a certain reserve she found herself often pained by the practical brusqueness with which mrs markham put aside the comandantes delicate attentions and she was moved with a strange pity for his childlike trustfulness which she knew was hopeless as the months passed on the few occasions that she still met the excelsiors passengers she was surprised to find how they had faded from her memory and to discover in them the existence of qualities that made her wonder how she could have ever been familiar with them she reproached herself with this fickleness she wondered if she would have felt thus if they had completed their voyage to san francisco together and she recalled with a sad smile the enthusiastic plans they had formed during the passage to perpetuate their fellowship by anniversaries and festivals but she at last succumbed and finally accepted their open alienation as preferable to the growing awkwardness of their chance encounters  for a few weeks following the flight of captain bunker and her acceptance of the hospitality and protection of the council she became despondent the courage that had sustained her and the energy she had shown in the first days of their abandonment suddenly gave way for no apparent reason she bitterly regretted the brother whom she scarcely remembered she imagined his suspense and anguish on her account and suffered for both she felt the dumb pain of homesickness for a home she had never known her loneliness became intolerable her condition at last affected mrs markham whose own idleness had been beguiled by writing to her husband an exhaustive account of her captivity which had finally swelled to a volume on todos santos its resources inhabitants and customs good heavens she said you must do something child to occupy your mindif it is only a flirtation with that conceited secretary but this terrible alternative was happily not required the comandante had still retained as part of the old patriarchal government of the mission the presidio school for the primary instruction of the children of the soldiersdependants of the garrison miss keene fascinated by several little pairs of beady black eyes that had looked up trustingly to hers from the playground on the glacis offered to teach english to the comandantes flock the offer was submitted to the spiritual head of todos santos and full permission given by padre esteban to the fair heretic singing was added to the instruction and in a few months the fame of the gracious dona leonors pupils stirred to emulation even the boy choristers of the mission  her relations with james hurlstone during this interval were at first marked by a strange and unreasoning reserve whether she resented the singular coalition forced upon them by the council and felt the awkwardness of their unintentional imposture when they met she did not know but she generally avoided his society this was not difficult as he himself had shown no desire to intrude his confidences upon her and even in her shyness she could not help thinking that if he had treated the situation lightly or humorouslyas she felt sure mr brace or mr crosby would have doneit would have been less awkward and unpleasant but his gloomy reserve seemed to the highspirited girl to color their innocent partnership with the darkness of conspiracy  if your conscience troubles you mr hurlstone in regard to the wretched infatuation of those people she had once said undeceive them if you can and i will assist you and dont let that affair of captain bunker worry you either i have already confessed to the comandante that he escaped through my carelessness  you could not have done otherwise without sacrificing the poor secretary who must have helped you hurlstone returned quietly  miss keene bit her lip and dropped the subject at their next meeting hurlstone himself resumed it  i hope you dont allow that absurd decree of the council to disturb you i imagine theyre quite convinced of their folly i know that the padre is and i know that he thinks youve earned a right to the gratitude of the council in your gracious task at the presidio school that is far beyond any fancied political service  i really havent thought about it at all said miss keene coolly i thought it was you who were annoyed  i not at all returned hurlstone quickly i have been able to assist the padre in arranging the ecclesiastical archives of the church and in suggesting some improvement in codifying the ordinances of the last forty years no i believe im earning my living here and i fancy they think so  then it isnt that that troubles you said miss keene carelessly but glancing at him under the shade of her lashes  no he said coldly turning away  yet unsatisfactory as these brief interviews were they revived in miss keene the sympathizing curiosity and interest she had always felt for this singular man and which had been only held in abeyance at the beginning of their exile in fact she found herself thinking of him more during the interval when they seldom saw each other and apparently had few interests in common than when they were together on the excelsior gradually she slipped into three successive phases of feeling towards him each of them marked with an equal degree of peril to her peace of mind she began with a profound interest in the mystery of his secluded habits his strange abstraction and a recognition of the evident superiority of a nature capable of such deep feelinguninfluenced by those baser distractions which occupied brace crosby and winslow this phase passed into a settled conviction that some woman was at the root of his trouble and responsible for it with an instinctive distrust of her own sex she was satisfied that it must be either a misplaced or unworthy attachment and that the unknown woman was to blame this second phasewhich hovered between compassion and resentmentsuddenly changed to the latterthe third phase of her feelings miss keene became convinced that mr hurlstone had a settled aversion to herself why and wherefore she did not attempt to reason yet she was satisfied that from the first he disliked her his studious reserve on the excelsior compared with the attentions of the others ought then to have convinced her of the fact and there was no doubt now that his present discontent could be traced to the unfortunate circumstances that brought them together having given herself up to that idea she vacillated between a strong impulse to inform him that she knew his real feelings and an equally strong instinct to avoid him hereafter entirely the result was a feeble compromise on the ground that mr hurlstone could scarcely be expected to admire her inferior performances she declined to invite him with father esteban to listen to her pupils father esteban took a huge pinch of snuff examined miss keene attentively and smiled a sad smile the next day he begged hurlstone to take a volume of old music to miss keene with his compliments hurlstone did so and for some reason exerted himself to be agreeable as he made no allusion to her rudeness she presumed he did not know of it and speedily forgot it herself when he suggested a return visit to the boy choir with whom he occasionally practiced she blushed and feared she had scarcely the time but she came with mrs markham some consciousness and a visible color  and then almost without her knowing how or why and entirely unexpected and unheralded came a day so strangely and unconsciously happy so innocently sweet and joyous that it seemed as if all the other days of her exile had only gone before to create it and as if itand it alonewere a sufficient reason for her being there a day full of gentle intimations laughing suggestions childlike surprises and awakenings a day delicious for the very incompleteness of its vague happiness and this remarkable day was simply marked in mrs markhams diary as followswent with e to indian village met padre and j h j h actually left shell and crawled on beach with e e chatty  the day itself had been singularly quiet and gracious even for that rare climate of balmy days and recuperating nights at times the slight breath of the sea which usually stirred the morning air of todos santos was suspended and a hush of expectation seemed to arrest land and water when miss keene and mrs markham left the presidio the tide was low and their way lay along the beach past the mission walls a walk of two or three miles brought them to the indian villageproperly a suburban quarter of todos santosa collection of adobe huts and rudely cultivated fields padre esteban and mr hurlstone were awaiting them in the palmthatched veranda of a more pretentious cabin that served as a schoolroom this is don diegos design said the padre beaming with a certain paternal pride on hurlstone built by himself and helped by the heathen but look you my gentleman is not satisfied with it and wishes now to bring his flock to the mission school and have them mingle with the pureblooded races on an equality that is the revolutionary idea of this sans culotte reformer continued the good father shaking his yellow finger with gentle archness at the young man ah we shall yet have a revolution in todos santos unless you ladies take him in hand he has already brought the halfbreeds over to his side and those heathens follow him like dumb cattle anywhere there take him away and scold him dona leonor while i speak to the senora markham of the work that her good heart and skillful fingers may do for my poor muchachos  eleanor keene lifted her beautiful eyes to hurlstone with an artless tribute in their depths that brought the blood faintly into his cheek she was not thinking of the priests admonishing words she was thinking of the quiet unselfish work that this gloomy misanthrope had been doing while his companions had been engaged in lower aims and listless pleasures and while she herself had been aimlessly fretting and diverting herself what were her few hours of applauded instruction with the pretty murillolike children of the fort compared to his silent and unrecognized labor yet even at this moment an uneasy doubt crossed her mind  i suppose mrs brimmer and miss chubb interest themselves greatly in yourin the padres charities  the first playful smile she had seen on hurlstones face lightened in his eyes and lips and was becoming  i am afraid my barbarians are too low and too near home for mrs brimmers missionary zeal she and miss chubb patronize the mexican school with castoff dresses old bonnets retrimmed flannel petticoats some old novels and books of poetryof which the padre makes an autodafeand their own patronizing presence on fete days providence has given them the vague impression that leprosy and contagious skindisease are a peculiarity of the southern aborigine and they have left me severely alone  i wish you would prevail upon the padre to let me help you said miss keene looking down  but you already have the commanders chickenswhich you are bringing up as swans by the way said hurlstone mischievously you wouldnt surely abandon the nest again  you are laughing at me said miss keene putting on a slight pout to hide the vague pleasure that hurlstones gayer manner was giving her but really ive been thinking that the presidio children are altogether too pretty and picturesque for me and that i enjoy them too much to do them any good its like playing with them you know  hurlstone laughed but suddenly looking down upon her face he was struck with its youthfulness she had always impressed him beforethrough her reserve and independenceas older and more matured in character he did not know how lately she was finding her lost youth as he asked her quite abruptly if she ever had any little brothers and sisters  the answer to this question involved the simple story of miss keenes life which she gave with naive detail she told him of her early childhood and the brother who was only an indistinct memory of her school days and her friendships up to the moment of her first step into the great world that was so strangely arrested at todos santos he was touched with the almost pathetic blankness of this virgin page encouraged by his attention and perhaps feeling a sympathy she had lately been longing for she confessed to him the thousand little things which she had reserved from even mrs markham during her first apathetic weeks at todos santos  im sure i should have been much happier if i had had any one to talk to she added looking up into his face with a naivete of faint reproach its very different for men you know they can always distract themselves with something although she continued hesitatingly ive sometimes thought you would have been happier if you had had somebody to tell your troubles toi dont mean the padre for good as he is he is a foreigner you know and wouldnt look upon things as we dobut some one in sympathy with you  she stopped alarmed at the change of expression in his face a quick flush had crossed his cheek for an instant he had looked suspiciously into her questioning eyes but the next moment the idea of his quietly selecting this simple unsophisticated girl as the confidant of his miserable marriage and the desperation that had brought him there struck him as being irresistibly ludicrous and he smiled it was the first time that the habitual morbid intensity of his thoughts on that one subject had ever been disturbed by reaction it was the first time that a clear ray of reason had pierced the gloom in which he had enwrapped it seeing him smile the young girl smiled too then they smiled together vaguely and sympathetically as over some unspoken confidence but unknown and unsuspected by himself that smile had completed his emancipation and triumph the next moment when he sought with a conscientious sigh to reenter his old mood he was half shocked to find it gone whatever gradual influencethe outcome of these few months of rest and reposemay have already been at work to dissipate his clouded fancy he was only vaguely conscious that the laughing breath of the young girl had blown it away forever  the perilous point passed unconsciously to both of them they fell into freer conversation tacitly avoiding the subject of mr hurlstones past reserve only as being less interesting hurlstone did not return miss keenes confidencesnot because he wished to deceive her but that he preferred to entertain her while she did not care to know his secret now that it no longer affected their sympathy in other things it was a pleasant innocent selfishness that however led them along step by step to more uncertain and difficult ground  in their idle happy walk they had strayed towards the beach and had come upon a large stone cross with its base half hidden in sand and covered with small tenacious sweetscented creepers bearing a pale lilac blossom that exhaled a mingled odor of sea and shore hurlstone pointed out the cross as one of the earliest outposts of the church on the edge of the unclaimed heathen wilderness it was hung with strings of gaudy shells and feathers which hurlstone explained were votive offerings in which their pagan superstitions still mingled with their new faith  i dont like to worry that good old padre he continued with a light smile but im afraid that they prefer this cross to the chapel for certain heathenish reasons of their own i am quite sure that they still hold some obscure rites here under the good fathers very nose and that in the guise of this emblem of our universal faith they worship some deity we have no knowledge of  its a shame said miss keene quickly  to her surprise hurlstone did not appear so shocked as she in her belief of his religious sympathy with the padre had imagined  theyre a harmless race he said carelessly the place is much frequented by the childrenespecially the young girls a good many of these offerings came from them  the better to examine these quaint tributes miss keene had thrown herself with an impulsive girlish abandonment on the mound by the cross and hurlstone sat down beside her their eyes met in an innocent pleasure of each others company she thought him very handsome in the dark half official mexican dress that necessity alone had obliged him to assume and much more distinguishedlooking than his companions in their extravagant foppery he thought her beauty more youthful and artless than he had imagined it to be and with his older and graver experiences felt a certain protecting superiority that was pleasant and reassuring  nevertheless seated so near each other they were very quiet hurlstone could not tell whether it was the sea or the flowers but the dress of the young girl seemed to exhale some subtle perfume of her own freshness that half took away his breath she had scraped up a handful of sand and was allowing it to escape through her slim fingers in a slender rain on the ground he was watching the operation with what he began to fear was fatuous imbecility  miss keenei beg your pardon  mr hurlstoneexcuse me you were saying  they had both spoken at the same moment and smiled forgivingly at each other hurlstone gallantly insisted upon the precedence of her thoughtthe scamp had doubted the coherency of his own  i used to think she beganyou wont be angry will you  decidedly not  i used to think you had an idea of becoming a priest  why  becauseyou are sure you wont be angrybecause i thought you hated women  father esteban is a priest said hurlstone with a faint smile and you know he thinks kindly of your sex  yes but perhaps his life was never spoiled by some wicked woman likelike yours  for an instant he gazed intently into her eyes  who told you that  no one  she was evidently speaking the absolute truth there was no deceit or suppression in her clear gaze if anything only the faintest look of wonder at his astonishment and hethis jealously guarded secret the curse of his whole wretched life had been guessed by this simple girl without comment without reserve without horror and there had been no scene no convulsion of nature no tragedy he had not thrown himself into yonder sea she had not fled from him shrinking but was sitting there opposite to him in gentle smiling expectation the golden light of todos santos around them a bit of bright ribbon shining in her dark hair and he miserable outcast and recluse had not even changed his position but was looking up without tremulousness or excitement and smiling too  he raised himself suddenly on his knee  and what if it were all true he demanded  i should be very sorry for you and glad it were all over now she said softly  a faint pink flush covered her cheek the next moment as if she had suddenly become aware of another meaning in her speech and she turned her head hastily towards the village to her relief she discerned that a number of indian children had approached them from behind and had halted a few paces from the cross their hands were full of flowers and shells as they stood hesitatingly watching the couple  they are some of the schoolchildren said hurlstone in answer to her inquiring look but i cant understand why they come here so openly  oh dont scold them said eleanor forgetting her previous orthodox protest let us go away and pretend we dont notice them  but as she was about to rise to her feet the hesitation of the little creatures ended in a sudden advance of the whole body and before she comprehended what they were doing they had pressed the whole of their floral tributes in her lap the color rose again quickly to her laughing face as she looked at hurlstone  do you usually get up this pretty surprise for visitors she said hesitatingly  i assure you i have nothing to do with it he answered with frank amazement its quite spontaneous and lookthey are even decorating me  it was true they had thrown a half dozen strings of shells on hurlstones unresisting shoulders and unheeding the few words he laughingly addressed them in their own dialect they ran off a few paces and remained standing as if gravely contemplating their work suddenly with a little outcry of terror they turned fled wildly past them and disappeared in the bushes  miss keene and hurlstone rose at the same moment but the young girl taking a step forward suddenly staggered and was obliged to clasp one of the arms of the cross to keep herself from falling hurlstone sprang to her side  are you ill he asked hurriedly you are quite white what is the matter  a smile crossed her colorless face  i am certainly very giddy everything seems to tremble  perhaps it is the flowers he said anxiously their heavy perfume in this close air affects you throw them away for heavens sake  but she clutched them tighter to her heart as she leaned for a moment pale yet smiling against the cross  no no she said earnestly it was not that but the children were frightened and their alarm terrified me there it is over now  she let him help her to her seat again as he glanced hurriedly around him it must have been sympathy with her for he was conscious of a slight vertigo himself the air was very close and still even the pleasant murmur of the waves had ceased  how very low the tide is said eleanor keene resting her elbow on her knees and her round chin upon her hand i wonder if that could have frightened those dear little midgets the tide in fact had left the shore quite bare and muddy for nearly a quarter of a mile to seaward  hurlstone arose with grave eyes but a voice that was unchanged  suppose we inquire lean on my arm and well go up the hill towards the mission garden bring your flowers with you  the color had quite returned to her cheek as she leant on his proffered arm yet perhaps she was really weaker than she knew for he felt the soft pressure of her hand and the gentle abandonment of her figure against his own as they moved on but for some preoccupying thought he might have yielded more completely to the pleasure of that innocent contact and have drawn her closer towards him yet they moved steadily on he contenting himself from time to time with a hurried glance at the downcast fringes of the eyes beside him presently he stopped his attention disturbed by what appeared to be the fluttering of a blackwinged redcrested bird in the bushes before him the next moment he discovered it to be the rosecovered head of dona isabel who was running towards them eleanor withdrew her arm from hurlstones  ah imbecile said dona isabel pouncing upon eleanor keene like an affectionate panther they have said you were on the seashore and i fly for you as a bird tell to me quick she whispered hastily putting her own little brown ear against miss keenes mouth immediatamente are you much happy  where is mr brace said miss keene trying to effect a diversion as she laughed and struggled to get free from her tormentor  he the idiot boy naturally when he is for use he comes not but as a maniacever i would that i have him no more you will to me presently give yourbrother i have since today a presentimiento that him i shall love ah  she pressed her little brown fist still tightly clutching her fan against her low bodice as if already transfixed with a secret and absorbing passion  well you shall have dick then said miss keene laughing but was it for that you were seeking me  mother of god you know not then what has happened you are a blinda deafto but one thing all the time ah she said quickly unfolding her fan and modestly diving her little head behind it i have ashamed for you miss keene  but what has happened said hurlstone interposing to relieve his companion we fancied something  something he says somethingah that something was a temblor an earthquake the earth has shaken himself look  she pointed with her fan to the shore where the sea had suddenly returned in a turbulence of foam and billows that was breaking over the base of the cross they had just quitted  miss keene drew a quick sigh dona isabel had ducked again modestly behind her fan but this time dragging with her other arm miss keenes head down to share its discreet shadow as she whispered  andinfatuated oneyou two never noticed it     chapter v  clouds and change   the earthquake shock although the first experienced by the americans had been a yearly phenomenon to the people of todos santos and was so slight as to leave little impression upon either the low adobe walls of the pueblo or the indolent population if its a provision of nature for shaking up these rip van winkle latin races now and then its a dead failure as far as todos santos is concerned crosby had said with a yawn brace whos got geology on the brain ever since he struck cinnabar ore says he isnt sure the injins aint right when they believe that the pacific ocean used to roll straight up to the presidio and there wasnt any channeland that reef of rocks was upheaved in their time but whats the use of it it never really waked them up perhaps theyre waiting for another kind of earthquake winslow had responded sententiously  in six weeks it had been forgotten except by three peoplemiss keene james hurlstone and padre esteban since hurlstone had parted with miss keene on that memorable afternoon he had apparently lapsed into his former reserve without seeming to avoid her timid advances he met her seldom and then only in the presence of the padre or mrs markham although uneasy at the deprivation of his society his present shyness did not affect her as it had done at first she knew it was no longer indifference she even fancied she understood it from what had been her own feelings if he no longer raised his eyes to hers as frankly as he had that day she felt a more delicate pleasure in the consciousness of his lowered eyelids when they met and the instinct that told her when his melancholy glance followed her unobserved the sex of these loversif we may call them so who had never exchanged a word of loveseemed to be changed it was miss keene who now sought him with a respectful and frank admiration it was hurlstone who now tried to avoid it with a feminine dread of reciprocal display once she had even adverted to the episode of the cross they were standing under the arch of the refectory door waiting for padre esteban and looking towards the sea  do you think we were ever in any real danger down there on the shorethat day she said timidly  no not from the sea he replied looking at her with a half defiant resolution  from what then she asked with a naivete that was yet a little conscious  do you remember the children giving you their offerings that day he asked abruptly  i do she replied with smiling eyes  well it appears that it is the custom for the betrothed couples to come to the cross to exchange their vows they mistook us for lovers  all the instinctive delicacy of miss keenes womanhood resented the rude infelicity of this speech and the flippant manner of its utterance she did not blush but lifted her clear eyes calmly to his  it was an unfortunate mistake she said coldly the more so as they were your pupils ah here is father esteban she added with a marked tone of relief as she crossed over to the priests side  when father esteban returned to the refectory that evening hurlstone was absent when it grew later becoming uneasy the good father sought him in the garden at the end of the avenue of peartrees there was a break in the seawall and here with his face to the sea hurlstone was leaning gloomily father estebans tread was noiseless and he had laid his soft hand on the young mans shoulder before hurlstone was aware of his presence he started slightly his gloomy eyes fell before the priests  my son said the old man gravely this must go on no longer  i dont understand you hurlstone replied coldly  do not try to deceive yourself nor me above all do not try to deceive her either you are or are not in love with this countrywoman of yours if you are not my respect for her and my friendship for you prompts me to save you both from a foolish intimacy that may ripen into a misplaced affection if you are already in love with her  i have never spoken a word of love to her interrupted hurlstone quickly i have even tried to avoid her since  since you found that you loved her ah foolish boy and you think that because the lips speak not the passions of the heart are stilled do you think your silence in her presence is not a protestation that she even she child as she is can read with the cunning of her sex  wellif i am in love with her what then said hurlstone doggedly it is no crime to love a pure and simple girl am i not free you yourself in yonder church told me  silence diego said the priest sternly silence before you utter the thought that shall disgrace you to speak and me to hear  forgive me father esteban said the young man hurriedly grasping both hands of the priest forgive mei am maddistractedbut i swear to you i only meant  hush interrupted the priest more gently so that will do he stopped drew out his snuffbox rapped the lid and took a pinch of snuff slowly we will not recur to that point then you have told her the story of your life  no but i will she shall know alleverythingbefore i utter a word of love to her  ah bueno muy bueno said the padre wiping his nose ostentatiously ah let me see then when we have shown her that we cannot possibly marry her we will begin to make love to her eh eh that is the american fashion ah pardon he continued in response to a gesture of protestation from hurlstone i am wrong it is when we have told her that we cannot marry her as a protestant that we will make love as a catholic is that it  hear me said hurlstone passionately you have saved me from madness and perhaps death your careyour kindnessyour teachings have given me life again dont blame me father esteban if in casting off my old self you have given me hopes of a new and fresher lifeof  a newer and fresher love you would say said the padre with a sad smile be it so you will at least do justice to the old priest when you remember that he never pressed you to take vows that would have prevented this forever  i know it said hurlstone taking the old mans hand and you will remember too that i was happy and contented before this came upon me tell me what i shall do be my guidemy friend father esteban put me where i was a few months agobefore i learned to love her  do you mean it diego said the old man grasping his hand tightly and fixing his eyes upon him  i do  then listen to me for it is my turn to speak when eight months ago you sought the shelter of that blessed roof it was for refuge from a woman that had cursed your life it was given you you would leave it now to commit an act that would bring another woman as mad as yourself clamoring at its doors for protection from you for what you are proposing to this innocent girl is what you accepted from the older and wickeder woman you have been cursed because a woman divided for you what was before god an indivisible right and you diego would now redivide that with another whom you dare to say you love you would use the opportunity of her helplessness and loneliness here to convince her you would tempt her with sympathy for she is unhappy with companionship for she has no longer the world to choose fromwith everything that should make her sacred from your pursuit  enough said hurlstone hoarsely say no more only i implore you tell me what to do now to save her i willif you tell me to do itleave her forever  why should you go said the priest quietly her absence will be sufficient  her absence echoed hurlstone  hers alone the conditions that brought you here are unchanged you are still in need of an asylum from the world and the wife you have repudiated why should you abandon it for the girl there is no cause why she should remainbeyond yourself she has a brother whom she loveswho wants herwho has the right to claim her at any time she will go to him  but how  that has been my secret and will be my sacrifice to you diego my son i have foreseen all this i have expected it from the day that girl sent you her womans message that was half a challenge from her schooli have known it from the day you walked together on the seashore i was blind before thatfor i am weak in my way too and i had dreamed of other things god has willed it otherwise he paused and returning the pressure of hurlstones hand went on my secret and my sacrifice for you is this for the last two hundred years the church has had a secret and trusty messenger from the see at guadalajarain a ship that touches here for a few hours only every three years her arrival and departure is known only to myself and my brothers of the council by this wisdom and the provision of god the integrity of the holy church and the conversion of the heathen have been maintained without interruption and interference you know now my son why your comrades were placed under surveillance why it was necessary that the people should believe in a political conspiracy among yourselves rather than the facts as they existed which might have bred a dangerous curiosity among them i have given you our secret diegothat is but a part of my sacrifice when that ship arrives and she is expected daily i will secretly place miss keene and her friend on board with explanatory letters to the archbishop and she will be assisted to rejoin her brother it will be against the wishes of the council but my will continued the old man with a gesture of imperiousness is the will of the church and the law that overrides all  he had stopped with a strange fire in his eyes it still continued to burn as he went on rapidly  you will understand the sacrifice i am making in telling you this when you know that i could have done all that i propose without your leave or hindrance yes diego i had but to stretch out my hand thus and that foolish firebrand of a heretic muchacha would have vanished from todos santos forever i could have left you in your fools paradise and one morning you would have found her gone i should have condoled with you and consoled you and you would have forgotten her as you did the other i should not have hesitated it is the right of the church through all time to break through those carnal ties without heed of the suffering flesh and i ought to have done so this and this alone would have been worthy of las casas and junipero serra but i am weak and oldi am no longer fit for his work far better that the ship which takes her away should bring back my successor and one more worthy todos santos than i  he stopped his eyes dimmed he buried his face in his hands  you have done right father esteban said hurlstone gently putting his arm round the priests shoulders and i swear to you your secret is as safe as if you had never revealed it to me perhaps he added with a sigh i should have been happier if i had not known itif she had passed out of my life as mysteriously as she had entered it but you will try to accept my sacrifice as some return for yours i shall see her no more  but will you swear it said the priest eagerly will you swear that you will not even seek her to say farewell for in that moment the wretched girl may shake your resolution  i shall not see her repeated the young man slowly  but if she asks an interview persisted the priest on the pretense of having your advice  she will not returned hurlstone with a half bitter recollection of their last parting you do not know her pride  perhaps said the priest musingly but i have your word diego and now let us return to the mission for there is much to prepare and you shall assist me  meantime hurlstone was only half right in his estimate of miss keenes feelings although the result was the same the first shock to her delicacy in his abrupt speech had been succeeded by a renewal of her uneasiness concerning his past life or history while she would in her unselfish attachment for him have undoubtingly accepted any explanation he might have chosen to give her his continued reserve and avoidance of her left full scope to her imaginings rejecting any hypothesis of his history except that of some unfortunate love episode she began to think that perhaps he still loved this nameless woman had anything occurred to renew his affection it was impossible in their isolated condition that he would hear from her but perhaps the priest might have been a confidant of his past and had recalled the old affection in rivalry of her or had she herself been unfortunate through any idle word to reopen the wound had there been any suggestionshe checked herself suddenly at a thought that benumbed and chilled herperhaps that happy hour at the cross might have reminded him of some episode with another that was the real significance of his rude speech with this first taste of the poison of jealousy upon her virgin lips she seized the cup and drank it eagerly ah wellhe should keep his blissful recollections of the past undisturbed by her perhaps he might even seethough she had no pastthat her present life might be as disturbing to him she recalled with a foolish pleasure his solitary faint sneer at the devotion of the commanders secretary why shouldnt she hereafter encourage that devotion as well as that sneer from this complacently beloved mr hurlstone why should he be so assured of her past the fair and gentle reader who may be shocked at this revelation of eleanor keenes character will remember that she has not been recorded as an angel in these pagesbut as a very human honest inexperienced girl for the first time struggling with the most diplomatic machiavellian and hypocritical of all the passions  in pursuance of this new resolution she determined to accept an invitation from mrs markham to accompany her and the commander to a reception at the alcaldes housethe happy secretary being of the party mrs markham who was under promise to the comandante not to reveal his plan for the escape of herself and miss keene until the arrival of the expected transport had paid little attention to the late vagaries of her friend and had contented herself by once saying with a marked emphasis that the more free they kept themselves from any entanglements with other people the more prepared they would be for a change  perhaps its just as well not to be too free even with those jesuits over at the mission your brother you know might not like it  those jesuits repeated miss keene indignantly father esteban to begin with is a franciscan and mr hurlstone is as orthodox as you or i  dont be too sure of that my dear returned mrs markham sententiously heaven only knows what disguises they assume why hurlstone and the priest are already as thick as two peas and you cant make me believe they didnt know of each other before we came here he was the first one ashore you remember before the mutiny and where did he turn upat the mission of course and have you forgotten that sleepwalking affairall jesuitical why poor dear markham used to say we were surrounded by ramifications of that societyeverywhere the very waiter at your hotel table might belong to the order  the hour of the siesta was just past and the corridor and gardens of the alcaldes house were grouped with friends and acquaintances as the party from the presidio entered mrs brimmer who had apparently effected a temporary compromise with her late instincts of propriety was still doing the honors of the alcaldes house and had once more assumed the mexican dishabille even to the slight exposure of her small feet stockingless in white satin slippers the presence of the comandante and his secretary guaranteed the two ladies of their party a reception at least faultless in form and respect whatever may have been the secret feelings of the hostess and her friends the alcalde received mrs markham and miss keene with unruffled courtesy and conducted them to the place of honor beside him  as eleanor keene slightly flushed and beautiful in her unwonted nervous excitement took her seat a flutter went around the corridor and with the single exception of dona isabel an almost imperceptible drawing together of the other ladies in offensive alliance miss keene had never abandoned her own style of dress and that afternoon her delicate and closelyfitting white muslin gathered in at the waist with a broad blue belt of ribbon seemed to accentuate somewhat unflatteringly the tropical neglige of mrs brimmer and miss chubb brace who was in attendance with crosby on the two ramirez girls could not help being uneasily conscious of this in addition to the awkwardness of meeting miss keene after the transfer of his affections elsewhere nor was his embarrassment relieved by crosbys confidences to him in a half audible whisper  i say old man after all the regular straightout american style lays over all their foreign flops and fandoodles i wonder what old brimmer would say to his wifes fulldress nightgowneh  but at this moment the longdrawn slightly stridulous utterances of mrs brimmer rose through the other greetings like a lazy east wind  i shall never forgive the commander for making the presidio so attractive to you dear miss keene that you cannot really find time to see your own countrymen though of course youre not to blame for not coming to see two frights as we must looknot having been educated to be able to do up our dresses in that faultless styleand perhaps not having the entire control over an establishment like you yet i suppose that even if the alcalde did give us carte blanche of the laundry here we couldnt do it unaided even by mrs markham yes dear you must let me compliment you on your skill and the way you make things last as for me and miss chubb weve only found our things fit to be given away to the poor of the mission but i suppose even that charity would look as shabby to you as our clothes in comparison with the really good missionary work you and mr hurlstoneor is it mr bracei always confound your admirers my dearare doing now at least so says that good father esteban  but with the exception of the alcalde and miss chubb mrs brimmers words fell on unheeding ears and miss keene did not prejudice the triumph of her own superior attractions by seeming to notice mrs brimmers innuendo she answered briefly and entered into lively conversation with crosby and the secretary holding the hand of dona isabel in her own as if to assure her that she was guiltless of any design against her former admirer this was quite unnecessary as the gentle isabel after bidding brace with a rap on the knuckles to go and play contented herself with curling up like a kitten beside miss keene and left that gentleman to wander somewhat aimlessly in the patio  nevertheless miss keene whose eyes and ears were nervously alert and who had indulged a faint hope of meeting padre esteban and hearing news of hurlstone glanced from time to time towards the entrance of the patio a singular presentiment that some outcome of this present visit would determine her relations with hurlstone had already possessed her consequently she was conscious before it had attracted the attention of the others of some vague stirring in the plaza beyond suddenly the clatter of hoofs was heard before the gateway there was a moments pause of dismounting a gruff order given in spanish and the next moment three strangers entered the patio  they were dressed in red shirts their white trousers tucked in high boots and wore slouched hats they were so travelstained dusty and unshaven that their features were barely distinguishable one who appeared to be the spokesman of the party cast a perfunctory glance around the corridor and in fluent spanish began with the mechanical air of a man repeating some formula  we are the bearers of a despatch to the comandante of todos santos from the governor of mazatlan the officer and the escort who came with us are outside the gate we have been told that the comandante is in this house the case is urgent or we would not intrude  he was stopped by the voice of mrs markham from the corridor well i dont understand spanish muchi may be a fool or crazy or perhaps bothbut if that isnt james markhams voice ill bet a cooky  the three strangers turned quickly toward the corridor the next moment the youngest of their party advanced eagerly towards miss keene who had arisen with a half frightened joy and with the cry of why its nell ran towards her the third man came slowly forward as mrs brimmer slipped hastily from the hammock and stood erect  in the name of goodness barbara said mr brimmer closing upon her in a slow portentous whisper where are your stockings     chapter vi  a more important arrival   the commander was the first to recover his presence of mind taking the despatch from the hands of the unlookedfor husband of the woman he loved he opened it with an immovable face and habitual precision then turning with a military salute to the strangers he bade them join him in half an hour at the presidio and bowing gravely to the assembled company stepped from the corridor but mrs markham was before him stopped him with a gesture and turned to her husband  james markhamwheres your hand  markham embarrassed but subjugated disengaged it timidly from his wifes waist  give it to that gentlemanfor a gentleman he is from the crown of his head to the soles of his boots there shake his hand you dont get such a chance every day you can thank him again later  as the two mens hands parted after this perfunctory grasp and the commander passed on she turned again to her husband  now james i am ready to hear all about it perhaps youll tell me where you have been  there was a moment of embarrassing silence the doctor and secretary had discreetly withdrawn the alcalde after a brief introduction to mr brimmer and an incomprehensible glance from the wife had retired with a colorless face dona isabel had lingered last to blow a kiss across her fan to eleanor keene that half mischievously included her brother the americans were alone  thus appealed to mr markham hastily began his story but as he progressed a slight incoherency was noticeable he occasionally contradicted himself and was obliged to be sustained supplemented and at times corrected by keene and brimmer substantially it appeared that they had come from san francisco to mazatlan and through the influence of mr brimmer on the mexican authorities their party with an escort of dragoons had been transported across the gulf and landed on the opposite shore where they had made a forced march across the desert to todos santos literally interpreted however by the nervous markham it would seem that they had conceived this expedition long ago and yet had difficulties because they only thought of it the day before the steamer sailed that they had embarked for the isthmus of nicaragua and yet had stopped at mazatlan that their information was complete in san francisco and only picked up at mazatlan that friendssometimes contradictorily known as he and shehad overpowering influence with the mexican government and alone had helped them and yet that they were utterly dependent upon the efforts of senor perkins who had compromised matters with the mexican government and everybody  do you mean to say james markham that youve seen perkins and it was he who told you we were here  nonot him exactly  let me explain said mr brimmer hastily it appears he corrected his haste with practical businesslike precision that the filibuster perkins after debarking you here and taking the excelsior to quinquinambo actually established the quinquinambo government and got mexico and the other confederacies to recognize its independence quinquinambo behaved very handsomely and not only allowed the mexican government indemnity for breaking the neutrality of todos santos by the seizure but even compromised with our own government their claim to confiscate the excelsior for treaty violation and paid half the value of the vessel besides giving information to mexico and washington of your whereabouts we consequently represent a joint commission from both countries to settle the matter and arrange for your return  but what i want to know is this is it to senor perkins that we ought to be thankful for seeing you here at all asked mrs markham impatiently  no nonot that exactly stammered markham oh come now susannah  no said richard keene earnestly by jove some thanks ought to go to belle montgomeryhe checked himself in sudden consternation  there was a chilly silence even miss keene looked anxiously at her brother as the voice of mrs brimmer for the first time broke the silence  may we be permitted to know who is this person to whom we owe so great an obligation  certainly said brimmer she wasas i have already intimateda friend possibly you know he added turning lightly to his companions as if to corroborate an impression that had just struck him perhaps aaa sweetheart of the senor perkins  and how was she so interested in us pray said mrs markham  well you see she had an idea that a former husband was on board of the excelsior  he stopped suddenly remembering from the astonished faces of keene and markham that the secret was not known to them while they impressed with the belief that the story was a sudden invention of brimmers with difficulty preserved their composure but the women were quick to notice their confusion and promptly disbelieved brimmers explanation  well as theres no mister montgomery here shes probably mistaken said mrs markham with decision though it strikes me that shes very likely had the same delusion on board of some other ship come along james perhaps after youve had a bath and some clean clothes you may come out a little more like the man i once knew i dont know how mrs brimmer feels but i feel more as if i required to be introduced to youthan your friends friend mrs montgomery at any rate try and look and behave a little more decent when you go over to the presidio  with these words she dragged him away mr brimmer after a futile attempt to appear at his ease promptly effected the usual marital diversion of carrying the war into the enemys camp  for heavens sake barbara he said with ostentatious indignation go and dress yourself properly had you neither money nor credit to purchase clothes i declare i didnt know you at first and when i did i was shocked before mrs markham too  mrs markham i fear has quite enough to occupy her now said mrs brimmer shortly as she turned away with hysterically moist eyes leaving her husband to follow her  oblivious of this comedy richard keene and eleanor had already wandered back hand in hand to their days of childhood but even in the joy that filled the young girls heart in the presence of her only kinsman there was a strange reservation the meeting that she had looked forward to with eager longing had brought all she expected more than that it seemed to have been providentially anticipated at the moment of her greatest need and yet it was incomplete she was ashamed that after the first recognition a wild desire to run to hurlstone and tell him her happiness was her only thought she was shocked that the bright joyous face of this handsome lovable boy could not shut out the melancholy austere features of hurlstone which seemed to rise reproachfully between them when for the third and fourth time they had recounted their past history exchanged their confidences and feelings dick passing his arm around his sisters waist looked down smilingly in her eyes  and so after all little nell everybody has been good to you and you have been happy  everybody has been kind to me dick far kinder than i deserved even if i had really been the great lady that little dona isabel thought i was or the important person the commander believed me to be i couldnt have been treated more kindly i have met with nothing but respect and attention i have been very happy dick very happy  and with a little cry she threw herself on her brothers neck and burst into a childlike flood of inconsistent tears  meantime the news of the arrival of the reliefparty had penetrated even the peaceful cloisters of the mission and father esteban had been summoned in haste to the council he returned with an eager face to hurlstone who had been anxiously awaiting him when the padre had imparted the full particulars of the event to his companion he added gravely  you see my son how providence which has protected you since you first claimed the churchs sanctuary has again interfered to spare me the sacrifice of using the power of the church in purely mundane passions i weekly accept the rebuke of his betterordained ways and you diego may comfort yourself that this girl is restored directly to her brothers care without any deviousness of plan or human responsibility you do not speak my son continued the priest anxiously can it be possible that in the face of this gracious approval of providence to your resolution you are regretting it  the young man replied with a half reproachful gesture  do you then think me still so weak no father esteban i have steeled myself against my selfishness for her sake i could have resigned her to the escape you had planned believing her happier for it and ignorant of the real condition of the man she had learnt totopity but he added turning suddenly and almost rudely upon the priest do you know the meaning of this irruption of the outer world to me do you reflect that these men probably know my miserable storythat as one of the passengers of the excelsior they will be obliged to seek me and to restore me he added with a bitter laugh to my home my kindredto the world i loathe  but you need not follow them remain here  herewith the door thrown open to any talebearer or perhaps to my wife herself never hear me father he went on hurriedly these men have come from san franciscohave been to mazatlan can you believe that it is possible that they have never heard of this womans search for me no the quest of hate is as strong as the quest of love and more merciless to the hunted  but if that were so foolish boy she would have accompanied them  you are wrong it would have been enough for her to have sent my exposure by themto have driven me from this refuge  this is but futile fancy diego said father esteban with a simulated assurance he was far from feeling nothing has yet been saidnothing may be said wait my child  wait he echoed bitterly ay wait until the poor girl shall hearperhaps from her brothers lipsthe story of my marriage as bandied about by others wait for her to know that the man who would have made her love him was anothers and unworthy of her respect no it is i who must leave this place and at once  you echoed the padre how  by the same means you would have used for her departure i must take her place in that ship you are expecting you will give me letters to your friends perhaps when this is over i may returnif i still live  padre esteban became thoughtful  you will not refuse me said the young man taking the padres hand it is for the best believe me i will remain secret here until then you will invent some excuseillness or what you liketo keep them from penetrating here above all to spare me from the misery of ever reading my secret in her face  father esteban remained still absorbed in thought  you will take a letter from me to the archbishop and put yourself under his care he asked at last after a long pause you will promise me that  i do  then we shall see what can be done they talk those americanos continued the priest of making their way up the coast to punta st jago where the ship they have already sent for to take them away can approach the shore and the comandante has orders to furnish them escort and transport to that point it is a foolish indiscretion of the government and i warrant without the sanction of the church already there is curiosity discontent and wild talk among the people ah thou sayest truly my son said the old man gloomily the doors of todos santos are open the comandante will speed these heretics quickly on their way but the doors by which they came and whence they go will never close again but gods will be done and if the open doors bring thee back my son i shall not question his will  it would seem however as if hurlstones fears had been groundless for in the excitement of the succeeding days and the mingling of the party from san antonio with the newcomers the recluse had been forgotten so habitual had been his isolation from the others that except for the words of praise and gratitude hesitatingly dropped by miss keene to her brother his name was not mentioned and it might have been possible for the relieving party to have left him behindunnoticed mr brimmer for domestic reasons was quite willing to allow the episode of miss montgomerys connection with their expedition to drop for the present her name was only recalled once by miss keene when dick had professed a sudden and violent admiration for the coquettish dona isabel eleanor had looked up in her brothers face with a half troubled air  who was this queer montgomery woman dick she said  dick laugheda frank reassuring heartfree laugh  perfectly stunning nell such a figure in tights you ought to have seen her dancemy  hush i dare say she was horrid  not at all she wasnt such a bad fellow if you left out her poetry and gush which i didnt go in for muchthough the other fellowshe stopped from a sudden sense of loyalty to brimmer and markham no you see nell she was regularly ridiculously struck after that man perkinswhom shed never seena kind of schoolgirl worship for a pirate you know how you women go in for those fellows with a mystery about em  no i dont said miss keene sharply with a slight rise of color and i dont see what thats got to do with you and her  everything she was in correspondence with perkins and knows about the excelsior affair and wants to help him get out of it with clean hands dont you see thats why she made up to us there nell she aint your style of course but you owe a heap to her for giving us points as to where you were but thats all over now she left us at mazatlan and went on to nicaragua to meet perkins somewhere therefor the fellow has always got some central american revolution on hand it appears until they garrote or shoot him some day hell go on in the liberating business forever  then there wasnt any mr montgomery of course said eleanor  oh mr montgomery said dick hesitating well you see nell i think that knowing how correct and all that sort of thing brimmer is she sort of invented the husband to make her interest look more proper  its shameful said miss keene indignantly  come nell one would think you had a personal dislike to her let her go she wont trouble younor i reckon anybody much longer  what do you mean dick  i mean she has regularly exhausted and burnt herself out with her hysterics and excitements and the drugs shes taken to subdue themto say nothing of the panama fever she got last spring if she dont go regularly crazy at last shell have another attack of fever hanging round the isthmus waiting for perkins  meanwhile undisturbed by excitement or intrusion of the outer world the days had passed quietly at the mission but one evening at twilight a swiftfooted lightlyclad indian glided into the sacristy as if he had slipped from the outlying fog and almost immediately as quietly glided away again and disappeared the next moment father estebans gaunt and agitated face appeared at hurlstones door  my son god has been merciful and cut short your probation the signal of the ship has just been made her boat will be waiting on the beach two leagues from here an hour hence are you ready and are you still resolved  i am said hurlstone rising i have been prepared since you first assented  the old mans lips quivered slightly and the great brown hand laid upon the table trembled for an instant with a strong effort he recovered himself and said hurriedly  conchos mule is saddled and ready for you at the foot of the garden you will follow the beach a league beyond the indians cross in the boat will await you the trusty messenger of the church you will say to him guadalajara and give him these letters one is to the captain you will require no other introduction he laid the papers on the table and turning to hurlstone lifted his tremulous hands in the air and now my son may the grace of god  he faltered and stopped his uplifted arms falling helplessly on hurlstones shoulders for an instant the young man supported him in his arms then placed him gently in the chair he had just quitted and for the first time in their intimacy dropped upon his knee before him the old man with a faint smile placed his hand upon his companions head a breathless pause followed father estebans lips moved silently suddenly the young man rose pressed his lips hurriedly to the fathers hand and passed out into the night  the moon was already suffusing the dropping veil of fog above him with that nebulous mysterious radiance he had noticed the first night he had approached the mission when he reached the cross he dismounted and gathering a few of the sweetscented blossoms that crept around its base placed them in his breast then remounting he continued his way until he came to the spot designated by concho as a fitting place to leave his tethered mule this done he proceeded on foot about a mile further along the hard wet sand his eyes fixed on the narrow strip of water and shore before him that was yet uninvaded by the fog on either side  the misty nebulous light the strange silence broken only by the occasional low hurried whisper of some spent wave that sent its film of spume across his path or filled his footprints behind him possessed him with vague presentiments and imaginings at times he fancied he heard voices at his side at times indistinct figures loomed through the mist before him at last what seemed to be his own shadow faintly impinged upon the mist at one side impressed him so strongly that he stopped the apparition stopped too continuing a few hundred paces further he stopped again but this time the ghostly figure passed on and convinced him that it was no shadow but some one actually following him with an angry challenge he advanced towards it it quickly retreated inland and was lost irritated and suspicious he turned back towards the water and was amazed to see before him not twenty yards away the object of his questa boat with two men in it kept in position by the occasional lazy dip of an oar in the pursuit of his mysterious shadow he had evidently overlooked it as his own figure emerged from the fog the boat pulled towards him the priests password was upon his lips when he perceived that the two men were common foreign sailors the messenger of the church was evidently not there could it have been he who had haunted him he paused irresolutely is there none other coming he asked the two men looked at each other one said quien sabe and shrugged his shoulders hurlstone without further hesitation leaped aboard  the same dull wall of vaporat times thickening to an almost impenetrable barrier and again half suffocating him in its soft embracewhich he had breasted on the night he swam ashore carried back his thoughts to that time now so remote and unreal and when after a few moments silent rowing the boat approached a black hulk that seemed to have started forward out of the gloom to meet them his vague recollection began to take a more definite form as he climbed up the companionladder and boarded the vessel an inexplicable memory came over him a petty officer on the gangway advanced silently and ushered him half dazed and bewildered into the cabin he glanced hurriedly around the door of a stateroom opened and disclosed the indomitable and affable senor perkins a slight expression of surprise however crossed the features of the liberator of quinquinambo as he advanced with outstretched hand  this is really a surprise my dear fellow i had no idea that you were in this affair but i am delighted to welcome you once more to the excelsior     chapter vii  the return of the excelsior   amazed and disconcerted hurlstone nevertheless retained his presence of mind  there must be some mistake he said coolly i am certainly not the person you seem to be expecting  were you not sent here by winslow demanded perkins  no the person you are looking for is probably one i saw on the shore he no doubt became alarmed at my approach and has allowed me quite unwittingly to take his place in the boat  perkins examined hurlstone keenly for a moment stepped to the door gave a brief order and returned  then if you did not intend the honor of this visit for me he resumed with a smile may i ask my dear fellow whom you expected to meet and on what ship there are not so many at todos santos if my memory serves me right as to create confusion  i must decline to answer that question said hurlstone curtly  the senor smiled with an accession of his old gentleness  my dear young friend he said have you forgotten that on a far more important occasion to you i showed no desire to pry into your secret hurlstone made a movement of deprecation nor have i any such desire now but for the sake of our coming to an understanding as friends let me answer the question for you you are here my dear fellow as a messenger from the mission of todos santos to the ecclesiastical commission from guadalajara whose ship touches here every three years it is now due you have mistaken this vessel for theirs  hurlstone remained silent  it is no secret continued senor perkins blandly nor shall i pretend to conceal my purpose here which is on the invitation of certain distressed patriots of todos santos to assist them in their deliverance from the effete tyranny of the church and its government i have been fortunate enough to anticipate the arrival of your vessel as you were fortunate enough to anticipate the arrival of my messenger i am doubly fortunate as it gives me the pleasure of your company this evening and necessitates no further trouble than the return of the boat for the other gentlemanwhich has already gone doubtless you may know him  i must warn you again senor perkins said hurlstone sternly that i have no connection with any political party nor have i any sympathy with your purpose against the constituted authorities  i am willing to believe that you have no political affinities at all my dear mr hurlstone returned perkins with unruffled composure and consequently we will not argue as to what is the constituted authority of todos santos perhaps tomorrow it may be on board this ship and i may still have the pleasure of making you at home here  until then said hurlstone dryly at least you will allow me to repair my error by returning to the shore  for the moment i hardly think it would be wise replied perkins gently allowing that you escaped the vigilance of my friends on the shore whose suspicions you have aroused and who might do you some injury you would feel it your duty to inform those who sent you of the presence of my ship and thus precipitate a collision between my friends and yours which would be promotive of illfeeling and perhaps bloodshed you know my peaceful disposition mr hurlstone you can hardly expect me to countenance an act of folly that would be in violation of it  in other words having decoyed me here on board your ship you intend to detain me said hurlstone insultingly  decoy said perkins in gentle deprecation decoy is hardly the word i expected from a gentleman who has been so unfortunate as to take unsolicited and of his own free will another persons place in a boat but he continued assuming an easy argumentative attitude let us look at it from your viewpoint let us imagine that your ship had anticipated mine and that my messenger had unwittingly gone on board of her what do you think they would have done to him  they would have hung him at the yardarm as he deserved said hurlstone unflinchingly  you are wrong said perkins gently they would have given him the alternative of betraying his trust and confessing everythingwhich he would probably have accepted pardon methis is no insinuation against you he interruptedbut i regret to say that my experience with the effete latin races of this continent has not inspired me with confidence in their loyalty to trust let me give you an instance he continued smiling the ship you are expecting is supposed to be an inviolable secret of the church but it is known to meto my friends ashoreand even to you my poor friend a heretic more than that i am told that the comandante the padre and alcalde are actually arranging to deport some of the american women by this vessel which has been hitherto sacred to the emissaries of the church alone but you probably know thisit is doubtless part of your errand i only mention it to convince you that i have certainly no need either to know your secrets to hang you from the yardarm if you refused to give them up or to hold you as hostage for my messenger who as i have shown you can take care of himself i shall not ask you for that secret despatch you undoubtedly carry next your heart because i dont want it you are at liberty to keep it until you can deliver it or drop it out of that porthole into the seaas you choose but i hear the boat returning continued perkins rising gently from his seat as the sound of oars came faintly alongside and no doubt with winslows messenger i am sorry you wont let me bring you together i dare say he knows all about you and it really need not alter your opinions  one moment said hurlstone stunned yet incredulous of perkinss revelations you said that both the comandante and alcalde had arranged to send away certain ladiesare you not mistaken  i think not said perkins quietly looking over a pile of papers on the table before him yes here it is he continued reading from a memorandum don ramon ramirez arranged with pepe for the secret carrying off of dona barbara brimmer why that was six weeks ago and here we have the comandante suborning one marcia a dragoon to abduct mrs markhamby jove my old friendand dona leonorour beauty was she not yes here it is in black and white read it if you likeand pardon me for one moment while i receive this unlucky messenger  left to himself hurlstone barely glanced at the memorandum which seemed to be the rough minutes of some society he believed perkins but was it possible that the padre could be ignorant of the designs of his fellowcouncilors and if he were notif he had long before been in complicity with them for the removal of eleanor might he not also have duped him hurlstone and sent him on this mission as a mere blind andmore infamouslyperhaps even thus decoyed him on board the wrong ship noit was impossible his honest blood quickly flew to his cheek at that momentary disloyal suspicion  nevertheless the senors bland revelations filled him with vague uneasiness she was safe with her brother now but what if he and the other americans were engaged in this ridiculous conspiracy this pothouse rebellion that father esteban had spoken of and which he had always treated with such contempt it seemed strange that perkins had said nothing of the arrival of the relieving party from the gulf and its probable effect on the malcontents did he know it or was the news now being brought by this messenger whom he hurlstone had supplanted if so when and how had perkins received the intelligence that brought him to todos santos the young man could scarcely repress a bitter smile as he remembered the accepted idea of todos santos inviolabilitythat inaccessible port that had within six weeks secretly summoned perkins to its assistance and it was there he believed himself secure what security had he at all might not this strange unimpassioned omniscient man already know his secret as he had known the others  the interview of perkins with the messenger in the next cabin was a long one and apparently a stormy one on the part of the newcomer hurlstone could hear his excited foreign voice shrill with the small vehemence of a shallow character but there was no change in the slow measured tones of the senor he listlessly began to turn over the papers on the table presently he paused he had taken up a sheet of paper on which senor perkins had evidently been essaying some composition in verse it seemed to have been of a lugubrious character the titular line at the top of the page dirge had been crossed out for the substituted in memoriam he read carelessly       o muse unmetbut not unwept        i seek thy sacred haunt in vain      too late alas the tryst is kept        we may not meet again       i sought thee midst the orange bloom        to find that thou hadst grasped the palm      of martyr and the silent tomb        had hid thee in its calm       by fever racked thou languishest        on nicaraguas  hurlstone threw the paper aside although he had not forgotten the senors reputation for sentimental extravagance and on another occasion might have laughed at it there was something so monstrous in this hysterical morbid composition of the man who was even then contemplating bloodshed and crime that he was disgusted like most sentimental egotists hurlstone was exceedingly intolerant of that quality in others and he turned for relief to his own thoughts of eleanor keene and his own unfortunate passion he could not have written poetry at such a moment  but the cabindoor opened and senor perkins appeared whatever might have been the excited condition of his unknown visitor the senors round cleanshaven face was smiling and undisturbed by emotion as his eye fell on the page of manuscript hurlstone had just cast down a slight shadow crossed his beneficent expanse of forehead and deepened in his soft dark eyes but the next moment it was chased away by his quick recurring smile even thus transient and superficial was his feeling thought hurlstone  i have some news for you said perkins affably which may alter your decision about returning my friends ashore he continued judging from the ingenuous specimen which has just visited me are more remarkable for their temporary zeal and spasmodic devotion than for prudent reserve or lasting discretion they have submitted a list to me of those whom they consider dangerous to mexican liberty and whom they are desirous of hanging i regret to say that the list is illogical and the request inopportune our friend mr banks is put down as an ally of the government and an objectionable business rival of that eminent patriot and wellknown drover senor martinez who just called upon me mr crosbys humor is considered subversive of a proper respect for all patriotism but i cannot understand why they have added your name as especially dangerous  hurlstone made a gesture of contempt  i suppose they pay me the respect of considering me a friend of the old priest so be it i hope they will let the responsibility fall on me alone  the padre is already proscribed as one of the council said senor perkins quietly  do you mean to say said hurlstone impetuously that you will permit a hair of that innocent old mans head to be harmed by those wretches  you are generous but hasty my friend said senor perkins in gentle deprecation allow me to put your question in another way ask me if i intend to perpetuate the catholic church in todos santos by adding another martyr to its roll and i will tell youno i need not say that i am equally opposed to any proceedings against banks crosby and yourself for diplomatic reasons apart from the kindly memories of our old associations on this ship i have therefore been obliged to return to the excellent martinez his little list with the remark that i should hold him personally responsible if any of you are molested there is however no danger messrs banks and crosby are with the other americans whom we have guaranteed to protect at the mission in the care of your friend the padre you are surprised equally so was the padre had you delayed your departure an hour you would have met them and i should have been debarred the pleasure of your company  by tomorrow continued perkins placing the tips of his fingers together reflectively the government of todos santos will have changed hands and without bloodshed you look incredulous my dear young friend it has been a part of my professional pride to show the world that these revolutions can be accomplished as peacefully as our own changes of administration but for a few infelicitous accidents this would have been the case of the late liberation of quinquinambo the only risk run is to myselfthe leader and that is as it should be but all this personal explanation is doubtless uninteresting to you my young friend i meant only to say that if you prefer not to remain here you can accompany me when i leave the ship at nine oclock with a small reconnoitring party and i will give you safe escort back to your friends at the mission  this amicable proposition produced a sudden revulsion of feeling in hurlstone to return to those people from whom he was fleeing in what was scarcely yet a serious emergency was not to be thought of yet where could he go how could he be near enough to assist her without again openly casting his lot among them and would they not consider his return an act of cowardice he could not restrain a gesture of irritation as he rose impatiently to his feet  you are agitated my dear fellow it is not unworthy of your youth but believe me it is unnecessary said perkins in his most soothing manner sit down you have an hour yet to make your decision if you prefer to remain you will accompany the ship to todos santos and join me  i dont comprehend you interrupted hurlstone suspiciously  i forgot said perkins with a bland smile that you are unaware of our plan of campaign after communicating with the insurgents i land here with a small force to assist them i do this to anticipate any action and prevent the interference of the mexican coaster now due which always touches here through ignorance of the channel leading to the bay of todos santos and the presidio i then send the excelsior that does know the channel to todos santos to appear before the presidio take the enemy in flank and cooperate with us the arrival of the excelsior there is the last move of this little game if i may so call it it is checkmate to the king the clerical government of todos santos  a little impressed in spite of himself with the calm forethought and masterful security of the senor hurlstone thanked him with a greater show of respect than he had hitherto evinced the senor looked gratified but unfortunately placed that respect the next moment in peril  you were possibly glancing over these verses he said with a hesitating and almost awkward diffidence indicating the manuscript hurlstone had just thrown aside it is merely the first rough draft of a little tribute i had begun to a charming friend i sometimes he interpolated with an apologetic smile trifle with the muse perhaps i ought not to use the word trifle in connection with a composition of a threnodial and dirgelike character he continued deprecatingly certainly not in the presence of a gentleman as accomplished and educated as yourself to whom recreation of this kind is undoubtedly familiar my occupations have been unfortunately of a nature not favorable to the indulgence of verse as a college man yourself my dear sir you will probably forgive the lucubrations of an old graduate of william and marys who has forgotten his ars poetica the verses you have possibly glanced at are crude i am aware and perhaps show the difficulty of expressing at once the dictates of the heart and the brain they refer to a dear friend now at peace you have perhaps in happier and more careless hours heard me speak of mrs euphemia mcorkle of illinois  hurlstone remembered indistinctly to have heard even in his reserved exclusiveness on the excelsior the current badinage of the passengers concerning senor perkins extravagant adulation of this unknown poetess as a part of the staple monotonous humor of the voyage it had only disgusted him with a feeling that he was unconsciously sharing the burlesque relief of the passengers he said with a polite attempt at interest  then the lady isno more  if that term can be applied to one whose work is immortal corrected senor perkins gently all that was finite of this gifted woman was lately forwarded by adamss express company from san juan to receive sepulture among her kindred at keokuk iowa  did she say she was from that place asked hurlstone with half automatic interest  the consul says she gave that request to the priest  then you were not with her when she died said hurlstone absently  i was never with her neither then nor before returned senor perkins gravely seeing hurlstones momentary surprise he went on the late mrs mcorkle and i never metwe were personally unknown to each other you may have observed the epithet unmet in the first line of the first stanza you will then understand that the privation of actual contact with this magnetic soul would naturally impart more difficulty into elegiac expression  then you never really saw the lady you admire said hurlstone vacantly  never the story is a romantic one said perkins with a smile that was half complacent and yet half embarrassed may i tell it to you thanks some three years ago i contributed some verses to the columns of a western paper edited by a friend of mine the subject chosen was my favorite one the liberation of mankind in which i may possibly have expressed myself with some poetic fervor on a theme so dear to my heart i may remark without vanity that it received high encomiumsperhaps at some more opportune moment you may be induced to cast your eyes over a copy i still retainbut no praise touched me as deeply as a tribute in verse in another journal from a gifted unknown who signed herself euphemia the subject of the poem which was dedicated to myself was on the liberation of womenfromeri may say certain domestic shackles treated perhaps vaguely but with grace and vigor i replied a week later in a larger poem recording more fully my theories and aspirations regarding a struggling central american confederacy addressed to euphemia she rejoined with equal elaboration and detail referring to a more definite form of tyranny in the relations of marriage and alluding with some feeling to uncongenial experiences of her own an instinct of natural delicacy veiled under the hyperbole of want of space prevented my editorial friend from encouraging the repetition of this charming interchange of thought and feeling but i procured the fair strangers address we began a correspondence at once imaginative and sympathetic in expression if not always poetical in form i was called to south america by the macedonian cry of quinquinambo i still corresponded with her when i returned to quinquinambo i received letters from her dated from san francisco i feel that my words could only fail my dear hurlstone to convey to you the strength and support i derived from those impassioned breathings of aid and sympathy at that time enough for me to confess that it was mainly due to the deep womanly interest that she took in the fortunes of the passengers of the excelsior that i gave the mexican authorities early notice of their whereabouts but pardon mehe stopped hesitatingly with a slight flush as he noticed the utterly inattentive face and attitude of hurlstonei am boring you i am forgetting that this is only important to myself he added with a sigh i only intended to ask your advice in regard to the disposition of certain manuscripts and effects of hers which are unconnected with our acquaintance i thought perhaps i might entrust them to your delicacy and consideration they are here if you choose to look them over and here is also what i believe to be a daguerreotype of the lady herself but in which i fail to recognize her soul and genius  he laid a bundle of letters and a morocco case on the table with a carelessness that was intended to hide a slight shade of disappointment in his faceand rose  i beg your pardon said hurlstone in confused and remorseful apology but i frankly confess that my thoughts were preoccupied pray forgive me if you will leave these papers with me i promise to devote myself to them another time  as you please said the senor with a slight return of his old affability but dont bore yourself now let us go on deck  he passed out of the cabin as hurlstone glanced half mechanically at the package before him suddenly his cheek reddened he stopped looked hurriedly at the retreating form of perkins and picked up a manuscript from the packet it was in his wifes handwriting a sudden idea flashed across his mind and seemed to illuminate the obscure monotony of the story he had just heard he turned hurriedly to the morocco case and opened it with trembling fingers it was a daguerreotype faded and silvered but the features were those of his wife     chapter viii  hostage   the revolution of todos santos had to all appearances been effected as peacefully as the gentle liberator of quinquinambo could have wished two pronunciamientos rudely printed and posted in the plaza and saluted by the fickle garrison of one hundred men who had however immediately reappointed their old commander as generalissimo under the new regime seemed to leave nothing to be desired a surging mob of vacant and wondering peons bearing a singular resemblance to the wild cattle and horses which intermingled with them in blind and unceasing movement across the plaza and up the hilly street and seemingly as incapable of selfgovernment were alternately dispersed and stampeded or allowed to gather again as occasion required some of these heterogeneous bands were afterwards foundthe revolution accomplishedgazing stupidly on the sea or ruminating in bovine wantonness on the glacis before the presidio  eleanor keene who with her countrywomen had been hurried to the refuge of the mission was more disturbed and excited at the prospect of meeting hurlstone again than by any terror of the insurrection but hurlstone was not there and father esteban received her with a coldness she could not attribute entirely to her countrymens supposed sympathy with the insurgents when richard keene who would not leave his sister until he had seen her safe under the mission walls ventured at her suggestion to ask after the american recluse father esteban replied dryly that being a christian gentleman hurlstone was the only one who had the boldness to seek out the american filibuster perkins on his own ship and remonstrate with him for his unholy crusade for the old priest had already become aware of hurlstones blunder and he hated eleanor as the primary cause of the trouble but for her diego would be still with him in this emergency  never mind nell said dick noticing the disappointed eyes of his sister as they parted youll all be safe here until we return between you and me banks brimmer and i think that brace and winslow have gone too far in this matter and were going to stop it unless the whole thing is over now as they say  dont believe that said crosby its like their infernal earthquakes theres always a second shock and a tidal wave to follow i pity brace winslow and perkins if they get caught in it  there seemed to be some reason for his skepticism for later the calm of the mission garden was broken upon by the monotonous tread of banded men on the shellstrewn walks and the door of the refectory opened to the figure of senor perkins a green silk sash across his breast a goldlaced belt supporting a light dresssword and a pair of pistols buckled around the jaunty waist of his ordinary black frockcoat were his scant martial suggestions but his hat albeit exchanged for a soft felt one still reposed on the back of his benevolent head and seemed to accent more than ever the contrast between his peaceful shoulders and the military smartness of his lower figure he bowed with easy politeness to the assembled fugitives but before he could address them father esteban had risen to his feet  i thought that this house at least was free from the desecrating footsteps of lawlessness and impiety said the priest sternly how dare you enter here  nothing but the desire to lend my assistance to the claims of beauty innocence helplessness andif you will allow me to add with a low bow to the priestsanctity caused this intrusion for i regret to say that through the illadvised counsels of some of my fellowpatriots the indian tribes attached to this mission are in revolt and threaten even this sacred building  it is false said father esteban indignantly even under the accursed manipulation of your emissaries the miserable heathen would not dare to raise a parricidal hand against the church that fostered him  senor perkins smiled gently but sadly  your belief reverend sir does you infinite credit but to save time let me give way to a gentleman who i believe possesses your confidence he will confirm my statement  he drew aside and allowed hurlstone who had been standing unperceived behind to step forward the padre uttered an exclamation of pleasure miss keene colored quickly hurlstone cast a long and lingering glance at her which seemed to the embarrassed girl full of a new strange meaning and then advanced quickly with outstretched hands towards father esteban  he speaks truly he said hurriedly and in the interests of humanity alone the indians have been tampered with treacherously against his knowledge and consent he only seeks now to prevent the consequences of this folly by placing you and these ladies out of reach of harm aboard of the excelsior  a very proper and excellent idea broke in mrs brimmer with genteel precision you see these people evidently recognize the fact of mr brimmers previous ownership of the excelsior and the respect that is due to him i for one shall accept the offer and insist upon miss chubb accompanying me  i shall be charmed to extend the hospitality of the excelsior to you on any pretext said the senor gallantly and indeed should insist upon personally accompanying you and my dear friends mrs markham and miss keene but alas i am required elsewhere i leave he continued turning towards hurlstone who was already absorbed in a whispered consultation with padre estebani leave a sufficient escort with you to protect your party to the boats which have brought us here you will take them to the excelsior and join me with the ship off todos santos in the morning adieu my friends goodnight and farewell  the priest made a vehement movement of protestation but he was checked by hurlstone as with a low bow senor perkins passed out into the darkness the next moment his voice was heard raised in command and the measured tramp of his men gradually receded and was lost in the distance  does he think said the priest indignantly that i padre esteban would desert my sacred trust and leave his holy temple a prey to sacrilegious trespass never while i live diego call him back and tell him so  rather listen to me father esteban said the young man earnestly i have a plan by which this may be avoided from my knowledge of these indians i am convinced that they have been basely tricked and cajoled by some one i believe that they are still amenable to reason and argument and i am so certain that i am ready to go down among them and make the attempt the old chief and part of his band are still encamped on the shore we could hear them as we passed in the boats i will go and meet them if i succeed in bringing them to reason i will return if i find them intractable i will at least divert their attention from the mission long enough for you to embark these ladies with their escort which you will do at the end of two hours if i do not return  in two hours broke in mrs brimmer in sharp protest i positively object i certainly understood that senor perkins invitation which under the circumstances i shall consider equal to a command from mr brimmer was to be accepted at once and without delay and i certainly shall not leave miss chubb exposed to imminent danger for two hours to meet the caprice of an entire stranger to mr brimmer  i am willing to stay with father esteban if he will let me said eleanor keene quietly for i have faith in mr hurlstones influence and courage and believe he will be successful  the young man thanked her with another demonstrative look that brought the warm blood to her cheek  well said mrs markham promptly i suppose if nell stays i must see the thing through and stay with hereven if i havent orders from jimmy  there is no necessity that either mr or mrs brimmer should be disobeyed in their wishes said hurlstone grimly luckily there are two boats mrs brimmer and miss chubb can take one of them with half the escort and proceed at once to the excelsior i will ride with them as far as the boat and now he continued turning to the old priest with sparkling eyes i have only to ask your blessing and the good wishes of these ladies to go forth on my mission of peace if i am successful he added with a light laugh confess that a layman and a heretic may do some service for the church as the old man laid his half detaining half benedictory hands upon his shoulders the young man seized the opportunity to whisper in his ear remember your promise to tell her all i have told you and with an other glance at miss keene he marshalled mrs brimmer and miss chubb before him and hurried them to the boat  miss keene looked after him with a vague felicity in the change that seemed to have come on him a change that she could as little account for as her own happiness was it the excitement of danger that had overcome his reserve and set free his compressed will and energy she longed for her brother to see him thusalert strong and chivalrous in her girlish faith she had no fear for his safety he would conquer he would succeed he would come back to them victorious looking up from her happy abstraction at the side of mrs markham who had calmly gone to sleep in an armchair she saw father estebans eyes fixed upon her with a warning gesture of the hand towards mrs markham he rose and going to the door of the sacristy beckoned to her the young girl noiselessly crossed the room and followed him into the sanctuary  half an hour later and while mrs markham was still asleep father esteban appeared at the door of the sacristy ostentatiously taking snuff and using a large red handkerchief to wipe his more than usually humid eyes eleanor keene with her chin resting on her hand remained sitting as he had left her with her abstracted eyes fixed vacantly on the lamp before the statue of the virgin and the halflit gloom of the nave  padre esteban had told her all she now knew hurlstones history even as he had hesitatingly imparted it to the old priest in this very churchperhaps upon the very seat where she sat she knew the peace that he had sought for and found within these walls broken only by his passion for her she knew his struggles against the hopelessness of this newborn love even the desperate remedy that had been adopted against herself and the later voluntary exile of her lover she knew the providential culmination of his trouble in the news brought unconsciously by perkins which but a few hours ago he had verified by the letters records and even the certificate of death that had thus strangely been placed in his hands she knew all this so clearly now that with the instinct of a sympathetic nature she even fancied she had heard it before she knew that all the obstacles to an exchange of their affection had been removed that her lover only waited his opportunity to hear from her own lips the answer that was even now struggling at her heart and yet she hesitated and drew back half frightened in the presence of her great happiness how she longed and yet dreaded to meet him what if anything should have happened to himwhat if he should be the victim of some treacherywhat if he did not comewhat ifgood heavens what was that  she was near the door of the sacristy gazing into the dim and shadowy church either she was going mad or else the grotesque indian hangings of the walls were certainly moving towards her she rose in speechless terror as what she had taken for an uncouthly swathed and draped barbaric pillar suddenly glided to the window crouching against the wall she crept breathlessly towards the entrance to the garden casting a hurried glance above her she saw the open belfry that was illuminated by the misty radiance of the moon darkly shadowed by hideously gibbering faces that peered at her through the broken tracery with a cry of horror she threw open the gardendoor but the next moment was swallowed up in the tumultuous tide of wild and half naked indians who surged against the walls of the church and felt herself lifted from her feet with inarticulate cries and borne along the garden even in her mortal terror she could recognize that the cries were not those of rage but of vacant satisfaction that although she was lifted on lithe shoulders the grasp of her limbs was gentle and the few dark faces she could see around her were glistening in childlike curiosity presently she felt herself placed upon the back of a mule that seemed to be swayed hither and thither in the shifting mass and the next moment the misty tossing cortege moved forward with a new and more definite purpose she called aloud for father esteban and mrs markham her voice appeared to flow back upon her from the luminous wall of fog that closed around her then the inarticulate irregular outcries took upon themselves a measured rhythm the movement of the mass formed itself upon the monotonous chant the intervals grew shorter the mule broke into a trot and then the whole vast multitude fell into a weird rhythmical jogging quick step at her side  whatever was the intent of this invasion of the mission and her own strange abduction she was relieved by noticing that they were going in the same direction as that taken by hurlstone an hour before either he was cognizant of their movements and being powerless to prevent their attack on the church had stipulated they were to bring her to him in safety or else he was calculating to intercept them on the way the fog prevented her from forming any estimation of the numbers that surrounded her or if the padre and mrs markham were possibly preceding her as captives in the vanguard she felt the breath of the sea and knew they were traveling along the shore the monotonous chant and jogging motion gradually dulled her active terror to an apathetic resignation in which occasionally her senses seemed to swoon and swim in the dreamy radiance through which they passed at times it seemed a dream or nightmare with which she was hopelessly struggling at times she was taking part in an unhallowed pageant or some heathen sacrificial procession of which she was the destined victim  she had no consciousness of how long the hideous journey lasted her benumbed senses were suddenly awakened by a shock the chant had ceased the moving mass in which she was imbedded rolled forward once more as if by its own elasticity and then receded again with a jar that almost unseated her then the inarticulate murmur was overborne by a voice it was his she turned blindly towards it but before she could utter the cry that rose to her lips she was again lifted from the saddle carried forward and gently placed upon what seemed to be a mossgrown bank opening her half swimming eyes she recognized the indian cross the crowd seemed to recede before her her eyes closed again as a strong arm passed around her waist  speak to me miss keeneeleanormy darling said hurlstones voice o my god they have killed her  with an effort she moved her head and tried to smile their eyes and then their lips met she fainted  when she struggled to her senses again she was lying in the sternsheets of the excelsiors boat supported on mrs markhams shoulder for an instant the floating veil of fog around her and the rhythmical movement of the boat seemed a part of her mysterious ride and she raised her head with a faint cry for hurlstone  its all right my dear said mrs markham soothingly hes ashore with the padre and everything else is all right too but its rather ridiculous to think that those idiotic indians believed the only way they could show mr hurlstone that they meant us no harm was to drag us all up to their mission as they call that half heathen cross of theirsfor safety againstwho do you think dearthe dreadful americans and imagine all the while the padre and i were just behind you bringing up the rear of the processiononly they wouldnt let us join you because they wanted to show you special honor asshe sank her voice to a whisper in eleanors earas the future mrs hurlstone it appears they must have noticed something about you two the last time you were there my dear andto thinkyou never told me anything about it  when they reached the excelsior they found that mrs brimmer having already settled herself in the best cabin was inclined to extend the hospitalities of the ship with the air of a hostess but the arrival of hurlstone at midnight with some delegated authority from senor perkins and the unexpected getting under way of the ship disturbed her complacency  we are going through the channel into the bay of todos santos was the brief reply vouchsafed her by hurlstone  but why cant we remain here and wait for mr brimmer she asked indignantly  because responded hurlstone grimly the excelsior is expected off the presidio tomorrow morning to aid the insurgents  you dont mean to say that miss chubb and myself are to be put in the attitude of arraying ourselves against the constituted authoritiesand perhaps mr brimmer himself asked mrs brimmer in genuine alarm  it looks so said hurlstone a little maliciously but no doubt your husband and the senor will arrange it amicably  to mrs markham and miss keene he explained more satisfactorily that the unexpected disaffection of the indians had obliged perkins to so far change his plans as to disembark his entire force from the excelsior and leave her with only the complement of men necessary to navigate her through the channel of todos santos where she would peacefully await his orders or receive his men in case of defeat  nevertheless as the night was nearly spent mrs markham and eleanor preferred to await the coming day on deck and watch the progress of the excelsior through the mysterious channel in a few moments the barque began to feel the combined influence of the tide and the slight morning breeze and after rounding an invisible point she presently rose and fell on the larger ocean swell the pilot whom hurlstone recognized as the former third mate of the excelsior appeared to understand the passage perfectly and even hurlstone and the ladies who had through eight months experience become accustomed to the luminous obscurity of todos santos could detect the faint looming of the headland at the entrance the same soothing silence even the same lulling of the unseen surf which broke in gentle undulations over the bar and seemed to lift the barque in rocking buoyancy over the slight obstruction came back to them as on the day of their fateful advent the low orders of the pilot the cry of the leadsman in the chains were but a part of the restful past  under the combined influence of the hour and the climate the conversation fell into monosyllables and mrs markham dozed the lovers sat silently together but the memory of a kiss was between them it spanned the gulf of the past with an airy bridge over which their secret thoughts and fancies passed and repassed with a delicious security henceforth they could not flee from that memory even if they wished they read it in each others lightest glance they felt it in the passing touch of each others hands it lingered with vague tenderness on the most trivial interchange of thought yet they spoke a little of the future eleanor believed that her brother would not object to their union he had spoken of entering into business at todos santos and perhaps when peace and security were restored they might live together hurlstone did not tell her that a brief examination of his wifes papers had shown him that the property he had set aside for her maintenance and from which she had regularly drawn an income had increased in value and left him a rich man he only pressed her hand and whispered that her wishes should be his they had become tenderly silent again as the excelsior now fairly in the bay appeared to be slowly drifting with listless sails and idle helm in languid search of an anchorage suddenly they were startled by a cry from the lookout  sail ho  there was an incredulous start on the deck the mate sprang into the forerigging with an oath of protestation but at the same moment the tall masts and spars of a vessel suddenly rose like a phantom out of the fog at their side the half disciplined foreign crew uttered a cry of rage and trepidation and huddled like sheep in the waist with distracted gestures even the two men at the wheel forsook their post to run in dazed terror to the taffrail before the mate could restore order to this chaos the excelsior had drifted with a scarcely perceptible concussion against the counter of the strange vessel in an instant a dozen figures appeared on its bulwarks and dropped unimpeded upon the excelsiors deck as the foremost one approached the mate the latter shrank back in consternation  captain bunker  yes said the figure advancing with a mocking laugh captain bunker it is captain bunker formerly of this american barque excelsior and now of the mexican ship la trinidad captain bunker ez larnt every foot of that passage in an open boat last august and didnt forget it yesterday in a big ship captain bunker ez has just landed a company of dragoons to relieve the presidio what dye say to that mr mcarthyeh  i say answered mcarthy raising his voice with a desperate effort to recover his calmness i say that perkins landed with double that number of men yesterday around that point and that hell be aboard here in half an hour to make you answer for this insult to his ship and his government  his government echoed bunker with a hoarser laugh hear himhis government his government died at four oclock this morning when his own ringleaders gave him up to the authorities ha why this yer revolution is played out old man and generalissimo leonidas perkins is locked up in the presidio     chapter ix  liberated   the revolution was indeed ended the unexpected arrival of a relieving garrison in the bay of todos santos had completed what the dissensions in the insurgents councils had begun the discontents led by brace and winslow had united with the government against perkins and his aliens but a compromise had been effected by the treacherous giving up of the liberator himself in return for an amnesty granted to his followers the part that bunker had played in bringing about this moral catastrophe was however purely adventitious when he had recovered his health and subsequent events had corroborated the truth of his story the mexican government who had compromised with quinquinambo was obliged to recognize his claims by offering him command of the missionary ship and permission to rediscover the channel the secret of which had been lost for half a century to the government he had arrived at the crucial moment when perkins command were scattered along the seashore and the dragoons had invested todos santos without opposition  such was the story substantially told to hurlstone and confirmed on his debarkation with the ladies at todos santos the excelsior being now in the hands of the authorities hurlstone did not hesitate to express to padre esteban his disgust at the treachery which had made a scapegoat of senor perkins but to his surprise the cautious priest only shrugged his shoulders as he took a complacent pinch of snuff  have a care diego you are of necessity grateful to this man for the news he has broughtnay more for possibly being the instrument elected by providence to precipitate the denouement of that miserable womans lifebut let it not close your eyes to his infamous political career i admit that he was opposed to the revolt of the heathen against us but it was his emissaries and his doctrines that poisoned with heresy the fountains from which they drank enough be grateful but do not expect me to intercede for baal and ashtaroth  intercede echoed hurlstone alarmed at the sudden sacerdotal hardness that had overspread the old priests face surely the council will not be severe with the man who was betrayed into their power by others equally guilty  padre esteban avoided hurlstones eyes as he answered with affected coolnessquien sabe there will be expulsados no doubt the excelsior which is confiscated will be sent to mexico with them  i must see senor perkins said hurlstone suddenly  the priest hesitated  when he asked cautiously  at once  good he wrote a hurried line on a piece of paper folded it sealed it and gave it to hurlstone you will hand that to the comandante he will give you access to the prisoner  in less than half an hour hurlstone presented himself before the commander the events of the last twentyfour hours had evidently affected don miguel for although he received hurlstone courteously there was a singular reflection of the priests harshness in his face as he glanced over the missive he took out his watch  i give you ten minutes with the prisoner don diego more i cannot  a little awed by the manner of the commander hurlstone bowed and followed him across the courtyard it was filled with soldiers and near the gateway a double file of dragoons with loaded carbines were standing at ease two sentries were ranged on each side of an open door which gave upon the courtyard the commander paused before it and with a gesture invited him to enter it was a large square apartment lighted only by the open door and a grated enclosure above it seated in his shirtsleeves before a rude table senor perkins was quietly writing the shadow of hurlstones figure falling across his paper caused him to look up  whatever anxiety hurlstone had begun to feel it was quickly dissipated by the hearty affable and even happy greeting of the prisoner  ah what my young friend hurlstone again an unexpected pleasure he said extending his white hands and again you find me wooing the muse in i fear hesitating numbers he pointed to the sheet of paper before him which showed some attempts at versification but i confess to a singular fascination in the exercise of poetic composition in instants of leisure like thisa fascination which as a man of imagination yourself you can appreciate  and i am sorry to find you here senor perkins began hurlstone frankly but i believe it will not be for long  my opinion said the senor with a glance of gentle contemplation at the distant comandante as far as i may express it coincides with your own  i have come continued hurlstone earnestly to offer you my services i am ready he raised his voice with a view of being overheard to bear testimony that you had no complicity in the baser part of the late conspiracythe revolt of the savages and that you did your best to counteract the evil although in doing so you have sacrificed yourself i shall claim the right to speak from my own knowledge of the indians and from their admission to me that they were led away by the vague representations of martinez brace and winslow  pardonpardon me said senor perkins deprecatingly you are mistaken my general instructions no doubt justified these young gentlemen in taking i shall not say extreme but injudicious measures he glanced meaningly in the direction of the commander as if to warn hurlstone from continuing and said gently but let us talk of something else i thank you for your gracious intentions but you remember that we agreed only yesterday that you knew nothing of politics and did not concern yourself with them i do not know but you are wise politics and the science of selfgovernment although dealing with general principles are apt to be defined by the individual limitations of the enthusiast what is good for himself he too often deems is applicable to the general public instead of wisely understanding that what is good for them must be good for himself but said the senor lightly we are again transgressing we were to choose another topic let it be yourself mr hurlstone you are looking well sir indeed i may say i never saw you looking so well let me congratulate you health is the right of youth may you keep both  he shook hurlstones hand again with singular fervor  there was a slight bustle and commotion at the door of the guardroom and the commanders attention was called in that direction hurlstone profited by the opportunity to say in a hurried whisper  tell me what i can do for you and he hesitated to voice his renewed uneasinesstell me ififif your case isurgent  senor perkins lifted his shoulders and smiled with grateful benevolence  you have already promised me to deliver those papers and manuscripts of my deceased friend and to endeavor to find her relations i do not think it is urgent however  i do not mean that said hurlstone eagerly ibut perkins stopped him with a sign that the commander was returning  don miguel approached them with disturbed and anxious looks  i have yielded to the persuasions of two ladies dona leonor and the senora markham to ask you to see them for a moment he said to senor perkins shall it be so i have told them the hour is nearly spent  you have told themnothing more asked the senor in a whisper unheard by hurlstone  no  let them come then  the commander made a gesture to the sentries at the guardroom who drew back to allow mrs markham and eleanor to pass a little child one of eleanors old presidio pupils who recognizing her had followed her into the guardroom now emerged with her and momentarily disconcerted at the presence of the commander ran with the unerring instinct of childhood to the senor for protection the filibuster smiled and lifting the child with a paternal gesture to his shoulder by one hand he extended the other to the ladies  the commander said mrs markham briskly says its against the rules that visiting time is up and youve already got a friend with you and all that sort of thing but i told him that i was bound to see you if only to say that if theres any meanness going on susannah and james markham aint in it no but were going to see you put right and square in the matter and if we cant do it here well do it if we have to follow you to mexicothats all  and i said eleanor grasping the senors hand and half blushing as she glanced at hurlstone see that i have already a friend here who will help me to put in action all the sympathy i feel  senor perkins drew himself up and cast a faint look of pride towards the commander  to hear such assurances from beautiful and eloquent lips like those before me he said with his old oratorical wave of the hand but a passing shadow across his mild eyes is more than sufficient in my experience of life i have been favored at various emergencies by the sympathy and outspoken counsel of your noble sex the last time by mrs euphemia mcorkle of peoria illinois a lady of whom you have heard me speakalas now lately deceased a few lines at present lying on yonder tablea tribute to her geniuswill be forwarded to you dear mrs markham but let us change the theme you are looking welland you too miss keene from the roses that bloom on your cheeksnourished by the humid air of todos santosi am gratified in thinking you have forgiven me your enforced detention here  at a gesture from the commander he ceased stepped back bowed gravely and the ladies recognized that their brief audience had terminated as they passed through the gateway looking back they saw perkins still standing with the child on his shoulder and smiling affably upon them then the two massive doors of the gateway swung to with a crash the bolts were shot and the courtyard was impenetrable        a few moments later the three friends had passed the outermost angle of the fortifications and were descending towards the beach by the time they had reached the sands they had fallen into a vague silence  a noise like the cracking and fall of some slight scaffolding behind them arrested their attention hurlstone turned quickly a light smoke drifting from the courtyard was mingling with the fog a faint cry of dios y libertad rose with it  with a hurried excuse to his companions hurlstone ran rapidly back and reached the gate as it slowly rolled upon its hinges to a file of men that issued from the courtyard the first object that met his eyes was the hat of senor perkins lying on the ground near the wall with a terrible suggestion in its helpless and pathetic vacuity a few paces further lay its late owner with twenty mexican bullets in his breast his benevolent forehead bared meekly to the sky as if even then mutely appealing to the higher judgment he was dead the soul of the liberator of quinquinambo and of various other peoples more or less distressed and more or less ungrateful was itself liberated        with the death of senor perkins ended the crusade of the excelsior under charge of captain bunker the vessel was sent to mazatlan by the authorities bearing the banished and proscribed americans banks brace winslow and crosby and by permission of the council also their friends markham and brimmer and the ladies mrs brimmer chubb and markham hurlstone and miss keene alone were invited to remain but on later representations the council graciously included richard keene in the invitation with the concession of the right to work the mines and control the ranches he and hurlstone had purchased from their proscribed countrymen the complacency of the council of todos santos may be accounted for when it is understood that on the day the firm of hurlstone  keene was really begun under the title of mr and mrs hurlstone richard had prevailed upon the alcalde to allow him to add the piquant dona isabel also to the firm under the title of mrs keene although the port of todos santos was henceforth open to all commerce the firm of hurlstone  keene long retained the monopoly of trade and was a recognized power of intelligent civilization and honest progress on the pacific coast and none contributed more to that result than the clever and beautiful hostess of excelsior lodge the charming country home of james hurlstone esq senior partner of the firm under the truly catholic shelter of its veranda padre esteban and the heretic stranger mingled harmoniously and the dissensions of local and central government were forgotten  i said that you were a dama de grandeza you remember said the youthful mrs keene to mrs hurlstone and you see you are
