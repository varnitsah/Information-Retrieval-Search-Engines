epigram on existence    preface    in collecting the following poems i have to thank the editors and proprietors of the periodicals in which certain of them have appeared for permission to reclaim them  now that the miscellany is brought together some lack of concord in pieces written at widely severed dates and in contrasting moods and circumstances will be obvious enough  this i cannot help but the sense of disconnection particularly in respect of those lyrics penned in the first person will be immaterial when it is borne in mind that they are to be regarded in the main as dramatic monologues by different characters  as a whole they will i hope take the reader forward even if not far rather than backward  i should add that some lines in the earlydated poems have been rewritten though they have been left substantially unchanged  t h september 1909    the revisitation       as i lay awake at nighttime in an ancient country barrack known to ancient cannoneers and recalled the hopes that heralded each seeming brave and bright time    of my primal purple years     much it haunted me that nigh there i had borne my bitterest losswhen one who went came not again in a joyless hour of discord in a joylesshued july there     a july just such as then     and as thus i brooded longer with my faint eyes on the feeble square of wanlit window frame a quick conviction sprung within me grew and grew yet stronger    that the monthnight was the same     too as that which saw her leave me on the rugged ridge of waterstone the peewits plaining round and a lapsing twenty years had ruled thatas it were to grieve me     i should near the onceloved ground     though but now a warworn stranger chance had quartered here i rose up and descended to the yard all was soundless save the troopers horses tossing at the manger    and the sentry keeping guard     through the gateway i betook me down the high street and beyond the lamps across the battered bridge till the country darkness clasped me and the friendly shine forsook me    and i bore towards the ridge     with a dim unowned emotion saying softly  small my reason now at midnight to be here    yet a sleepless swain of fifty with a brief romantic notion    may retrace a track so dear     thus i walked with thoughts halfuttered up the lane i knew so well the grey gaunt lonely lane of slyre and at whiles behind me far at sea a sullen thunder muttered    as i mounted high and higher     till the upper roadway quitting i adventured on the open drouthy downland thinly grassed while the spry white scuts of conies flashed before me earthward flitting    and an arid wind went past     round about me bulged the barrows as before in antique silenceimmemorial funeral piles  where the sleek herds trampled daily the remains of flinttipt arrows    mid the thyme and chamomiles     and the sarsen stone there dateless on whose breast we had sat and told the zephyrs many a tender vow held the heat of yester sun as sank thereon one fated mateless    from those far fond hours till now     maybe flustered by my presence rose the peewits just as all those years back wailing soft and loud and revealing their pale pinions like a fitful phosphorescence    up against the cope of cloud     where their dolesome exclamations seemed the voicings of the selfsame throats i had heard when life was green though since that day uncounted frail forgotten generations    of their kind had flecked the scene      and so living long and longer in a past that lived no more my eyes discerned there suddenly that a figure broke the skylinefirst in vague contour then stronger    and was crossing near to me     some longmissed familiar gesture something wonted struck me in the figures pause to list and heed till i fancied from its handling of its loosely wrapping vesture    that it might be she indeed     twas not reasonless  below there in the vale had been her home the nook might hold her even yet and the downlands were her fathers fief she still might come and go there     so i rose and said agnette     with a little leap halffrightened she withdrew some steps then letting intuition smother fear in a place so longaccustomed and as one whom thought enlightened    she replied  whatthat voicehere     yes agnetteand did the occasion of our marching hither make you think i might walk where we two o i often come she murmured with a moments coy evasion    tis not farandthink of you     then i took her hand and led her to the ancient peoples stone whereon i had sat  there now sat we and together talked until the first reluctant shyness fled her    and she spoke confidingly     it is just as ere we parted said she brimming high with joyand when then came you here and why dear i could not sleep for thinking of our trystings when twinhearted    she responded nor could i     there are few things i would rather than be wandering at this spirithourlonelived my kindred dead  on this wold of wellknown feature i inherit from my father    night or day i have no dread        o i wonder wonder whether any heartstring bore a signalthrill between us twain or no  some such influence can at times they say draw severed souls together    i said dear well dream it so     each ones hand the others grasping and a mutual forgiveness won we sank to silent thought a large content in us that seemed our rended lives reclasping    and contracting years to nought     till i maybe overweary from the lateness and a wayfaring so full of strain and stress for one no longer buoyant to a peak so steep and eery    sank to slow unconsciousness        how long i slept i knew not but the brief warm summer night had slid when to my swift surprise a red upedging sun of glory chambered mortals view not    was blazing on my eyes     from the milton woods to dolehill all the spacious landscape lighting and around about my feet flinging tall thin tapering shadows from the meanest mound and molehill    and on trails the ewes had beat     she was sitting still beside me dozing likewise and i turned to her to take her hanging hand when the more regarding that which like a spectre shook and tried me    in her image then i scanned     that which times transforming chisel had been tooling night and day for twenty years and tooled too well in its rendering of crease where curve was where was raven grizzle     pits where peonies once did dwell     she had wakened and perceiving i surmise my sigh and shock my quite involuntary dismay up she started andher wasted figure all throughout it heaving     said ah yes  i am thus by day     can you really wince and wonder that the sunlight should reveal you such a thing of skin and bone as if unaware a deathshead must of need lie not far under    flesh whose years outcount your own     yes  that movement was a warning of the worth of mans devotionyes sir i am old said she and the thing which should increase love turns it quickly into scorning     and your newwon heart from me     then she went ere i could call her with the too proud temper ruling that had parted us before and i saw her form descend the slopes and smaller grow and smaller    till i caught its course no more        true i might have dogged her downward  but it may be though i know not that this trick on us of time disconcerted and confused mesoon i bent my footsteps townward    like to one who had watched a crime     well i knew my native weakness well i know it still  i cherished her reproach like physicwine for i saw in that emaciate shape of bitterness and bleakness    a nobler soul than mine     did i not return then ever  did we meet againmend allalas what greyhead perseveres  soon i got the route elsewhithersince that hour i have seen her never    love is lame at

backs our shoulders sticking to our packs by fosseway fields and turnpike tracks    we skirted sad sedgemoor  ii  full twenty miles we jaunted on       we jaunted on  my fancyman and jeering john    and mother lee and i and as the sun drew down to west we climbed the toilsome poldon crest and saw of landskip sights the best    the inn that beamed thereby  iii  for months we had padded side by side       ay side by side through the great forest blackmoor wide    and where the parret ran wed faced the gusts on mendip ridge had crossed the yeo unhelped by bridge been stung by every marshwood

jeering john i laid his hand my waist upon i would not bend my glances on    my lovers dark distress  vi  thus poldon top at last we won       at last we won and gained the inn at sink of sun

we sat i next to john to show    that he had wooed and won and then he took me on his knee and swore it was his turn to be my favoured mate and mother lee    passed to my former one  viii  then in a voice i had never heard       i had never heard my only love to me  one word    my lady if you please whose is the child you are like to bear  his  after all my months o care god knows twas not  but o despair    i noddedstill to tease  ix  then up he sprung and with his knife        and with his knife he let out jeering johnnys life    yes there at set of sun the slant ray through the window nigh gilded johns blood and glazing eye ere scarcely mother lee and i    knew that the deed was done  x  the taverns tell the gloomy tale       the gloomy tale how that at ivelchester jail    my love my

 alone alone on his deathday i gave my groan    and dropt his deadborn child twas nigh the jail beneath a tree none tending me for mother lee had died at glaston leaving me    unfriended on the wild  xii  and in the night as i lay weak       as i lay weak the leaves afalling on my cheek   the red moon low declined  the ghost of him id die to kiss rose up and said  ah tell me this was the child mine or was it his    speak that i rest may find  xiii  o doubt not but i told him then       i told him then that i had kept me from all men   since we joined lips and swore whereat he smiled and

upon the writer two or three years ago when after climbing on a hot afternoon to the beautiful spot near which it stands and entering the inn for tea he was informed by the landlady that none could be

and the continual haunt of fever which at last led to its condemnation  its site is now an innocentlooking green meadow  april 1902    the two rosalinds    i     the dubious daylight ended and i walked the town alone unminding whither bound and why as from each gaunt street and gaping square a mist of light ascended    and dispersed upon the sky  ii     files of evanescent faces passed each other without heeding in their travail teen or joy some in void unvisioned listlessness inwrought with pallid traces    of keen penurys annoy  iii     nebulous flames in crystal cages leered as if with discontent at city movement murk and grime and as waiting some procession of great ghosts from bygone ages    to exalt the ignoble time  iv     in a colonnade highlighted by a thoroughfare where stern utilitarian traffic dinned on a red and white emblazonment of players and parts i sighted    the name of rosalind  v     and her famous mates of arden who observed no stricter customs than the seasons difference bade who lived with running brooks for books in natures wildwood garden    and called idleness their trade     vi     now the poster stirred an ember still remaining from my ardours of some forty years before when the selfsame portal on an eve it thrilled me to remember    a like announcement bore  vii     and expectantly i had entered and had first beheld in human mould a rosalind woo and plead on whose transcendent figuring my speedy soul had centred    as it had been she indeed     viii     so all other plans discarding i resolved on entrance bent on seeing what i once had seen and approached the gangway of my earlier knowledge disregarding    the tract of time between  ix     the words sir cried a creature hovering mid the shine and shade as twixt the live world and the tomb but the wellknown numbers needed not for me a text or teacher    to revive and reillume  x     then the play    but how unfitted was this rosalinda mammet quite to me in memories nurst and with chilling disappointment soon i sought the street i had quitted    to reponder on the first  xi     the hag still hawkedi met her just without the colonnade  so you dont like her sir said she ahi was once that rosalindi acted hernone better     yesin eighteen sixtythree  xii     thus i won orlando to me in my then triumphant days when i had charm and maidenhood now some forty years agoi used to say come woo me woo me    and she struck the attitude  xiii     it was when i had gone there nightly and the voicethough raucous nowwas yet the old oneclear as noon my rosalind was

carol       and called in friends  time has tired me since we met here    when the folk now dead were young since the viands were outset here       and quaint songs sung  and the worm has bored the viol    that used to lead the tune rust eaten out the dial       that struck nights noon  now no christmas brings in neighbours    and the new year comes unlit where we sang the mole now labours       and spiders knit  yet at midnight if here walking    when the moon sheets wall and tree i see forms of old time talking       who smile on me    bereft       in the black winter morning no light will be struck near my eyes while the clock in the stairway is warning for five when he used to rise       leave the door unbarred       the clock unwound       make my lone bed hard        would twere underground     when the summer dawns clearly and the appletreetops seem alight who will undraw the curtain and cheerly call out that the morning is bright     when i tarry at market no form will cross durnover lea in the gathering darkness to hark at greys bridge for the pitpat o me     when the supper crocks steaming and the time is the time of his tread i shall sit by the fire and wait

by the logs in my chamber    deserted decrepit  spent flames limning ghosts on the wainscot    of friends i once knew   my drama and hers begins weirdly    its dumb reenactment each scene sigh and circumstance passing    in spectral review   wealth was mine beyond wish when i met her     the pride of the lowland  embowered in tintinhull valley    by laurel and yew  and love lit my soul notwithstanding    my features ill favour too obvious beside her perfections    of line and of hue  but it pleased her to play on my passion    and whet me to pleadings that won from her mirthful negations    and scornings undue  then i fled her disdains and derisions    to cities of pleasure and made me the crony of idlers    in every purlieu  of those who lent ear to my story    a needy adonis gave hint how to grizzle her garden    from roses to rue  could his price but be paid for so purging    my scorner of scornings thus tempted the lust to avenge me    germed inly and grew  i clothed him in sumptuous apparel    consigned to him coursers meet equipage liveried attendants    in full retinue  so dowered with letters of credit    he wayfared to england and spied out the manor she goddessed    and handy thereto  set to hire him a tenantless mansion    as coignstone of vantage for testing what gross adulation    of beauty could do  he laboured through mornings and evens    on new moons and sabbaths by wiles to enmesh her attention    in park path and pew  and having afar played upon her    advanced his lines nearer and boldly outleaping conventions    bent briskly to woo  his gay godlike face his rare seeming    anon worked to win her and later at noontides and nighttides    they held rendezvous  his tarriance full spent he departed    and met me in venice and lines from her told that my jilter    was stooping to sue  not long could be further concealment    she pled to him humbly by our love and our sin o protect me    i fly unto you  a mighty remorse overgat me    i heard her low anguish and there in the gloom of the calle    my steel ran him through  a swift push engulphed his hot carrion    within the canal there  that still street of waters dividing    the city in two   i wandered awhile all unable    to smother my torment my brain racked by yells as from tophet    of satans whole crew  a month of unrest brought me hovering    at home in her precincts to whose hidinghole local story    afforded a clue  exposed and expelled by her people    afar off in london i found her alone in a sombre    and soulstifling mew  still burning to make reparation    i pleaded to wive her and father her child and thus faintly    my mischief undo  she yielded and spells of calm weather    succeeded the tempest and one sprung of him stood as scion    of my bone and thew     but time unveils sorrows and secrets    and so it befell now by inches the curtain was twitched at    and slowly undrew  as we lay she and i in the nighttime    we heard the boy moaning o misery mine  my false father    has murdered my true  she gasped  yea she heard understood it    next day the child fled us and nevermore sighted was even    a print of his shoe  thenceforward she shunned me and languished    till one day the parkpool embraced her fair form and extinguished    her eyes living blue   so ask not what blast may account for    this aspect of pallor these bones that just prison within them    lifes poor residue  but pass by and leave unregarded    a cain to his suffering for vengeance too dark on the woman    whose lover he slew    the rejected members wife    we shall see her no more    on the balcony smiling while hurt at the roar    as of surging sea from the stormy sturdy band    who have doomed her lords cause though she waves her little hand    as it were applause  here will be candidates yet    and candidates wives fervid with zeal to set    their ideals on our lives here will come marketmen    on the marketdays here will clash now and then    more such party assays  and the balcony will fill    when such times are renewed and the throng in the street will thrill    with todays mettled mood but she will no more stand    in the sunshine there with that wave of her whitegloved hand    and that chestnut hair  january 1906    the farmwomans winter    i  if seasons all were summers    and leaves would never fall and hopping casementcomers    were foodless not at all and fragile folk might be here    that white winds bid depart then one i used to see here    would warm my wasted heart  ii  one frail who bravely tilling    long hours in gripping gusts was mastered by their chilling    and now his ploughshare rusts so savage winter catches    the breath of limber things and what i love he snatches    and what i love not brings    autumn in kings hintock park    here by the baring bough    raking up leaves often i ponder how    springtime deceives  i an old woman now    raking up leaves  here in the avenue    raking up leaves lords ladies pass in view    until one heaves sighs at lifes russet hue    raking up leaves  just as my shape you see    raking up leaves i saw when fresh and free    those memory weaves into grey ghosts by me    raking up leaves  yet dear though one may sigh    raking up leaves new leaves will dance on high     earth never grieves  will not when missed am i    raking up leaves  1901    shut out that moon    close up the casement draw the blind    shut out that stealing moon she wears too much the guise she wore    before our lutes were strewn with yearsdeep dust and names

glowers behind dark groups from far and near whose interests were apart from ours    she would disappear  then show again till i ceased to see that flexible form that nebulous white and she who was

joined us there banished our words of warmth away we felt with cloudings of despair    what love must lose that day  her crimson lips remained unkissed our fingers kept no tender hold his lack of feeling made the tryst    embarrassed stiff and cold  a cynic ghost then rose and said but is his love for her so small that nigh to yours it may be read    as of no worth at all  you love her for her

that would not die    killed her old endowment of charm that had capped all nigh       which vanished to none       like the gilt of a cloud       and showed her but one       of the common crowd     she seemed but a sample of earths poor average kind    lit up by no ample enrichments of mien or mind       i covered my eyes       as to cover the thought       and unrecognize       what the morn

frail happiness out of me  and then i kissed youdespite my thought that our spell must end when reflection came on what you had deemed me whose one long aim had been to serve you that what i sought lay not in a heart that could breathe such blame  but yet i kissed you whereon you again as of old kissed me  why why was it so do you cleave to me after that lighttongued blow if you scorned me at eventide how love then the thing is dark dear  i do not know    in the minds eye    that was once her casement    and the taper nigh shining from within there    beckoned here am i  now as then i see

between you dear and me     there shall remain no trace of what so closely tied us and blank as ere love eyed us    will be our meetingplace     the flowers and thymy air will they now miss our coming

upeyed till she with a timid quaver yielded to the kiss i gave her    but she sighed  that there mingled with her feeling some sad thought she was concealing    it implied  not that she had ceased to love me none on earth she set above me    but she sighed  she could not disguise a passion dread or doubt in weakest fashion    if she tried nothing seemed to hold us sundered hearts were victors so i wondered    why she sighed  afterwards i knew her throughly and she loved me staunchly truly    till she died but she never made confession why at that first sweet concession    she had sighed  it was in our may remember and though now i near november    and abide till my appointed change unfretting sometimes i sit half regretting    that she sighed    in the night she came    i told her when i left one day that whatsoever weight of care might strain our love times mere assault    would work no changes there and in the night she came to me    toothless and wan and old with leaden concaves round her eyes    and wrinkles manifold  i tremblingly exclaimed to her o wherefore do you ghost me thus i have said that dull defacing time    will bring no dreads to us and is that true of you she cried    in voice of troubled tune i faltered  well    i did not think    you would test me quite so soon  she vanished with a curious smile which told me plainlier than by word that my staunch pledge could scarce beguile    the fear she had averred her doubts then wrought their shape in me    and when next day i paid my due caress we seemed to be    divided by some shade    the conformers       yes well wed my little fay    and you shall write you mine and in a villa chastely gray    well house and sleep and dine    but those nightscreened divine    stolen trysts of heretofore we of choice

evade    the searching light of the sun our game of passion will be played       our dreaming done     we shall not go in stealth    to rendezvous unknown but friends will ask me of your health    and you about my own    when we abide alone    no leapings each to each but syllables in frigid tone       of household speech     when down to dust we glide    men will not say askance as now  how all

uprises there a mothers form upon my ken guiding my infant steps as when we walked that ancient thoroughfare    the roman road    the vampirine fair    gilbert had sailed to indias shore    and i was all alone my lord came in at my open door    and said o fairest one  he leant upon the slant bureau    and sighed i am sick for thee my lord said i pray speak not so    since wedded wife i be  leaning upon the slant bureau    bitter his next words came so much i know and likewise know    my love burns on the same  but since you thrust my love away    and since it knows no cure i must live out as best i may    the ache that i endure  when michaelmas browned the nether coomb    and wingreen hill above and made the hollyhocks rags of bloom    my lord grew ill of love  my lord grew ill with love for me    gilbert was far from port andso it wasthat time did see    me housed at manor court  about the bowers of manor court    the primrose pushed its head when on a day at last report    arrived of him i had wed  gilbert my lord is homeward bound    his sloop is drawing near what shall i do when i am found    not in his house but here  o i will heal the injuries    ive done to him and thee ill give him means to live at ease    afar from shastonbry  when gilbert came we both took thought    since comfort and good cheer said he so readily are bought    hes welcome to thee dear  so when my lord flung liberally    his gold in gilberts hands i coaxed and got my brothers three    made stewards of his lands  and then i coaxed him to install    my other kith and kin with aim to benefit them all    before his love ran thin  and next i craved to be possessed    of plate and jewels rare he groaned  you give me love no rest    take all the law will spare  and so in course of years my wealth    became a goodly hoard my steward brethren too by stealth    had each a fortune stored  thereafter in the gloom hed walk    and by and by began to say aloud in absent talk    i am a ruined man   i hardly could have thought he said    when first i looked on thee that one so soft so rosy red    could thus have beggared me  seeing his fair estates in pawn    and him in such decline i knew that his domain had gone    to lift up me and mine  next month upon a sunday morn    a gunshot sounded nigh by his own hand my lordly born    had doomed himself to die  live my dear lord and much of thine    shall be restored to thee he smiled and said twixt word and sign    alasthat cannot be  and while i searched his cabinet    for letters keys or will twas touching that his gaze was set    with love upon me still  and when i burnt each document    before his dying eyes twas sweet that he did not resent    my fear of compromise  the steeplecock gleamed golden when    i watched his spirit go and i became repentant then    that i had wrecked him so  three weeks at least had come and gone    with many a saddened word before i wrote to gilbert on    the stroke that so had stirred  and having worn a mournful gown    i joined in decent while my husband at a dashing town    to live in dashing style  yet though i now enjoy my fling    and dine and dance and drive id give my prettiest emerald ring    to see my lord alive  and when the meet on huntingdays    is near his churchyard home i leave my bantering beaux to place    a flower upon his tomb  and sometimes say  perhaps too late    the saints

joy would justify and put misery out of view do you make me notice you    the rambler    i do not see the hills around nor mark the tints the copses wear i do not note the grassy ground and constellated daisies there  i hear not the contralto note of cuckoos hid on either hand the whirr that shakes the nighthawks throat when eves brown awning hoods the land  some say each songster tree

ones missed when near and now perceived too late by me    night in the old home    when the wasting embers redden the chimneybreast and lifes bare pathway looms like a desert track to me and from hall and parlour the living have gone to their rest my perished people who housed them here come back to me  they come and seat them around in their mouldy places now and then bending towards me a glance of wistfulness a strange upbraiding smile upon all their faces and in the bearing of each a passive tristfulness  do you uphold me lingering and languishing here a pale late plant of your once strong

shelter    from storm and drought  thus all unknowing    for whom or what we set it growing    in this bleak spot it still will grieve here    throughout its time unable to leave here    or change its

advanced on the roadside sward  i wondered how succeeding suns    would shape her wayfarings and wished some power might take such ones    under its warding wings  the busy breeze came up the hill    and smartened her cheek to red and frizzled her hair to a haze  with a will    goodmorning my dear i said  she glanced from me to the faroff gray    and with proud severity goodmorning to youthough i may say    i am not your dear quoth she  for i am the dear of one not here     one far from his native land  and she passed me by and i did not try    to make her understand  1901    one we knew m h  17721857    she told how they used to form for the country dances     the triumph the newrigged ship  to the light of the guttering wax in the panelled manses    and in cots to the blink of a dip  she spoke of the wild poussetting and allemanding    on carpet on oak and on sod and the two long rows of ladies and gentlemen standing    and the figures the couples trod  she showed us the spot where the maypole was yearly planted    and where the bandsmen stood while breeched and kerchiefed partners whirled and panted    to choose each other for good  she told of that farback day when they learnt astounded    of the death of the king of france of the terror and then of bonapartes unbounded    ambition and arrogance  of how his threats woke warlike preparations    along the southern strand and how each night brought tremors and trepidations    lest morning should see him land  she said she had often heard the gibbet creaking    as it swayed in the lightning flash had caught from the neighbouring town a small childs shrieking    at the carttail under the lash     with capframed face and long gaze into the embers     we seated around her knees  she would dwell on such dead themes not as one who remembers    but rather as one who sees  she seemed one left behind of a band gone distant    so far that no tongue could hail past things retold were to her as things existent    things present but as a tale  may 20 1902    she hears the storm    there was a time in former years     while my rooftree was his  when i should have been distressed by fears    at such a night as this  i should have murmured anxiously    the pricking rain strikes cold his road is bare of hedge or tree    and he is getting old  but now the fitful chimneyroar    the drone of thorncombe trees the froom in flood upon the moor    the mud of mellstock leaze  the candle slanting sooty wickd    the thuds upon the thatch the eavesdrops on the window flicked    the clacking gardenhatch  and what they mean to wayfarers    i scarcely heed or mind he has won that stormtight roof of hers    which earth grants all her kind    a wet night    i pace along the rainshafts riddling me mile after mile out by the moorland way and up the hill and through the eweleaze gray into the lane and round the corner tree  where as my clothing clams me mirebestarred and the enfeebled light dies out of day leaving the liquid shades to reign i say this is a hardship to be calendared  yet sires of mine now perished and forgot when worse beset ere roads were shapen here and night and storm were foes indeed to fear

as indeed earths testimonies tell     before the birth of consciousness       when all went well     none suffered sickness love or loss none knew regret starved hope or heartburnings    none cared whatever crash or cross       brought wrack to things     if something ceased no tongue bewailed if something winced and waned no heart was wrung    if brightness dimmed and dark prevailed       no

cricked and bent i think of panthera who underwent much from insidious aches in his decline but his aches were not radical like mine they were the twinges of old woundsthe feel of the hand he had lost shorn by barbarian steel which came back so he said at a change in the air fingers and all as if it still were there my pains are otherwise  upclosing cramps and stiffened tendons from this countrys damps where panthera was never commandant  the fates sent him by way of the levant    he had been blithe in his young manhoods time and as centurion carried well his prime in ethiop araby climes fair and fell he had seen service and had borne him well nought shook him then  he was serene as brave yet later knew some shocks and would grow grave when pondering them shocks less of corporal kind than phantomlike that disarranged his mind and it was in the way of warning me by much his junior against levity that he recounted them and one in chief panthera loved to set in bold relief     this was a tragedy of his eastern days personal in touchthough i have sometimes thought that touch a possible delusionwrought of halfconviction carried to a craze  his mind at last being stressed by ails and age yet his good faith thereon i well could wage     i had said it long had been a wish with me that i might leave a scionsome small tree as channel for my sap if not my name  ay offspring even of no

not unlike he again began the noon these pricking memories print on me  yea that day when the sun grew copperred and i served in judaea    twas a date of rest for arms  the pax romana ruled to the chagrin of frontier legionaries palestine was annexedthough sullen yet  i being in age some twoscore years and ten and having the garrison in jerusalem part in my hands as acting officer under the governor  a tedious time i found it of routine amid a folk restless contentless and irascible  quelling some riot sentrying court and hall sending men forth on public meetingdays to maintain order were my duties there     then came a morn in spring and the cheerful sun whitened the city and the hills around and every mountainroad that clambered them tincturing the greyness of the olives warm and the rank cacti round the valleys sides the day was one whereon deathpenalties were put in force and here and there were set the soldiery for order as i said since one of the condemned had raised some heat and crowds surged passionately to see him slain i mounted on a cappadocian horse with some halfcompany of auxiliaries had captained the procession through the streets when it came streaming from the judgmenthall after the verdicts of the governor it drew to the great gate of the northern way that bears towards damascus and to a knoll upon the common just beyond the walls  whence could be

for an incident that followed these     among the tagrag rabble of either sex that hung around the wretches as they writhed till thrust back by our spears one held my eye  a weeping woman whose strained countenance sharpened against a looming livid cloud was mocked by the crude rays of afternoon  the mother of one of those who suffered there i had heard her called when spoken roughly to by my ranged men for pressing forward so it stole upon me hers was a face i knew yet when or how i had known it for a while eluded me  and then at once it came     some thirty years or more before that noon i was subcaptain of a company drawn from the legion of calabria that marched up from judaea north to tyre we had pierced the old flat country of jezreel the great esdraelon plain and fightingfloor of jew with canaanite and with the host of pharaohnecho king of egypt met while crossing there to strike the assyrian pride we left behind gilboa passed by nain till bulging tabor rose embossed to the top with arbute terabinth and locust growths     encumbering me were sundry sick so fallen through drinking from a swamp beside the way but we pressed on till bearing over a ridge we dipt into a world of pleasantness  a vale the fairest i had gazed upon  which lapped a village on its furthest slopes called nazareth brimmed round by uplands nigh in the midst thereof a fountain bubbled where limedry from marching our glad halt we made to rest our sick ones and refresh us all     here a day onward towards the eventide our men were piping to a pyrrhic dance trod by their comrades when the young women came to fill their pitchers as their custom was i proffered help to onea slim girl coy even as a fawn meek and as innocent her long blue gown the string of silver coins that hung down by her banded beautiful hair symboled in full immaculate modesty     well i was young and hot and readily stirred to quick desire  twas tedious timing out the convalescence of the soldiery and i beguiled the long and empty days by blissful yieldance to her sweet allure who had no arts but what outarted all the tremulous tender charm of trustfulness we met and met and under the winking stars that passed which peoples earthtrue union yea to the pure eye of her simplicity     meanwhile the sick found health and we pricked on i made her no rash promise of return as some do use i was sincere in that i said we sundered never to meet again  and yet i spoke untruth unknowingly  for meet again we did  now guess you aught the weeping mother on calvaria was she i had knownalbeit that time and tears had wasted rudely her once flowerlike form and her soft eyes now swollen with sorrowing     though i betrayed some qualms she marked me not and i was scarce of mood to comrade her and close the silence of so wide a time to claim a malefactor as my son  for so i guessed him  and inquiry made brought rumour how at nazareth long before an old man wedded her for pitys sake on finding she had grown pregnant none knew how cared for her child and loved her till he died     well there it ended save that then i learnt that hethe man whose ardent blood was mine  had waked sedition long among the jews and hurled insulting parlance at their god whose temple bulked upon the adjoining hill vowing that he would raze it that himself was god as great as he whom they adored and by descent moreover was their king with sundry other incitements to misrule     the impalements done and done the soldiers game of raffling for the clothes a legionary longinus pierced the young man with his lance at signs from me moved by his agonies through naysaying the drug they had offered him it brought the end  and when he had breathed his last the woman went  i saw her never again

the truth was made too late to influence to ruth the procurator who had condemned his son or rather him so deemed  for there was none to prove that panthera erred not  and indeed when vagueness of identity i would plead panther himself would sometimes own as much  yet lothly  but assuming fact was such that the said woman did not recognize her lovers face is matter for surprise however theres
