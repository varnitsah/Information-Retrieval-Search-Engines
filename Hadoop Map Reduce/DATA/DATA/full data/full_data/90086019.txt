   nathaniel hawthorne    the following story the simple and domestic incidents of which may be deemed scarcely worth relating after such a lapse of time awakened some degree of interest a hundred years ago in a principal seaport of the bay province  the rainy twilight of an autumn daya parlor on the second floor of a small house plainly furnished as beseemed the middling circumstances of its inhabitants yet decorated with little curiosities from beyond the sea and a few delicate specimens of indian manufacturethese are the only particulars to be premised in regard to scene and season  two young and comely women sat together by the fireside nursing their mutual and peculiar sorrows  they were the recent brides of two brothers a sailor and a landsman and two successive days had brought tidings of the death of each by the chances of canadian warfare and the tempestuous atlantic  the universal sympathy excited by this bereavement drew numerous condoling guests to the habitation of the widowed sisters  several among whom was the minister had remained till the verge of evening when one by one whispering many comfortable passages of scripture that were answered by more abundant tears they took their leave and departed to their own happier homes the mourners though not insensible to the kindness of their friends had yearned to be left alone  united as they had been by the relationship of the living and now more closely so by that of the dead each felt as if whatever consolation her grief admitted were to be found in the bosom of the other  they joined their hearts and wept together silently  but after an hour of such indulgence one of the sisters all of whose emotions were influenced by her mild quiet yet not feeble character began to recollect the precepts of resignation and endurance which piety had taught her when she did not think to need them  her misfortune besides as earliest known should earliest cease to interfere with her regular course of duties accordingly having placed the table before the fire and arranged a frugal meal she took the hand of her companion  come dearest sister you have eaten not a morsel today she said arise i pray you and let us ask a blessing on that which is provided for us  her sisterinlaw was of a lively and irritable temperament and the first pangs of her sorrow had been expressed by shrieks and passionate lamentation  she now shrunk from marys words like a wounded sufferer from a hand that revives the throb  there is no blessing left for me neither will i ask it cried margaret with a fresh burst of tears  would it were his will that i might never taste food more  yet she trembled at these rebellious expressions almost as soon as they were uttered and by degrees mary succeeded in bringing her sisters mind nearer to the situation of her own  time went on and their usual hour of repose arrived  the brothers and their brides entering the married state with no more than the slender means which then sanctioned such a step had confederated themselves in one household with equal rights to the parlor and claiming exclusive privileges in two sleepingrooms  contiguous to it  thither the widowed ones retired after heaping ashes upon the dying embers of their fire and placing a lighted lamp upon the hearth  the doors of both chambers were left open so that a part of the interior of each and the beds with their unclosed curtains were reciprocally visible  sleep did not steal upon the sisters at one and the same time  mary experienced the effect often consequent upon grief quietly borne and soon sunk into temporary forgetfulness while margaret became more disturbed and feverish in proportion as the night advanced with its deepest and stillest hours  she lay listening to the drops of rain that came down in monotonous succession unswayed by a breath of wind and a nervous impulse continually caused her to lift her head from the pillow and gaze into marys chamber and the intermediate apartment  the cold light of the lamp threw the shadows of the furniture up against the wall stamping them immovably there except when they were shaken by a sudden flicker of the flame  two vacant armchairs were in their old positions on opposite sides of the hearth where the brothers had been wont to sit in young and laughing dignity as heads of families two humbler seats were near them the true thrones of that little empire where mary and herself had exercised in love a power that love had won the cheerful radiance of the fire had shone upon the happy circle and the dead glimmer of the lamp might have befitted their reunion now while margaret groaned in bitterness she heard a knock at the street door  how would my heart have leapt at that sound but yesterday thought she remembering the anxiety with which she had long awaited tidings from her husband  i care not for it now let them begone for i will not arise  but even while a sort of childish fretfulness made her thus resolve she was breathing hurriedly and straining her ears to catch a repetition of the summons  it is difficult to be convinced of the death of one whom we have deemed another self  the knocking was now renewed in slow and regular strokes apparently given with the soft end of a doubled fist and was accompanied by words faintly heard through several thicknesses of wall  margaret looked to her sisters chamber and beheld her still lying in the depths of sleep  she arose placed her foot upon the floor and slightly arrayed herself trembling between fear and eagerness as she did so  heaven help me sighed she  i have nothing left to fear and methinks i am ten times more a coward than ever  seizing the lamp from the hearth she hastened to the window that overlooked the streetdoor  it was a lattice turning upon hinges and having thrown it back she stretched her head a little way into the moist atmosphere  a lantern was reddening the front of the house and melting its light in the neighboring puddles while a deluge of darkness overwhelmed every other object  as the window grated on its hinges a man in a broadbrimmed hat and blanketcoat stepped from under the shelter of the projecting story and looked upward to discover whom his application had aroused  margaret knew him as a friendly innkeeper of the town  what would you have goodman parker cried the widow  lackaday is it you mistress margaret replied the innkeeper  i was afraid it might be your sister mary for i hate to see a young woman in trouble when i have nt a word of comfort to whisper her  for heavens sake what news do you bring  screamed margaret  why there has been an express through the town within this halfhour said goodman parker travelling from the eastern jurisdiction with letters from the governor and council  he tarried at my house to refresh himself with a drop and a morsel and i asked him what tidings on the frontiers  he tells me we had the better in the skirmish you wot of and that thirteen men reported slain are well and sound and your husband among them  besides he is appointed of the escort to bring the captivated frenchers and indians home to the province jail  i judged you would nt mind being broke of your rest and so i stepped over to tell you  good night  so saying the honest man departed and his lantern gleamed along the street bringing to view indistinct shapes of things and the fragments of a world like order glimmering through chaos or memory roaming over the past  but margaret stayed not to watch these picturesque effects joy flashed into her heart and lighted it up at once and breathless and with winged steps she flew to the bedside of her sister  she paused however at the door of the chamber while a thought of pain broke in upon her  poor mary said she to herself  shall i waken her to feel her sorrow sharpened by my happiness  no i will keep it within my own bosom till the morrow  she approached the bed to discover if marys sleep were peaceful  her face was turned partly inward to the pillow and had been hidden there to weep but a look of motionless contentment was now visible upon it as if her heart like a deep lake had grown calm because its dead had sunk down so far within  happy is it and strange that the lighter sorrows are those from which dreams are chiefly fabricated  margaret shrunk from disturbing her sisterinlaw and felt as if her own better fortune had rendered her involuntarily unfaithful and as if altered and diminished affection must be the consequence of the disclosure she had to make with a sudden step she turned away  but joy could not long be repressed even by circumstances that would have excited heavy grief at another moment  her mind was thronged with delightful thoughts till sleep stole on and transformed them to visions more delightful and more wild like the breath of winter but what a cold comparison working fantastic tracery upon a window  when the night was far advanced mary awoke with a sudden start  a vivid dream had latterly involved her in its unreal life of which however she could only remember that it had been broken in upon at the most interesting point  for a little time slumber hung about her like a morning mist hindering her from perceiving the distinct outline of her situation  she listened with imperfect consciousness to two or three volleys of a rapid and eager knocking and first she deemed the noise a matter of course like the breath she drew next it appeared a thing in which she had no concern and lastly she became aware that it was a summons necessary to be obeyed  at the same moment the pang of recollection darted into her mind the pall of sleep was thrown back from the face of grief the dim light of the chamber and the objects therein revealed had retained all her suspended ideas and restored them as soon as she unclosed her eyes  again there was a quick peal upon the streetdoor  fearing that her sister would also be disturbed mary wrapped herself in a cloak and hood took the lamp from the hearth and hastened to the window  by some accident it had been left unhasped and yielded easily to her hand  whos there asked mary trembling as she looked forth  the storm was over and the moon was up it shone upon broken clouds above and below upon houses black with moisture and upon little lakes of the fallen rain curling into silver beneath the quick enchantment of a breeze  a young man in a sailors dress wet as if he had come out of the depths of the sea stood alone under the window  mary recognized him as one whose livelihood was gained by short voyages along the coast nor did she forget that previous to her marriage he had been an unsuccessful wooer of her own  what do you seek here stephen said she  cheer up mary for i seek to comfort you answered the rejected lover you must know i got home not ten minutes ago and the first thing my good mother told me was the news about your husband  so without saying a word to the old woman i clapped on my hat and ran out of the house i could nt have slept a wink before speaking to you mary for the sake of old times  stephen i thought better of you exclaimed the widow with gushing tears and preparing to close the lattice for she was no whit inclined to imitate the first wife of zadig  but stop and hear my story out cried the young sailor  i tell you we spoke a brig yesterday afternoon bound in from old england  and who do you think i saw standing on deck well and hearty only a bit thinner than he was five months ago  mary leaned from the window but could not speak  why it was your husband himself continued the generous seaman  he and three others saved themselves on a spar when the blessing turned bottom upwards  the brig will beat into the bay by daylight with this wind and youll see him here tomorrow  theres the comfort i bring you mary and so good night  he hurried away while mary watched him with a doubt of waking reality that seemed stronger or weaker as he alternately entered the shade of the houses or emerged into the broad streaks of moonlight  gradually however a blessed flood of conviction swelled into her heart in strength enough to overwhelm her had its increase been more abrupt her first impulse was to rouse her sisterinlaw and communicate the newborn gladness  she opened the chamberdoor which had been closed in the course of the night though not latched advanced to the bedside and was about to lay her hand upon the slumberers shoulder  but then she remembered that margaret would awake to thoughts of death and woe rendered not the less bitter by their contrast with her own felicity she suffered the rays of the lamp to fall upon the unconscious form of the bereaved one  margaret lay in unquiet sleep and the drapery was displaced around her her young cheek was rosytinted and her lips half opened in a vivid smile an expression of joy debarred its passage by her sealed eyelids struggled forth like incense from the whole countenance  my poor sister you will waken too soon from that happy dream thought mary  before retiring she set down the lamp and endeavored to arrange the bedclothes so that the chill air might not do harm to the feverish slumberer  but her hand trembled against margarets neck a tear also fell upon her cheek and she suddenly awoke
