introduction                                 illustration    thackeray in his study at onslow square from a painting by e m ward   we know exceedingly little of the genesis and progress of esmond “it did not seem to be a part of our lives as pendennis was” says lady ritchie though she wrote part of it to dictation she “only heard esmond spoken of very rarely” perhaps its state was not the less gracious the milton girls found paradise lost a very considerable part of their lives—and were not the happier  but its parallels are respectable the greatest things have a way of coming “all so still” into the world we wrangle—that is those of us who are not content simply not to know—about the composition of homer the purpose of the divina commedia the probable plan of the canterbury tales the urhamlet nobody put preliminary advertisements in the papers you see about these things there was a discreditable neglect of the first requirements of the public so it is with esmond there is i thought a reference to it in the brookfield letters but in several searches i cannot find it to his mother he speaks of the book as “grand and melancholy” and to lady stanley as of “cutthroat melancholy” it is said to have been sold for a thousand pounds—the same sum that master shallow lent falstaff on probably inferior security those who knew thought well of it—which is not wholly surprising  it is still perhaps in possession of a success rather of esteem than of affection a company of young men and maidens to whom it was not long ago submitted pronounced it with one or two exceptions inferior as a work of humour the hitting of little harry in the eye with a potato was they admitted humorous but hardly anything else as representing another generation and another point of view the faithful dr john brown did not wholly like it—esmond’s marriage with rachel after his love for beatrix being apparently “the fly in the ointment” to him even the author could only plead “there’s a deal of pains in it that goes for nothing” as he says in one of his rare published references to the subject but he was wrong undoubtedly the mere taking of pains will not do but that is when they are taken in not the right manner by not the right person on not the right subject here everything was right and accordingly it “went for” everything a greater novel than esmond i do not know and i do not know many greater books it may be “melancholy” and none the worse for that it is “grand”  for though there may not be much humour of the potatothrowing sort in esmond it will perhaps be found that in no book of thackeray’s or of any one else’s is that deeper and higher humour which takes all life for its province—which is the humour of humanity—more absolutely pervading and it may be found likewise at least by some that in no book is there to be found such a constant intertwist of the passion which in all humanity’s higher representatives goes with humour hand in hand—a loving yet a mutually critical pair of the extraordinarily difficult form of autobiography i do not know such another masterly presentment nor is it very difficult to recognize the means by which this mastery is attained though heaven knows it is not easy to understand the skill with which they are applied the success is in fact the result of that curious “doubleness”—amounting in fact here to something like triplicity—which distinguishes thackeray’s attitude and handling thus henry esmond who is on the whole i should say the most like him of all his characters though of course “romanced” a little is himself and “the other fellow” and also as it were human criticism of both at times we have a tolerably unsophisticated account of his actions or it may be even his thoughts at another his thoughts and actions as they present themselves or might present themselves to another mind and yet at other times a reasoned view of them as it were that of an impartial historian the mixed form of narrative and monodrama lends itself to this as nothing else could and so does the author’s wellknown much discussed and sometimes heartily abused habit of parabasis or soliloquy to the audience of this nothing has yet been directly said and anything that is said would have to be repeated as to every novel so that we may as well keep it for the last or a late example the virginians or philip but its efficacy in this peculiar kind of double or treble handling is almost indisputable even by those who may dispute its legitimacy as a constantly applied method  one result however it has as regards the herospokesman which is curious i believe thoroughly in henry esmond—he is to me one of the most real of illustrious henrys as well of thackeray’s characters—but his reality is of a rather different kind from that of most of his fellows it is somewhat more abstract more typical more generalized than the reality of english heroes usually is he is not in the least shadowy or allegoric but still he is somehow “esmondity” as well as esmond—the melancholy rather than a melancholy clearsighted aloofminded man his heart and his head act to each other as their governing powers passion and humour have been sketched as acting above he is a man never likely to be very successful famous or fortunate in the world not what is generally called a happy man yet enjoying constant glows and glimmers of a cloudy happiness which he would hardly exchange for any other light the late professor masson—himself no posturemonger or man of megrims but one of genial temper and steady sense—described thackeray as “a man apart” and so is the marquis of esmond yet thackeray was a very real man and so is the marquis too                                illustration   no 36 onslow square brompton where thackeray lived from 1853 to 1862   the element of abstraction disappears or rather retires into the background when we pass to beatrix she also has the ewigweibliche in her—as much of it as any or almost any of shakespeare’s women and therefore more than anybody else’s but she is very much more than a type—she is beatrix esmond in flesh and blood and damask and diamond born “for the destruction of mankind” and fortunately for the delight of them or some of them as well beatrix is beyond eulogy “cease cease to sing her praise” is really the only motto though perhaps something more may be said when we come to the terrible pendant which only thackeray has had the courage and the skill to draw with truth and without a disgusting result if she had died when esmond closes i doubt whether in the wood of fair ladies even cleopatra would have dared to summon her to her side lest the comparison should not be favourable enough to herself and the throne have to be shared  but as usual with thackeray you must not look to the hero and heroine too exclusively even when there is such a heroine as this for is there not here another heroine—cause of the dubieties of the doctor fidelis as above cited as to that it may perhaps be pointed out to the extreme sentimentalists that after all harry had been in love with the mother as well as with the daughter all along if they consider this an aggravation it cannot be helped but except from the extreme point of view of miss marianne dashwood in her earlier stage it ought rather to be considered a palliative and if they say further that the thing is made worse still by the fact that harry was himself rachel’s second love and that she did not exactly wait to be a widow before she fell in love with him—why there is again nothing for it but to confess that it is very shocking—and excessively human indeed the fact is that rachel is as human as beatrix though in a different way you may not only love her less but—in a different sense of contrast from that of the roman poet—like her a little less but you cannot if you have any knowledge of human nature call her unnatural and really i do not know that the third lady of the family isabel marchioness of esmond though there is less written about her is not as real and almost as wonderful as the other two she is not so fairly treated however poor thing for we have her bernstein period without her beatrix one  as for my lords castlewood—thomas and francis père et fils—their creator has not taken so much trouble with them but they are never “out” the least of a piece i think is rachel’s too fortunate or too unfortunate husband the people who regard ibsen’s great triumph in the doll’s house as consisting in the conduct of the husband as to the incriminating documents ought to admire thackeray’s management of the temporary loss of rachel’s beauty they are certainly both touches of the baser side of human nature ingeniously worked in but the question is what in this wonderful book is not ingeniously worked in—character or incident description or speech  if the champions of “unity” were wise they would take esmond as a battlehorse for it is certain that great as are its parts the whole is greater than almost any one of them—which is certainly not the case with pendennis and it is further certain that of these parts the personages of the hero and the heroine stand out commandingly which is certainly not the case with pendennis again the unity however is of a peculiar kind and differs from the ordinary nonclassical “unity of interest” which thackeray almost invariably exhibits it is rather a unity of temper which is also present as the allpervading motto vanitas vanitatum almost necessitates in all the books but here reaches a transcendence not elsewhere attained the brooding spirit of ecclesiastes here covers as it were with the shadow of one of its wings the joys and sorrows the failures and successes of a private family and their friends with the other the fates of england and europe the fortunes of marlborough and of swift on their way from dictatorship in each case to dotage and death the big wars and the notable literary triumphs as well as the hopeless passions or acquiescent losses it is thus an instance—and the greatest—of that revival of the historical novel which was taking place and in which the novel of scott1—simpler though not so very simple as is sometimes thought—is being dashed with a far heavier dose of the novelelement as opposed to the romance yet without abandonment of the romancequality proper of these novelromance scenes as they may be called the famous mockduel at the end is of course the greatest but that where the duke of hamilton has to acknowledge the marquis of esmond and where beatrix gives the kiss of beatrix is almost as great and there are many others it is possible that this very transcendence accounts to some extent for the somewhat lukewarm admiration which it has received the usual devotee of the novel of analysis dislikes the historic and has taught himself to consider it childish the common lover of romance not the better kind feels himself hampered by the characterstudy as Émile de girardin’s subscribers felt themselves hampered by gautier’s style all the happier those who can make the best of both dispensations  nothing however has yet been said of one of the most salient characteristics of esmond—one perhaps which has had as much to do with the love of its lovers and the qualified esteem of those who do not quite love it as anything else this is of course the attempt certainly a very audacious one at once to give the very form and pressure of the time of the story—sometimes in actual diction—and yet to suffuse it with a modern thought and colour which most certainly were not of the time the boldness and the peril of this attempt are both quite indisputable and the peril itself is in a way double there is the malcontent who will say “this may be all very fine but i don’t like it it bothers and teases me i do not want to be talked to in the language of addison and steele” and there will be the possibly less ingenuous but more obtrusive malcontent who will say that it ought never to have been done or that it is not as it is done well with the first who probably exists “in squadrons and gross bands” argument is of course impossible he may be taught better if he is caught young but that is all and certainly the last thing that any honest lover of literature would wish would be to make him say that he likes a thing when he does not that may be left to those who preach and follow the fashions of the moment nor perhaps is there very much to do with those who say that the double attempt is not successful—except to disable their judgement but as for the doctrine that this attempt deserves to fail and must fail—that it is wrong in itself—there one may take up the cudgels with some confidence  so far from there being anything illegitimate in this attempt to bring one period before the eyes of another in its habit as it lived and speaking as it spoke but to allow those eyes themselves to move as they move and see as they see—it is merely the triumph and the justification of the whole method of prose fiction in general and of the historical novel in particular for that historical novel is itself the result of the growth of the historic sense acting upon the demand for fiction so long as people made no attempt to understand things and thoughts different from those around and within them so long as like the men of the middle ages they blandly threw everything into their own image or like those of the renaissance to some extent and the augustan period still more regarded other ages at worst with contempt and at best with indulgence as childish—the historical novel could not come into being and did not it only became possible when history began to be seriously studied as something more than a chronicle of external events when it had thus been made possible it was a perfectly legitimate experiment to carry the process still further not merely to discuss or moralize but to represent the period as it was without forfeiting the privilege of regarding it from a point of view which it had not itself reached the process of thackeray is really only an unfolding and carrying further into application of the method of shakespeare partly his date partly his genius partly his dramatic necessities obliged shakespeare to combine his treatment—to make his godlike romans at once roman and elizabethan and men of all time and men of no time at all thackeray with the conveniences of the novel and the demands of his audience dichotomizes the presentation while observing a certain unity in the fictitious person now of henry esmond now of william makepeace thackeray himself if anybody does not like the result there is nothing to be said but there are those who regard it as one of the furthest explorations that we yet possess of human genius—one of the most extraordinary achievements of that higher imagination which coleridge liked to call esenoplastic2 that a man should have the faculty of reproducing contemporary or general life is wonderful that he should have the faculty of reproducing past life is wonderful still more but that he should thus revive the past and preserve the present—command and provide at once theatre and company audience and performance—this is the highest wizardry of all and this as it seems to me is what thackeray had attempted and more what he has done in the history of henry esmond3  he could not have done it without the “pains” to which he refers in the saying quoted above but these pains as usual bore fruit more than once it has been thought desirable to include in the present volume the two main aftercrops4 the english humourists and the four georges exactly how early thackeray’s attention was drawn to the eighteenth century it would in the necessarily incomplete state of our biographical information about him be very difficult to say we have pointed out that the connexion was pretty well established as early as catherine but it was evidently founded upon that peculiar congeniality freshened and enlivened with a proper dose of difference which is the most certain source and the purest maintainer of love in life and literature  at the same time the two sets of lectures are differentiated from the novel not so much by their form—for thackeray as a lecturer had very little that smacked of the platform and as a novelist he had a great deal that smacked of the satiric conversationscene—as by their purport esmond though partly critical is mainly and in far the greater part creative the lectures though partly creative—resurrective at any rate—are professedly and substantially critical now a good deal has been said already of thackeray’s qualities and defects as a critic and it has been pointed out that in consequence of his peculiar impulsiveness his strong likes and dislikes his satiricromantic temperament and perhaps certain deficiencies in allround literary and historical learning his critical light was apt to be rather uncertain and his critical deductions by no means things from which there should be no appeal but the english humourists is by far the most important “place” for this criticism in the literary department and the four georges with the book of snobs to some extent supplementing it is the chief place for his criticism of society personality and the like moreover both have been and are violently attacked by those who do not like him so that for more reasons than one or two both works deserve faithful critical handling themselves  it is always best to disperse maleger and his myrmidons before exploring the beauties of the house of alma so we may take the objections to the humourists first they are chiefly concerned with the handling of swift and in a less degree of sterne now it is quite certain that we have here in the first case at any rate to confess though by no means to avoid it is an instance of that excessive “taking sides” with or against his characters which has been noticed and will be noticed again and again nor is the reason of this in the least difficult to perceive it is very doubtful whether thackeray’s own estimate of average humanity was much higher than swift’s nor is it quite certain that the affection which swift professed and from more than one instance seems to have really felt for dick tom and harry in particular as opposed to mankind at large was very much less sincere than thackeray’s own for individuals but the temperament of the one deepened and aggravated his general understanding of mankind into a furious misanthropy while the temperament of the other softened his into a general pardon in the same way swift’s very love and friendship were dangerous and harshfaced while thackeray’s were sunny and caressing but there can be very little doubt that thackeray himself when the “shadow of vanity” was heaviest on him felt the danger of actual misanthropy and thus revolted from its victim with a kind of terror while his nature could not help feeling a similar revulsion from swift’s harsh ways that to all this revulsion he gives undue force of expression need not be denied but then it must be remembered that he does not allow it to affect his literary judgement i do not believe that any one now living has a greater admiration for swift than i have and all that i can say is that i know no estimate of his genius anywhere more adequate than thackeray’s as for sterne i do not intend to say much if you will thrust your personality into your literature as sterne constantly does you must take the chances of your personality as well as of your literature you practically expose both to the judgement of the public and if anybody chooses to take up the cudgels for sterne’s personality i shall hand them over to him and take no part on one side or another in that bout to his genius once more i do not think thackeray at all unjust  the fact is however that as is usual with persons of genius but even more than as usual the defects and the qualities are so intimately connected that you cannot have one without the other—you must pay the price of the other for the one all i can say is that such another live piece of english criticism of english literature as this i do not know anywhere what is alive is very seldom perfect to get perfection you must go to epitaphs but once more though i could pick plenty of small holes in the details of the actual critical dicta i know no picture of the division of literature here concerned from which a fairly intelligent person will derive a better impression of the facts than from this addison may be a little depressed and steele a little exalted but it is necessary to remember that by macaulay whose estimate then practically held the field steele had been most unduly depressed and addison rather unduly exalted you may go about among our critics on the brightest day with the largest lantern and find nothing more brilliant itself than the “congreve” article where the spice of injustice will again deceive nobody but a fool the vividness of the “addison and steele” presentation is miraculous he redresses johnson on prior as he had redressed macaulay on steele and he is not unjust as we might have feared that he would be to pope “hogarth smollett and fielding” is another miracle of appreciation and i should like to ask the objectors to “sentimentality” by what other means than an intense sympathy from which it is impossible to exclude something that may be called sentimental such a study as that of goldsmith could have been produced now goldsmith is one of the most difficult persons in the whole range of literature to treat from the motley of his merits and his weaknesses yet thackeray has achieved the adventure here in short throughout the book he is invaluable as a critic if not impeccable in criticism his faults and the causes of them are obvious separable negligible his merits the chief of them as usual the constant shower of happy and illuminative phrase as rare in quality as they are abundant in quantity  the lectures on the english humourists must have been composed very much pari passu with esmond they were being delivered while it was being finished and it was published just as the author was setting off to redeliver them in america the four georges were not regularly taken in hand till some years later when the newcomes was finished or finishing and when fresh material was wanted for the second american trip but there exists a very remarkable scenario of them—as it may be almost called—a full decade older in the shape of a satura of verse and prose contributed to punch on october 11 1845 which has accordingly been kept back from its original associates to be inserted here all things considered it gives the lines which are followed in the later lectures with remarkable precision and it is not at all improbable that thackeray actually though not of necessity consciously took it for headnotes  no book of his has been so violently attacked both at the time of its appearance and since nor—for as the reader must have seen long ago the present writer though proud to be called a thackerayan stalwart is not a thackerayan “knownothing” a “thackerayrightorwrong” man—is there any that exposes itself more to attack from the strictly literary side indeed it has the advantage of the book of snobs for it is nowhere unequal and exhibits its author’s unmatched power of historicalartistic imagination or reconstruction in almost the highest degree possible but in other respects it certainly does show the omission “to erect a sconce on drumsnab” there was it has already been hinted at in connexion with the eastern journey a curious innocence about thackeray it may be that like the hind       he feared no danger for he knew no sin   but the absence of fear with him implied an apparent ignoring of danger which is a danger in itself nobody who has even passed responsions in the study of his literary and moral character will suspect him for one moment of having pandered to american prejudice by prating to it as a titbit and primeur scandal about this or that king george but it was quite evident from the first and ought to have been evident to the author long beforehand that the enemy might think and would say so in fact putting considerations of mere expediency aside i think myself that he had much better not have done it as for the justice of the general verdict it is no doubt affected throughout by thackeray’s political incapacity whatever side he might have taken and by that quaint theoretical republicanism with a good deal of pure toryism mixed which he attributes to some of his characters and no doubt in a kind of rather confused speculative way held himself he certainly puts george iii’s ability too low and as certainly he indulges in the case of george iv in one of these curious outbursts—a hetze of unreasoning frantic “stopthief” and “maddog” persecution—to which he was liable “gorgius” may not have been a hero or a proper moral man he was certainly “a most expensive herr” and by no means a pattern husband but recent and by no means pharisaical expositions have exhibited his wife as almost infinitely not better than she should be the allegations of treachery to private friends are on the whole not proven if he deserted the whigs it was no more than some of these very whigs very shortly afterwards did to their country he played the difficult part of regent and the not very easy one of king by no means ill he was by common and even reluctant consent an extremely pleasant host and companion and he liked jane austen’s novels there have been a good many princes—and a good many demagogues too—of whom as much good could not be said  admitting excess in these details and “inconvenience” in the circumstances of the original representation there remains as it seems to me a more than sufficient balance to credit that socialhistoric sense accompanied with literary power of bodying forth its results which we noticed as early as the opening of catherine has in the seventeen years’ interval fully and marvellously matured itself the picture is not a mere mob of details it is an orderly pageant of artistically composed material it is possible it is lifelike the only question and that is rather a minor one is “is it true”  minor i say because the artistic value would remain if the historical were impaired but i do not think it is i shall bow to the authority of persons better acquainted with the eighteenth century than i am but if some decades of familiarity with essayists and novelists and diarists and letterwriters may give one a scanty locus standi i shall certainly give my testimony in favour of “thackeray’s extract” the true essence of the life that exhibits itself in fiction from pamela and joseph andrews down to pompey the little and the spiritual quixote in essay from the tatler to the mirror in lord chesterfield and lady mary and horace walpole in pope and young and green and churchill and cowper in boswell and wraxall in mrs delany and madame d’arblay seems to me to deserve warrant of excise and guarantee of analysis as it lies in these four little flaskets  and as has been done before let me finish with an almost silent indication of the wonderful variety of this volume also in one sense the subject of its constituents is the same yet in another it is treated with the widest and most infinite difference any one of the three treatments would be a masterpiece of single achievement while the first of the three is as it seems to me the masterpiece of its entire class5  the ms of “esmond”  the ms is contained in two volumes and was presented to trinity college cambridge by the author’s daughter it is now deposited in the college library sir leslie stephen in writing to the librarian about it on june 11 1889 says—  “there are three separate handwritings thackeray’s own small upright handwriting that of his daughter now mrs richmond ritchie a rather large round handwriting and that of an amanuensis whose name i do not know the interest is mainly this that it shows that thackeray dictated a considerable part of the book and as mrs ritchie tells me he dictated it without having previously written anything the copy was sent straight to press as it stands with as you will see remarkably little alteration as esmond is generally considered to be his most perfect work in point of style i think that this is a remarkable fact and adds considerably to the interest of the ms”  the four facsimiles which follow and which appear here by the very kind permission of lady ritchie and of the authorities of the college have been slightly reduced to fit the

another though a few scores of hogsheads of tobacco were all the produce that for long after the restoration our family received from their virginian estates  my dear and honoured father colonel henry esmond whose history written by himself is contained in the accompanying volume came to virginia in the year 1718 built his house of castlewood and here permanently settled after a long stormy life in england he passed the remainder of his many years in peace and honour in this country how beloved and respected by all his fellow citizens how inexpressibly dear to his family i need not say his whole life was a benefit to all who were connected with him he gave the best example the best advice the most bounteous hospitality to his friends the tenderest care to his dependants and bestowed on those of his immediate family such a blessing of fatherly love and protection as can never be thought of by us at least without veneration and thankfulness and my son’s children whether established here in our republick or at home in the always beloved mother country from which our late quarrel hath separated us may surely be proud to be descended from one who in all ways was so truly noble  my dear mother died in 1736 soon after our return from england whither my parents took me for my education and where i made the acquaintance of mr warrington whom my children never saw when it pleased heaven in the bloom of his youth and after but a few months of a most happy union to remove him from me i owed my recovery from the grief which that calamity caused me mainly to my dearest father’s tenderness and then to the blessing vouchsafed to me in the birth of my two beloved boys i know the fatal differences which separated them in politics never disunited their hearts and as i can love them both whether wearing the king’s colours or the republick’s i am sure that they love me and one another and him above all my father and theirs the dearest friend of their childhood the noble gentleman who bred them from their infancy in the practice and knowledge of truth and love and honour  my children will never forget the appearance and figure of their revered grandfather and i wish i possessed the art of drawing which my papa had in perfection so that i could leave to our descendants a portrait of one who was so good and so respected my father was of a dark complexion with a very great forehead and dark hazel eyes overhung by eyebrows which remained black long after his hair was white his nose was aquiline his smile extraordinary sweet how well i remember it and how little any description i can write can recall his image he was of rather low stature not being above five feet seven inches in height he used to laugh at my sons whom he called his crutches and say they were grown too tall for him to lean upon but small as he was he had a perfect grace and majesty of deportment such as i have never seen in this country except perhaps in our friend mr washington and commanded respect wherever he appeared  in all bodily exercises he excelled and showed an extraordinary quickness and agility of fencing he was especially fond and made my two boys proficient in that art so much so that when the french came to this country with monsieur rochambeau not one of his officers was superior to my henry and he was not the equal of my poor george who had taken the king’s side in our lamentable but glorious war of independence  neither my father nor my mother ever wore powder in their hair both their heads were as white as silver as i can remember them my dear mother possessed to the last an extraordinary brightness and freshness of complexion nor would people believe that she did not wear rouge at sixty years of age she still looked young and was quite agile it was not until after that dreadful siege of our house by the indians which left me a widow ere i was a mother that my dear mother’s health broke she never recovered her terror and anxiety of those days which ended so fatally for me then a bride scarce six months married and died in my father’s arms ere my own year of widowhood was over  from that day until the last of his dear and honoured life it was my delight and consolation to remain with him as his comforter and companion and from those little notes which my mother hath made here and there in the volume in which my father describes his adventures in europe i can well understand the extreme devotion with which she regarded him—a devotion so passionate and exclusive as to prevent her i think from loving any other person except with an inferior regard her whole thoughts being centred on this one object of affection and worship i know that before her my dear father did not show the love which he had for his daughter and in her last and most sacred moments this dear and tender parent owned to me her repentance that she had not loved me enough her jealousy even that my father should give his affection to any but herself and in the most fond and beautiful words of affection and admonition she bade me never to leave him and to supply the place which she was quitting with a clear conscience and a heart inexpressibly thankful i think i can say that i fulfilled those dying commands and that until his last hour my dearest father never had to complain that his daughter’s love and fidelity failed him  and it is since i knew him entirely for during my mother’s life he never quite opened himself to me—since i knew the value and splendour of that affection which he bestowed upon me that i have come to understand and pardon what i own used to anger me in my mother’s lifetime her jealousy respecting her husband’s love ’twas a gift so precious that no wonder she who had it was for keeping it all and could part with none of it even to her daughter  though i never heard my father use a rough word ’twas extraordinary with how much awe his people regarded him and the servants on our plantation both those assigned from england and the purchased negroes obeyed him with an eagerness such as the most severe taskmasters round about us could never get from their people he was never familiar though perfectly simple and natural he was the same with the meanest man as with the greatest and as courteous to a black slavegirl as to the governor’s wife no one ever thought of taking a liberty with him except once a tipsy gentleman from york and i am bound to own that my papa never forgave him he set the humblest people at once on their ease with him and brought down the most arrogant by a grave satiric way which made persons exceedingly afraid of him his courtesy was not put on like a sunday suit and laid by when the company went away it was always the same as he was always dressed the same whether for a dinner by ourselves or for a great entertainment they say he liked to be the first in his company but what company was there in which he would not be first when i went to europe for my education and we passed a winter at london with my halfbrother my lord castlewood and his second lady i saw at her majesty’s court some of the most famous gentlemen of those days and i thought to myself “none of these are better than my papa” and the famous lord bolingbroke who came to us from dawley said as much and that the men of that time were not like those of his youth—“were your father madam” he said “to go into the woods the indians would elect him sachem” and his lordship was pleased to call me pocahontas  i did not see our other relative bishop tusher’s lady of whom so much is said in my papa’s memoirs—although my mamma went to visit her in the country i have no pride as i showed by complying with my mother’s request and marrying a gentleman who was but the younger son of a suffolk baronet yet i own to a decent respect for my name and wonder how one who ever bore it should change it for that of mrs thomas tusher i pass over as odious and unworthy of credit those reports which i heard in europe and was then too young to understand how this person having left her family and fled to paris out of jealousy of the pretender betrayed his secrets to my lord stair king george’s ambassador and nearly caused the prince’s death there how she came to england and married this mr tusher and became a great favourite of king george the second by whom mr tusher was made a dean and then a bishop i did not see the lady who chose to remain at her palace all the time we were in london but after visiting her my poor mamma said she had lost all her good looks and warned me not to set too much store by any such gifts which nature had bestowed upon me she grew exceedingly stout and i remember my brother’s wife lady castlewood saying—“no wonder she became a favourite for the king likes them old and ugly as his father did before him” on which papa said—“all women were alike that there was never one so beautiful as that one and that we could forgive her everything but her beauty” and hereupon my mamma looked vexed and my lord castlewood began to laugh and i of course being a young creature could not understand what was the subject of their conversation  after the circumstances narrated in the third book of these memoirs my father and mother both went abroad being advised by their friends to leave the country in consequence of the transactions which are recounted at the close of the volume of the memoirs but my brother hearing how the future bishop’s lady had quitted castlewood and joined the pretender at paris pursued him and would have killed him prince as he was had not the prince managed to make his escape on his expedition to scotland directly after castlewood was so enraged against him that he asked leave to serve as a volunteer and join the duke of argyle’s army in scotland which the pretender never had the courage to face and thenceforth my lord was quite reconciled to the present reigning family from whom he hath even received promotion  mrs tusher was by this time as angry against the pretender as any of her relations could be and used to boast as i have heard that she not only brought back my lord to the church of england but procured the english peerage for him which the junior branch of our family at present enjoys she was a great friend of sir robert walpole and would not rest until her husband slept at lambeth my papa used laughing to say however the bishop died of apoplexy suddenly and his wife erected a great monument over him and the pair sleep under that stone with a canopy of marble clouds and angels above them—the first mrs tusher lying sixty miles off at castlewood  but my papa’s genius and education are both greater than any a woman can be expected to have and his adventures in europe far more exciting than his life in this country which was past in the tranquil offices of love and duty and i shall say no more by way of introduction to his memoirs nor keep my children from the perusal of a story which is much more interesting than that of their affectionate old mother  rachel esmond warrington  castlewood virginia november 3 1778     book i the early youth of henry esmond up to the time of his leaving trinity college in cambridge   the actors in the old tragedies as we read piped their iambics to a tune speaking from under a mask and wearing stilts and a great headdress ’twas thought the dignity of the tragic muse required these appurtenances and that she was not to move except to a measure and cadence so queen medea slew her children to a slow music and king agamemnon perished in a dying fall to use mr dryden’s words the chorus standing by in a set attitude and rhythmically and decorously bewailing the fates of those great crowned persons the muse of history hath encumbered herself with ceremony as well as her sister of the theatre she too wears the mask and the cothurnus and speaks to measure she too in our age busies herself with the affairs only of kings waiting on them obsequiously and stately as if she were but a mistress of court ceremonies and had nothing to do with the registering of the affairs of the common people i have seen in his very old age and decrepitude the old french king lewis the fourteenth the type and model of kinghood—who never moved but to measure who lived and died according to the laws of his courtmarshal persisting in enacting through life the part of hero and divested of poetry this was but a little wrinkled old man pockmarked and with a great periwig and red heels to make him look tall—a hero for a book if you like or for a brass statue or a painted ceiling a god in a roman shape but what more than a man for madame maintenon or the barber who shaved him or monsieur fagon his surgeon i wonder shall history ever pull off her periwig and cease to be courtridden shall we see something of france and england besides versailles and windsor i saw queen anne at the latter place tearing down the park slopes after her staghounds and driving her onehorse chaise—a hot redfaced woman not in the least resembling that statue of her which turns its stone back upon st paul’s and faces the coaches struggling up ludgate hill she was neither better bred nor wiser than you and me though we knelt to hand her a letter or a washhandbasin why shall history go on kneeling to the end of time i am for having her rise up off her knees and take a natural posture not to be for ever performing cringes and congees like a courtchamberlain and shuffling backwards out of doors in the presence of the sovereign in a word i would have history familiar rather than heroic and think that mr hogarth and mr fielding will give our children a much better idea of the manners of the present age in england than the court gazette and the newspapers which we get thence  there was a german officer of webb’s with whom we used to joke and of whom a story whereof i myself was the author was got to be believed in the army that he was eldest son of the hereditary grand bootjack of the empire and heir to that honour of which his ancestors had been very proud having been kicked for twenty generations by one imperial foot as they drew the boot from the other i have heard that the old lord castlewood of part of whose family these present volumes are a chronicle though he came of quite as good blood as the stuarts whom he served and who as regards mere lineage are no better than a dozen english and scottish houses i could name was prouder of his post about the court than of his ancestral honours and valued his dignity as lord of the butteries and groom of the king’s posset so highly that he cheerfully ruined himself for the thankless and thriftless race who bestowed it he pawned his plate for king charles the first mortgaged his property for the same cause and lost the greater part of it by fines and sequestration stood a siege of his castle by ireton where his brother thomas capitulated afterwards making terms with the commonwealth for which the elder brother never forgave him and where his second brother edward who had embraced the ecclesiastical profession was slain on castlewood tower being engaged there both as preacher and artilleryman this resolute old loyalist who was with the king whilst his house was thus being battered down escaped abroad with his only son then a boy to return and take a part in worcester fight on that fatal field eustace esmond was killed and castlewood fled from it once more into exile and henceforward and after the restoration never was away from the court of the monarch for whose return we offer thanks in the prayerbook who sold his country and who took bribes of the french king  what spectacle is more august than that of a great king in exile who is more worthy of respect than a brave man in misfortune mr addison has painted such a figure in his noble piece of cato but suppose fugitive cato fuddling himself at a tavern with a wench on each knee a dozen faithful and tipsy companions of defeat and a landlord calling out for his bill and the dignity of misfortune is straightway lost the historical muse turns away shamefaced from the vulgar scene and closes the door—on which the exile’s unpaid drink is scored up—upon him and his pots and his pipes and the tavernchorus which he and his friends are singing such a man as charles should have had an ostade or mieris to paint him your knellers and le bruns only deal in clumsy and impossible allegories and it hath always seemed to me blasphemy to claim olympus for such a winedrabbled divinity as that  about the king’s follower the viscount castlewood—orphan of his son ruined by his fidelity bearing many wounds and marks of bravery old and in exile his kinsmen i suppose should be silent nor if this patriarch fell down in his cups call fie upon him and fetch passersby to laugh at his red face and white hairs what does a stream rush out of a mountain free and pure to roll through fair pastures to feed and throw out bright tributaries and to end in a village gutter lives that have noble commencements have often no better endings it is not without a kind of awe and reverence that an observer should speculate upon such careers as he traces the course of them i have seen too much of success in life to take off my hat and huzza to it as it passes in its gilt coach and would do my little part with my neighbours on foot that they should not gape with too much wonder nor applaud too loudly is it the lord mayor going in state to mincepies and the mansion house is it poor jack of newgate’s procession with the sheriff and javelinmen conducting him on his last journey to tyburn i look into my heart and think that i am as good as my lord mayor and know i am as bad as tyburn jack give me a chain and red gown and a pudding before me and i could play the part of alderman very well and sentence jack after dinner starve me keep me from books and honest people educate me to love dice gin and pleasure and put me on hounslow heath with a purse before me and i will take it “and i shall be deservedly hanged” say you wishing to put an end to this prosing i don’t say no i can’t but accept the world as i find it including a rope’s end as long as it is in fashion    chapter i an account of the family of esmond of castlewood hall   when francis fourth viscount castlewood came to his title and presently after to take possession of his house of castlewood county hants in the year 1691 almost the only tenant of the place besides the domestics was a lad of twelve years of age of whom no one seemed to take any note until my lady viscountess lighted upon him going over the house with the housekeeper on the day of her arrival the boy was in the room known as the bookroom or yellow gallery where the portraits of the family used to hang that fine piece among others of sir antonio van dyck of george second viscount and that by mr dobson of my lord the third viscount just deceased which it seems his lady and widow did not think fit to carry away when she sent for and carried off to her house at chelsey near to london the picture of herself by sir peter lely in which her ladyship was represented as a huntress of diana’s court  the new and fair lady of castlewood found the sad lonely little occupant of this gallery busy over his great book which he laid down when he was aware that a stranger was at hand and knowing who that person must be the lad stood up and bowed before her performing a shy obeisance to the mistress of his house  she stretched out her hand—indeed when was it that that hand would not stretch out to do an act of kindness or to protect grief and illfortune “and this is our kinsman’” she said “and what is your name kinsman”  “my name is henry esmond” said the lad looking up at her in a sort of delight and wonder for she had come upon him as a dea certè and appeared the most charming object he had ever looked on her golden hair was shining in the gold of the sun her complexion was of a dazzling bloom her lips smiling and her eyes beaming with a kindness which made harry esmond’s heart to beat with surprise  “his name is henry esmond sure enough my lady” says mrs worksop the housekeeper an old tyrant whom henry esmond plagued more than he hated and the old gentlewoman looked significantly towards the late lord’s picture as it now is in the family noble and severelooking with his hand on his sword and his order on his cloak which he had from the emperor during the war on the danube against the turk  seeing the great and undeniable likeness between this portrait and the lad the new viscountess who had still hold of the boy’s hand as she looked at the picture blushed and dropped the hand quickly and walked down the gallery followed by mrs worksop  when the lady came back harry esmond stood exactly in the same spot and with his hand as it had fallen when he dropped it on his black coat  her heart melted i suppose indeed she hath since owned as much at the notion that she should do anything unkind to any mortal great or small for when she returned she had sent away the housekeeper upon an errand by the door at the farther end of the gallery and coming back to the lad with a look of infinite pity and tenderness in her eyes she took his hand again placing her other fair hand on his head and saying some words to him which were so kind and said in a voice so sweet that the boy who had never looked upon so much beauty before felt as if the touch of a superior being or angel smote him down to the ground and kissed the fair protecting hand as he knelt on one knee to the very last hour of his life esmond remembered the lady as she then spoke and looked the rings on her fair hands the very scent of her robe the beam of her eyes lighting up with surprise and kindness her lips blooming in a smile the sun making a golden halo round her hair  as the boy was yet in this attitude of humility enters behind him a portly gentleman with a little girl of four years old in his hand the gentleman burst into a great laugh at the lady and her adorer with his little queer figure his sallow face and long black hair the lady blushed and seemed to deprecate his ridicule by a look of appeal to her husband for it was my lord viscount who now arrived and whom the lad knew having once before seen him in the late lord’s lifetime  “so this is the little priest” says my lord looking down at the lad “welcome kinsman”  “he is saying his prayers to mamma” says the little girl who came up to her papa’s knee and my lord burst out into another great laugh at this and kinsman henry looked very silly he invented a halfdozen of speeches in reply but ’twas months afterwards when he thought of this adventure as it was he had never a word in answer  “le pauvre enfant il n’a que nous” says the lady looking to her lord and the boy who understood her though doubtless she thought otherwise thanked her with all his heart for her kind speech  “and he shan’t want for friends here” says my lord in a kind voice “shall he little trix”  the little girl whose name was beatrix and whom her papa called by this diminutive looked at henry esmond solemnly with a pair of large eyes and then a smile shone over her face which was as beautiful as that of a cherub and she came up and put out a little hand to him a keen and delightful pang of gratitude happiness affection filled the orphan child’s heart as he received from the protectors whom heaven had sent to him these touching words and tokens of friendliness and kindness but an hour since he had felt quite alone in the world when he heard the great peal of bells from castlewood church ringing that morning to welcome the arrival of the new lord and lady it had rung only terror and anxiety to him for he knew not how the new owner would deal with him and those to whom he formerly looked for protection were forgotten or dead pride and doubt too had kept him within doors when the vicar and the people of the village and the servants of the house had gone out to welcome my lord castlewood—for henry esmond was no servant though a dependant no relative though he bore the name and inherited the blood of the house and in the midst of the noise and acclamations attending the arrival of the new lord for whom you may be sure a feast was got ready and guns were fired and tenants and domestics huzzaed when his carriage approached and rolled into the courtyard of the hall no one ever took any notice of young henry esmond who sat unobserved and alone in the bookroom until the afternoon of that day when his new friends found him  when my lord and lady were going away thence the little girl still holding her kinsman by the hand bade him to come too “thou wilt always forsake an old friend for a new one trix” says her father to her goodnaturedly and went into the gallery giving an arm to his lady they passed thence through the musicgallery long since dismantled and queen elizabeth’s rooms in the clocktower and out into the terrace where was a fine prospect of sunset and the great darkling woods with a cloud of rooks returning and the plain and river with castlewood village beyond and purple hills beautiful to look at—and the little heir of castlewood a child of two years old was already here on the terrace in his nurse’s arms from whom he ran across the grass instantly he perceived his mother and came to her  “if thou canst not be happy here” says my lord looking round at the scene “thou art hard to please rachel”  “i am happy where you are” she said “but we were happiest of all at walcote forest” then my lord began to describe what was before them to his wife and what indeed little harry knew better than he—viz the history of the house how by yonder gate the page ran away with the heiress of castlewood by which the estate came into the present family how the roundheads attacked the clocktower which my lord’s father was slain in defending “i was but two years old then” says he “but take fortysix from ninety and how old shall i be kinsman harry”  “thirty” says his wife with a laugh  “a great deal too old for you rachel” answers my lord looking fondly down at her indeed she seemed to be a girl and was at that time scarce twenty years old  “you know frank i will do anything to please you” says she “and i promise you i will grow older every day”  “you mustn’t call papa frank you must call papa my lord now” says miss beatrix with a toss of her little head at which the mother smiled and the goodnatured father laughed and the little trotting boy laughed not knowing why—but because he was happy no doubt—as every one seemed to be there how those trivial incidents and words the landscape and sunshine and the group of people smiling and talking remain fixed on the memory  as the sun was setting the little heir was sent in the arms of his nurse to bed whither he went howling but little trix was promised to sit to supper that night—“and you will come too kinsman won’t you” she said  harry esmond blushed “i—i have supper with mrs worksop” says he  “d—n it” says my lord “thou shalt sup with us harry tonight shan’t refuse a lady shall he trix”—and they all wondered at harry’s performance as a trencherman in which character the poor boy acquitted himself very remarkably for the truth is he had no dinner nobody thinking of him in the bustle which the house was in during the preparations antecedent to the new lord’s arrival  “no dinner poor dear child” says my lady heaping up his plate with meat and my lord filling a bumper for him bade him call a health on which master harry crying “the king” tossed off the wine my lord was ready to drink that and most other toasts indeed only too ready he would not hear of doctor tusher the vicar of castlewood who came to supper going away when the sweetmeats were brought he had not had a chaplain long enough he said to be tired of him so his reverence kept my lord company for some hours over a pipe and a punchbowl and went away home with rather a reeling gait and declaring a dozen of times that his lordship’s affability surpassed every kindness he had ever had from his lordship’s gracious family  as for young esmond when he got to his little chamber it was with a heart full of surprise and gratitude towards the new friends whom this happy day had brought him he was up and watching long before the house was astir longing to see that fair lady and her children—that kind protector and patron and only fearful lest their welcome of the past night should in any way be withdrawn or altered but presently little beatrix came out into the garden and her mother followed who greeted harry as kindly as before he told her at greater length the histories of the house which he had been taught in the old lord’s time and to which she listened with great interest and then he told her with respect to the night before that he understood french and thanked her for her protection  “do you” says she with a blush “then sir you shall teach me and beatrix” and she asked him many more questions regarding himself which had best be told more fully and explicitly than in those brief replies which the lad made to his mistress’s questions    chapter ii relates how francis fourth viscount arrives at castlewood   ’tis known that the name of esmond and the estate of castlewood com hants came into possession of the present family through dorothea daughter and heiress of edward earl and marquis of esmond and lord of castlewood which lady married 23 eliz henry poyns gent the said henry being then a page in the household of her father francis son and heir of the above henry and dorothea who took the maternal name which the family hath borne subsequently was made knight and baronet by king james the first and being of a military disposition remained long in germany with the electorpalatine in whose service sir francis incurred both expense and danger lending large sums of money to that unfortunate prince and receiving many wounds in the battles against the imperialists in which sir francis engaged  on his return home sir francis was rewarded for his services and many sacrifices by his late majesty james the first who graciously conferred upon this tried servant the post of warden of the butteries and groom of the king’s posset which high and confidential office he filled in that king’s and his unhappy successor’s reign  his age and many wounds and infirmities obliged sir francis to perform much of his duty by deputy and his son sir george esmond knight and banneret first as his father’s lieutenant and afterwards as inheritor of his father’s title and dignity performed this office during almost the whole of the reign of king charles the first and his two sons who succeeded him  sir george esmond married rather beneath the rank that a person of his name and honour might aspire to the daughter of thos topham of the city of london alderman and goldsmith who taking the parliamentary side in the troubles then commencing disappointed sir george of the property which he expected at the demise of his fatherinlaw who devised his money to his second daughter barbara a spinster  sir george esmond on his part was conspicuous for his attachment and loyalty to the royal cause and person and the king being at oxford in 1642 sir george with the consent of his father then very aged and infirm and residing at his house of castlewood melted the whole of the family plate for his majesty’s service  for this and other sacrifices and merits his majesty by patent under the privy seal dated oxford jan 1643 was pleased to advance sir francis esmond to the dignity of viscount castlewood of shandon in ireland and the viscount’s estate being much impoverished by loans to the king which in those troublesome times his majesty could not repay a grant of land in the plantations of virginia was given to the lord viscount part of which land is in possession of descendants of his family to the present day  the first viscount castlewood died full of years and within a few months after he had been advanced to his honours he was succeeded by his eldest son the beforenamed george and left issue besides thomas a colonel in the king’s army that afterwards joined the usurper’s government and francis in holy orders who was slain whilst defending the house of castlewood against the parliament anno 1647  george lord castlewood the second viscount of king charles the first’s time had no male issue save his one son eustace esmond who was killed with half of the castlewood men beside him at worcester fight the lands about castlewood were sold and apportioned to the commonwealth men castlewood being concerned in almost all of the plots against the protector after the death of the king and up to king charles the second’s restoration my lord followed that king’s court about in its exile having ruined himself in its service he had but one daughter who was of no great comfort to her father for misfortune had not taught those exiles sobriety of life and it is said that the duke of york and his brother the king both quarrelled about isabel esmond she was maid of honour to the queen henrietta maria she early joined the roman church her father a weak man following her not long after at breda  on the death of eustace esmond at worcester thomas esmond nephew to my lord castlewood and then a stripling became heir to the title his father had taken the parliament side in the quarrels and so had been estranged from the chief of his house and my lord castlewood was at first so much enraged to think that his title albeit little more than an empty one now should pass to a rascally roundhead that he would have married again and indeed proposed to do so to a vintner’s daughter at bruges to whom his lordship owed a score for lodging when the king was there but for fear of the laughter of the court and the anger of his daughter of whom he stood in awe for she was in temper as imperious and violent as my lord who was much enfeebled by wounds and drinking was weak  lord castlewood would have had a match between his daughter isabel and her cousin the son of that francis esmond who was killed at castlewood siege and the lady it was said took a fancy to the young man who was her junior by several years which circumstance she did not consider to be a fault in him but having paid his court and being admitted to the intimacy of the house he suddenly flung up his suit when it seemed to be pretty prosperous without giving a pretext for his behaviour his friends rallied him at what they laughingly chose to call his infidelity jack churchill frank esmond’s lieutenant in the royal regiment of foot guards getting the company which esmond vacated when he left the court and went to tangier in a rage at discovering that his promotion depended on the complaisance of his elderly affianced bride he and churchill who had been condiscipuli at st paul’s school had words about this matter and frank esmond said to him with an oath “jack your sister may be soandso but by jove my wife shan’t” and swords were drawn and blood drawn too until friends separated them on this quarrel few men were so jealous about the point of honour in those days and gentlemen of good birth and lineage thought a royal blot was an ornament to their family coat frank esmond retired in the sulks first to tangier whence he returned after two years’ service settling on a small property he had of his mother near to winchester and became a country gentleman and kept a pack of beagles and never came to court again in king charles’s time but his uncle castlewood was never reconciled to him nor for some time afterwards his cousin whom he had refused  by places pensions bounties from france and gifts from the king whilst his daughter was in favour lord castlewood who had spent in the royal service his youth and fortune did not retrieve the latter quite and never cared to visit castlewood or repair it since the death of his son but managed to keep a good house and figure at court and to save a considerable sum of ready money  and now his heir and nephew thomas esmond began to bid for his uncle’s favour thomas had served with the emperor and with the dutch when king charles was compelled to lend troops to the states and against them when his majesty made an alliance with the french king in these campaigns thomas esmond was more remarked for duelling brawling vice and play than for any conspicuous gallantry in the field and came back to england like many another english gentleman who has travelled with a character by no means improved by his foreign experience he had dissipated his small paternal inheritance of a younger brother’s portion and as truth must be told was no better than a hangeron of ordinaries and a brawler about alsatia and the friars when he bethought him of a means of mending his fortune  his cousin was now of more than middle age and had nobody’s word but her own for the beauty which she said she once possessed she was lean and yellow and long in the tooth all the red and white in all the toyshops in london could not make a beauty of her—mr killigrew called her the sibyl the death’shead put up at the king’s feast as a memento mori c—in fine a woman who might be easy of conquest but whom only a very bold man would think of conquering this bold man was thomas esmond he had a fancy to my lord castlewood’s savings the amount of which rumour had very much exaggerated madam isabel was said to have royal jewels of great value whereas poor tom esmond’s last coat but one was in pawn  my lord had at this time a fine house in lincoln’s inn fields nigh to the duke’s theatre and the portugal ambassador’s chapel tom esmond who had frequented the one as long as he had money to spend among the actresses now came to the church as assiduously he looked so lean and shabby that he passed without difficulty for a repentant sinner and so becoming converted you may be sure took his uncle’s priest for a director  this charitable father reconciled him with the old lord his uncle who a short time before would not speak to him as tom passed under my lord’s coach window his lordship going in state to his place at court while his nephew slunk by with his battered hat and feather and the point of his rapier sticking out of the scabbard—to his twopenny ordinary in bell yard  thomas esmond after this reconciliation with his uncle very soon began to grow sleek and to show signs of the benefits of good living and clean linen he fasted rigorously twice a week to be sure but he made amends on the other days and to show how great his appetite was mr wycherley said he ended by swallowing that flyblown rank old morsel his cousin there were endless jokes and lampoons about this marriage at court but tom rode thither in his uncle’s coach now called him father and having won could afford to laugh this marriage took place very shortly before king charles died whom the viscount of castlewood speedily followed  the issue of this marriage was one son whom the parents watched with an intense eagerness and care but who in spite of nurses and physicians had only a brief existence his tainted blood did not run very long in his poor feeble little body symptoms of evil broke out early on him and part from flattery part superstition nothing would satisfy my lord and lady especially the latter but having the poor little cripple touched by his majesty at his church they were ready to cry out miracle at first the doctors and quacksalvers being constantly in attendance on the child and experimenting on his poor little body with every conceivable nostrum—but though there seemed from some reason a notable amelioration in the infant’s health after his majesty touched him in a few weeks afterward the poor thing died—causing the lampooners of the court to say that the king in expelling evil out of the infant of tom esmond and isabella his wife expelled the life out of it which was nothing but corruption  the mother’s natural pang at losing this poor little child must have been increased when she thought of her rival frank esmond’s wife who was a favourite of the whole court where my poor lady castlewood was neglected and who had one child a daughter flourishing and beautiful and was about to become a mother once more  the court as i have heard only laughed the more because the poor lady who had pretty well passed the age when ladies are accustomed to have children nevertheless determined not to give hope up and even when she came to live at castlewood was constantly sending over to hexton for the doctor and announcing to her friends the arrival of an heir this absurdity of hers was one amongst many others which the wags used to play upon indeed to the last days of her life my lady viscountess had the comfort of fancying herself beautiful and persisted in blooming up to the very midst of winter painting roses on her cheeks long after their natural season and attiring herself like summer though her head was covered with snow  gentlemen who were about the court of king charles and king james have told the present writer a number of stories about this queer old lady with which it’s not necessary that posterity should be entertained she is said to have had great powers of invective and if she fought with all her rivals in king james’s favour ’tis certain she must have had a vast number of quarrels on her hands she was a woman of an intrepid spirit and it appears pursued and rather fatigued his majesty with her rights and her wrongs some say that the cause of her leaving court was jealousy of frank esmond’s wife others that she was forced to retreat after a great battle which took place at whitehall between her ladyship and lady dorchester tom killigrew’s daughter whom the king delighted to honour and in which that illfavoured esther got the better of our elderly vashti but her ladyship for her part always averred that it was her husband’s quarrel and not her own which occasioned the banishment of the two into the country and the cruel ingratitude of the sovereign in giving away out of the family that place of warden of the butteries and groom of the king’s posset which the two last lords castlewood had held so honourably and which was now conferred upon a fellow of yesterday and a hangeron of that odious dorchester creature my lord bergamot6 “i never” said my lady “could have come to see his majesty’s posset carried by any other hand than an esmond i should have dashed the salver out of lord bergamot’s hand had i met him” and those who knew her ladyship are aware that she was a person quite capable of performing this feat had she not wisely kept out of the way  holding the pursestrings in her own control to which indeed she liked to bring most persons who came near her lady castlewood could command her husband’s obedience and so broke up her establishment at london she had removed from lincoln’s inn fields to chelsey to a pretty new house she bought there and brought her establishment her maids lapdogs and gentlewomen her priest and his lordship her husband to castlewood hall that she had never seen since she quitted it as a child with her father during the troubles of king charles the first’s reign the walls were still open in the old house as they had been left by the shot of the commonwealth men a part of the mansion was restored and furnished up with the plate hangings and furniture brought from the house in london my lady meant to have a triumphal entry into castlewood village and expected the people to cheer as she drove over the green in her great coach my lord beside her her gentlewomen lapdogs and cockatoos on the opposite seat six horses to her carriage and servants armed and mounted following it and preceding it but ’twas in the height of the nopopery cry the folks in the village and the neighbouring town were scared by the sight of her ladyship’s painted face and eyelids as she bobbed her head out of the coach window meaning no doubt to be very gracious and one old woman said “lady isabel lordamercy it’s lady jezebel” a name by which the enemies of the right honourable viscountess were afterwards in the habit of designating her the country was then in a great nopopery fervour her ladyship’s known conversion and her husband’s the priest in her train and the service performed at the chapel of castlewood though the chapel had been built for that worship before any other was heard of in the country and though the service was performed in the most quiet manner got her no favour at first in the county or village by far the greater part of the estate of castlewood had been confiscated and been parcelled out to commonwealth men one or two of these old cromwellian soldiers were still alive in the village and looked grimly at first upon my lady viscountess when she came to dwell there  she appeared at the hexton assembly bringing her lord after her scaring the country folks with the splendour of her diamonds which she always wore in public they said she wore them in private too and slept with them round her neck though the writer can pledge his word that this was a calumny “if she were to take them off” my lady sark said “tom esmond her husband would run away with them and pawn them” ’twas another calumny my lady sark was also an exile from court and there had been war between the two ladies before  the village people began to be reconciled presently to their lady who was generous and kind though fantastic and haughty in her ways and whose praises dr tusher the vicar sounded loudly amongst his flock as for my lord he gave no great trouble being considered scarce more than an appendage to my lady who as daughter of the old lords of castlewood and possessor of vast wealth as the country folks said though indeed ninetenths of it existed but in rumour was looked upon as the real queen of the castle and mistress of all it contained    chapter iii whither in the time of thomas third viscount i had preceded him as page to isabella   coming up to london again some short time after this retreat the lord castlewood dispatched a retainer of his to a little cottage in the village of ealing near to london where for some time had dwelt an old french refugee by name mr pastoureau one of those whom the persecution of the huguenots by the french king had brought over to this country with this old man lived a little lad who went by the name of henry thomas he remembered to have lived in another place a short time before near to london too amongst looms and spinningwheels and a great deal of psalmsinging and churchgoing and a whole colony of frenchmen  there he had a dear dear friend who died and whom he called aunt she used to visit him in his dreams sometimes and her face though it was homely was a thousand times dearer to him than that of mrs pastoureau bon papa pastoureau’s new wife who came to live with him after aunt went away and there at spittlefields as it used to be called lived uncle george who was a weaver too but used to tell harry that he was a little gentleman and that his father was a captain and his mother an angel  when he said so bon papa used to look up from the loom where he was embroidering beautiful silk flowers and say “angel she belongs to the babylonish scarlet woman” bon papa was always talking of the scarlet woman he had a little room where he always used to preach and sing hymns out of his great old nose little harry did not like the preaching he liked better the fine stories which aunt used to tell him bon papa’s wife never told him pretty stories she quarrelled with uncle george and he went away  after this harry’s bon papa and his wife and two children of her own that she brought with her came to live at ealing the new wife gave her children the best of everything and harry many a whipping he knew not why besides blows he got ill names from her which need not be set down here for the sake of old mr pastoureau who was still kind sometimes the unhappiness of those days is long forgiven though they cast a shade of melancholy over the child’s youth which will accompany him no doubt to the end of his days as those tender twigs are bent the trees grow afterward and he at least who has suffered as a child and is not quite perverted in that early school of unhappiness learns to be gentle and longsuffering with little children  harry was very glad when a gentleman dressed in black on horseback with a mounted servant behind him came to fetch him away from ealing the noverca or unjust stepmother who had neglected him for her own two children gave him supper enough the night before he went away and plenty in the morning she did not beat him once and told the children to keep their hands off him one was a girl and harry never could bear to strike a girl and the other was a boy whom he could easily have beat but he always cried out when mrs pastoureau came sailing to the rescue with arms like a flail she only washed harry’s face the day he went away nor ever so much as once boxed his ears she whimpered rather when the gentleman in black came for the boy and old mr pastoureau as he gave the child his blessing scowled over his shoulder at the strange gentleman and grumbled out something about babylon and the scarlet lady he was grown quite old like a child almost mrs pastoureau used to wipe his nose as she did to the children she was a great big handsome young woman but though she pretended to cry harry thought ’twas only a sham and sprung quite delighted upon the horse upon which the lackey helped him  he was a frenchman his name was blaise the child could talk to him in his own language perfectly well he knew it better than english indeed having lived hitherto chiefly among french people and being called the little frenchman by other boys on ealing green he soon learnt to speak english perfectly and to forget some of his french children forget easily some earlier and fainter recollections the child had of a different country and a town with tall white houses and a ship but these were quite indistinct in the boy’s mind as indeed the memory of ealing soon became at least of much that he suffered there  the lackey before whom he rode was very lively and voluble and informed the boy that the gentleman riding before him was my lord’s chaplain father holt—that he was now to be called master harry esmond—that my lord viscount castlewood was his parrain—that he was to live at the great house of castlewood in the province of ——shire where he would see madame the viscountess who was a grand lady and so seated on a cloth before blaise’s saddle harry esmond was brought to london and to a fine square called covent garden near to which his patron lodged  mr holt the priest took the child by the hand and brought him to this nobleman a grand languid nobleman in a great cap and flowered morninggown sucking oranges he patted harry on the head and gave him an orange  “c’est bien ça” he said to the priest after eyeing the child and the gentleman in black shrugged his shoulders  “let blaise take him out for a holiday” and out for a holiday the boy and the valet went harry went jumping along he was glad enough to go  he will remember to his life’s end the delights of those days he was taken to see a play by monsieur blaise in a house a thousand times greater and finer than the booth at ealing fair—and on the next happy day they took water on the river and harry saw london bridge with the houses and booksellers’ shops thereon looking like a street and the tower of london with the armour and the great lions and bears in the moats—all under company of monsieur blaise  presently of an early morning all the party set forth for the country namely my lord viscount and the other gentleman monsieur blaise and harry on a pillion behind them and two or three men with pistols leading the baggagehorses and all along the road the frenchman told little harry stories of brigands which made the child’s hair stand on end and terrified him so that at the great gloomy inn on the road where they lay he besought to be allowed to sleep in a room with one of the servants and was compassionated by mr holt the gentleman who travelled with my lord and who gave the child a little bed in his chamber  his artless talk and answers very likely inclined this gentleman in the boy’s favour for next day mr holt said harry should ride behind him and not with the french lacky and all along the journey put a thousand questions to the child—as to his fosterbrother and relations at ealing what his old grandfather had taught him what languages he knew whether he could read and write and sing and so forth and mr holt found that harry could read and write and possessed the two languages of french and english very well and when he asked harry about singing the lad broke out with a hymn to the tune of dr martin luther which set mr holt alaughing and even caused his grand parrain in the laced hat and periwig to laugh too when holt told him what the child was singing for it appeared that dr martin luther’s hymns were not sung in the churches mr holt preached at  “you must never sing that song any more do you hear little manikin” says my lord viscount holding up a finger  “but we will try and teach you a better harry” mr holt said and the child answered for he was a docile child and of an affectionate nature “that he loved pretty songs and would try and learn anything the gentleman would tell him” that day he so pleased the gentlemen by his talk that they had him to dine with them at the inn and encouraged him in his prattle and monsieur blaise with whom he rode and dined the day before waited upon him now  “’tis well ’tis well” said blaise that night in his own language when they lay again at an inn “we are a little lord here we are a little lord now we shall see what we are when we come to castlewood where my lady is”  “when shall we come to castlewood monsieur blaise” says harry  “parbleu my lord does not press himself” blaise says with a grin and indeed it seemed as if his lordship was not in a great hurry for he spent three days on that journey which harry esmond hath often since ridden in a dozen hours for the last two of the days harry rode with the priest who was so kind to him that the child had grown to be quite fond and familiar with him by the journey’s end and had scarce a thought in his little heart which by that time he had not confided to his new friend  at length on the third day at evening they came to a village standing on a green with elms round it very pretty to look at and the people there all took off their hats and made curtsies to my lord viscount who bowed to them all languidly and there was one portly person that wore a cassock and a broadleafed hat who bowed lower than any one—and with this one both my lord and mr holt had a few words “this harry is castlewood church” says mr holt “and this is the pillar thereof learned doctor tusher take off your hat sirrah and salute doctor tusher”  “come up to supper doctor” says my lord at which the doctor made another low bow and the party moved on towards a grand house that was before them with many grey towers and vanes on them and windows flaming in the sunshine and a great army of rooks wheeling over their heads made for the woods behind the house as harry saw and mr holt told him that they lived at castlewood too  they came to the house and passed under an arch into a courtyard with a fountain in the centre where many men came and held my lord’s stirrup as he descended and paid great respect to mr holt likewise and the child thought that the servants looked at him curiously and smiled to one another—and he recalled what blaise had said to him when they were in london and harry had spoken about his godpapa when the frenchman said “parbleu one sees well that my lord is your godfather” words whereof the poor lad did not know the meaning then though he apprehended the truth in a very short time afterwards and learned it and thought of it with no small feeling of shame  taking harry by the hand as soon as they were both descended from their horses mr holt led him across the court and under a low door to rooms on a level with the ground one of which father holt said was to be the boy’s chamber the other on the other side of the passage being the father’s own and as soon as the little man’s face was washed and the father’s own dress arranged harry’s guide took him once more to the door by which my lord had entered the hall and up a stair and through an anteroom to my lady’s drawingroom—an apartment than which harry thought he had never seen anything more grand—no not in the tower of london which he had just visited indeed the chamber was richly ornamented in the manner of queen elizabeth’s time with great stained windows at either end and hangings of tapestry which the sun shining through the coloured glass painted of a thousand hues and here in state by the fire sat a lady to whom the priest took up harry who was indeed amazed by her appearance  my lady viscountess’s face was daubed with white and red up to the eyes to which the paint gave an unearthly glare she had a tower of lace on her head under which was a bush of black curls—borrowed curls—so that no wonder little harry esmond was scared when he was first presented to her—the kind priest acting as master of the ceremonies at that solemn introduction—and he stared at her with eyes almost as great as her own as he had stared at the playerwoman who acted the wicked tragedyqueen when the players came down to ealing fair she sat in a great chair by the firecorner in her lap was a spanieldog that barked furiously on a little table by her was her ladyship’s snuffbox and her sugarplum box she wore a dress of black velvet and a petticoat of flamecoloured brocade she had as many rings on her fingers as the old woman of banbury cross and pretty small feet which she was fond of showing with great gold clocks to her stockings and white pantofles with red heels and an odour of musk was shook out of her garments whenever she moved or quitted the room leaning on her tortoiseshell stick little fury barking at her heels  mrs tusher the parson’s wife was with my lady she had been waitingwoman to her ladyship in the late lord’s time and having her soul in that business took naturally to it when the viscountess of castlewood returned to inhabit her father’s house  “i present to your ladyship your kinsman and little page of honour master henry esmond” mr holt said bowing lowly with a sort of comical humility “make a pretty bow to my lady monsieur and then another little bow not so low to madam tusher—the fair priestess of castlewood”  “where i have lived and hope to die sir” says madam tusher giving a hard glance at the brat and then at my lady  upon her the boy’s whole attention was for a time directed he could not keep his great eyes off from her since the empress of ealing he had seen nothing so awful  “does my appearance please you little page” asked the lady  “he would be very hard to please if it didn’t” cried madam tusher  “have done you silly maria” said lady castlewood  “where i’m attached i’m attached madam—and i’d die rather than not say so”  “je meurs où je m’attache” mr holt said with a polite grin “the ivy says so in the picture and clings to the oak like a fond parasite as it is”  “parricide sir” cries mrs tusher  “hush tusher—you are always bickering with father holt” cried my lady “come and kiss my hand child” and the oak held out a branch to little harry esmond who took and dutifully kissed the lean old hand upon the gnarled knuckles of which there glittered a hundred rings  “to kiss that hand would make many a pretty fellow happy” cried mrs tusher on which my lady crying out “go you foolish tusher” and tapping her with her great fan tusher ran forward to seize her hand and kiss it fury arose and barked furiously at tusher and father holt looked on at this queer scene with arch grave glances  the awe exhibited by the little boy perhaps pleased the lady to whom this artless flattery was bestowed for having gone down on his knee as father holt had directed him and the mode then was and performed his obeisance she said “page esmond my groom of the chamber will inform you what your duties are when you wait upon my lord and me and good father holt will instruct you as becomes a gentleman of our name you will pay him obedience in everything and i pray you may grow to be as learned and as good as your tutor”  the lady seemed to have the greatest reverence for mr holt and to be more afraid of him than of anything else in the world if she was ever so angry a word or look from father holt made her calm indeed he had a vast power of subjecting those who came near him and among the rest his new pupil gave himself up with an entire confidence and attachment to the good father and became his willing slave almost from the first moment he saw him  he put his small hand into the father’s as he walked away from his first presentation to his mistress and asked many questions in his artless childish way “who is that other woman” he asked “she is fat and round she is more pretty than my lady castlewood”  “she is madam tusher the parson’s wife of castlewood she has a son of your age but bigger than you”  “why does she like so to kiss my lady’s hand it is not good to kiss”  “tastes are different little man madam tusher is attached to my lady having been her waitingwoman before she was married in the old lord’s time she married doctor tusher the chaplain the english household divines often marry the waitingwomen”  “you will not marry the french woman will you i saw her laughing with blaise in the buttery”  “i belong to a church that is older and better than the english church” mr holt said making a sign whereof esmond did not then understand the meaning across his breast and forehead “in our church the clergy do not marry you will understand these things better soon”  “was not st peter the head of your church—dr rabbits of ealing told us so”  the father said “yes he was”  “but st peter was married for we heard only last sunday that his wife’s mother lay sick of a fever” on which the father again laughed and said he would understand this too better soon and talked of other things and took away harry esmond and showed him the great old house which he had come to inhabit  it stood on a rising green hill with woods behind it in which were rooks’ nests where the birds at morning and returning home at evening made a great cawing at the foot of the hill was a river with a steep ancient bridge crossing it and beyond that a large pleasant green flat where the village of castlewood stood and stands with the church in the midst the parsonage hard by it the inn with the blacksmith’s forge beside it and the sign of the “three castles” on the elm the london road stretched away towards the rising sun and to the west were swelling hills and peaks behind which many a time harry esmond saw the same sun setting that he now looks on thousands of miles away across the great ocean—in a new castlewood by another stream that bears like the new country of wandering aeneas the fond names of the land of his youth  the hall of castlewood was built with two courts whereof one only the fountain court was now inhabited the other having been battered down in the cromwellian wars in the fountain court still in good repair was the great hall near to the kitchen and butteries a dozen of livingrooms looking to the north and communicating with the little chapel that faced eastwards and the buildings stretching from that to the main gate and with the hall which looked to the west into the court now dismantled this court had been the most magnificent of the two until the protector’s cannon tore down one side of it before the place was taken and stormed the besiegers entered at the terrace under the clocktower slaying every man of the garrison and at their head my lord’s brother francis esmond  the restoration did not bring enough money to the lord castlewood to restore this ruined part of his house where were the morning parlours above them the long musicgallery and before which stretched the gardenterrace where however the flowers grew again which the boots of the roundheads had trodden in their assault and which was restored without much cost and only a little care by both ladies who succeeded the second viscount in the government of this mansion round the terracegarden was a low wall with a wicket leading to the wooded height beyond that is called cromwell’s battery to this day  young harry esmond learned the domestic part of his duty which was easy enough from the groom of her ladyship’s chamber serving the countess as the custom commonly was in his boyhood as page waiting at her chair bringing her scented water and the silver basin after dinner—sitting on her carriage step on state occasions or on public days introducing her company to her this was chiefly of the catholic gentry of whom there were a pretty many in the country and neighbouring city and who rode not seldom to castlewood to partake of the hospitalities there in the second year of their residence the company seemed especially to increase my lord and my lady were seldom without visitors in whose society it was curious to contrast the difference of behaviour between father holt the director of the family and doctor tusher the rector of the parish—mr holt moving amongst the very highest as quite their equal and as commanding them all while poor doctor tusher whose position was indeed a difficult one having been chaplain once to the hall and still to the protestant servants there seemed more like an usher than an equal and always rose to go away after the first course  also there came in these times to father holt many private visitors whom after a little henry esmond had little difficulty in recognizing as ecclesiastics of the father’s persuasion whatever their dresses and they adopted all might be these were closeted with the father constantly and often came and rode away without paying their devoirs to my lord and lady—to the lady and lord rather—his lordship being little more than a cipher in the house and entirely under his domineering partner a little fowling a little hunting a great deal of sleep and a long time at cards and table carried through one day after another with his lordship when meetings took place in this second year which often would happen with closed doors the page found my lord’s sheet of paper scribbled over with dogs and horses and ’twas said he had much ado to keep himself awake at these councils the countess ruling over them and he acting as little more than her secretary  father holt began speedily to be so much occupied with these meetings as rather to neglect the education of the little lad who so gladly put himself under the kind priest’s orders at first they read much and regularly both in latin and french the father not neglecting in anything to impress his faith upon his pupil but not forcing him violently and treating him with a delicacy and kindness which surprised and attached the child always more easily won by these methods than by any severe exercise of authority and his delight in our walks was to tell harry of the glories of his order of its martyrs and heroes of its brethren converting the heathen by myriads traversing the desert facing the stake ruling the courts and councils or braving the tortures of kings so that harry esmond thought that to belong to the jesuits was the greatest prize of life and bravest end of ambition the greatest career here and in heaven the surest reward and began to long for the day not only when he should enter into the one church and receive his first communion but when he might join that wonderful brotherhood which was present throughout all the world and which numbered the wisest the bravest the highest born the most eloquent of men among its members father holt bade him keep his views secret and to hide them as a great treasure which would escape him if it was revealed and proud of this confidence and secret vested in him the lad became fondly attached to the master who initiated him into a mystery so wonderful and awful and when little tom tusher his neighbour came from school for his holiday and said how he too was to be bred up for an english priest and would get what he called an exhibition from his school and then a college scholarship and fellowship and then a good living—it tasked young harry esmond’s powers of reticence not to say to his young companion “church priesthood fat living my dear tommy do you call yours a church and a priesthood what is a fat living compared to converting a hundred thousand heathens by a single sermon what is a scholarship at trinity by the side of a crown of martyrdom with angels awaiting you as your head is taken off could your master at school sail over the thames on his gown have you statues in your church that can bleed speak walk and cry my good tommy in dear father holt’s church these things take place every day you know st philip of the willows appeared to lord castlewood and caused him to turn to the one true church no saints ever come to you” and harry esmond because of his promise to father holt hiding away these treasures of faith from t tusher delivered himself of them nevertheless simply to father holt who stroked his head smiled at him with his inscrutable look and told him that he did well to meditate on these great things and not to talk of them except under direction    chapter iv i am placed under a popish priest and bred to that religion—viscountess castlewood   had time enough been given and his childish inclinations been properly nurtured harry esmond had been a jesuit priest ere he was a dozen years older and might have finished his days a martyr in china or a victim on tower hill for in the few months they spent together at castlewood mr holt obtained an entire mastery over the boy’s intellect and affections and had brought him to think as indeed father holt thought with all his heart too that no life was so noble no death so desirable as that which many brethren of his famous order were ready to undergo by love by a brightness of wit and good humour that charmed all by an authority which he knew how to assume by a mystery and silence about him which increased the child’s reverence for him he won harry’s absolute fealty and would have kept it doubtless if schemes greater and more important than a poor little boy’s admission into orders had not called him away  after being at home for a few months in tranquillity if theirs might be called tranquillity which was in truth a constant bickering my lord and lady left the country for london taking their director with them and his little pupil scarce ever shed more bitter tears in his life than he did for nights after the first parting with his dear friend as he lay in the lonely chamber next to that which the father used to occupy he and a few domestics were left as the only tenants of the great house and though harry sedulously did all the tasks which the father set him he had many hours unoccupied and read in the library and bewildered his little brains with the great books he found there  after a while the little lad grew accustomed to the loneliness of the place and in after days remembered this part of his life as a period not unhappy when the family was at london the whole of the establishment travelled thither with the exception of the porter who was moreover brewer gardener and woodman and his wife and children these had their lodging in the gatehouse hard by with a door into the court and a window looking out on the green was the chaplain’s room and next to this a small chamber where father holt had his books and harry esmond his sleepingcloset the side of the house facing the east had escaped the guns of the cromwellians whose battery was on the height facing the western court so that this eastern end bore few marks of demolition save in the chapel where the painted windows surviving edward the sixth had been broke by the commonwealth men in father holt’s time little harry esmond acted as his familiar and faithful little servitor beating his clothes folding his vestments fetching his water from the well long before daylight ready to run anywhere for the service of his beloved priest when the father was away he locked his private chamber but the room where the books were was left to little harry who but for the society of this gentleman was little less solitary when lord castlewood was at home  the french wit saith that a hero is none to his valet de chambre and it required less quick eyes than my lady’s little page was naturally endowed with to see that she had many qualities by no means heroic however much mrs tusher might flatter and coax her when father holt was not by who exercised an entire authority over the pair my lord and my lady quarrelled and abused each other so as to make the servants laugh and to frighten the little page on duty the poor boy trembled before his mistress who called him by a hundred ugly names who made nothing of boxing his ears—and tilting the silver basin in his face which it was his business to present to her after dinner she hath repaired by subsequent kindness to him these severities which it must be owned made his childhood very unhappy she was but unhappy herself at this time poor soul and i suppose made her dependants lead her own sad life i think my lord was as much afraid of her as her page was and the only person of the household who mastered her was mr holt harry was only too glad when the father dined at table and to slink away and prattle with him afterwards or read with him or walk with him luckily my lady viscountess did not rise till noon heaven help the poor waitingwoman who had charge of her toilet i have often seen the poor wretch come out with red eyes from the closet where those long and mysterious rites of her ladyship’s dress were performed and the backgammonbox locked up with a rap on mrs tusher’s fingers when she played ill or the game was going the wrong way  blessed be the king who introduced cards and the kind inventors of piquet and cribbage for they employed six hours at least of her ladyship’s day during which her family was pretty easy without this occupation my lady frequently declared she should die her dependants one after another relieved guard—’twas rather a dangerous post to play with her ladyship—and took the cards turn about mr holt would sit with her at piquet during hours together at which time she behaved herself properly and as for dr tusher i believe he would have left a parishioner’s dying bed if summoned to play a rubber with his patroness at castlewood sometimes when they were pretty comfortable together my lord took a hand besides these my lady had her faithful poor tusher and one two three gentlewomen whom harry esmond could recollect in his time they could not bear that genteel service very long one after another tried and failed at it these and the housekeeper and little harry esmond had a table of their own poor ladies their life was far harder than the page’s he was found asleep tucked up in his little bed whilst they were sitting by her ladyship reading her to sleep with the news letter or the grand cyrus my lady used to have boxes of new plays from london and harry was forbidden under the pain of a whipping to look into them i am afraid he deserved the penalty pretty often and got it sometimes father holt applied it twice or thrice when he caught the young scapegrace with a delightful wicked comedy of mr shadwell’s or mr wycherley’s under his pillow  these when he took any were my lord’s favourite reading but he was averse to much study and as his little page fancied to much occupation of any sort  it always seemed to young harry esmond that my lord treated him with more kindness when his lady was not present and lord castlewood would take the lad sometimes on his little journeys ahunting or abirding he loved to play at cards and trictrac with him which games the boy learned to pleasure his lord and was growing to like him better daily showing a special pleasure if father holt gave a good report of him patting him on the head and promising that he would provide for the boy however in my lady’s presence my lord showed no such marks of kindness and affected to treat the lad roughly and rebuked him sharply for little faults—for which he in a manner asked pardon of young esmond when they were private saying if he did not speak roughly she would and his tongue was not such a bad one as his lady’s—a point whereof the boy young as he was was very well assured  great public events were happening all this while of which the simple young page took little count but one day riding into the neighbouring town on the step of my lady’s coach his lordship and she and father holt being inside a great mob of people came hooting and jeering round the coach bawling out “the bishops for ever” “down with the pope” “no popery no popery jezebel jezebel” so that my lord began to laugh my lady’s eyes to roll with anger for she was as bold as a lioness and feared nobody whilst mr holt as esmond saw from his place on the step sank back with rather an alarmed face crying out to her ladyship “for god’s sake madam do not speak or look out of window sit still” but she did not obey this prudent injunction of the father she thrust her head out of the coach window and screamed out to the coachman “flog your way through them the brutes james and use your whip”  the mob answered with a roaring jeer of laughter and fresh cries of “jezebel jezebel” my lord only laughed the more he was a languid gentleman nothing seemed to excite him commonly though i have seen him cheer and halloo the hounds very briskly and his face which was generally very yellow and calm grow quite red and cheerful during a burst over the downs after a hare and laugh and swear and huzza at a cockfight of which sport he was very fond and now when the mob began to hoot his lady he laughed with something of a mischievous look as though he expected sport and thought that she and they were a match  james the coachman was more afraid of his mistress than the mob probably for he whipped on his horses as he was bidden and the postboy that rode with the first pair my lady always went with her coachandsix gave a cut of his thong over the shoulders of one fellow who put his hand out towards the leading horse’s rein  it was a market day and the country people were all assembled with their baskets of poultry eggs and such things the postilion had no sooner lashed the man who would have taken hold of his horse but a great cabbage came whirling like a bombshell into the carriage at which my lord laughed more for it knocked my lady’s fan out of her hand and plumped into father holt’s stomach then came a shower of carrots and potatoes  “for heaven’s sake be still” says mr holt “we are not ten paces from the ‘bell’ archway where they can shut the gates on us and keep out this canaille”  the little page was outside the coach on the step and a fellow in the crowd aimed a potato at him and hit him in the eye at which the poor little wretch set up a shout the man laughed a great big saddler’s apprentice of the town “ah you d—— little yelling popish bastard” he said and stooped to pick up another the crowd had gathered quite between the horses and in the inn door by this time and the coach was brought to a dead standstill my lord jumped as briskly as a boy out of the door on his side of the coach squeezing little harry behind it had hold of the potatothrower’s collar in an instant and the next moment the brute’s heels were in the air and he fell on the stones with a thump  “you hulking coward” says he “you pack of screaming blackguards how dare you attack children and insult women fling another shot at that carriage you sneaking pigskin cobbler and by the lord i’ll send my rapier through you”  some of the mob cried “huzza my lord” for they knew him and the saddler’s man was a known bruiser near twice as big as my lord viscount  “make way there” says he he spoke in a high shrill voice but with a great air of authority “make way and let her ladyship’s carriage pass” the men that were between the coach and the gate of the “bell” actually did make way and the horses went in my lord walking after them with his hat on his head  as he was going in at the gate through which the coach had just rolled another cry begins of “no popery—no papists” my lord turns round and faces them once more  “god save the king” says he at the highest pitch of his voice “who dares abuse the king’s religion you you d——d psalmsinging cobbler as sure as i’m a magistrate of this county i’ll commit you” the fellow shrunk back and my lord retreated with all the honours of the day but when the little flurry caused by the scene was over and the flush passed off his face he relapsed into his usual languor trifled with his little dog and yawned when my lady spoke to him  this mob was one of many thousands that were going about the country at that time huzzaing for the acquittal of the seven bishops who had been tried just then and about whom little harry esmond at that time knew scarce anything it was assizes at hexton and there was a great meeting of the gentry at the “bell” and my lord’s people had their new liveries on and harry a little suit of blue and silver which he wore upon occasions of state and the gentlefolks came round and talked to my lord and a judge in a red gown who seemed a very great personage especially complimented him and my lady who was mighty grand harry remembers her train borne up by her gentlewoman there was an assembly and ball at the great room at the “bell” and other young gentlemen of the county families looked on as he did one of them jeered him for his black eye which was swelled by the potato and another called him a bastard on which he and harry fell to fisticuffs my lord’s cousin colonel esmond of walcote was there and separated the two lads a great tall gentleman with a handsome goodnatured face the boy did not know how nearly in afterlife he should be allied to colonel esmond and how much kindness he should have to owe him  there was little love between the two families my lady used not to spare colonel esmond in talking of him for reasons which have been hinted already but about which at his tender age henry esmond could be expected to know nothing  very soon afterwards my lord and lady went to london with mr holt leaving however the page behind them the little man had the great house of castlewood to himself or between him and the housekeeper mrs worksop an old lady who was a kinswoman of the family in some distant way and a protestant but a stanch tory and king’sman as all the esmonds were he used to go to school to dr tusher when he was at home though the doctor was much occupied too there was a great stir and commotion everywhere even in the little quiet village of castlewood whither a party of people came from the town who would have broken castlewood chapel windows but the village people turned out and even old sievewright the republican blacksmith along with them for my lady though she was a papist and had many odd ways was kind to the tenantry and there was always a plenty of beef and blankets and medicine for the poor at castlewood hall  a kingdom was changing hands whilst my lord and lady were away king james was flying the dutchmen were coming awful stories about them and the prince of orange used old mrs worksop to tell to the idle little page  he liked the solitude of the great house very well he had all the playbooks to read and no father holt to whip him and a hundred childish pursuits and pastimes without doors and within which made this time very pleasant    chapter v my superiors are engaged in plots for the restoration of king james ii   not having been able to sleep for thinking of some lines for eels which he had placed the night before the lad was lying in his little bed waiting for the hour when the gate would be open and he and his comrade job lockwood the porter’s son might go to the pond and see what fortune had brought them at daybreak job was to awaken him but his own eagerness for the sport had served as a réveille long since—so long that it seemed to him as if the day never would come  it might have been four o’clock when he heard the door of the opposite chamber the chaplain’s room open and the voice of a man coughing in the passage harry jumped up thinking for certain it was a robber or hoping perhaps for a ghost and flinging open his own door saw before him the chaplain’s door open and a light inside and a figure standing in the doorway in the midst of a great smoke which issued from the room  “who’s there” cried out the boy who was of a good spirit  “silentium” whispered the other “’tis i my boy” and holding his hand out harry had no difficulty in recognizing his master and friend father holt a curtain was over the window of the chaplain’s room that looked to the court and harry saw that the smoke came from a great flame of papers which were burning in a brazier when he entered the chaplain’s room after giving a hasty greeting and blessing to the lad who was charmed to see his tutor the father continued the burning of his papers drawing them from a cupboard over the mantelpiece wall which harry had never seen before  father holt laughed seeing the lad’s attention fixed at once on this hole “that is right harry” he said “faithful little famuli see all and say nothing you are faithful i know”  “i know i would go to the stake for you” said harry  “i don’t want your head” said the father patting it kindly “all you have to do is to hold your tongue let us burn these papers and say nothing to anybody should you like to read them”  harry esmond blushed and held down his head he had looked as the fact was and without thinking at the paper before him and though he had seen it could not understand a word of it the letters being quite clear enough but quite without meaning they burned the papers beating down the ashes in a brazier so that scarce any traces of them remained  harry had been accustomed to see father holt in more dresses than one it not being safe or worth the danger for popish ecclesiastics to wear their proper dress and he was in consequence in no wise astonished that the priest should now appear before him in a riding dress with large buff leather boots and a feather to his hat plain but such as gentlemen wore  “you know the secret of the cupboard” said he laughing “and must be prepared for other mysteries” and he opened—but not a secret cupboard this time—only a wardrobe which he usually kept locked and from which he now took out two or three dresses and perukes of different colours and a couple of swords of a pretty make father holt was an expert practitioner with the small sword and every day whilst he was at home he and his pupil practised this exercise in which the lad became a very great proficient a military coat and cloak and a farmer’s smock and placed them in the large hole over the mantelpiece from which the papers had been taken  “if they miss the cupboard” he said “they will not find these if they find them they’ll tell no tales except that father holt wore more suits of clothes than one all jesuits do you know what deceivers we are harry”  harry was alarmed at the notion that his friend was about to leave him but “no” the priest said “i may very likely come back with my lord in a few days we are to be tolerated we are not to be persecuted but they may take a fancy to pay a visit at castlewood ere our return and as gentlemen of my cloth are suspected they might choose to examine my papers which concern nobody—at least not them” and to this day whether the papers in cipher related to politics or to the affairs of that mysterious society whereof father holt was a member his pupil harry esmond remains in entire ignorance  the rest of his goods his small wardrobe c holt left untouched on his shelves and in his cupboard taking down—with a laugh however—and flinging into the brazier where he only half burned them some theological treatises which he had been writing against the english divines “and now” said he “henry my son you may testify with a safe conscience that you saw me burning latin sermons the last time i was here before i went away to london and it will be daybreak directly and i must be away before lockwood is stirring”  “will not lockwood let you out sir” esmond asked holt laughed he was never more gay or goodhumoured than when in the midst of action or danger  “lockwood knows nothing of my being here mind you” he said “nor would you you little wretch had you slept better you must forget that i have been here and now farewell close the door and go to your own room and don’t come out till—stay why should you not know one secret more i know you will never betray me”  in the chaplain’s room were two windows the one looking into the court facing westwards to the fountain the other a small casement strongly barred and looking on to the green in front of the hall this window was too high to reach from the ground but mounting on a buffet which stood beneath it father holt showed me how by pressing on the base of the window the whole framework of lead glass and iron stanchions descended into a cavity worked below from which it could be drawn and restored to its usual place from without a broken pane being purposely open to admit the hand which was to work upon the spring of the machine  “when i am gone” father holt said “you may push away the buffet so that no one may fancy that an exit has been made that way lock the door place the key—where shall we put the key—under chrysostom on the bookshelf and if any ask for it say i keep it there and told you where to find it if you had need to go to my room the descent is easy down the wall into the ditch and so once more farewell until i see thee again my dear son” and with this the intrepid father mounted the buffet with great agility and briskness stepped across the window lifting up the bars and framework again from the other side and only leaving room for harry esmond to stand on tiptoe and kiss his hand before the casement closed the bars fixing as firm as ever seemingly in the stone arch overhead when father holt next arrived at castlewood it was by the public gate on horseback and he never so much as alluded to the existence of the private issue to harry except when he had need of a private messenger from within for which end no doubt he had instructed his young pupil in the means of quitting the hall  esmond young as he was would have died sooner than betray his friend and master as mr holt well knew for he had tried the boy more than once putting temptations in his way to see whether he would yield to them and confess afterwards or whether he would resist them as he did sometimes or whether he would lie which he never did holt instructing the boy on this point however that if to keep silence is not to lie as it certainly is not yet silence is after all equivalent to a negation—and therefore a downright no in the interest of justice or your friend and in reply to a question that may be prejudicial to either is not criminal but on the contrary praiseworthy and as lawful a way as the other of eluding a wrongful demand for instance says he suppose a good citizen who had seen his majesty take refuge there had been asked “is king charles up that oaktree” his duty would have been not to say yes—so that the cromwellians should seize the king and murder him like his father—but no his majesty being private in the tree and therefore not to be seen there by loyal eyes all which instruction in religion and morals as well as in the rudiments of the tongues and sciences the boy took eagerly and with gratitude from his tutor when then holt was gone and told harry not to see him it was as if he had never been and he had this answer pat when he came to be questioned a few days after  the prince of orange was then at salisbury as young esmond learned from seeing doctor tusher in his best cassock though the roads were muddy and he never was known to wear his silk only his stuff one ahorseback with a great orange cockade in his broadleafed hat and nahum his clerk ornamented with a like decoration the doctor was walking up and down in front of his parsonage when little esmond saw him and heard him say he was going to pay his duty to his highness the prince as he mounted his pad and rode away with nahum behind the village people had orange cockades too and his friend the blacksmith’s laughing daughter pinned one into harry’s old hat which he tore out indignantly when they bid him to cry “god save the prince of orange and the protestant religion” but the people only laughed for they liked the boy in the village where his solitary condition moved the general pity and where he found friendly welcomes and faces in many houses father holt had many friends there too for he not only would fight the blacksmith at theology never losing his temper but laughing the whole time in his pleasant way but he cured him of an ague with quinquina and was always ready with a kind word for any man that asked it so that they said in the village ’twas a pity the two were papists  the director and the vicar of castlewood agreed very well indeed the former was a perfectly bred gentleman and it was the latter’s business to agree with everybody doctor tusher and the lady’s maid his spouse had a boy who was about the age of little esmond and there was such a friendship between the lads as propinquity and tolerable kindness and good humour on either side would be pretty sure to occasion tom tusher was sent off early however to a school in london whither his father took him and a volume of sermons in the first year of the reign of king james and tom returned but once a year afterwards to castlewood for many years of his scholastic and collegiate life thus there was less danger to tom of a perversion of his faith by the director who scarce ever saw him than there was to harry who constantly was in the vicar’s company but as long as harry’s religion was his majesty’s and my lord’s and my lady’s the doctor said gravely it should not be for him to disturb or disquiet him it was far from him to say that his majesty’s church was not a branch of the catholic church upon which father holt used according to his custom to laugh and say that the holy church throughout all the world and the noble army of martyrs were very much obliged to the doctor  it was while dr tusher was away at salisbury that there came a troop of dragoons with orange scarfs and quartered in castlewood and some of them came up to the hall where they took possession robbing nothing however beyond the henhouse and the beercellar and only insisting upon going through the house and looking for papers the first room they asked to look at was father holt’s room of which harry esmond brought the key and they opened the drawers and the cupboards and tossed over the papers and clothes—but found nothing except his books and clothes and the vestments in a box by themselves with which the dragoons made merry to harry esmond’s horror and to the questions which the gentleman put to harry he replied that father holt was a very kind man to him and a very learned man and harry supposed would tell him none of his secrets if he had any he was about eleven years old at this time and looked as innocent as boys of his age  the family were away more than six months and when they returned they were in the deepest state of dejection for king james had been banished the prince of orange was on the throne and the direst persecutions of those of the catholic faith were apprehended by my lady who said she did not believe that there was a word of truth in the promises of toleration that dutch monster made or in a single word the perjured wretch said my lord and lady were in a manner prisoners in their own house so her ladyship gave the little page to know who was by this time growing of an age to understand what was passing about him and something of the characters of the people he lived with  “we are prisoners” says she “in everything but chains we are prisoners let them come let them consign me to dungeons or strike off my head from this poor little throat” and she clasped it in her long fingers “the blood of the esmonds will always flow freely for their kings we are not like the churchills—the judases who kiss their master and betray him we know how to suffer how even to forgive in the royal cause” no doubt it was to that fatal business of losing the place of groom of the posset to which her ladyship alluded as she did half a dozen times in the day “let the tyrant of orange bring his rack and his odious dutch tortures—the beast the wretch i spit upon him and defy him cheerfully will i lay this head upon the block cheerfully will i accompany my lord to the scaffold we will cry ‘god save king james’ with our dying breath and smile in the face of the executioner” and she told her page a hundred times at least of the particulars of the last interview which she had with his majesty  “i flung myself before my liege’s feet” she said “at salisbury i devoted myself—my husband—my house to his cause perhaps he remembered old times when isabella esmond was young and fair perhaps he recalled the day when ’twas not i that knelt—at least he spoke to me with a voice that reminded me of days gone by ‘egad’ said his majesty ‘you should go to the prince of orange if you want anything’ ‘no sire’ i replied ‘i would not kneel to a usurper the esmond that would have served your majesty will never be groom to a traitor’s posset’ the royal exile smiled even in the midst of his misfortune he deigned to raise me with words of consolation the viscount my husband himself could not be angry at the august salute with which he honoured me”  the public misfortune had the effect of making my lord and his lady better friends than they ever had been since their courtship my lord viscount had shown both loyalty and spirit when these were rare qualities in the dispirited party about the king and the praise he got elevated him not a little in his wife’s good opinion and perhaps in his own he wakened up from the listless and supine life which he had been leading was always riding to and fro in consultation with this friend or that of the king’s the page of course knowing little of his doings but remarking only his greater cheerfulness and altered demeanour  father holt came to the hall constantly but officiated no longer openly as chaplain he was always fetching and carrying strangers military and ecclesiastic harry knew the latter though they came in all sorts of disguises were continually arriving and departing my lord made long absences and sudden reappearances using sometimes the means of exit which father holt had employed though how often the little window in the chaplain’s room let in or let out my lord and his friends harry could not tell he stoutly kept his promise to the father of not prying and if at midnight from his little room he heard noises of persons stirring in the next chamber he turned round to the wall and hid his curiosity under his pillow until it fell asleep of course he could not help remarking that the priest’s journeys were constant and understanding by a hundred signs that some active though secret business employed him what this was may pretty well be guessed by what soon happened to my lord  no garrison or watch was put into castlewood when my lord came back but a guard was in the village and one or other of them was always on the green keeping a lookout on our great gate and those who went out and in lockwood said that at night especially every person who came in or went out was watched by the outlying sentries ’twas lucky that we had a gate which their worships knew nothing about my lord and father holt must have made constant journeys at night once or twice little harry acted as their messenger and discreet little aide de camp he remembers he was bidden to go into the village with his fishingrod enter certain houses ask for a drink of water and tell the good man “there would be a horsemarket at newbury next thursday” and so carry the same message on to the next house on his list  he did not know what the message meant at the time nor what was happening which may as well however for clearness’ sake be explained here the prince of orange being gone to ireland where the king was ready to meet him with a great army it was determined that a great rising of his majesty’s party should take place in this country and my lord was to head the force in our county of late he had taken a greater lead in affairs than before having the indefatigable mr holt at his elbow and my lady viscountess strongly urging him on and my lord sark being in the tower a prisoner and sir wilmot crawley of queen’s crawley having gone over to the prince of orange’s side—my lord became the most considerable person in our part of the county for the affairs of the king  it was arranged that the regiment of scots greys and dragoons then quartered at newbury should declare for the king on a certain day when likewise the gentry affected to his majesty’s cause were to come in with their tenants and adherents to newbury march upon the dutch troops at reading under ginckel and these overthrown and their indomitable little master away in ireland ’twas thought that our side might move on london itself and a confident victory was predicted for the king  as these great matters were in agitation my lord lost his listless manner and seemed to gain health my lady did not scold him mr holt came to and fro busy always and little harry longed to have been a few inches taller that he might draw a sword in this good cause  one day it must have been about the month of july 1690 my lord in a great horseman’s coat under which harry could see the shining of a steel breastplate he had on called little harry to him put the hair off the child’s forehead and kissed him and bade god bless him in such an affectionate way as he never had used before father holt blessed him too and then they took leave of my lady viscountess who came from her apartment with a pockethandkerchief to her eyes and her gentlewoman and mrs tusher supporting her  “you are going to—to ride” says she “oh that i might come too—but in my situation i am forbidden horse exercise”  “we kiss my lady marchioness’s hand” says mr holt  “my lord god speed you” she said stepping up and embracing my lord in a grand manner “mr holt i ask your blessing” and she knelt down for that whilst mrs tusher tossed her head up  mr holt gave the same benediction to the little page who went down and held my lord’s stirrups for him to mount there were two servants waiting there too—and they rode out of castlewood gate  as they crossed the bridge harry could see an officer in scarlet ride up touching his hat and address my lord  the party stopped and came to some parley or discussion which presently ended my lord putting his horse into a canter after taking off his hat and making a bow to the officer who rode alongside him step for step the trooper accompanying him falling back and riding with my lord’s two men they cantered over the green and behind the elms my lord waving his hand harry thought and so they disappeared  that evening we had a great panic the cowboy coming at milkingtime riding one of our horses which he had found grazing at the outer park wall  all night my lady viscountess was in a very quiet and subdued mood she scarce found fault with anybody she played at cards for six hours little page esmond went to sleep he prayed for my lord and the good cause before closing his eyes  it was quite in the grey of the morning when the porter’s bell rang and old lockwood waking up let in one of my lord’s servants who had gone with him in the morning and who returned with a melancholy story  the officer who rode up to my lord had it appeared said to him that it was his duty to inform his lordship that he was not under arrest but under surveillance and to request him not to ride abroad that day  my lord replied that riding was good for his health that if the captain chose to accompany him he was welcome and it was then that he made a bow and they cantered away together  when he came on to wansey down my lord all of a sudden pulled up and the party came to a halt at the crossway  “sir” says he to the officer “we are four to two will you be so kind as to take that road and leave me to go mine”  “your road is mine my lord” says the officer  “then” says my lord but he had no time to say more for the officer drawing a pistol snapped it at his lordship as at the same moment father holt drawing a pistol shot the officer through the head  it was done and the man dead in an instant of time the orderly gazing at the officer looked scared for a moment and galloped away for his life  “fire fire” cries out father holt sending another shot after the trooper but the two servants were too much surprised to use their pieces and my lord calling to them to hold their hands the fellow got away  “mr holt qui pensoit à tout” says blaise “gets off his horse examines the pockets of the dead officer for papers gives his money to us two and says ‘the wine is drawn monsieur le marquis’—why did he say marquis to monsieur le vicomte—‘we must drink it’  “the poor gentleman’s horse was a better one than that i rode” blaise continues “mr holt bids me get on him and so i gave a cut to whitefoot and she trotted home we rode on towards newbury we heard firing towards midday at two o’clock a horseman comes up to us as we were giving our cattle water at an inn—and says all is done the ecossois declared an hour too soon—general ginckel was down upon them the whole thing was at an end  “ ‘and we’ve shot an officer on duty and let his orderly escape’ says my lord  “ ‘blaise’ says mr holt writing two lines on his tablebook one for my lady and one for you master harry ‘you must go back to castlewood and deliver these’ and behold me”  and he gave harry the two papers he read that to himself which only said “burn the papers in the cupboard burn this you know nothing about anything” harry read this ran upstairs to his mistress’s apartment where her gentlewoman slept near to the door made her bring a light and wake my lady into whose hands he gave the paper she was a wonderful object to look at in her night attire nor had harry ever seen the like  as soon as she had the paper in her hand harry stepped back to the chaplain’s room opened the secret cupboard over the fireplace burned all the papers in it and as he had seen the priest do before took down one of his reverence’s manuscript sermons and half burnt that in the brazier by the time the papers were quite destroyed it was daylight harry ran back to his mistress again her gentlewoman ushered him again into her ladyship’s chamber she told him from behind her nuptial curtains to bid the coach be got ready and that she would ride away anon  but the mysteries of her ladyship’s toilet were as awfully long on this day as on any other and long after the coach was ready my lady was still attiring herself and just as the viscountess stepped forth from her room ready for departure young job lockwood comes running up from the village with news that a lawyer three officers and twenty or fourandtwenty soldiers were marching thence upon the house job had but two minutes the start of them and ere he had well told his story the troop rode into our courtyard    chapter vi the issue of the plots—the death of thomas third viscount of castlewood and the imprisonment of his viscountess   at first my lady was for dying like mary queen of scots to whom she fancied she bore a resemblance in beauty and stroking her scraggy neck said “they will find isabel of castlewood is equal to her fate” her gentlewoman victoire persuaded her that her prudent course was as she could not fly to receive the troops as though she suspected nothing and that her chamber was the best place wherein to await them so her black japan casket which harry was to carry to the coach was taken back to her ladyship’s chamber whither the maid and mistress retired victoire came out presently bidding the page to say her ladyship was ill confined to her bed with the rheumatism  by this time the soldiers had reached castlewood harry esmond saw them from the window of the tapestry parlour a couple of sentinels were posted at the gate—a halfdozen more walked towards the stable and some others preceded by their commander and a man in black a lawyer probably were conducted by one of the servants to the stair leading up to the part of the house which my lord and lady inhabited  so the captain a handsome kind man and the lawyer came through the anteroom to the tapestry parlour and where now was nobody but young harry esmond the page  “tell your mistress little man” says the captain kindly “that we must speak to her”  “my mistress is ill abed” said the page  “what complaint has she” asked the captain  the boy said “the rheumatism”  “rheumatism that’s a sad complaint” continues the goodnatured captain “and the coach is in the yard to fetch the doctor i suppose”  “i don’t know” says the boy  “and how long has her ladyship been ill”  “i don’t know” says the boy  “when did my lord go away”  “yesterday night”  “with father holt”  “with mr holt”  “and which way did they travel” asks the lawyer  “they travelled without me” says the page  “we must see lady castlewood”  “i have orders that nobody goes in to her ladyship—she is sick” says the page but at this moment victoire came out “hush” says she and as if not knowing that any one was near “what’s this noise” says she “is this gentleman the doctor”  “stuff we must see lady castlewood” says the lawyer pushing by  the curtains of her ladyship’s room were down and the chamber dark and she was in bed with a nightcap on her head and propped up by her pillows looking none the less ghastly because of the red which was still on her cheeks and which she could not afford to forgo  “is that the doctor” she said  “there is no use with this deception madam” captain westbury said for so he was named “my duty is to arrest the person of thomas viscount castlewood a nonjuring peer—of robert tusher vicar of castlewood—and henry holt known under various other names and designations a jesuit priest who officiated as chaplain here in the late king’s time and is now at the head of the conspiracy which was about to break out in this country against the authority of their majesties king william and queen mary—and my orders are to search the house for such papers or traces of the conspiracy as may be found here your ladyship will please to give me your keys and it will be as well for yourself that you should help us in every way in our search”  “you see sir that i have the rheumatism and cannot move” said the lady looking uncommonly ghastly as she sat up in her bed where however she had had her cheeks painted and a new cap put on so that she might at least look her best when the officers came  “i shall take leave to place a sentinel in the chamber so that your ladyship in case you should wish to rise may have an arm to lean on” captain westbury said “your woman will show me where i am to look” and madame victoire chattering in her halffrench and halfenglish jargon opened while the captain examined one drawer after another but as harry esmond thought rather carelessly with a smile on his face as if he was only conducting the examination for form’s sake  before one of the cupboards victoire flung herself down stretching out her arms and with a piercing shriek cried “non jamais monsieur l’officier jamais i will rather die than let you see this wardrobe”  but captain westbury would open it still with a smile on his face which when the box was opened turned into a fair burst of laughter it contained—not papers regarding the conspiracy—but my lady’s wigs washes and rougepots and victoire said men were monsters as the captain went on with his perquisition he tapped the back to see whether or no it was hollow and as he thrust his hands into the cupboard my lady from her bed called out with a voice that did not sound like that of a very sick woman “is it your commission to insult ladies as well as to arrest gentlemen captain”  “these articles are only dangerous when worn by your ladyship” the captain said with a low bow and a mock grin of politeness “i have found nothing which concerns the government as yet—only the weapons with which beauty is authorized to kill” says he pointing to a wig with his swordtip “we must now proceed to search the rest of the house”  “you are not going to leave that wretch in the room with me” cried my lady pointing to the soldier  “what can i do madam somebody you must have to smooth your pillow and bring your medicine—permit me——”  “sir” screamed out my lady—  “madam if you are too ill to leave the bed” the captain then said rather sternly “i must have in four of my men to lift you off in the sheet i must examine this bed in a word papers may be hidden in a bed as elsewhere we know that very well and——”  here it was her ladyship’s turn to shriek for the captain with his fist shaking the pillows and bolsters at last came to “burn” as they say in the play of forfeits and wrenching away one of the pillows said “look did not i tell you so here is a pillow stuffed with paper”  “some villain has betrayed us” cried out my lady sitting up in the bed showing herself full dressed under her nightrail  “and now your ladyship can move i am sure permit me to give you my hand to rise you will have to travel for some distance as far as hexton castle tonight will you have your coach your woman shall attend you if you like—and the japanbox”  “sir you don’t strike a man when he is down” said my lady with some dignity “can you not spare a woman”  “your ladyship must please to rise and let me search the bed” said the captain “there is no more time to lose in bandying talk”  and without more ado the gaunt old woman got up harry esmond recollected to the end of his life that figure with the brocade dress and the white nightrail and the goldclocked red stockings and white redheeled shoes sitting up in the bed and stepping down from it the trunks were ready packed for departure in her anteroom and the horses ready harnessed in the stable about all which the captain seemed to know by information got from some quarter or other and whence esmond could make a pretty shrewd guess in aftertimes when dr tusher complained that king william’s government had basely treated him for services done in that cause  and here he may relate though he was then too young to know all that was happening what the papers contained of which captain westbury had made a seizure and which papers had been transferred from the japanbox to the bed when the officers arrived  there was a list of gentlemen of the county in father holt’s handwriting—mr freeman’s king james’s friends—a similar paper being found among those of sir john fenwick and mr coplestone who suffered death for this conspiracy  there was a patent conferring the title of marquis of esmond on my lord castlewood and the heirs male of his body his appointment as lord lieutenant of the county and majorgeneral7  there were various letters from the nobility and gentry some ardent and some doubtful in the king’s service and very luckily for him two letters concerning colonel francis esmond one from father holt which said “i have been to see this colonel at his house at walcote near to wells where he resides since the king’s departure and pressed him very eagerly in mr freeman’s cause showing him the great advantage he would have by trading with that merchant offering him large premiums there as agreed between us but he says no he considers mr freeman the head of the firm will never trade against him or embark with any other trading company but considers his duty was done when mr freeman left england this colonel seems to care more for his wife and his beagles than for affairs he asked me much about young h e ‘that bastard’ as he called him doubting my lord’s intentions respecting him i reassured him on this head stating what i knew of the lad and our intentions respecting him but with regard to freeman he was inflexible”  and another letter was from colonel esmond to his kinsman to say that one captain holton had been with him offering him large bribes to join you know who and saying that the head of the house of castlewood was deeply engaged in that quarter but for his part he had broke his sword when the k left the country and would never again fight in that quarrel the p of o was a man at least of a noble courage and his duty and as he thought every englishman’s was to keep the country quiet and the french out of it and in fine that he would have nothing to do with the scheme  of the existence of these two letters and the contents of the pillow colonel frank esmond who became viscount castlewood told henry esmond afterwards when the letters were shown to his lordship who congratulated himself as he had good reason that he had not joined in the scheme which proved so fatal to many concerned in it but naturally the lad knew little about these circumstances when they happened under his eyes only being aware that his patron and his mistress were in some trouble which had caused the flight of the one and the apprehension of the other by the officers of king william  the seizure of the papers effected the gentlemen did not pursue their further search through castlewood house very rigorously they examined mr holt’s room being led thither by his pupil who showed as the father had bidden him the place where the key of his chamber lay opened the door for the gentlemen and conducted them into the room  when the gentlemen came to the halfburned papers in the brazier they examined them eagerly enough and their young guide was a little amused at their perplexity  “what are these” says one  “they’re written in a foreign language” says the lawyer “what are you laughing at little whelp” adds he turning round as he saw the boy smile  “mr holt said they were sermons” harry said “and bade me to burn them” which indeed was true of those papers  “sermons indeed—it’s treason i would lay a wager” cries the lawyer  “egad it’s greek to me” says captain westbury “can you read it little boy”  “yes sir a little” harry said  “then read and read in english sir on your peril” said the lawyer and harry began to translate—  “hath not one of your own writers said ‘the children of adam are now labouring as much as he himself ever did about the tree of the knowledge of good and evil shaking the boughs thereof and seeking the fruit being for the most part unmindful of the tree of life’ o blind generation ’tis this tree of knowledge to which the serpent has led you”—and here the boy was obliged to stop the rest of the page being charred by the fire and asked of the lawyer—“shall i go on sir”  the lawyer said—“this boy is deeper than he seems who knows that he is not laughing at us”  “let’s have in dick the scholar” cried captain westbury laughing and he called to a trooper out of the window—“ho dick come in here and construe”  a thickset soldier with a square goodhumoured face came in at the summons saluting his officer  “tell us what is this dick” says the lawyer  “my name is steele sir” says the soldier “i may be dick for my friends but i don’t name gentlemen of your cloth amongst them”  “well then steele”  “mr steele sir if you please when you address a gentleman of his majesty’s horse guards be pleased not to be so familiar”  “i didn’t know sir” said the lawyer  “how should you i take it you are not accustomed to meet with gentlemen” says the trooper  “hold thy prate and read that bit of paper” says westbury  “’tis latin” says dick glancing at it and again saluting his officer “and from a sermon of mr cudworth’s” and he translated the words pretty much as henry esmond had rendered them  “what a young scholar you are” says the captain to the boy  “depend on’t he knows more than he tells” says the lawyer “i think we will pack him off in the coach with old jezebel”  “for construing a bit of latin” said the captain very goodnaturedly  “i would as lief go there as anywhere” harry esmond said simply “for there is nobody to care for me”  there must have been something touching in the child’s voice or in this description of his solitude—for the captain looked at him very goodnaturedly and the trooper called steele put his hand kindly on the lad’s head and said some words in the latin tongue  “what does he say” says the lawyer  “faith ask dick himself” cried captain westbury  “i said i was not ignorant of misfortune myself and had learned to succour the miserable and that’s not your trade mr sheepskin” said the trooper  “you had better leave dick the scholar alone mr corbet” the captain said and harry esmond always touched by a kind face and kind word felt very grateful to this goodnatured champion  the horses were by this time harnessed to the coach and the countess and victoire came down and were put into the vehicle this woman who quarrelled with harry esmond all day was melted at parting with him and called him “dear angel” and “poor infant” and a hundred other names  the viscountess giving him her lean hand to kiss bade him always be faithful to the house of esmond “if evil should happen to my lord” says she “his successor i trust will be found and give you protection situated as i am they will not dare wreak their vengeance on me now” and she kissed a medal she wore with great fervour and henry esmond knew not in the least what her meaning was but hath since learned that old as she was she was for ever expecting by the good offices of saints and relics to have an heir to the title of esmond  harry esmond was too young to have been introduced into the secrets of politics in which his patrons were implicated for they put but few questions to the boy who was little of stature and looked much younger than his age and such questions as they put he answered cautiously enough and professing even more ignorance than he had for which his examiners willingly enough gave him credit he did not say a word about the window or the cupboard over the fireplace and these secrets quite escaped the eyes of the searchers  so then my lady was consigned to her coach and sent off to hexton with her woman and the man of law to bear her company a couple of troopers riding on either side of the coach and harry was left behind at the hall belonging as it were to nobody and quite alone in the world the captain and a guard of men remained in possession there and the soldiers who were very goodnatured and kind ate my lord’s mutton and drank his wine and made themselves comfortable as they well might do in such pleasant quarters  the captains had their dinner served in my lord’s tapestry parlour and poor little harry thought his duty was to wait upon captain westbury’s chair as his custom had been to serve his lord when he sat there  after the departure of the countess dick the scholar took harry esmond under his special protection and would examine him in his humanities and talk to him both of french and latin in which tongues the lad found and his new friend was willing enough to acknowledge that he was even more proficient than scholar dick hearing that he had learned them from a jesuit in the praise of whom and whose goodness harry was never tired of speaking dick rather to the boy’s surprise who began to have an early shrewdness like many children bred up alone showed a great deal of theological science and knowledge of the points at issue between the two churches so that he and harry would have hours of controversy together in which the boy was certainly worsted by the arguments of this singular trooper “i am no common soldier” dick would say and indeed it was easy to see by his learning breeding and many accomplishments that he was not “i am of one of the most ancient families in the empire i have had my education at a famous school and a famous university i learned my first rudiments of latin near to smithfield in london where the martyrs were roasted”  “you hanged as many of ours” interposed harry “and for the matter of persecution father holt told me that a young gentleman of edinburgh eighteen years of age student at the college there was hanged for heresy only last year though he recanted and solemnly asked pardon for his errors”  “faith there has been too much persecution on both sides but ’twas you taught us”  “nay ’twas the pagans began it” cried the lad and began to instance a number of saints of the church from the protomartyr downwards—“this one’s fire went out under him that one’s oil cooled in the cauldron at a third holy head the executioner chopped three times and it would not come off show us martyrs in your church for whom such miracles have been done”  “nay” says the trooper gravely “the miracles of the first three centuries belong to my church as well as yours master papist” and then added with something of a smile upon his countenance and a queer look at harry—“and yet my little catechizer i have sometimes thought about those miracles that there was not much good in them since the victim’s head always finished by coming off at the third or fourth chop and the cauldron if it did not boil one day boiled the next howbeit in our times the church has lost that questionable advantage of respites there never was a shower to put out ridley’s fire nor an angel to turn the edge of campion’s axe the rack tore the limbs of southwell the jesuit and sympson the protestant alike for faith everywhere multitudes die willingly enough i have read in monsieur rycaut’s history of the turks of thousands of mahomet’s followers rushing upon death in battle as upon certain paradise and in the great mogul’s dominions people fling themselves by hundreds under the cars of the idols annually and the widows burn themselves on their husbands’ bodies as ’tis well known ’tis not the dying for a faith that’s so hard master harry—every man of every nation has done that—’tis the living up to it that is difficult as i know to my cost” he added with a sigh “and ah” he added “my poor lad i am not strong enough to convince thee by my life—though to die for my religion would give me the greatest of joys—but i had a dear friend in magdalen college in oxford i wish joe addison were here to convince thee as he quickly could—for i think he’s a match for the whole college of jesuits and what’s more in his life too in that very sermon of dr cudworth’s which your priest was quoting from and which suffered martyrdom in the brazier” dick added with a smile “i had a thought of wearing the black coat but was ashamed of my life you see and took to this sorry red one—i have often thought of joe addison—doctor cudworth says ‘a good conscience is the best lookingglass of heaven’—and there’s a serenity in my friend’s face which always reflects it—i wish you could see him harry”  “did he do you a great deal of good” asked the lad simply  “he might have done” said the other—“at least he taught me to see and approve better things ’tis my own fault deteriora sequi”  “you seem very good” the boy said  “i’m not what i seem alas” answered the trooper—and indeed as it turned out poor dick told the truth—for that very night at supper in the hall where the gentlemen of the troop took their repasts and passed most part of their days dicing and smoking of tobacco and singing and cursing over the castlewood ale—harry esmond found dick the scholar in a woful state of drunkenness he hiccuped out a sermon and his laughing companions bade him sing a hymn on which dick swearing he would run the scoundrel through the body who insulted his religion made for his sword which was hanging on the wall and fell down flat on the floor under it saying to harry who ran forward to help him “ah little papist i wish joseph addison was here”  though the troopers of the king’s life guards were all gentlemen yet the rest of the gentlemen seemed ignorant and vulgar boors to harry esmond with the exception of this goodnatured corporal steele the scholar and captain westbury and lieutenant trant who were always kind to the lad they remained for some weeks or months encamped in castlewood and harry learned from them from time to time how the lady at hexton castle was treated and the particulars of her confinement there ’tis known that king william was disposed to deal very leniently with the gentry who remained faithful to the old king’s cause and no prince usurping a crown as his enemies said he did righteously taking it as i think now ever caused less blood to be shed as for womenconspirators he kept spies on the least dangerous and locked up the others lady castlewood had the best rooms in hexton castle and the gaoler’s garden to walk in and though she repeatedly desired to be led out to execution like mary queen of scots there never was any thought of taking her painted old head off or any desire to do aught but keep her person in security  and it appeared she found that some were friends in her misfortune whom she had in her prosperity considered as her worst enemies colonel francis esmond my lord’s cousin and her ladyship’s who had married the dean of winchester’s daughter and since king james’s departure out of england had lived not very far away from hexton town hearing of his kinswoman’s strait and being friends with colonel brice commanding for king william in hexton and with the church dignitaries there came to visit her ladyship in prison offering to his uncle’s daughter any friendly services which lay in his power and he brought his lady and little daughter to see the prisoner to the latter of whom a child of great beauty and many winning ways the old viscountess took not a little liking although between her ladyship and the child’s mother there was little more love than formerly there are some injuries which women never forgive one another and madam francis esmond in marrying her cousin had done one of those irretrievable wrongs to lady castlewood but as she was now humiliated and in misfortune madam francis could allow a truce to her enmity and could be kind for a while at least to her husband’s discarded mistress so the little beatrix her daughter was permitted often to go and visit the imprisoned viscountess who in so far as the child and its father were concerned got to abate in her anger towards that branch of the castlewood family and the letters of colonel esmond coming to light as has been said and his conduct being known to the king’s council the colonel was put in a better position with the existing government than he had ever before been any suspicions regarding his loyalty were entirely done away and so he was enabled to be of more service to his kinswoman than he could otherwise have been  and now there befell an event by which this lady recovered her liberty and the house of castlewood got a new owner and fatherless little harry esmond a new and most kind protector and friend whatever that secret was which harry was to hear from my lord the boy never heard it for that night when father holt arrived and carried my lord away with him was the last on which harry ever saw his patron what happened to my lord may be briefly told here having found the horses at the place where they were lying my lord and father holt rode together to chatteris where they had temporary refuge with one of the father’s penitents in that city but the pursuit being hot for them and the reward for the apprehension of one or the other considerable it was deemed advisable that they should separate and the priest betook himself to other places of retreat known to him whilst my lord passed over from bristol into ireland in which kingdom king james had a court and an army my lord was but a small addition to this bringing indeed only his sword and the few pieces in his pocket but the king received him with some kindness and distinction in spite of his poor plight confirmed him in his new title of marquis gave him a regiment and promised him further promotion but titles or promotion were not to benefit him now my lord was wounded at the fatal battle of the boyne flying from which field long after his master had set him an example he lay for a while concealed in the marshy country near to the town of trim and more from catarrh and fever caught in the bogs than from the steel of the enemy in the battle sank and died may the earth lie light upon thomas of castlewood he who writes this must speak in charity though this lord did him and his two grievous wrongs for one of these he would have made amends perhaps had life been spared him but the other lay beyond his power to repair though ’tis to be hoped that a greater power than a priest has absolved him of it he got the comfort of this absolution too such as it was a priest of trim writing a letter to my lady to inform her of this calamity  but in those days letters were slow of travelling and our priest’s took two months or more on its journey from ireland to england where when it did arrive it did not find my lady at her own house she was at the king’s house of hexton castle when the letter came to castlewood but it was opened for all that by the officer in command there  harry esmond well remembered the receipt of this letter which lockwood brought in as captain westbury and lieutenant trant were on the green playing at bowls young esmond looking on at the sport or reading his book in the arbour  “here’s news for frank esmond” says captain westbury “harry did you ever see colonel esmond” and captain westbury looked very hard at the boy as he spoke  harry said he had seen him but once when he was at hexton at the ball there  “and did he say anything”  “he said what i don’t care to repeat” harry answered for he was now twelve years of age he knew what his birth was and the disgrace of it and he felt no love towards the man who had most likely stained his mother’s honour and his own  “did you love my lord castlewood”  “i wait until i know my mother sir to say” the boy answered his eyes filling with tears  “something has happened to lord castlewood” captain westbury said in a vary grave tone—“something which must happen to us all he is dead of a wound received at the boyne fighting for king james”  “i am glad my lord fought for the right cause” the boy said  “it was better to meet death on the field like a man than face it on tower hill as some of them may” continued mr westbury “i hope he has made some testament or provided for thee somehow this letter says he recommends unicum filium suum dilectissimum to his lady i hope he has left you more than that”  harry did not know he said he was in the hands of heaven and fate but more lonely now as it seemed to him than he had been all the rest of his life and that night as he lay in his little room which he still occupied the boy thought with many a pang of shame and grief of his strange and solitary condition—how he had a father and no father a nameless mother that had been brought to ruin perhaps by that very father whom harry could only acknowledge in secret and with a blush and whom he could neither love nor revere and he sickened to think how father holt a stranger and two or three soldiers his acquaintances of the last six weeks were the only friends he had in the great wide world where he was now quite alone the soul of the boy was full of love and he longed as he lay in the darkness there for some one upon whom he could bestow it he remembers and must to his dying day the thoughts and tears of that long night the hours tolling through it who was he and what why here rather than elsewhere i have a mind he thought to go to that priest at trim and find out what my father said to him on his deathbed confession is there any child in the whole world so unprotected as i am shall i get up and quit this place and run to ireland with these thoughts and tears the lad passed that night away until he wept himself to sleep  the next day the gentlemen of the guard who had heard what had befallen him were more than usually kind to the child especially his friend scholar dick who told him about his own father’s death which had happened when dick was a child at dublin not quite five years of age “that was the first sensation of grief” dick said “i ever knew i remember i went into the room where his body lay and my mother sat weeping beside it i had my battledore in my hand and fell abeating the coffin and calling papa on which my mother caught me in her arms and told me in a flood of tears papa could not hear me and would play with me no more for they were going to put him under ground whence he could never come to us again and this” said dick kindly “has made me pity all children ever since and caused me to love thee my poor fatherless motherless lad and if ever thou wantest a friend thou shalt have one in richard steele”  harry esmond thanked him and was grateful but what could corporal steele do for him take him to ride a spare horse and be servant to the troop though there might be a bar in harry esmond’s shield it was a noble one the counsel of the two friends was that little harry should stay where he was and abide his fortune so esmond stayed on at castlewood awaiting with no small anxiety the fate whatever it was which was over him    chapter vii i am left at castlewood an orphan and find most kind protectors there   during the stay of the soldiers in castlewood honest dick the scholar was the constant companion of the lonely little orphan lad harry esmond and they read together and they played bowls together and when the other troopers or their officers who were freespoken over their cups as was the way of that day when neither men nor women were overnice talked unbecomingly of their amours and gallantries before the child dick who very likely was setting the whole company laughing would stop their jokes with a maxima debetur pueris reverentia and once offered to lug out against another trooper called hulking tom who wanted to ask harry esmond a ribald question  also dick seeing that the child had as he said a sensibility above his years and a great and praiseworthy discretion confided to harry his love for a vintner’s daughter near to the tollyard westminster whom dick addressed as saccharissa in many verses of his composition and without whom he said it would be impossible that he could continue to live he vowed this a thousand times in a day though harry smiled to see the lovelorn swain had his health and appetite as well as the most heartwhole trooper in the regiment and he swore harry to secrecy too which vow the lad religiously kept until he found that officers and privates were all taken into dick’s confidence and had the benefit of his verses and it must be owned likewise that while dick was sighing after saccharissa in london he had consolations in the country for there came a wench out of castlewood village who had washed his linen and who cried sadly when she heard he was gone and without paying her bill too which harry esmond took upon himself to discharge by giving the girl a silver pocketpiece which scholar dick had presented to him when with many embraces and prayers for his prosperity dick parted from him the garrison of castlewood being ordered away dick the scholar said he would never forget his young friend nor indeed did he and harry was sorry when the kind soldiers vacated castlewood looking forward with no small anxiety for care and solitude had made him thoughtful beyond his years to his fate when the new lord and lady of the house came to live there he had lived to be past twelve years old now and had never had a friend save this wild trooper perhaps and father holt and had a fond and affectionate heart tender to weakness that would fain attach itself to somebody and did not seem at rest until it had found a friend who would take charge of it  the instinct which led henry esmond to admire and love the gracious person the fair apparition of whose beauty and kindness had so moved him when he first beheld her became soon a devoted affection and passion of gratitude which entirely filled his young heart that as yet except in the case of dear father holt had had very little kindness for which to be thankful o dea certè thought he remembering the lines out of the aeneis which mr holt had taught him there seemed as the boy thought in every look or gesture of this fair creature an angelical softness and bright pity—in motion or repose she seemed gracious alike the tone of her voice though she uttered words ever so trivial gave him a pleasure that amounted almost to anguish it cannot be called love that a lad of twelve years of age little more than a menial felt for an exalted lady his mistress but it was worship to catch her glance to divine her errand and run on it before she had spoken it to watch to follow adore her became the business of his life meanwhile as is the way often his idol had idols of her own and never thought of or suspected the admiration of her little pigmy adorer  my lady had on her side her three idols first and foremost jove and supreme ruler was her lord harry’s patron the good viscount of castlewood all wishes of his were laws with her if he had a headache she was ill if he frowned she trembled if he joked she smiled and was charmed if he went ahunting she was always at the window to see him ride away her little son crowing on her arm or on the watch till his return she made dishes for his dinner spiced his wine for him made the toast for his tankard at breakfast hushed the house when he slept in his chair and watched for a look when he woke if my lord was not a little proud of his beauty my lady adored it she clung to his arm as he paced the terrace her two fair little hands clasped round his great one her eyes were never tired of looking in his face and wondering at its perfection her little son was his son and had his father’s look and curly brown hair her daughter beatrix was his daughter and had his eyes—were there ever such beautiful eyes in the world all the house was arranged so as to bring him ease and give him pleasure she liked the small gentry round about to come and pay him court never caring for admiration for herself those who wanted to be well with the lady must admire him not regarding her dress she would wear a gown to rags because he had once liked it and if he brought her a brooch or a ribbon would prefer it to all the most costly articles of her wardrobe  my lord went to london every year for six weeks and the family being too poor to appear at court with any figure he went alone it was not until he was out of sight that her face showed any sorrow and what a joy when he came back what preparation before his return the fond creature had his armchair at the chimneyside—delighting to put the children in it and look at them there nobody took his place at the table but his silver tankard stood there as when my lord was present  a pretty sight it was to see during my lord’s absence or on those many mornings when sleep or headache kept him abed this fair young lady of castlewood her little daughter at her knee and her domestics gathered round her reading the morning prayer of the english church esmond long remembered how she looked and spoke kneeling reverently before the sacred book the sun shining upon her golden hair until it made a halo round about her a dozen of the servants of the house kneeled in a line opposite their mistress for awhile harry esmond kept apart from these mysteries but doctor tusher showing him that the prayers read were those of the church of all ages and the boy’s own inclination prompting him to be always as near as he might to his mistress and to think all things she did right from listening to the prayers in the antechamber he came presently to kneel down with the rest of the household in the parlour and before a couple of years my lady had made a thorough convert indeed the boy loved his catechizer so much that he would have subscribed to anything she bade him and was never tired of listening to her fond discourse and simple comments upon the book which she read to him in a voice of which it was difficult to resist the sweet persuasion and tender appealing kindness this friendly controversy and the intimacy which it occasioned bound the lad more fondly than ever to his mistress the happiest period of all his life was this and the young mother with her daughter and son and the orphan lad whom she protected read and worked and played and were children together if the lady looked forward—as what fond woman does not—towards the future she had no plans from which harry esmond was left out and a thousand and a thousand times in his passionate and impetuous way he vowed that no power should separate him from his mistress and only asked for some chance to happen by which he might show his fidelity to her now at the close of his life as he sits and recalls in tranquillity the happy and busy scenes of it he can think not ungratefully that he has been faithful to that early vow such a life is so simple that years may be chronicled in a few lines but few men’s lifevoyages are destined to be all prosperous and this calm of which we are speaking was soon to come to an end  as esmond grew and observed for himself he found of necessity much to read and think of outside that fond circle of kinsfolk who had admitted him to join hand with them he read more books than they cared to study with him was alone in the midst of them many a time and passed nights over labours futile perhaps but in which they could not join him his dear mistress divined his thoughts with her usual jealous watchfulness of affection began to forebode a time when he would escape from his homenest and at his eager protestations to the contrary would only sigh and shake her head before those fatal decrees in life are executed there are always secret previsions and warning omens when everything yet seems calm we are aware that the storm is coming ere the happy days were over two at least of that homeparty felt that they were drawing to a close and were uneasy and on the lookout for the cloud which was to obscure their calm  ’twas easy for harry to see however much his lady persisted in obedience and admiration for her husband that my lord tired of his quiet life and grew weary and then testy at those gentle bonds with which his wife would have held him as they say the grand lama of thibet is very much fatigued by his character of divinity and yawns on his altar as his bonzes kneel and worship him many a homegod grows heartily sick of the reverence with which his family devotees pursue him and sighs for freedom and for his old life and to be off the pedestal on which his dependants would have him sit for ever whilst they adore him and ply him with flowers and hymns and incense and flattery—so after a few years of his marriage my honest lord castlewood began to tire all the highflown raptures and devotional ceremonies with which his wife his chief priestess treated him first sent him to sleep and then drove him out of doors for the truth must be told that my lord was a jolly gentleman with very little of the august or divine in his nature though his fond wife persisted in revering it—and besides he had to pay a penalty for this love which persons of his disposition seldom like to defray and in a word if he had a loving wife had a very jealous and exacting one then he wearied of this jealousy then he broke away from it then came no doubt complaints and recriminations then perhaps promises of amendment not fulfilled then upbraidings not the more pleasant because they were silent and only sad looks and tearful eyes conveyed them then perhaps the pair reached that other stage which is not uncommon in married life when the woman perceives that the god of the honeymoon is a god no more only a mortal like the rest of us—and so she looks into her heart and lo vacuae sedes et inania arcana and now supposing our lady to have a fine genius and a brilliant wit of her own and the magic spell and infatuation removed from her which had led her to worship as a god a very ordinary mortal—and what follows they live together and they dine together and they say “my dear” and “my love” as heretofore but the man is himself and the woman herself that dream of love is over as everything else is over in life as flowers and fury and griefs and pleasures are over  very likely the lady castlewood had ceased to adore her husband herself long before she got off her knees or would allow her household to discontinue worshipping him to do him justice my lord never exacted this subservience he laughed and joked and drank his bottle and swore when he was angry much too familiarly for any one pretending to sublimity and did his best to destroy the ceremonial with which his wife chose to surround him and it required no great conceit on young esmond’s part to see that his own brains were better than his patron’s who indeed never assumed any airs of superiority over the lad or over any dependant of his save when he was displeased in which case he would express his mind in oaths very freely and who on the contrary perhaps spoiled “parson harry” as he called young esmond by constantly praising his parts and admiring his boyish stock of learning  it may seem ungracious in one who has received a hundred favours from his patron to speak in any but a reverential manner of his elders but the present writer has had descendants of his own whom he has brought up with as little as possible of the servility at present exacted by parents from children under which mask of duty there often lurks indifference contempt or rebellion and as he would have his grandsons believe or represent him to be not an inch taller than nature has made him so with regard to his past acquaintances he would speak without anger but with truth as far as he knows it neither extenuating nor setting down aught in malice  so long then as the world moved according to lord castlewood’s wishes he was goodhumoured enough of a temper naturally sprightly and easy liking to joke especially with his inferiors and charmed to receive the tribute of their laughter all exercises of the body he could perform to perfection—shooting at a mark and flying breaking horses riding at the ring pitching the quoit playing at all games with great skill and not only did he do these things well but he thought he did them to perfection hence he was often tricked about horses which he pretended to know better than any jockey was made to play at ball and billiards by sharpers who took his money and came back from london wofully poorer each time than he went as the state of his affairs testified when the sudden accident came by which his career was brought to an end  he was fond of the parade of dress and passed as many hours daily at his toilette as an elderly coquette a tenth part of his day was spent in the brushing of his teeth and the oiling of his hair which was curling and brown and which he did not like to conceal under a periwig such as almost everybody of that time wore we have the liberty of our hair back now but powder and pomatum along with it when i wonder will these monstrous polltaxes of our age be withdrawn and men allowed to carry their colours black red or grey as nature made them and as he liked her to be well dressed his lady spared no pains in that matter to please him indeed she would dress her head or cut it off if he had bidden her  it was a wonder to young esmond serving as page to my lord and lady to hear day after day to such company as came the same boisterous stories told by my lord at which his lady never failed to smile or hold down her head and doctor tusher to burst out laughing at the proper point or cry “fie my lord remember my cloth” but with such a faint show of resistance that it only provoked my lord further lord castlewood’s stories rose by degrees and became stronger after the ale at dinner and the bottle afterwards my lady always taking flight after the very first glass to church and king and leaving the gentlemen to drink the rest of the toasts by themselves  and as harry esmond was her page he also was called from duty at this time “my lord has lived in the army and with soldiers” she would say to the lad “amongst whom great licence is allowed you have had a different nurture and i trust these things will change as you grow older not that any fault attaches to my lord who is one of the best and most religious men in this kingdom” and very likely she believed so ’tis strange what a man may do and a woman yet think him an angel  and as esmond has taken truth for his motto it must be owned even with regard to that other angel his mistress that she had a fault of character which flawed her perfections with the other sex perfectly tolerant and kindly of her own she was invariably jealous and a proof that she had this vice is that though she would acknowledge a thousand faults that she had not to this which she had she could never be got to own but if there came a woman with even a semblance of beauty to castlewood she was so sure to find out some wrong in her that my lord laughing in his jolly way would often joke with her concerning her foible comely servantmaids might come for hire but none were taken at castlewood the housekeeper was old my lady’s own waitingwoman squinted and was marked with the smallpox the housemaids and scullion were ordinary country wenches to whom lady castlewood was kind as her nature made her to everybody almost but as soon as ever she had to do with a pretty woman she was cold retiring and haughty the country ladies found this fault in her and though the men all admired her their wives and daughters complained of her coldness and airs and said that castlewood was pleasanter in lady jezebel’s time as the dowager was called than at present some few were of my mistress’s side old lady blenkinsop jointure who had been at court in king james the first’s time always took her side and so did old mistress crookshank bishop crookshank’s daughter of hexton who with some more of their like pronounced my lady an angel but the pretty women were not of this mind and the opinion of the country was that my lord was tied to his wife’s apronstrings and that she ruled over him  the second fight which harry esmond had was at fourteen years of age with bryan hawkshaw sir john hawkshaw’s son of bramblebrook who advancing this opinion that my lady was jealous and henpecked my lord put harry into such a fury that harry fell on him and with such rage that the other boy who was two years older and by far bigger than he had by far the worst of the assault until it was interrupted by doctor tusher walking out of the dinner room  bryan hawkshaw got up bleeding at the nose having indeed been surprised as many a stronger man might have been by the fury of the assault upon him  “you little bastard beggar” he said “i’ll murder you for this”  and indeed he was big enough  “bastard or not” said the other grinding his teeth “i have a couple of swords and if you like to meet me as a man on the terrace tonight——”  and here the doctor coming up the colloquy of the young champions ended very likely big as he was hawkshaw did not care to continue a fight with such a ferocious opponent as this had been    chapter viii after good fortune comes evil   since my lady mary wortley montagu brought home the custom of inoculation from turkey a perilous practice many deem it and only a useless rushing into the jaws of danger i think the severity of the smallpox that dreadful scourge of the world has somewhat been abated in our part of it and remembering in my time hundreds of the young and beautiful who have been carried to the grave or have only risen from their pillows frightfully scarred and disfigured by this malady many a sweet face hath left its roses on the bed on which this dreadful and withering blight has laid them in my early days this pestilence would enter a village and destroy half its inhabitants at its approach it may well be imagined not only the beautiful but the strongest were alarmed and those fled who could one day in the year 1694 i have good reason to remember it doctor tusher ran into castlewood house with a face of consternation saying that the malady had made its appearance at the blacksmith’s house in the village and that one of the maids there was down in the smallpox  the blacksmith beside his forge and irons for horses had an alehouse for men which his wife kept and his company sat on benches before the inn door looking at the smithy while they drank their beer now there was a pretty girl at this inn the landlord’s men called nancy sievewright a bouncing freshlooking lass whose face was as red as the hollyhocks over the pales of the garden behind the inn at this time harry esmond was a lad of sixteen and somehow in his walks and rambles it often happened that he fell in with nancy sievewright’s bonny face if he did not want something done at the blacksmith’s he would go and drink ale at the “three castles” or find some pretext for seeing this poor nancy poor thing harry meant or imagined no harm and she no doubt as little but the truth is they were always meeting—in the lanes or by the brook or at the gardenpalings or about castlewood it was “lord mr henry” and “how do you do nancy” many and many a time in the week ’tis surprising the magnetic attraction which draws people together from ever so far i blush as i think of poor nancy now in a red bodice and buxom purple cheeks and a canvas petticoat and that i devised schemes and set traps and made speeches in my heart which i seldom had courage to say when in presence of that humble enchantress who knew nothing beyond milking a cow and opened her black eyes with wonder when i made one of my fine speeches out of waller or ovid poor nancy from the mist of faroff years thine honest country face beams out and i remember thy kind voice as if i had heard it yesterday  when doctor tusher brought the news that the smallpox was at the “three castles” whither a tramper it was said had brought the malady henry esmond’s first thought was of alarm for poor nancy and then of shame and disquiet for the castlewood family lest he might have brought this infection for the truth is that mr harry had been sitting in a back room for an hour that day where nancy sievewright was with a little brother who complained of headache and was lying stupefied and crying either in a chair by the corner of the fire or in nancy’s lap or on mine  little lady beatrix screamed out at dr tusher’s news and my lord cried out “god bless me” he was a brave man and not afraid of death in any shape but this he was very proud of his pink complexion and fair hair—but the idea of death by smallpox scared him beyond all other ends “we will take the children and ride away tomorrow to walcote” this was my lord’s small house inherited from his mother near to winchester  “that is the best refuge in case the disease spreads” said dr tusher “’tis awful to think of it beginning at the alehouse half the people of the village have visited that today or the blacksmith’s which is the same thing my clerk simons lodges with them—i can never go into my readingdesk and have that fellow so near me i won’t have that man near me”  “if a parishioner dying in the smallpox sent to you would you not go” asked my lady looking up from her frame of work with her calm blue eyes  “by the lord i wouldn’t” said my lord  “we are not in a popish country and a sick man doth not absolutely need absolution and confession” said the doctor “’tis true they are a comfort and a help to him when attainable and to be administered with hope of good but in a case where the life of a parish priest in the midst of his flock is highly valuable to them he is not called upon to risk it and therewith the lives future prospects and temporal even spiritual welfare of his own family for the sake of a single person who is not very likely in a condition even to understand the religious message whereof the priest is the bringer—being uneducated and likewise stupefied or delirious by disease if your ladyship or his lordship my excellent good friend and patron were to take it——”  “god forbid” cried my lord  “amen” continued dr tusher “amen to that prayer my very good lord for your sake i would lay my life down”—and to judge from the alarmed look of the doctor’s purple face you would have thought that that sacrifice was about to be called for instantly  to love children and be gentle with them was an instinct rather than a merit in henry esmond so much so that he thought almost with a sort of shame of his liking for them and of the softness into which it betrayed him and on this day the poor fellow had not only had his young friend the milkmaid’s brother on his knee but had been drawing pictures and telling stories to the little frank esmond who had occupied the same place for an hour after dinner and was never tired of henry’s tales and his pictures of soldiers and horses as luck would have it beatrix had not on that evening taken her usual place which generally she was glad enough to have upon her tutor’s lap for beatrix from the earliest time was jealous of every caress which was given to her little brother frank she would fling away even from the maternal arms if she saw frank had been there before her insomuch that lady castlewood was obliged not to show her love for her son in the presence of the little girl and embrace one or the other alone she would turn pale and red with rage if she caught signs of intelligence or affection between frank and his mother would sit apart and not speak for a whole night if she thought the boy had a better fruit or a larger cake than hers would fling away a ribbon if he had one and from the earliest age sitting up in her little chair by the great fireplace opposite to the corner where lady castlewood commonly sat at her embroidery would utter infantine sarcasms about the favour shown to her brother these if spoken in the presence of lord castlewood tickled and amused his humour he would pretend to love frank best and dandle and kiss him and roar with laughter at beatrix’s jealousy but the truth is my lord did not often witness these scenes nor very much trouble the quiet fireside at which his lady passed many long evenings my lord was hunting all day when the season admitted he frequented all the cockfights and fairs in the country and would ride twenty miles to see a main fought or two clowns break their heads at a cudgelling match and he liked better to sit in his parlour drinking ale and punch with jack and tom than in his wife’s drawingroom whither if he came he brought only too often bloodshot eyes a hiccuping voice and a reeling gait the management of the house and the property the care of the few tenants and the village poor and the accounts of the estate were in the hands of his lady and her young secretary harry esmond my lord took charge of the stables the kennel and the cellar—and he filled this and emptied it too  so it chanced that upon this very day when poor harry esmond had had the blacksmith’s son and the peer’s son alike upon his knee little beatrix who would come to her tutor willingly enough with her book and her writing had refused him seeing the place occupied by her brother and luckily for her had sat at the further end of the room away from him playing with a spaniel dog which she had and for which by fits and starts she would take a great affection and talking at harry esmond over her shoulder as she pretended to caress the dog saying that fido would love her and she would love fido and nothing but fido all her life  when then the news was brought that the little boy at the “three castles” was ill with the smallpox poor harry esmond felt a shock of alarm not so much for himself as for his mistress’s son whom he might have brought into peril beatrix who had pouted sufficiently and who whenever a stranger appeared began from infancy almost to play off little graces to catch his attention her brother being now gone to bed was for taking her place upon esmond’s knee for though the doctor was very obsequious to her she did not like him because he had thick boots and dirty hands the pert young miss said and because she hated learning the catechism  but as she advanced towards esmond from the corner where she had been sulking he started back and placed the great chair on which he was sitting between him and her—saying in the french language to lady castlewood with whom the young lad had read much and whom he had perfected in this tongue—“madam the child must not approach me i must tell you that i was at the blacksmith’s today and had his little boy upon my lap”  “where you took my son afterwards” lady castlewood said very angry and turning red “i thank you sir for giving him such company beatrix” she said in english “i forbid you to touch mr esmond come away child—come to your room come to your room—i wish your reverence good night—and you sir had you not better go back to your friends at the alehouse” her eyes ordinarily so kind darted flashes of anger as she spoke and she tossed up her head which hung down commonly with the mien of a princess  “heyday” says my lord who was standing by the fireplace—indeed he was in the position to which he generally came by that hour of the evening—“heyday rachel what are you in a passion about ladies ought never to be in a passion ought they doctor tusher though it does good to see rachel in a passion—damme lady castlewood you look dev’lish handsome in a passion”  “it is my lord because mr henry esmond having nothing to do with his time here and not having a taste for our company has been to the alehouse where he has some friends”  my lord burst out with a laugh and an oath—“you young slyboots you’ve been at nancy sievewright d—— the young hypocrite who’d have thought it in him i say tusher he’s been after——”  “enough my lord” said my lady “don’t insult me with this talk”  “upon my word” said poor harry ready to cry with shame and mortification “the honour of that young person is perfectly unstained for me”  “oh of course of course” says my lord more and more laughing and tipsy “upon his honour doctor—nancy sieve——”  “take mistress beatrix to bed” my lady cried at this moment to mrs tucker her woman who came in with her ladyship’s tea “put her into my room—no into yours” she added quickly “go my child go i say not a word” and beatrix quite surprised at so sudden a tone of authority from one who was seldom accustomed to raise her voice went out of the room with a scared countenance and waited even to burst out acrying until she got to the door with mrs tucker  for once her mother took little heed of her sobbing and continued to speak eagerly—“my lord” she said “this young man—your dependant—told me just now in french—he was ashamed to speak in his own language—that he had been at the alehouse all day where he has had that little wretch who is now ill of the smallpox on his knee and he comes home reeking from that place—yes reeking from it—and takes my boy into his lap without shame and sits down by me yes by me he may have killed frank for what i know—killed our child why was he brought in to disgrace our house why is he here let him go—let him go i say tonight and pollute the place no more”  she had never once uttered a syllable of unkindness to harry esmond and her cruel words smote the poor boy so that he stood for some moments bewildered with grief and rage at the injustice of such a stab from such a hand he turned quite white from red which he had been  “i cannot help my birth madam” he said “nor my other misfortune and as for your boy if—if my coming nigh to him pollutes him now it was not so always good night my lord heaven bless you and yours for your goodness to me i have tired her ladyship’s kindness out and i will go” and sinking down on his knee harry esmond took the rough hand of his benefactor and kissed it  “he wants to go to the alehouse—let him go” cried my lady  “i’m d——d if he shall” said my lord “i didn’t think you could be so d——d ungrateful rachel”  her reply was to burst into a flood of tears and to quit the room with a rapid glance at harry esmond as my lord not heeding them and still in great good humour raised up his young client from his kneeling posture for a thousand kindnesses had caused the lad to revere my lord as a father and put his broad hand on harry esmond’s shoulder—  “she was always so” my lord said “the very notion of a woman drives her mad i took to liquor on that very account by jove for no other reason than that for she can’t be jealous of a beerbarrel or a bottle of rum can she doctor d—— it look at the maids—just look at the maids in the house” my lord pronounced all the words together—justlookatthemazeinthehouse jeverseesuchmaze “you wouldn’t take a wife out of castlewood now would you doctor” and my lord burst out laughing  the doctor who had been looking at my lord castlewood from under his eyelids said “but joking apart and my lord as a divine i cannot treat the subject in a jocular light nor as a pastor of this congregation look with anything but sorrow at the idea of so very young a sheep going astray”  “sir” said young esmond bursting out indignantly “she told me that you yourself were a horrid old man and had offered to kiss her in the dairy”  “for shame henry” cried doctor tusher turning as red as a turkeycock while my lord continued to roar with laughter “if you listen to the falsehoods of an abandoned girl——”  “she is as honest as any woman in england and as pure for me” cried out henry “and as kind and as good for shame on you to malign her”  “far be it from me to do so” cried the doctor “heaven grant i may be mistaken in the girl and in you sir who have a truly precocious genius but that is not the point at issue at present it appears that the smallpox broke out in the little boy at the ‘three castles’ that it was on him when you visited the alehouse for your own reasons and that you sat with the child for some time and immediately afterwards with my young lord” the doctor raised his voice as he spoke and looked towards my lady who had now come back looking very pale with a handkerchief in her hand  “this is all very true sir” said lady esmond looking at the young man  “’tis to be feared that he may have brought the infection with him”  “from the alehouse—yes” said my lady  “d—— it i forgot when i collared you boy” cried my lord stepping back “keep off harry my boy there’s no good in running into the wolf’s jaws you know”  my lady looked at him with some surprise and instantly advancing to henry esmond took his hand “i beg your pardon henry” she said “i spoke very unkindly i have no right to interfere with you—with your——”  my lord broke out into an oath “can’t you leave the boy alone my lady” she looked a little red and faintly pressed the lad’s hand as she dropped it  “there is no use my lord” she said “frank was on his knee as he was making pictures and was running constantly from henry to me the evil is done if any”  “not with me damme” cried my lord “i’ve been smoking”—and he lighted his pipe again with a coal—“and it keeps off infection and as the disease is in the village—plague take it—i would have you leave it we’ll go tomorrow to walcote my lady”  “i have no fear” said my lady “i may have had it as an infant it broke out in our house then and when four of my sisters had it at home two years before our marriage i escaped it and two of my dear sisters died”  “i won’t run the risk” said my lord “i’m as bold as any man but i’ll not bear that”  “take beatrix with you and go” said my lady “for us the mischief is done and tucker can wait upon us who has had the disease”  “you take care to choose ’em ugly enough” said my lord at which her ladyship hung down her head and looked foolish and my lord calling away tusher bade him come to the oak parlour and have a pipe the doctor made a low bow to her ladyship of which salaams he was profuse and walked off on his creaking squaretoes after his patron  when the lady and the young man were alone there was a silence of some moments during which he stood at the fire looking rather vacantly at the dying embers whilst her ladyship busied herself with her tambourframe and needles  “i am sorry” she said after a pause in a hard dry voice—“i repeat i am sorry that i showed myself so ungrateful for the safety of my son it was not at all my wish that you should leave us i am sure unless you found pleasure elsewhere but you must perceive mr esmond that at your age and with your tastes it is impossible that you can continue to stay upon the intimate footing in which you have been in this family you have wished to go to the university and i think ’tis quite as well that you should be sent thither i did not press this matter thinking you a child as you are indeed in years—quite a child and i should never have thought of treating you otherwise until—until these circumstances came to light and i shall beg my lord to dispatch you as quick as possible and will go on with frank’s learning as well as i can i owe my father thanks for a little grounding and you i’m sure for much that you have taught me—and—and i wish you a good night mr esmond”  and with this she dropped a stately curtsy and taking her candle went away through the tapestry door which led to her apartments esmond stood by the fireplace blankly staring after her indeed he scarce seemed to see until she was gone and then her image was impressed upon him and remained for ever fixed upon his memory he saw her retreating the taper lighting up her marble face her scarlet lip quivering and her shining golden hair he went to his own room and to bed where he tried to read as his custom was but he never knew what he was reading until afterwards he remembered the appearance of the letters of the book it was in montaigne’s essays and the events of the day passed before him—that is of the last hour of the day for as for the morning and the poor milkmaid yonder he never so much as once thought and he could not get to sleep until daylight and woke with a violent headache and quite unrefreshed  he had brought the contagion with him from the “three castles” sure enough and was presently laid up with the smallpox which spared the hall no more than it did the cottage    chapter ix i have the smallpox and prepare to leave castlewood   when harry esmond passed through the crisis of that malady and returned to health again he found that little frank esmond had also suffered and rallied after the disease and the lady his mother was down with it with a couple more of the household “it was a providence for which we all ought to be thankful” doctor tusher said “that my lady and her son were spared while death carried off the poor domestics of the house” and rebuked harry for asking in his simple way—for which we ought to be thankful—that the servants were killed or the gentlefolks were saved nor could young esmond agree in the doctor’s vehement protestations to my lady when he visited her during her convalescence that the malady had not in the least impaired her charms and had not been churl enough to injure the fair features of the viscountess of castlewood whereas in spite of these fine speeches harry thought that her ladyship’s beauty was very much injured by the smallpox when the marks of the disease cleared away they did not it is true leave furrows or scars on her face except one perhaps on her forehead over her left eyebrow but the delicacy of her rosy colour and complexion were gone her eyes had lost their brilliancy her hair fell and her face looked older it was as if a coarse hand had rubbed off the delicate tints of that sweet picture and brought it as one has seen unskilful paintingcleaners do to the dead colour also it must be owned that for a year or two after the malady her ladyship’s nose was swollen and redder  there would be no need to mention these trivialities but that they actually influenced many lives as trifles will in the world where a gnat often plays a greater part than an elephant and a molehill as we know in king william’s case can upset an empire when tusher in his courtly way at which harry esmond always chafed and spoke scornfully vowed and protested that my lady’s face was none the worse—the lad broke out and said “it is worse and my mistress is not near so handsome as she was” on which poor lady esmond gave a rueful smile and a look into a little venice glass she had which showed her i suppose that what the stupid boy said was only too true for she turned away from the glass and her eyes filled with tears  the sight of these in esmond’s heart always created a sort of rage of pity and seeing them on the face of the lady whom he loved best the young blunderer sank down on his knees and besought her to pardon him saying that he was a fool and an idiot that he was a brute to make such a speech he who had caused her malady and doctor tusher told him that a bear he was indeed and a bear he would remain at which speech poor young esmond was so dumbstricken that he did not even growl  “he is my bear and i will not have him baited doctor” my lady said patting her hand kindly on the boy’s head as he was still kneeling at her feet “how your hair has come off and mine too” she added with another sigh  “it is not for myself that i cared” my lady said to harry when the parson had taken his leave “but am i very much changed alas i fear ’tis too true”  “madam you have the dearest and kindest and sweetest face in the world i think” the lad said and indeed he thought and thinks so  “will my lord think so when he comes back” the lady asked with a sigh and another look at her venice glass “suppose he should think as you do sir that i am hideous—yes you said hideous—he will cease to care for me ’tis all men care for in women our little beauty why did he select me from among my sisters ’twas only for that we reign but for a day or two and be sure that vashti knew esther was coming”  “madam” said mr esmond “ahasuerus was the grand turk and to change was the manner of his country and according to his law”  “you are all grand turks for that matter” said my lady “or would be if you could come frank come my child you are well praised be heaven your locks are not thinned by this dreadful smallpox nor your poor face scarred—is it my angel”  frank began to shout and whimper at the idea of such a misfortune from the very earliest time the young lord had been taught to admire his beauty by his mother and esteemed it as highly as any reigning toast valued hers  one day as he himself was recovering from his fever and illness a pang of something like shame shot across young esmond’s breast as he remembered that he had never once during his illness given a thought to the poor girl at the smithy whose red cheeks but a month ago he had been so eager to see poor nancy her cheeks had shared the fate of roses and were withered now she had taken the illness on the same day with esmond—she and her brother were both dead of the smallpox and buried under the castlewood yewtrees there was no bright face looking now from the garden or to cheer the old smith at his lonely fireside esmond would have liked to have kissed her in her shroud like the lass in mr prior’s pretty poem but she rested many foot below the ground when esmond after his malady first trod on it  doctor tusher brought the news of this calamity about which harry esmond longed to ask but did not like he said almost the whole village had been stricken with the pestilence seventeen persons were dead of it among them mentioning the names of poor nancy and her little brother he did not fail to say how thankful we survivors ought to be it being this man’s business to flatter and make sermons it must be owned he was most industrious in it and was doing the one or the other all day  and so nancy was gone and harry esmond blushed that he had not a single tear for her and fell to composing an elegy in latin verses over the rustic little beauty he bade the dryads mourn and the rivernymphs deplore her as her father followed the calling of vulcan he said that surely she was like a daughter of venus though sievewright’s wife was an ugly shrew as he remembered to have heard afterwards he made a long face but in truth felt scarcely more sorrowful than a mute at a funeral these first passions of men and women are mostly abortive and are dead almost before they are born esmond could repeat to his last day some of the doggerel lines in which his muse bewailed his pretty lass not without shame to remember how bad the verses were and how good he thought them how false the grief and yet how he was rather proud of it ’tis an error surely to talk of the simplicity of youth i think no persons are more hypocritical and have a more affected behaviour to one another than the young they deceive themselves and each other with artifices that do not impose upon men of the world and so we got to understand truth better and grow simpler as we grow older  when my lady heard of the fate which had befallen poor nancy she said nothing so long as tusher was by but when he was gone she took harry esmond’s hand and said—  “harry i beg your pardon for those cruel words i used on the night you were taken ill i am shocked at the fate of the poor creature and am sure that nothing had happened of that with which in my anger i charged you and the very first day we go out you must take me to the blacksmith and we must see if there is anything i can do to console the poor old man poor man to lose both his children what should i do without mine”  and this was indeed the very first walk which my lady took leaning on esmond’s arm after her illness but her visit brought no consolation to the old father and he showed no softness or desire to speak “the lord gave and took away” he said and he knew what his servant’s duty was he wanted for nothing—less now than ever before as there were fewer mouths to feed he wished her ladyship and master esmond good morning—he had grown tall in his illness and was but very little marked and with this and a surly bow he went in from the smithy to the house leaving my lady somewhat silenced and shamefaced at the door he had a handsome stone put up for his two children which may be seen in castlewood churchyard to this very day and before a year was out his own name was upon the stone in the presence of death that sovereign ruler a woman’s coquetry is scared and her jealousy will hardly pass the boundaries of that grim kingdom ’tis entirely of the earth that passion and expires in the cold blue air beyond our sphere  at length when the danger was quite over it was announced that my lord and his daughter would return esmond well remembered the day the lady his mistress was in a flurry of fear before my lord came she went into her room and returned from it with reddened cheeks her fate was about to be decided her beauty was gone—was her reign too over a minute would say my lord came riding over the bridge—he could be seen from the great window clad in scarlet and mounted on his grey hackney—his little daughter ambled by him in a bright ridingdress of blue on a shining chestnut horse my lady leaned against the great mantelpiece looking on with one hand on her heart—she seemed only the more pale for those red marks on either cheek she put her handkerchief to her eyes and withdrew it laughing hysterically—the cloth was quite red with the rouge when she took it away she ran to her room again and came back with pale cheeks and red eyes—her son in her hand—just as my lord entered accompanied by young esmond who had gone out to meet his protector and to hold his stirrup as he descended from horseback  “what harry boy” my lord said goodnaturedly “you look as gaunt as a greyhound the smallpox hasn’t improved your beauty and your side of the house hadn’t never too much of it—ho ho”  and he laughed and sprang to the ground with no small agility looking handsome and red with a jolly face and brown hair like a beefeater esmond kneeling again as soon as his patron had descended performed his homage and then went to greet the little beatrix and help her from her horse  “fie how yellow you look” she said “and there are one two red holes in your face” which indeed was very true harry esmond’s harsh countenance bearing as long as it continued to be a human face the marks of the disease  my lord laughed again in high good humour  “d—— it” said he with one of his usual oaths “the little slut sees everything she saw the dowager’s paint t’other day and asked her why she wore that red stuff—didn’t you trix and the tower and st james’s and the play and the prince george and the princess anne—didn’t you trix”  “they are both very fat and smelt of brandy” the child said  papa roared with laughing  “brandy” he said “and how do you know miss pert”  “because your lordship smells of it after supper when i embrace you before you go to bed” said the young lady who indeed was as pert as her father said and looked as beautiful a little gipsy as eyes ever gazed on  “and now for my lady” said my lord going up the stairs and passing under the tapestry curtain that hung before the drawingroom door esmond remembered that noble figure handsomely arrayed in scarlet within the last few months he himself had grown from a boy to be a man and with his figure his thoughts had shot up and grown manly  my lady’s countenance of which harry esmond was accustomed to watch the changes and with a solicitous affection to note and interpret the signs of gladness or care wore a sad and depressed look for many weeks after her lord’s return during which it seemed as if by caresses and entreaties she strove to win him back from some ill humour he had and which he did not choose to throw off in her eagerness to please him she practised a hundred of those arts which had formerly charmed him but which seemed now to have lost their potency her songs did not amuse him and she hushed them and the children when in his presence my lord sat silent at his dinner drinking greatly his lady opposite to him looking furtively at his face though also speechless her silence annoyed him as much as her speech and he would peevishly and with an oath ask her why she held her tongue and looked so glum or he would roughly check her when speaking and bid her not talk nonsense it seemed as if since his return nothing she could do or say could please him  when a master and mistress are at strife in a house the subordinates in the family take the one side or the other harry esmond stood in so great fear of my lord that he would run a league barefoot to do a message for him but his attachment for lady esmond was such a passion of grateful regard that to spare her a grief or to do her a service he would have given his life daily and it was by the very depth and intensity of this regard that he began to divine how unhappy his adored lady’s life was and that a secret care for she never spoke of her anxieties was weighing upon her  can any one who has passed through the world and watched the nature of men and women there doubt what had befallen her i have seen to be sure some people carry down with them into old age the actual bloom of their youthful love and i know that mr thomas parr lived to be a hundred and sixty years old but for all that threescore and ten is the age of men and few get beyond it and ’tis certain that a man who marries for mere beaux yeux as my lord did considers his part of the contract at end when the woman ceases to fulfil hers and his love does not survive her beauty i know ’tis often otherwise i say and can think as most men in their own experience may of many a house where lighted in early years the sainted lamp of love hath never been extinguished but so there is mr parr and so there is the great giant at the fair that is eight feet high—exceptions to men—and that poor lamp whereof i speak that lights at first the nuptial chamber is extinguished by a hundred winds and draughts down the chimney or sputters out for want of feeding and then—and then it is chloe in the dark stark awake and strephon snoring unheeding or vice versa ’tis poor strephon that has married a heartless jilt and awoke out of that absurd vision of conjugal felicity which was to last for ever and is over like any other dream one and other has made his bed and so must lie in it until that final day when life ends and they sleep separate  about this time young esmond who had a knack of stringing verses turned some of ovid’s epistles into rhymes and brought them to his lady for her delectation those which treated of forsaken women touched her immensely harry remarked and when oenone called after paris and medea bade jason come back again the lady of castlewood sighed and said she thought that part of the verses was the most pleasing indeed she would have chopped up the dean her old father in order to bring her husband back again but her beautiful jason was gone as beautiful jasons will go and the poor enchantress had never a spell to keep him  my lord was only sulky as long as his wife’s anxious face or behaviour seemed to upbraid him when she had got to master these and to show an outwardly cheerful countenance and behaviour her husband’s good humour returned partially and he swore and stormed no longer at dinner but laughed sometimes and yawned unrestrainedly absenting himself often from home inviting more company thither passing the greater part of his days in the huntingfield or over the bottle as before but with this difference that the poor wife could no longer see now as she had done formerly the light of love kindled in his eyes he was with her but that flame was out and that once welcome beacon no more shone there  what were this lady’s feelings when forced to admit the truth whereof her foreboding glass had given her only too true warning that with her beauty her reign had ended and the days of her love were over what does a seaman do in a storm if mast and rudder are carried away he ships a jurymast and steers as he best can with an oar what happens if your roof falls in a tempest after the first stun of the calamity the sufferer starts up gropes around to see that the children are safe and puts them under a shed out of the rain if the palace burns down you take shelter in the barn what man’s life is not overtaken by one or more of these tornadoes that send us out of the course and fling us on rocks to shelter as best we may  when lady castlewood found that her great ship had gone down she began as best she might after she had rallied from the effects of the loss to put out small ventures of happiness and hope for little gains and returns as a merchant on “change indocilis pauperiem pati” having lost his thousands embarks a few guineas upon the next ship she laid out her all upon her children indulging them beyond all measure as was inevitable with one of her kindness of disposition giving all her thoughts to their welfare—learning that she might teach them and improving her own many natural gifts and feminine accomplishments that she might impart them to her young ones to be doing good for some one else is the life of most good women they are exuberant of kindness as it were and must impart it to some one she made herself a good scholar of french italian and latin having been grounded in these by her father in her youth hiding these gifts from her husband out of fear perhaps that they should offend him for my lord was no bookman—pish’d and psha’d at the notion of learned ladies and would have been angry that his wife could construe out of a latin book of which he could scarce understand two words young esmond was usher or house tutor under her or over her as it might happen during my lord’s many absences these schooldays would go on uninterruptedly the mother and daughter learning with surprising quickness the latter by fits and starts only and as suited her wayward humour as for the little lord it must be owned that he took after his father in the matter of learning—liked marbles and play and the great horse and the little one which his father brought him and on which he took him out ahunting—a great deal better than corderius and lily marshalled the village boys and had a little court of them already flogging them and domineering over them with a fine imperious spirit that made his father laugh when he beheld it and his mother fondly warn him the cook had a son the woodman had two the big lad at the porter’s lodge took his cuffs and his orders doctor tusher said he was a young nobleman of gallant spirit and harry esmond who was his tutor and eight years his little lordship’s senior had hard work sometimes to keep his own temper and hold his authority over his rebellious little chief and kinsman  in a couple of years after that calamity had befallen which had robbed lady castlewood of a little—a very little—of her beauty and her careless husband’s heart if the truth must be told my lady had found not only that her reign was over but that her successor was appointed a princess of a noble house in drury lane somewhere who was installed and visited by my lord at the town eight miles off—pudet haec opprobria dicere nobis—a great change had taken place in her mind which by struggles only known to herself at least never mentioned to any one and unsuspected by the person who caused the pain she endured—had been schooled into such a condition as she could not very likely have imagined possible a score of months since before her misfortunes had begun  she had oldened in that time as people do who suffer silently great mental pain and learned much that she had never suspected before she was taught by that bitter teacher misfortune a child the mother of other children but two years back her lord was a god to her his words her law his smile her sunshine his lazy commonplaces listened to eagerly as if they were words of wisdom—all his wishes and freaks obeyed with a servile devotion she had been my lord’s chief slave and blind worshipper some women bear farther than this and submit not only to neglect but to unfaithfulness too—but here this lady’s allegiance had failed her her spirit rebelled and disowned any more obedience first she had to bear in secret the passion of losing the adored object then to get a farther initiation and to find this worshipped being was but a clumsy idol then to admit the silent truth that it was she was superior and not the monarch her master that she had thoughts which his brains could never master and was the better of the two quite separate from my lord although tied to him and bound as almost all people save a very happy few to work all her life alone my lord sat in his chair laughing his laugh cracking his joke his face flushing with wine—my lady in her place over against him—he never suspecting that his superior was there in the calm resigned lady cold of manner with downcast eyes when he was merry in his cups he would make jokes about her coldness and “d—— it now my lady is gone we will have t’other bottle” he would say he was frank enough in telling his thoughts such as they were there was little mystery about my lord’s words or actions his fair rosamond did not live in a labyrinth like the lady of mr addison’s opera but paraded with painted cheeks and a tipsy retinue in the country town had she a mind to be revenged lady castlewood could have found the way to her rival’s house easily enough and if she had come with bowl and dagger would have been routed off the ground by the enemy with a volley of billingsgate which the fair person always kept by her  meanwhile it has been said that for harry esmond his benefactress’s sweet face had lost none of its charms it had always the kindest of looks and smiles for him—smiles not so gay and artless perhaps as those which lady castlewood had formerly worn when a child herself playing with her children her husband’s pleasure and authority were all she thought of but out of her griefs and cares as will happen i think when these trials fall upon a kindly heart and are not too unbearable grew up a number of thoughts and excellences which had never come into existence had not her sorrow and misfortunes engendered them sure occasion is the father of most that is good in us as you have seen the awkward fingers and clumsy tools of a prisoner cut and fashion the most delicate little pieces of carved work or achieve the most prodigious underground labours and cut through walls of masonry and saw iron bars and fetters ’tis misfortune that awakens ingenuity or fortitude or endurance in hearts where these qualities had never come to life but for the circumstance which gave them a being  “’twas after jason left her no doubt” lady castlewood once said with one of her smiles to young esmond who was reading to her a version of certain lines out of euripides “that medea became a learned woman and a great enchantress”  “and she could conjure the stars out of heaven” the young tutor added “but she could not bring jason back again”  “what do you mean” asked my lady very angry  “indeed i mean nothing” said the other “save what i’ve read in books what should i know about such matters i have seen no woman save you and little beatrix and the parson’s wife and my late mistress and your ladyship’s woman here”  “the men who wrote your books” says my lady “your horaces and ovids and virgils as far as i know of them all thought ill of us as all the heroes they wrote about used us basely we were bred to be slaves always and even of our own times as you are still the only lawgivers i think our sermons seem to say that the best woman is she who bears her master’s chains most gracefully ’tis a pity there are no nunneries permitted by our church beatrix and i would fly to one and end our days in peace there away from you”  “and is there no slavery in a convent” says esmond  “at least if women are slaves there no one sees them” answered the lady “they don’t work in streetgangs with the public to jeer them and if they suffer suffer in private here comes my lord home from hunting take away the books my lord does not love to see them lessons are over for today mr tutor” and with a curtsy and a smile she would end this sort of colloquy  indeed “mr tutor” as my lady called esmond had now business enough on his hands in castlewood house he had three pupils his lady and her two children at whose lessons she would always be present besides writing my lord’s letters and arranging his accompts for him—when these could be got from esmond’s indolent patron  of the pupils the two young people were but lazy scholars and as my lady would admit no discipline such as was then in use my lord’s son only learned what he liked which was but little and never to his life’s end could be got to construe more than six lines of virgil mistress beatrix chattered french prettily from a very early age and sang sweetly but this was from her mother’s teaching—not harry esmond’s who could scarce distinguish between “green sleeves” and “lillabullero” although he had no greater delight in life than to hear the ladies sing he sees them now will he ever forget them as they used to sit together of the summer evenings—the two golden heads over the page—the child’s little hand and the mother’s beating the time with their voices rising and falling in unison  but if the children were careless ’twas a wonder how eagerly the mother learned from her young tutor—and taught him too the happiest instinctive faculty was this lady’s—a faculty for discerning latent beauties and hidden graces of books especially books of poetry as in a walk she would spy out fieldflowers and make posies of them such as no other hand could she was a critic not by reason but by feeling the sweetest commentator of those books they read together and the happiest hours of young esmond’s life perhaps were those passed in the company of this kind mistress and her children  these happy days were to end soon however and it was by the lady castlewood’s own decree that they were brought to a conclusion it happened about christmastime harry esmond being now past sixteen years of age that his old comrade adversary and friend tom tusher returned from his school in london a fair wellgrown and sturdy lad who was about to enter college with an exhibition from his school and a prospect of after promotion in the church tom tusher’s talk was of nothing but cambridge now and the boys who were good friends examined each other eagerly about their progress in books tom had learned some greek and hebrew besides latin in which he was pretty well skilled and also had given himself to mathematical studies under his father’s guidance who was a proficient in those sciences of which esmond knew nothing nor could he write latin so well as tom though he could talk it better having been taught by his dear friend the jesuit father for whose memory the lad ever retained the warmest affection reading his books keeping his swords clean in the little crypt where the father had shown them to esmond on the night of his visit and often of a night sitting in the chaplain’s room which he inhabited over his books his verses and rubbish with which the lad occupied himself he would look up at the window thinking he wished it might open and let in the good father he had come and passed away like a dream but for the swords and books harry might almost think the father was an imagination of his mind—and for two letters which had come to him one from abroad full of advice and affection another soon after he had been confirmed by the bishop of hexton in which father holt deplored his falling away but harry esmond felt so confident now of his being in the right and of his own powers as a casuist that he thought he was able to face the father himself in argument and possibly convert him  to work upon the faith of her young pupil esmond’s kind mistress sent to the library of her father the dean who had been distinguished in the disputes of the late king’s reign and an old soldier now had hung up his weapons of controversy these he took down from his shelves willingly for young esmond whom he benefited by his own personal advice and instruction it did not require much persuasion to induce the boy to worship with his beloved mistress and the good old nonjuring dean flattered himself with a conversion which in truth was owing to a much gentler and fairer persuader  under her ladyship’s kind eyes my lord’s being sealed in sleep pretty generally esmond read many volumes of the works of the famous british divines of the last age and was familiar with wake and sherlock with stillingfleet and patrick his mistress never tired to listen or to read to pursue the text with fond comments to urge those points which her fancy dwelt on most or her reason deemed most important since the death of her father the dean this lady hath admitted a certain latitude of theological reading which her orthodox father would never have allowed his favourite writers appealing more to reason and antiquity than to the passions or imaginations of their readers so that the works of bishop taylor nay those of mr baxter and mr law have in reality found more favour with my lady castlewood than the severer volumes of our great english schoolmen  in later life at the university esmond reopened the controversy and pursued it in a very different manner when his patrons had determined for him that he was to embrace the ecclesiastical life but though his mistress’s heart was in this calling his own never was much after that first fervour of simple devotion which his beloved jesuit priest had inspired in him speculative theology took but little hold upon the young man’s mind when his early credulity was disturbed and his saints and virgins taken out of his worship to rank little higher than the divinities of olympus his belief became acquiescence rather than ardour and he made his mind up to assume the cassock and bands as another man does to wear a breastplate and jackboots or to mount a merchant’s desk for a livelihood and from obedience and necessity rather than from choice there were scores of such men in mr esmond’s time at the universities who were going to the church with no better calling than his  when thomas tusher was gone a feeling of no small depression and disquiet fell upon young esmond of which though he did not complain his kind mistress must have divined the cause for soon after she showed not only that she understood the reason of harry’s melancholy but could provide a remedy for it her habit was thus to watch unobservedly those to whom duty or affection bound her and to prevent their designs or to fulfil them when she had the power it was this lady’s disposition to think kindnesses and devise silent bounties and to scheme benevolence for those about her we take such goodness for the most part as if it was our due the marys who bring ointment for our feet get but little thanks some of us never feel this devotion at all or are moved by it to gratitude or acknowledgement others only recall it years after when the days are past in which those sweet kindnesses were spent on us and we offer back our return for the debt by a poor tardy payment of tears then forgotten tones of love recur to us and kind glances shine out of the past—oh so bright and clear—oh so longed after—because they are out of reach as holiday music from withinside a prison wall—or sunshine seen through the bars more prized because unattainable—more bright because of the contrast of present darkness and solitude whence there is no escape  all the notice then which lady castlewood seemed to take of harry esmond’s melancholy upon tom tusher’s departure was by a gaiety unusual to her to attempt to dispel his gloom she made his three scholars herself being the chief one more cheerful than ever they had been before and more docile too all of them learning and reading much more than they had been accustomed to do “for who knows” said the lady “what may happen and whether we may be able to keep such a learned tutor long”  frank esmond said he for his part did not want to learn any more and cousin harry might shut up his book whenever he liked if he would come out afishing and little beatrix declared she would send for tom tusher and he would be glad enough to come to castlewood if harry chose to go away  at last comes a messenger from winchester one day bearer of a letter with a great black seal from the dean there to say that his sister was dead and had left her fortune of 2000l among her six nieces the dean’s daughters and many a time since has harry esmond recalled the flushed face and eager look wherewith after this intelligence his kind lady regarded him she did not pretend to any grief about the deceased relative from whom she and her family had been many years parted  when my lord heard of the news he also did not make any very long face “the money will come very handy to furnish the musicroom and the cellar which is getting low and buy your ladyship a coach and a couple of horses that will do indifferent to ride or for the coach and beatrix you shall have a spinet and frank you shall have a little horse from hexton fair and harry you shall have five pounds to buy some books” said my lord who was generous with his own and indeed with other folks’ money “i wish your aunt would die once a year rachel we could spend your money and all your sisters’ too”  “i have but one aunt—and—and i have another use for the money my lord” says my lady turning very red  “another use my dear and what do you know about money” cries my lord “and what the devil is there that i don’t give you which you want”  “i intend to give this money—can’t you fancy how my lord”  my lord swore one of his large oaths that he did not know in the least what she meant  “i intend it for harry esmond to go to college—cousin harry” says my lady “you mustn’t stay longer in this dull place but make a name to yourself and for us too harry”  “d——n it harry’s well enough here” says my lord for a moment looking rather sulky  “is harry going away you don’t mean to say you will go away” cry out frank and beatrix at one breath  “but he will come back and this will always be his home” cries my lady with blue eyes looking a celestial kindness “and his scholars will always love him won’t they”  “by g——d rachel you’re a good woman” says my lord seizing my lady’s hand at which she blushed very much and shrank back putting her children before her “i wish you joy my kinsman” he continued giving harry esmond a hearty slap on the shoulder “i won’t balk your luck go to cambridge boy and when tusher dies you shall have the living here if you are not better provided by that time we’ll furnish the diningroom and buy the horses another year i’ll give thee a nag out of the stable take any one except my hack and the bay gelding and the coachhorses and god speed thee my boy”  “have the sorrel harry ’tis a good one father says ’tis the best in the stable” says little frank clapping his hands and jumping up “let’s come and see him in the stable” and the other in his delight and eagerness was for leaving the room that instant to arrange about his journey  the lady castlewood looked after him with sad penetrating glances “he wishes to be gone already my lord” said she to her husband  the young man hung back abashed “indeed i would stay for ever if your ladyship bade me” he said  “and thou wouldst be a fool for thy pains kinsman” said my lord “tut tut man go and see the world sow thy wild oats and take the best luck that fate sends thee i wish i were a boy again that i might go to college and taste the trumpington ale”  “ours indeed is but a dull home” cries my lady with a little of sadness and maybe of satire in her voice “an old glum house half ruined and the rest only half furnished a woman and two children are but poor company for men that are accustomed to better we are only fit to be your worship’s handmaids and your pleasures must of necessity lie elsewhere than at home”  “curse me rachel if i know now whether thou art in earnest or not” said my lord  “in earnest my lord” says she still clinging by one of her children “is there much subject here for joke” and she made him a grand curtsy and giving a stately look to harry esmond which seemed to say “remember you understand me though he does not” she left the room with her children  “since she found out that confounded hexton business” my lord said—“and be hanged to them that told her—she has not been the same woman she who used to be as humble as a milkmaid is as proud as a princess” says my lord “take my counsel harry esmond and keep clear of women since i have had anything to do with the jades they have given me nothing but disgust i had a wife at tangier with whom as she couldn’t speak a word of my language you’d have thought i might lead a quiet life but she tried to poison me because she was jealous of a jew girl there was your aunt for aunt she is—aunt jezebel a pretty life your father led with her and here’s my lady when i saw her on a pillion riding behind the dean her father she looked and was such a baby that a sixpenny doll might have pleased her and now you see what she is—hands off hightytighty high and mighty an empress couldn’t be grander pass us the tankard harry my boy a mug of beer and a toast at morn says my host a toast and a mug of beer at noon says my dear d——n it polly loves a mug of ale too and laced with brandy by jove” indeed i suppose they drank it together for my lord was often thick in his speech at midday dinner and at night at supper speechless altogether  harry esmond’s departure resolved upon it seemed as if the lady castlewood too rejoiced to lose him for more than once when the lad ashamed perhaps at his own secret eagerness to go away at any rate stricken with sadness at the idea of leaving those from whom he had received so many proofs of love and kindness inestimable tried to express to his mistress his sense of gratitude to her and his sorrow at quitting those who had so sheltered and tended a nameless and houseless orphan lady castlewood cut short his protests of love and his lamentations and would hear of no grief but only look forward to harry’s fame and prospects in life “our little legacy will keep you for four years like a gentleman heaven’s providence your own genius industry honour must do the rest for you castlewood will always be a home for you and these children whom you have taught and loved will not forget to love you and harry” said she and this was the only time when she spoke with a tear in her eye or a tremor in her voice “it may happen in the course of nature that i shall be called away from them and their father—and—and they will need true friends and protectors promise me that you will be true to them—as—as i think i have been to you—and a mother’s fond prayer and blessing go with you”  “so help me god madam i will” said harry esmond falling on his knees and kissing the hand of his dearest mistress “if you will have me stay now i will what matters whether or no i make my way in life or whether a poor bastard dies as unknown as he is now ’tis enough that i have your love and kindness surely and to make you happy is duty enough for me”  “happy” says she “but indeed i ought to be with my children and——”  “not happy” cried esmond for he knew what her life was though he and his mistress never spoke a word concerning it “if not happiness it may be ease let me stay and work for you—let me stay and be your servant”  “indeed you are best away” said my lady laughing as she put her hand on the boy’s head for a moment “you shall stay in no such dull place you shall go to college and distinguish yourself as becomes your name that is how you shall please me best and—and if my children want you or i want you you shall come to us and i know we may count on you”  “may heaven forsake me if you may not” harry said getting up from his knee  “and my knight longs for a dragon this instant that he may fight” said my lady laughing which speech made harry esmond start and turn red for indeed the very thought was in his mind that he would like that some chance should immediately happen whereby he might show his devotion and it pleased him to think that his lady had called him “her knight” and often and often he recalled this to his mind and prayed that he might be her true knight too  my lady’s bedchamber window looked out over the country and you could see from it the purple hills beyond castlewood village the green common betwixt that and the hall and the old bridge which crossed over the river when harry esmond went away for cambridge little frank ran alongside his horse as far as the bridge and there harry stopped for a moment and looked back at the house where the best part of his life had been passed it lay before him with its grey familiar towers a pinnacle or two shining in the sun the buttresses and terrace walls casting great blue shades on the grass and harry remembered all his life after how he saw his mistress at the window looking out on him in a white robe the little beatrix’s chestnut curls resting at her mother’s side both waved a farewell to him and little frank sobbed to leave him yes he would be his lady’s true knight he vowed in his heart he waved her an adieu with his hat the village people had goodbye to say to him too all knew that master harry was going to college and most of them had a kind word and a look of farewell i do not stop to say what adventures he began to imagine or what career to devise for himself before he had ridden three miles from home he had not read monsieur galland’s ingenious arabian tales as yet but be sure that there are other folks who build castles in the air and have fine hopes and kick them down too besides honest alnaschar    chapter x i go to cambridge and do but little good there   my lord who said he should like to revisit the old haunts of his youth kindly accompanied harry esmond in his first journey to cambridge their road lay through london where my lord viscount would also have harry stay a few days to show him the pleasures of the town before he entered upon his university studies and whilst here harry’s patron conducted the young man to my lady dowager’s house at chelsey near london the kind lady at castlewood having specially ordered that the young gentleman and the old should pay a respectful visit in that quarter  her ladyship the viscountess dowager occupied a handsome new house in chelsey with a garden behind it and facing the river always a bright and animated sight with its swarms of sailors barges and wherries harry laughed at recognizing in the parlour the wellremembered old piece of sir peter lely wherein his father’s widow was represented as a virgin huntress armed with a gilt bow and arrow and encumbered only with that small quantity of drapery which it would seem the virgins in king charles’s day were accustomed to wear  my lady dowager had left off this peculiar habit of huntress when she married but though she was now considerably past sixty years of age i believe she thought that airy nymph of the picture could still be easily recognized in the venerable personage who gave an audience to harry and his patron  she received the young man with even more favour than she showed to the elder for she chose to carry on the conversation in french in which my lord castlewood was no great proficient and expressed her satisfaction at finding that mr esmond could speak fluently in that language “’twas the only one fit for polite conversation” she condescended to say “and suitable to persons of high breeding”  my lord laughed afterwards as the gentlemen went away at his kinswoman’s behaviour he said he remembered the time when she could speak english fast enough and joked in his jolly way at the loss he had had of such a lovely wife as that  my lady viscountess deigned to ask his lordship news of his wife and children she had heard that lady castlewood had had the smallpox she hoped she was not so very much disfigured as people said  at this remark about his wife’s malady my lord viscount winced and turned red but the dowager in speaking of the disfigurement of the young lady turned to her lookingglass and examined her old wrinkled countenance in it with such a grin of satisfaction that it was all her guests could do to refrain from laughing in her ancient face  she asked harry what his profession was to be and my lord saying that the lad was to take orders and have the living of castlewood when old dr tusher vacated it she did not seem to show any particular anger at the notion of harry’s becoming a church of england clergyman nay was rather glad than otherwise that the youth should be so provided for she bade mr esmond not to forget to pay her a visit whenever he passed through london and carried her graciousness so far as to send a purse with twenty guineas for him to the tavern at which my lord put up the “greyhound” in charing cross and along with this welcome gift for her kinsman she sent a little doll for a present to my lord’s little daughter beatrix who was growing beyond the age of dolls by this time and was as tall almost as her venerable relative  after seeing the town and going to the plays my lord castlewood and esmond rode together to cambridge spending two pleasant days upon the journey those rapid new coaches were not established as yet that performed the whole journey between london and the university in a single day however the road was pleasant and short enough to harry esmond and he always gratefully remembered that happy holiday which his kind patron gave him  mr esmond was entered a pensioner of trinity college in cambridge to which famous college my lord had also in his youth belonged dr montague was master at this time and received my lord viscount with great politeness so did mr bridge who was appointed to be harry’s tutor tom tusher who was of emmanuel college and was by this time a junior soph came to wait upon my lord and to take harry under his protection and comfortable rooms being provided for him in the great court close by the gate and near to the famous mr newton’s lodgings harry’s patron took leave of him with many kind words and blessings and an admonition to him to behave better at the university than my lord himself had ever done  ’tis needless in these memoirs to go at any length into the particulars of harry esmond’s college career it was like that of a hundred young gentlemen of that day but he had the ill fortune to be older by a couple of years than most of his fellow students and by his previous solitary mode of bringing up the circumstances of his life and the peculiar thoughtfulness and melancholy that had naturally engendered he was in a great measure cut off from the society of comrades who were much younger and higherspirited than he his tutor who had bowed down to the ground as he walked my lord over the college grassplats changed his behaviour as soon as the nobleman’s back was turned and was—at least harry thought so—harsh and overbearing when the lads used to assemble in their greges in hall harry found himself alone in the midst of that little flock of boys they raised a great laugh at him when he was set on to read latin which he did with the foreign pronunciation taught to him by his old master the jesuit than which he knew no other mr bridge the tutor made him the object of clumsy jokes in which he was fond of indulging the young man’s spirit was chafed and his vanity mortified and he found himself for some time as lonely in this place as ever he had been at castlewood whither he longed to return his birth was a source of shame to him and he fancied a hundred slights and sneers from young and old who no doubt had treated him better had he met them himself more frankly and as he looks back in calmer days upon this period of his life which he thought so unhappy he can see that his own pride and vanity caused no small part of the mortifications which he attributed to others’ ill will the world deals goodnaturedly with goodnatured people and i never knew a sulky misanthropist who quarrelled with it but it was he and not it that was in the wrong tom tusher gave harry plenty of good advice on this subject for tom had both good sense and good humour but mr harry chose to treat his senior with a great deal of superfluous disdain and absurd scorn and would by no means part from his darling injuries in which very likely no man believed but himself as for honest doctor bridge the tutor found after a few trials of wit with the pupil that the younger man was an ugly subject for wit and that the laugh was often turned against him this did not make tutor and pupil any better friends but had so far an advantage for esmond that mr bridge was induced to leave him alone and so long as he kept his chapels and did the college exercises required of him bridge was content not to see harry’s glum face in his class and to leave him to read and sulk for himself in his own chamber  a poem or two in latin and english which were pronounced to have some merit and a latin oration for mr esmond could write that language better than pronounce it got him a little reputation both with the authorities of the university and amongst the young men with whom he began to pass for more than he was worth a few victories over their common enemy mr bridge made them incline towards him and look upon him as the champion of their order against the seniors such of the lads as he took into his confidence found him not so gloomy and haughty as his appearance led them to believe and don dismallo as he was called became presently a person of some little importance in his college and was as he believes set down by the seniors there as rather a dangerous character  don dismallo was a stanch young jacobite like the rest of his family gave himself many absurd airs of loyalty used to invite young friends to burgundy and give the king’s health on king james’s birthday wore black on the day of his abdication fasted on the anniversary of king william’s coronation and performed a thousand absurd antics of which he smiles now to think  these follies caused many remonstrances on tom tusher’s part who was always a friend to the powers that be as esmond was always in opposition to them tom was a whig while esmond was a tory tom never missed a lecture and capped the proctor with the profoundest of bows no wonder he sighed over harry’s insubordinate courses and was angry when the others laughed at him but that harry was known to have my lord viscount’s protection tom no doubt would have broken with him altogether but honest tom never gave up a comrade as long as he was the friend of a great man this was not out of scheming on tom’s part but a natural inclination towards the great ’twas no hypocrisy in him to flatter but the bent of his mind which was always perfectly goodhumoured obliging and servile  harry had very liberal allowances for his dear mistress of castlewood not only regularly supplied him but the dowager at chelsey made her donation annual and received esmond at her house near london every christmas but in spite of these benefactions esmond was constantly poor whilst ’twas a wonder with how small a stipend from his father tom tusher contrived to make a good figure ’tis true that harry both spent gave and lent his money very freely which thomas never did i think he was like the famous duke of marlborough in this instance who getting a present of fifty pieces when a young man from some foolish woman who fell in love with his good looks showed the money to cadogan in a drawer scores of years after where it had lain ever since he had sold his beardless honour to procure it i do not mean to say that tom ever let out his good looks so profitably for nature had not endowed him with any particular charms of person and he ever was a pattern of moral behaviour losing no opportunity of giving the very best advice to his younger comrade with which article to do him justice he parted very freely not but that he was a merry fellow too in his way he loved a joke if by good fortune he understood it and took his share generously of a bottle if another paid for it and especially if there was a young lord in company to drink it in these cases there was not a harder drinker in the university than mr tusher could be and it was edifying to behold him fresh shaved and with smug face singing out “amen” at early chapel in the morning in his reading poor harry permitted himself to go agadding after all the nine muses and so very likely had but little favour from any one of them whereas tom tusher who had no more turn for poetry than a ploughboy nevertheless by a dogged perseverance and obsequiousness in courting the divine calliope got himself a prize and some credit in the university and a fellowship at his college as a reward for his scholarship in this time of mr esmond’s life he got the little reading which he ever could boast of and passed a good part of his days greedily devouring all the books on which he could lay hand in this desultory way the works of most of the english french and italian poets came under his eyes and he had a smattering of the spanish tongue likewise besides the ancient languages of which at least of latin he was a tolerable master  then about midway in his university career he fell to reading for the profession to which worldly prudence rather than inclination called him and was perfectly bewildered in theological controversy in the course of his reading which was neither pursued with that seriousness or that devout mind which such a study requires the youth found himself at the end of one month a papist and was about to proclaim his faith the next month a protestant with chillingworth and the third a sceptic with hobbs and bayle whereas honest tom tusher never permitted his mind to stray out of the prescribed university path accepted the thirtynine articles with all his heart and would have signed and sworn to other nineandthirty with entire obedience harry’s wilfulness in this matter and disorderly thoughts and conversation so shocked and afflicted his senior that there grew up a coldness and estrangement between them so that they became scarce more than mere acquaintances from having been intimate friends when they came to college first politics ran high too at the university and here also the young men were at variance tom professed himself albeit a high churchman a strong king william’sman whereas harry brought his family tory politics to college with him to which he must add a dangerous admiration for oliver cromwell whose side or king james’s by turns he often chose to take in the disputes which the young gentlemen used to hold in each other’s rooms where they debated on the state of the nation crowned and deposed kings and toasted past and present heroes or beauties in flagons of college ale  thus either from the circumstances of his birth or the natural melancholy of his disposition esmond came to live very much by himself during his stay at the university having neither ambition enough to distinguish himself in the college career nor caring to mingle with the mere pleasures and boyish frolics of the students who were for the most part two or three years younger than he he fancied that the gentlemen of the commonroom of his college slighted him on account of his birth and hence kept aloof from their society it may be that he made the ill will which he imagined came from them by his own behaviour which as he looks back on it in afterlife he now sees was morose and haughty at any rate he was as tenderly grateful for kindness as he was susceptible of slight and wrong and lonely as he was generally yet had one or two very warm friendships for his companions of those days  one of these was a queer gentleman that resided in the university though he was no member of it and was the professor of a science scarce recognized in the common course of college education this was a french refugee officer who had been driven out of his native country at the time of the protestant persecutions there and who came to cambridge where he taught the science of the smallsword and set up a saloonofarms though he declared himself a protestant ’twas said mr moreau was a jesuit in disguise indeed he brought very strong recommendations to the tory party which was pretty strong in that university and very likely was one of the many agents whom king james had in this country esmond found this gentleman’s conversation very much more agreeable and to his taste than the talk of the college divines in the commonroom he never wearied of moreau’s stories of the wars of turenne and condé in which he had borne a part and being familiar with the french tongue from his youth and in a place where but few spoke it his company became very agreeable to the brave old professor of arms whose favourite pupil he was and who made mr esmond a very tolerable proficient in the noble science of escrime  at the next term esmond was to take his degree of bachelor of arts and afterwards in proper season to assume the cassock and bands which his fond mistress would have him wear tom tusher himself was a parson and a fellow of his college by this time and harry felt that he would very gladly cede his right to the living of castlewood to tom and that his own calling was in no way the pulpit but as he was bound before all things in the world to his dear mistress at home and knew that a refusal on his part would grieve her he determined to give her no hint of his unwillingness to the clerical office and it was in this unsatisfactory mood of mind that he went to spend the last vacation he should have at castlewood before he took orders    chapter xi i come home for a holiday to castlewood and find a skeleton in the house   at his third long vacation esmond came as usual to castlewood always feeling an eager thrill of pleasure when he found himself once more in the house where he had passed so many years and beheld the kind familiar eyes of his mistress looking upon him she and her children out of whose company she scarce ever saw him came to greet him miss beatrix was grown so tall that harry did not quite know whether he might kiss her or no and she blushed and held back when he offered that salutation though she took it and even courted it when they were alone the young lord was shooting up to be like his gallant father in look though with his mother’s kind eyes the lady of castlewood herself seemed grown too since harry saw her—in her look more stately in her person fuller in her face still as ever most tender and friendly a greater air of command and decision than had appeared in that guileless sweet countenance which harry remembered so gratefully the tone of her voice was so much deeper and sadder when she spoke and welcomed him that it quite startled esmond who looked up at her surprised as she spoke when she withdrew her eyes from him nor did she ever look at him afterwards when his own eyes were gazing upon her a something hinting at grief and secret and filling his mind with alarm undefinable seemed to speak with that low thrilling voice of hers and look out of those dear sad eyes her greeting to esmond was so cold that it almost pained the lad who would have liked to fall on his knees and kiss the skirt of her robe so fond and ardent was his respect and regard for her and he faltered in answering the questions which she hesitating on her side began to put to him was he happy at cambridge did he study too hard she hoped not he had grown very tall and looked very well  “he has got a moustache” cries out master esmond  “why does he not wear a peruke like my lord mohun” asked miss beatrix “my lord says that nobody wears their own hair”  “i believe you will have to occupy your old chamber” says my lady “i hope the housekeeper has got it ready”  “why mamma you have been there ten times these three days yourself” exclaims frank  “and she cut some flowers which you planted in my garden—do you remember ever so many years ago—when i was quite a little girl” cries out miss beatrix on tiptoe “and mamma put them in your window”  “i remember when you grew well after you were ill that you used to like roses” said the lady blushing like one of them they all conducted harry esmond to his chamber the children running before harry walking by his mistress handinhand  the old room had been ornamented and beautified not a little to receive him the flowers were in the window in a china vase and there was a fine new counterpane on the bed which chatterbox beatrix said mamma had made too a fire was crackling on the hearth although it was june my lady thought the room wanted warming everything was done to make him happy and welcome “and you are not to be a page any longer but a gentleman and kinsman and to walk with papa and mamma” said the children and as soon as his dear mistress and children had left him to himself it was with a heart overflowing with love and gratefulness that he flung himself down on his knees by the side of the little bed and asked a blessing upon those who were so kind to him  the children who are always house telltales soon made him acquainted with the little history of the house and family papa had been to london twice papa often went away now papa had taken beatrix to westlands where she was taller than sir george harper’s second daughter though she was two years older papa had taken beatrix and frank both to bellminster where frank had got the better of lord bellminster’s son in a boxingmatch—my lord laughing told harry afterwards many gentlemen came to stop with papa and papa had gotten a new game from london a french game called a billiard—that the french king played it very well and the dowager lady castlewood had sent miss beatrix a present and papa had gotten a new chaise with two little horses which he drove himself beside the coach which mamma went in and dr tusher was a cross old plague and they did not like to learn from him at all and papa did not care about them learning and laughed when they were at their books but mamma liked them to learn and taught them and “i don’t think papa is fond of mamma” said miss beatrix with her great eyes she had come quite close up to harry esmond by the time this prattle took place and was on his knee and had examined all the points of his dress and all the good or bad features of his homely face  “you shouldn’t say that papa is not fond of mamma” said the boy at this confession “mamma never said so and mamma forbade you to say it miss beatrix”  ’twas this no doubt that accounted for the sadness in lady castlewood’s eyes and the plaintive vibrations of her voice who does not know of eyes lighted by love once where the flame shines no more—of lamps extinguished once properly trimmed and tended every man has such in his house such mementoes make our splendidest chambers look blank and sad such faces seen in a day cast a gloom upon our sunshine so oaths mutually sworn and invocations of heaven and priestly ceremonies and fond belief and love so fond and faithful that it never doubted but that it should live for ever are all of no avail towards making love eternal it dies in spite of the banns and the priest and i have often thought there should be a visitation of the sick for it and a funeral service and an extreme unction and an abi in pace it has its course like all mortal things—its beginning progress and decay it buds and it blooms out into sunshine and it withers and ends strephon and chloe languish apart join in a rapture and presently you hear that chloe is crying and strephon has broken his crook across her back can you mend it so as to show no marks of rupture not all the priests of hymen not all the incantations to the gods can make it whole  waking up from dreams books and visions of college honours in which for two years harry esmond had been immersed he found himself instantly on his return home in the midst of this actual tragedy of life which absorbed and interested him more than all his tutor taught him the persons whom he loved best in the world and to whom he owed most were living unhappily together the gentlest and kindest of women was suffering illusage and shedding tears in secret the man who made her wretched by neglect if not by violence was harry’s benefactor and patron in houses where in place of that sacred inmost flame of love there is discord at the centre the whole household becomes hypocritical and each lies to his neighbour the husband or it may be the wife lies when the visitor comes in and wears a grin of reconciliation or politeness before him the wife lies indeed her business is to do that and to smile however much she is beaten swallows her tears and lies to her lord and master lies in bidding little jacky respect dear papa lies in assuring grandpapa that she is perfectly happy the servants lie wearing grave faces behind their master’s chair and pretending to be unconscious of the fighting and so from morning till bedtime life is passed in falsehood and wiseacres call this a proper regard of morals and point out baucis and philemon as examples of a good life  if my lady did not speak of her griefs to harry esmond my lord was by no means reserved when in his cups and spoke his mind very freely bidding harry in his coarse way and with his blunt language beware of all women as cheats jades jilts and using other unmistakable monosyllables in speaking of them indeed ’twas the fashion of the day as i must own and there’s not a writer of my time of any note with the exception of poor dick steele that does not speak of a woman as of a slave and scorn and use her as such mr pope mr congreve mr addison mr gay every one of ’em sing in this key each according to his nature and politeness and louder and fouler than all in abuse is dr swift who spoke of them as he treated them worst of all  much of the quarrels and hatred which arise between married people come in my mind from the husband’s rage and revolt at discovering that his slave and bedfellow who is to minister to all his wishes and is churchsworn to honour and obey him—is his superior and that he and not she ought to be the subordinate of the twain and in these controversies i think lay the cause of my lord’s anger against his lady when he left her she began to think for herself and her thoughts were not in his favour after the illumination when the lovelamp is put out that anon we spoke of and by the common daylight we look at the picture what a daub it looks what a clumsy effigy how many men and wives come to this knowledge think you and if it be painful to a woman to find herself mated for life to a boor and ordered to love and honour a dullard it is worse still for the man himself perhaps whenever in his dim comprehension the idea dawns that his slave and drudge yonder is in truth his superior that the woman who does his bidding and submits to his humour should be his lord that she can think a thousand things beyond the power of his muddled brains and that in yonder head on the pillow opposite to him lie a thousand feelings mysteries of thought latent scorns and rebellions whereof he only dimly perceives the existence as they look out furtively from her eyes treasures of love doomed to perish without a hand to gather them sweet fancies and images of beauty that would grow and unfold themselves into flower bright wit that would shine like diamonds could it be brought into the sun and the tyrant in possession crushes the outbreak of all these drives them back like slaves into the dungeon and darkness and chafes without that his prisoner is rebellious and his sworn subject undutiful and refractory so the lamp was out in castlewood hall and the lord and lady there saw each other as they were with her illness and altered beauty my lord’s fire for his wife disappeared with his selfishness and faithlessness her foolish fiction of love and reverence was rent away love—who is to love what is base and unlovely respect—who is to respect what is gross and sensual not all the marriage oaths sworn before all the parsons cardinals ministers muftis and rabbins in the world can bind to that monstrous allegiance this couple was living apart then the woman happy to be allowed to love and tend her children who were never of her own goodwill away from her and thankful to have saved such treasures as these out of the wreck in which the better part of her heart went down  these young ones had had no instructors save their mother and doctor tusher for their theology occasionally and had made more progress than might have been expected under a tutor so indulgent and fond as lady castlewood beatrix could sing and dance like a nymph her voice was her father’s delight after dinner she ruled over the house with little imperial ways which her parents coaxed and laughed at she had long learned the value of her bright eyes and tried experiments in coquetry in corpore vili upon rustics and country squires until she should prepare to conquer the world and the fashion she put on a new ribbon to welcome harry esmond made eyes at him and directed her young smiles at him not a little to the amusement of the young man and the joy of her father who laughed his great laugh and encouraged her in her thousand antics lady castlewood watched the child gravely and sadly the little one was pert in her replies to her mother yet eager in her protestations of love and promises of amendment and as ready to cry after a little quarrel brought on by her own giddiness until she had won back her mamma’s favour as she was to risk the kind lady’s displeasure by fresh outbreaks of restless vanity from her mother’s sad looks she fled to her father’s chair and boozy laughter she already set the one against the other and the little rogue delighted in the mischief which she knew how to make so early  the young heir of castlewood was spoiled by father and mother both he took their caresses as men do and as if they were his right he had his hawks and his spaniel dog his little horse and his beagles he had learned to ride and to drink and to shoot flying and he had a small court the sons of the huntsman and woodman as became the heirapparent taking after the example of my lord his father if he had a headache his mother was as much frightened as if the plague were in the house my lord laughed and jeered in his abrupt way—indeed ’twas on the day after new year’s day and an excess of mincepie—and said with some of his usual oaths—“d——n it harry esmond—you see how my lady takes on about frank’s megrim she used to be sorry about me my boy pass the tankard harry and to be frightened if i had a headache once she don’t care about my head now they’re like that—women are—all the same harry all jilts in their hearts stick to college—stick to punch and buttery ale and never see a woman that’s handsomer than an old cinderfaced bedmaker that’s my counsel”  it was my lord’s custom to fling out many jokes of this nature in presence of his wife and children at meals—clumsy sarcasms which my lady turned many a time or which sometimes she affected not to hear or which now and again would hit their mark and make the poor victim wince as you could see by her flushing face and eyes filling with tears or which again worked her up to anger and retort when in answer to one of these heavy bolts she would flash back with a quivering reply the pair were not happy nor indeed was it happy to be with them alas that youthful love and truth should end in bitterness and bankruptcy to see a young couple loving each other is no wonder but to see an old couple loving each other is the best sight of all harry esmond became the confidant of one and the other—that is my lord told the lad all his griefs and wrongs which were indeed of lord castlewood’s own making and harry divined my lady’s his affection leading him easily to penetrate the hypocrisy under which lady castlewood generally chose to go disguised and see her heart aching whilst her face wore a smile ’tis a hard task for women in life that mask which the world bids them wear but there is no greater crime than for a woman who is ill used and unhappy to show that she is so the world is quite relentless about bidding her to keep a cheerful face and our women like the malabar wives are forced to go smiling and painted to sacrifice themselves with their husbands their relations being the most eager to push them on to their duty and under their shouts and applauses to smother and hush their cries of pain  so into the sad secret of his patron’s household harry esmond became initiated he scarce knew how it had passed under his eyes two years before when he could not understand it but reading and thought and experience of men had oldened him and one of the deepest sorrows of a life which had never in truth been very happy came upon him now when he was compelled to understand and pity a grief which he stood quite powerless to relieve                      it hath been said my lord would never take the oath of allegiance nor his seat as a peer of the kingdom of ireland where indeed he had but a nominal estate and refused an english peerage which king william’s government offered him as a bribe to secure his loyalty  he might have accepted this and would doubtless but for the earnest remonstrances of his wife who ruled her husband’s opinions better than she could govern his conduct and who being a simplehearted woman with but one rule of faith and right never thought of swerving from her fidelity to the exiled family or of recognizing any other sovereign but king james and though she acquiesced in the doctrine of obedience to the reigning power no temptation she thought could induce her to acknowledge the prince of orange as rightful monarch nor to let her lord so acknowledge him so my lord castlewood remained a nonjuror all his life nearly though his selfdenial caused him many a pang and left him sulky and out of humour  the year after the revolution and all through king william’s life ’tis known there were constant intrigues for the restoration of the exiled family but if my lord castlewood took any share of these as is probable ’twas only for a short time and when harry esmond was too young to be introduced into such important secrets  but in the year 1695 when that conspiracy of sir john fenwick colonel lowick and others was set on foot for waylaying king william as he came from hampton court to london and a secret plot was formed in which a vast number of the nobility and people of honour were engaged father holt appeared at castlewood and brought a young friend with him a gentleman whom ’twas easy to see that both my lord and the father treated with uncommon deference harry esmond saw this gentleman and knew and recognized him in afterlife as shall be shown in its place and he has little doubt now that my lord viscount was implicated somewhat in the transactions which always kept father holt employed and travelling hither and thither under a dozen of different names and disguises the father’s companion went by the name of captain james and it was under a very different name and appearance that harry esmond afterwards saw him  it was the next year that the fenwick conspiracy blew up which is a matter of public history now and which ended in the execution of sir john and many more who suffered manfully for their treason and who were attended to tyburn by my lady’s father dean armstrong mr collier and other stout nonjuring clergymen who absolved them at the gallows’ foot  ’tis known that when sir john was apprehended discovery was made of a great number of names of gentlemen engaged in the conspiracy when with a noble wisdom and clemency the prince burned the list of conspirators furnished to him and said he would know no more now it was after this that lord castlewood swore his great oath that he would never so help him heaven be engaged in any transaction against that brave and merciful man and so he told holt when the indefatigable priest visited him and would have had him engage in a farther conspiracy after this my lord ever spoke of king william as he was—as one of the wisest the bravest and the greatest of men my lady esmond for her part said she could never pardon the king first for ousting his fatherinlaw from his throne and secondly for not being constant to his wife the princess mary indeed i think if nero were to rise again and be king of england and a good family man the ladies would pardon him my lord laughed at his wife’s objections—the standard of virtue did not fit him much  the last conference which mr holt had with his lordship took place when harry was come home for his first vacation from college harry saw his old tutor but for a halfhour and exchanged no private words with him and their talk whatever it might be left my lord viscount very much disturbed in mind—so much so that his wife and his young kinsman henry esmond could not but observe his disquiet after holt was gone my lord rebuffed esmond and again treated him with the greatest deference he shunned his wife’s questions and company and looked at his children with such a face of gloom and anxiety muttering “poor children—poor children” in a way that could not but fill those whose life it was to watch him and obey him with great alarm for which gloom each person interested in the lord castlewood framed in his or her own mind an interpretation  my lady with a laugh of cruel bitterness said “i suppose the person at hexton has been ill or has scolded him” for my lord’s infatuation about mrs marwood was known only too well young esmond feared for his money affairs into the condition of which he had been initiated and that the expenses always greater than his revenue had caused lord castlewood disquiet  one of the causes why my lord viscount had taken young esmond into his special favour was a trivial one that hath not before been mentioned though it was a very lucky accident in henry esmond’s life a very few months after my lord’s coming to castlewood in the wintertime—the little boy being a child in a petticoat trotting about—it happened that little frank was with his father after dinner who fell asleep over his wine heedless of the child who crawled to the fire and as good fortune would have it esmond was sent by his mistress for the boy just as the poor little screaming urchin’s coat was set on fire by a log when esmond rushing forward tore the dress off the infant so that his own hands were burned more than the child’s who was frightened rather than hurt by this accident but certainly ’twas providential that a resolute person should have come in at that instant or the child had been burned to death probably my lord sleeping very heavily after drinking and not waking so cool as a man should who had a danger to face  ever after this the father loud in his expressions of remorse and humility for being a tipsy goodfornothing and of admiration for harry esmond whom his lordship would style a hero for doing a very trifling service had the tenderest regard for his son’s preserver and harry became quite as one of the family his burns were tended with the greatest care by his kind mistress who said that heaven had sent him to be the guardian of her children and that she would love him all her life  and it was after this and from the very great love and tenderness which had grown up in this little household rather than to the exhortations of dean armstrong though these had no small weight with him that harry came to be quite of the religion of his house and his dear mistress of which he has ever since been a professing member as for dr tusher’s boasts that he was the cause of this conversion—even in these young days mr esmond had such a contempt for the doctor that had tusher bade him believe anything which he did not—never meddling at all harry would that instant have questioned the truth on’t  my lady seldom drank wine but on certain days of the year such as birthdays poor harry had never a one and anniversaries she took a little and this day the 29th december was one at the end then of this year ’96 it might have been a fortnight after mr holt’s last visit lord castlewood being still very gloomy in mind and sitting at table—my lady bidding a servant bring her a glass of wine and looking at her husband with one of her sweet smiles said—  “my lord will you not fill a bumper too and let me call a toast”  “what is it rachel” says he holding out his empty glass to be filled  “’tis the 29th of december” says my lady with her fond look of gratitude “and my toast is ‘harry—and god bless him who saved my boy’s life’ ”  my lord looked at harry hard and drank the glass but clapped it down on the table in a moment and with a sort of groan rose up and went out of the room what was the matter we all knew that some great grief was over him  whether my lord’s prudence had made him richer or legacies had fallen to him which enabled him to support a greater establishment than that frugal one which had been too much for his small means harry esmond knew not but the house of castlewood was now on a scale much more costly than it had been during the first year of his lordship’s coming to the title there were more horses in the stable and more servants in the hall and many more guests coming and going now than formerly when it was found difficult enough by the strictest economy to keep the house as befitted one of his lordship’s rank and the estate out of debt and it did not require very much penetration to find that many of the new acquaintances at castlewood were not agreeable to the lady there not that she ever treated them or any mortal with anything but courtesy but they were persons who could not be welcome to her and whose society a lady so refined and reserved could scarce desire for her children there came fuddling squires from the country round who bawled their songs under her windows and drank themselves tipsy with my lord’s punch and ale there came officers from hexton in whose company our little lord was made to hear talk and to drink and swear too in a way that made the delicate lady tremble for her son esmond tried to console her by saying what he knew of his college experience that with this sort of company and conversation a man must fall in sooner or later in his course through the world and it mattered very little whether he heard it at twelve years old or twenty—the youths who quitted mother’s apronstrings the latest being not uncommonly the wildest rakes but it was about her daughter that lady castlewood was the most anxious and the danger which she thought menaced the little beatrix from the indulgences which her father gave her it must be owned that my lord since these unhappy domestic differences especially was at once violent in his language to the children when angry as he was too familiar not to say coarse when he was in a good humour and from the company into which the careless lord brought the child  not very far off from castlewood is sark castle where the marchioness of sark lived who was known to have been a mistress of the late king charles—and to this house whither indeed a great part of the country gentry went my lord insisted upon going not only himself but on taking his little daughter and son to play with the children there the children were nothing loath for the house was splendid and the welcome kind enough but my lady justly no doubt thought that the children of such a mother as that noted lady sark had been could be no good company for her two and spoke her mind to her lord his own language when he was thwarted was not indeed of the gentlest to be brief there was a family dispute on this as there had been on many other points—and the lady was not only forced to give in for the other’s will was law—nor could she on account of their tender age tell her children what was the nature of her objection to their visit of pleasure or indeed mention to them any objection at all—but she had the additional secret mortification to find them returning delighted with their new friends loaded with presents from them and eager to be allowed to go back to a place of such delights as sark castle every year she thought the company there would be more dangerous to her daughter as from a child beatrix grew to a woman and her daily increasing beauty and many faults of character too expanded  it was harry esmond’s lot to see one of the visits which the old lady of sark paid to the lady of castlewood hall whither she came in state with six chestnut horses and blue ribbons a page on each carriage step a gentleman of the horse and armed servants riding before and behind her and but that it was unpleasant to see lady castlewood’s face it was amusing to watch the behaviour of the two enemies the frigid patience of the younger lady and the unconquerable good humour of the elder—who would see no offence whatever her rival intended and who never ceased to smile and to laugh and to coax the children and to pay compliments to every man woman child nay dog or chair and table in castlewood so bent was she upon admiring everything there she lauded the children and wished—as indeed she well might—that her own family had been brought up as well as those cherubs she had never seen such a complexion as dear beatrix’s—though to be sure she had a right to it from father and mother—lady castlewood’s was indeed a wonder of freshness and lady sark sighed to think she had not been born a fair woman and remarking harry esmond with a fascinating superannuated smile she complimented him on his wit which she said she could see from his eyes and forehead and vowed that she would never have him at sark until her daughter were out of the way    chapter xii my lord mohun comes among us for no good   there had ridden along with this old princess’s cavalcade two gentlemen her son my lord firebrace and his friend my lord mohun who both were greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the hospitable lord of castlewood my lord firebrace was but a feebleminded and weaklimbed young nobleman small in stature and limited in understanding—to judge from the talk young esmond had with him but the other was a person of a handsome presence with the bel air and a bright daring warlike aspect which according to the chronicle of those days had already achieved for him the conquest of several beauties and toasts he had fought and conquered in france as well as in flanders he had served a couple of campaigns with the prince of baden on the danube and witnessed the rescue of vienna from the turk and he spoke of his military exploits pleasantly and with the manly freedom of a soldier so as to delight all his hearers at castlewood who were little accustomed to meet a companion so agreeable  on the first day this noble company came my lord would not hear of their departure before dinner and carried away the gentlemen to amuse them whilst his wife was left to do the honours of her house to the old marchioness and her daughter within they looked at the stables where my lord mohun praised the horses though there was but a poor show there they walked over the old house and gardens and fought the siege of oliver’s time over again they played a game of rackets in the old court where my lord castlewood beat my lord mohun who said he loved ball of all things and would quickly come back to castlewood for his revenge after dinner they played bowls and drank punch in the green alley and when they parted they were sworn friends my lord castlewood kissing the other lord before he mounted on horseback and pronouncing him the best companion he had met for many a long day all night long over his tobaccopipe castlewood did not cease to talk to harry esmond in praise of his new friend and in fact did not leave off speaking of him until his lordship was so tipsy that he could not speak plainly any more  at breakfast next day it was the same talk renewed and when my lady said there was something free in the lord mohun’s looks and manner of speech which caused her to mistrust him her lord burst out with one of his laughs and oaths said that he never liked man woman or beast but what she was sure to be jealous of it that mohun was the prettiest fellow in england that he hoped to see more of him whilst in the country and that he would let mohun know what my lady prude said of him  “indeed” lady castlewood said “i liked his conversation well enough ’tis more amusing than that of most people i know i thought it i own too free not from what he said as rather from what he implied”  “psha your ladyship does not know the world” said her husband “and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen”  “you found no fault when i was a miss at fifteen”  “begad madam you are grown too old for a pinafore now and i hold that ’tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see” said my lord slapping the table  “indeed francis i never thought otherwise” answered my lady rising and dropping him a curtsy in which stately action if there was obedience there was defiance too and in which a bystander deeply interested in the happiness of that pair as harry esmond was might see how hopelessly separated they were what a great gulf of difference and discord had run between them  “by g——d mohun is the best fellow in england and i’ll invite him here just to plague that woman did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is harry that’s the way she treats me” he broke out storming and his face growing red as he clenched his fists and went on “i’m nobody in my own house i’m to be the humble servant of that parson’s daughter by jove i’d rather she should fling the dish at my head than sneer at me as she does she puts me to shame before the children with her d——d airs and i’ll swear tells frank and beaty that papa’s a reprobate and that they ought to despise me”  “indeed and indeed sir i never heard her say a word out of respect regarding you” harry esmond interposed  “no curse it i wish she would speak but she never does she scorns me and holds her tongue she keeps off from me as if i was a pestilence by george she was fond enough of her pestilence once and when i came acourting you would see miss blush—blush red by george for joy why what do you think she said to me harry she said herself when i joked with her about her d—d smiling red cheeks ‘’tis as they do at st james’s i put up my red flag when my king comes’ i was the king you see she meant but now sir look at her i believe she would be glad if i was dead and dead i’ve been to her these five years—ever since you all of you had the smallpox and she never forgave me for going away”  “indeed my lord though ’twas hard to forgive i think my mistress forgave it” harry esmond said “and remember how eagerly she watched your lordship’s return and how sadly she turned away when she saw your cold looks”  “damme” cries out my lord “would you have had me wait and catch the smallpox where the deuce had been the good of that i’ll bear danger with any man—but not useless danger—no no thank you for nothing and—you nod your head and i know very well parson harry what you mean there was the—the other affair to make her angry but is a woman never to forgive a husband who goes atripping do you take me for a saint”  “indeed sir i do not” says harry with a smile  “since that time my wife’s as cold as the statue at charing cross i tell thee she has no forgiveness in her henry her coldness blights my whole life and sends me to the punchbowl or driving about the country my children are not mine but hers when we are together ’tis only when she is out of sight with her abominable cold glances that run through me that they’ll come to me and that i dare to give them so much as a kiss and that’s why i take ’em and love ’em in other people’s houses harry i’m killed by the very virtue of that proud woman virtue give me the virtue that can forgive give me the virtue that thinks not of preserving itself but of making other folks happy damme what matters a scar or two if ’tis got in helping a friend in ill fortune”  and my lord again slapped the table and took a great draught from the tankard harry esmond admired as he listened to him and thought how the poor preacher of this selfsacrifice had fled from the smallpox which the lady had borne so cheerfully and which had been the cause of so much disunion in the lives of all in this house “how well men preach” thought the young man “and each is the example in his own sermon how each has a story in a dispute and a true one too and both are right or wrong as you will” harry’s heart was pained within him to watch the struggles and pangs that tore the breast of this kind manly friend and protector  “indeed sir” said he “i wish to god that my mistress could hear you speak as i have heard you she would know much that would make her life the happier could she hear it” but my lord flung away with one of his oaths and a jeer he said that parson harry was a good fellow but that as for women all women were alike—all jades and heartless so a man dashes a fine vase down and despises it for being broken it may be worthless—true but who had the keeping of it and who shattered it  harry who would have given his life to make his benefactress and her husband happy bethought him now that he saw what my lord’s state of mind was and that he really had a great deal of that love left in his heart and ready for his wife’s acceptance if she would take it whether he could not be a means of reconciliation between these two persons whom he revered the most in the world and he cast about how he should break a part of his mind to his mistress and warn her that in his harry’s opinion at least her husband was still her admirer and even her lover  but he found the subject a very difficult one to handle when he ventured to remonstrate which he did in the very gravest tone for long confidence and reiterated proofs of devotion and loyalty had given him a sort of authority in the house which he resumed as soon as ever he returned to it and with a speech that should have some effect as indeed it was uttered with the speaker’s own heart he ventured most gently to hint to his adored mistress that she was doing her husband harm by her ill opinion of him and that the happiness of all the family depended upon setting her right  she who was ordinarily calm and most gentle and full of smiles and soft attentions flushed up when young esmond so spoke to her and rose from her chair looking at him with a haughtiness and indignation that he had never before known her to display she was quite an altered being for that moment and looked an angry princess insulted by a vassal  “have you ever heard me utter a word in my lord’s disparagement” she asked hastily hissing out her words and stamping her foot  “indeed no” esmond said looking down  “are you come to me as his ambassador—you” she continued  “i would sooner see peace between you than anything else in the world” harry answered “and would go of any embassy that had that end”  “so you are my lord’s gobetween” she went on not regarding this speech “you are sent to bid me back into slavery again and inform me that my lord’s favour is graciously restored to his handmaid he is weary of covent garden is he that he comes home and would have the fatted calf killed”  “there’s good authority for it surely” said esmond  “for a son yes but my lord is not my son it was he who cast me away from him it was he who broke our happiness down and he bids me to repair it it was he who showed himself to me at last as he was not as i had thought him it is he who comes before my children stupid and senseless with wine—who leaves our company for that of frequenters of taverns and bagnios—who goes from his home to the city yonder and his friends there and when he is tired of them returns hither and expects that i shall kneel and welcome him and he sends you as his chamberlain what a proud embassy monsieur i make you my compliment of the new place”  “it would be a proud embassy and a happy embassy too could i bring you and my lord together” esmond replied  “i presume you have fulfilled your mission now sir ’twas a pretty one for you to undertake i don’t know whether ’tis your cambridge philosophy or time that has altered your ways of thinking” lady castlewood continued still in a sarcastic tone “perhaps you too have learned to love drink and to hiccup over your wine or punch—which is your worship’s favourite liquor perhaps you too put up at the ‘rose’ on your way through london and have your acquaintances in covent garden my services to you sir to principal and ambassador to master and—and lackey”  “great heavens madam” cried harry “what have i done that thus for a second time you insult me do you wish me to blush for what i used to be proud of that i lived on your bounty next to doing you a service which my life would pay for you know that to receive one from you is my highest pleasure what wrong have i done you that you should wound me so cruel woman”  “what wrong” she said looking at esmond with wild eyes “well none—none that you know of harry or could help why did you bring back the smallpox” she added after a pause “from castlewood village you could not help it could you which of us knows whither fate leads us but we were all happy henry till then” and harry went away from this colloquy thinking still that the estrangement between his patron and his beloved mistress was remediable and that each had at heart a strong attachment to the other  the intimacy between the lords mohun and castlewood appeared to increase as long as the former remained in the country and my lord of castlewood especially seemed never to be happy out of his new comrade’s sight they sported together they drank they played bowls and tennis my lord castlewood would go for three days to sark and bring back my lord mohun to castlewood—where indeed his lordship made himself very welcome to all persons having a joke or a new game at romps for the children all the talk of the town for my lord and music and gallantry and plenty of the beau langage for my lady and for harry esmond who was never tired of hearing his stories of his campaigns and his life at vienna venice paris and the famous cities of europe which he had visited both in peace and war and he sang at my lady’s harpsichord and played cards or backgammon or his new game of billiards with my lord of whom he invariably got the better always having a consummate good humour and bearing himself with a certain manly grace that might exhibit somewhat of the camp and alsatia perhaps but that had its charm and stamped him a gentleman and his manner to lady castlewood was so devoted and respectful that she soon recovered from the first feelings of dislike which she had conceived against him—nay before long began to be interested in his spiritual welfare and hopeful of his conversion lending him books of piety which he promised dutifully to study with her my lord talked of reform of settling into quiet life quitting the court and town and buying some land in the neighbourhood—though it must be owned that when the two lords were together over their burgundy after dinner their talk was very different and there was very little question of conversion on my lord mohun’s part when they got to their second bottle harry esmond used commonly to leave these two noble topers who though they talked freely enough heaven knows in his presence good lord what a set of stories of alsatia and spring garden of the taverns and gaminghouses of the ladies of the court and mesdames of the theatres he can recall out of their godly conversation—although i say they talked before esmond freely yet they seemed pleased when he went away and then they had another bottle and then they fell to cards and then my lord mohun came to her ladyship’s drawingroom leaving his boon companion to sleep off his wine  ’twas a point of honour with the fine gentlemen of those days to lose or win magnificently at their horsematches or games of cards and dice—and you could never tell from the demeanour of these two lords afterwards which had been successful and which the loser at their games and when my lady hinted to my lord that he played more than she liked he dismissed her with a “pish” and swore that nothing was more equal than play betwixt gentlemen if they did but keep it up long enough and these kept it up long enough you may be sure a man of fashion of that time often passed a quarter of his day at cards and another quarter at drink i have known many a pretty fellow who was a wit too ready of repartee and possessed of a thousand graces who would be puzzled if he had to write more than his name  there is scarce any thoughtful man or woman i suppose but can look back upon his course of past life and remember some point trifling as it may have seemed at the time of occurrence which has nevertheless turned and altered his whole career ’tis with almost all of us as in monsieur massillon’s magnificent image regarding king william a grain de sable that perverts or perhaps overthrows us and so it was but a light word flung in the air a mere freak of a perverse child’s temper that brought down a whole heap of crushing woes upon that family whereof harry esmond formed a part  coming home to his dear castlewood in the third year of his academical course wherein he had now obtained some distinction his latin poem on the death of the duke of gloucester princess anne of denmark’s son having gained him a medal and introduced him to the society of the university wits esmond found his little friend and pupil beatrix grown to be taller than her mother a slim and lovely young girl with cheeks mantling with health and roses with eyes like stars shining out of azure with waving bronze hair clustered about the fairest young forehead ever seen and a mien and shape haughty and beautiful such as that of the famous antique statue of the huntress diana—at one time haughty rapid imperious with eyes and arrows that dart and kill harry watched and wondered at this young creature and likened her in his mind to artemis with the ringing bow and shafts flashing death upon the children of niobe at another time she was coy and melting as luna shining tenderly upon endymion this fair creature this lustrous phoebe was only young as yet nor had nearly reached her full splendour but crescent and brilliant our young gentleman of the university his head full of poetical fancies his heart perhaps throbbing with desires undefined admired this rising young divinity and gazed at her though only as at some “bright particular star” far above his earth with endless delight and wonder she had been a coquette from the earliest times almost trying her freaks and jealousies her wayward frolics and winning caresses upon all that came within her reach she set her women quarrelling in the nursery and practised her eyes on the groom as she rode behind him on the pillion  she was the darling and torment of father and mother she intrigued with each secretly and bestowed her fondness and withdrew it plied them with tears smiles kisses cajolements—when the mother was angry as happened often flew to the father and sheltering behind him pursued her victim when both were displeased transferred her caresses to the domestics or watched until she could win back her parents’ good graces either by surprising them into laughter and good humour or appeasing them by submission and artful humility she was saevo laeta negotio like that fickle goddess horace describes and of whose “malicious joy” a great poet of our own has written so nobly—who famous and heroic as he was was not strong enough to resist the torture of women  it was but three years before that the child then but ten years old had nearly managed to make a quarrel between harry esmond and his comrade goodnatured phlegmatic thomas tusher who never of his own seeking quarrelled with anybody by quoting to the latter some silly joke which harry had made regarding him—it was the merest idlest jest though it near drove two old friends to blows and i think such a battle would have pleased her—and from that day tom kept at a distance from her and she respected him and coaxed him sedulously whenever they met but harry was much more easily appeased because he was fonder of the child and when she made mischief used cutting speeches or caused her friends pain she excused herself for her fault not by admitting and deploring it but by pleading not guilty and asserting innocence so constantly and with such seeming artlessness that it was impossible to question her plea in her childhood they were but mischiefs then which she did but her power became more fatal as she grew older—as a kitten first plays with a ball and then pounces on a bird and kills it ’tis not to be imagined that harry esmond had all this experience at this early stage of his life whereof he is now writing the history—many things here noted were but known to him in later days almost everything beatrix did or undid seemed good or at least pardonable to him then and years afterwards  it happened then that harry esmond came home to castlewood for his last vacation with good hopes of a fellowship at his college and a contented resolve to advance his fortune that way ’twas in the first year of the present century mr esmond as far as he knew the period of his birth being then twentytwo years old he found his quondam pupil shot up into this beauty of which we have spoken and promising yet more her brother my lord’s son a handsome highspirited brave lad generous and frank and kind to everybody save perhaps his sister with whom frank was at war and not from his but her fault—adoring his mother whose joy he was and taking her side in the unhappy matrimonial differences which were now permanent while of course mistress beatrix ranged with her father when heads of families fall out it must naturally be that their dependants wear the one or the other party’s colour and even in the parliaments in the servants’ hall or the stables harry who had an early observant turn could see which were my lord’s adherents and which my lady’s and conjecture pretty shrewdly how their unlucky quarrel was debated our lackeys sit in judgement on us my lord’s intrigues may be ever so stealthily conducted but his valet knows them and my lady’s woman carries her mistress’s private history to the servants’ scandalmarket and exchanges it against the secrets of other abigails    chapter xiii my lord leaves us and his evil behind him   my lord mohun of whose exploits and fame some of the gentlemen of the university had brought down but ugly reports was once more a guest at castlewood and seemingly more intimately allied with my lord even than before once in the spring those two noblemen had ridden to cambridge from newmarket whither they had gone for the horseracing and had honoured harry esmond with a visit at his rooms after which doctor montague the master of the college who had treated harry somewhat haughtily seeing his familiarity with these great folks and that my lord castlewood laughed and walked with his hand on harry’s shoulder relented to mr esmond and condescended to be very civil to him and some days after his arrival harry laughing told this story to lady esmond remarking how strange it was that men famous for learning and renowned over europe should nevertheless so bow down to a title and cringe to a nobleman ever so poor at this mistress beatrix flung up her head and said it became those of low origin to respect their betters that the parsons made themselves a great deal too proud she thought and that she liked the way at lady sark’s best where the chaplain though he loved pudding as all parsons do always went away before the custard  “and when i am a parson” says mr esmond “will you give me no custard beatrix”  “you—you are different” beatrix answered “you are of our blood”  “my father was a parson as you call him” said my lady  “but mine is a peer of ireland” says mistress beatrix tossing her head “let people know their places i suppose you will have me go down on my knees and ask a blessing of mr thomas tusher that has just been made a curate and whose mother was a waitingmaid”  and she tossed out of the room being in one of her flighty humours then  when she was gone my lady looked so sad and grave that harry asked the cause of her disquietude she said it was not merely what he said of newmarket but what she had remarked with great anxiety and terror that my lord ever since his acquaintance with the lord mohun especially had recurred to his fondness for play which he had renounced since his marriage  “but men promise more than they are able to perform in marriage” said my lady with a sigh “i fear he has lost large sums and our property always small is dwindling away under this reckless dissipation i heard of him in london with very wild company since his return letters and lawyers are constantly coming and going he seems to me to have a constant anxiety though he hides it under boisterousness and laughter i looked through—through the door last night and—and before” said my lady “and saw them at cards after midnight no estate will bear that extravagance much less ours which will be so diminished that my son will have nothing at all and my poor beatrix no portion”  “i wish i could help you madam” said harry esmond sighing and wishing that unavailingly and for the thousandth time in his life  “who can only god” said lady esmond—“only god in whose hands we are” and so it is and for his rule over his family and for his conduct to wife and children—subjects over whom his power is monarchical—any one who watches the world must think with trembling sometimes of the account which many a man will have to render for in our society there’s no law to control the king of the fireside he is master of property happiness—life almost he is free to punish to make happy or unhappy—to ruin or to torture he may kill a wife gradually and be no more questioned than the grand seignior who drowns a slave at midnight he may make slaves and hypocrites of his children or friends and freemen or drive them into revolt and enmity against the natural law of love i have heard politicians and coffeehouse wiseacres talking over the newspaper and railing at the tyranny of the french king and the emperor and wondered how these who are monarchs too in their way govern their own dominions at home where each man rules absolute when the annals of each little reign are shown to the supreme master under whom we hold sovereignty histories will be laid bare of household tyrants as cruel as amurath and as savage as nero and as reckless and dissolute as charles  if harry esmond’s patron erred ’twas in the latter way from a disposition rather selfindulgent than cruel and he might have been brought back to much better feelings had time been given to him to bring his repentance to a lasting reform  as my lord and his friend lord mohun were such close companions mistress beatrix chose to be jealous of the latter and the two gentlemen often entertained each other by laughing in their rude boisterous way at the child’s freaks of anger and show of dislike “when thou art old enough thou shalt marry lord mohun” beatrix’s father would say on which the girl would pout and say “i would rather marry tom tusher” and because the lord mohun always showed an extreme gallantry to my lady castlewood whom he professed to admire devotedly one day in answer to this old joke of her father’s beatrix said “i think my lord would rather marry mamma than marry me and is waiting till you die to ask her”  the words were said lightly and pertly by the girl one night before supper as the family party were assembled near the great fire the two lords who were at cards both gave a start my lady turned as red as scarlet and bade mistress beatrix go to her own chamber whereupon the girl putting on as her wont was the most innocent air said “i am sure i meant no wrong i am sure mamma talks a great deal more to harry esmond than she does to papa—and she cried when harry went away and she never does when papa goes away and last night she talked to lord mohun for ever so long and sent us out of the room and cried when we came back and——”  “d——n” cried out my lord castlewood out of all patience “go out of the room you little viper” and he started up and flung down his cards  “ask lord mohun what i said to him francis” her ladyship said rising up with a scared face but yet with a great and touching dignity and candour in her look and voice “come away with me beatrix” beatrix sprung up too she was in tears now  “dearest mamma what have i done” she asked “sure i meant no harm” and she clung to her mother and the pair went out sobbing together  “i will tell you what your wife said to me frank” my lord mohun cried—“parson harry may hear it and as i hope for heaven every word i say is true last night with tears in her eyes your wife implored me to play no more with you at dice or at cards and you know best whether what she asked was not for your good”  “of course it was mohun” says my lord in a dry hard voice “of course you are a model of a man and the world knows what a saint you are”  my lord mohun was separated from his wife and had had many affairs of honour of which women as usual had been the cause  “i am no saint though your wife is—and i can answer for my actions as other people must for their words” said my lord mohun  “by g—— my lord you shall” cried the other starting up  “we have another little account to settle first my lord” says lord mohun whereupon harry esmond filled with alarm for the consequences to which this disastrous dispute might lead broke out into the most vehement expostulations with his patron and his adversary “gracious heavens” he said “my lord are you going to draw a sword upon your friend in your own house can you doubt the honour of a lady who is as pure as heaven and would die a thousand times rather than do you a wrong are the idle words of a jealous child to set friends at variance has not my mistress as much as she dared to besought your lordship as the truth must be told to break your intimacy with my lord mohun and to give up the habit which may bring ruin on your family but for my lord mohun’s illness had he not left you”  “faith frank a man with a gouty toe can’t run after other men’s wives” broke out my lord mohun who indeed was in that way and with a laugh and a look at his swathed limb so frank and comical that the other dashing his fist across his forehead was caught by that infectious good humour and said with his oath “—— it harry i believe thee” and so this quarrel was over and the two gentlemen at swords drawn but just now dropped their points and shook hands  beati pacifici “go bring my lady back” said harry’s patron esmond went away only too glad to be the bearer of such good news he found her at the door she had been listening there but went back as he came she took both his hands hers were marble cold she seemed as if she would fall on his shoulder “thank you and god bless you my dear brother harry” she said she kissed his hand esmond felt her tears upon it and leading her into the room and up to my lord the lord castlewood with an outbreak of feeling and affection such as he had not exhibited for many a long day took his wife to his heart and bent over and kissed her and asked her pardon  “’tis time for me to go to roost i will have my gruel abed” said my lord mohun and limped off comically on harry esmond’s arm “by george that woman is a pearl” he said “and ’tis only a pig that wouldn’t value her have you seen the vulgar trapesing orangegirl whom esmond”—but here mr esmond interrupted him saying that these were not affairs for him to know  my lord’s gentleman came in to wait upon his master who was no sooner in his nightcap and dressinggown than he had another visitor whom his host insisted on sending to him and this was no other than the lady castlewood herself with the toast and gruel which her husband bade her make and carry with her own hands in to her guest  lord castlewood stood looking after his wife as she went on this errand and as he looked harry esmond could not but gaze on him and remarked in his patron’s face an expression of love and grief and care which very much moved and touched the young man lord castlewood’s hands fell down at his sides and his head on his breast and presently he said—  “you heard what mohun said parson”  “that my lady was a saint”  “that there are two accounts to settle i have been going wrong these five years harry esmond ever since you brought that damned smallpox into the house there has been a fate pursuing me and i had best have died of it and not run away from it like a coward i left beatrix with her relations and went to london and i fell among thieves harry and i got back to confounded cards and dice which i hadn’t touched since my marriage—no not since i was in the duke’s guard with those wild mohocks and i have been playing worse and worse and going deeper and deeper into it and i owe mohun two thousand pounds now and when it’s paid i am little better than a beggar i don’t like to look my boy in the face he hates me i know he does and i have spent beaty’s little portion and the lord knows what will come if i live the best thing i can do is to die and release what portion of the estate is redeemable for the boy”  mohun was as much master at castlewood as the owner of the hall itself and his equipages filled the stables where indeed there was room in plenty for many more horses than harry esmond’s impoverished patron could afford to keep he had arrived on horseback with his people but when his gout broke out my lord mohun sent to london for a light chaise he had drawn by a pair of small horses and running as swift wherever roads were good as a laplander’s sledge when this carriage came his lordship was eager to drive the lady castlewood abroad in it and did so many times and at a rapid pace greatly to his companion’s enjoyment who loved the swift motion and the healthy breezes over the downs which lie hard upon castlewood and stretch thence towards the sea as this amusement was very pleasant to her and her lord far from showing any mistrust of her intimacy with lord mohun encouraged her to be his companion as if willing by his present extreme confidence to make up for any past mistrust which his jealousy had shown the lady castlewood enjoyed herself freely in this harmless diversion which it must be owned her guest was very eager to give her and it seemed that she grew the more free with lord mohun and pleased with his company because of some sacrifice which his gallantry was pleased to make in her favour  seeing the two gentlemen constantly at cards still of evenings harry esmond one day deplored to his mistress that this fatal infatuation of her lord should continue and now they seemed reconciled together begged his lady to hint to her husband that he should play no more  but lady castlewood smiling archly and gaily said she would speak to him presently and that for a few nights more at least he might be let to have his amusement  “indeed madam” said harry “you know not what it costs you and ’tis easy for any observer who knows the game to see that lord mohun is by far the stronger of the two”  “i know he is” says my lady still with exceeding good humour “he is not only the best player but the kindest player in the world”  “madam madam” esmond cried transported and provoked “debts of honour must be paid some time or other and my master will be ruined if he goes on”  “harry shall i tell you a secret” my lady replied with kindness and pleasure still in her eyes “francis will not be ruined if he goes on he will be rescued if he goes on i repent of having spoken and thought unkindly of the lord mohun when he was here in the past year he is full of much kindness and good and ’tis my belief that we shall bring him to better things i have lent him tillotson and your favourite bishop taylor and he is much touched he says and as a proof of his repentance—and herein lies my secret—what do you think he is doing with francis he is letting poor frank win his money back again he hath won already at the last four nights and my lord mohun says that he will not be the means of injuring poor frank and my dear children”  “and in god’s name what do you return him for this sacrifice” asked esmond aghast who knew enough of men and of this one in particular to be aware that such a finished rake gave nothing for nothing “how in heaven’s name are you to pay him”  “pay him with a mother’s blessing and a wife’s prayers” cries my lady clasping her hands together harry esmond did not know whether to laugh to be angry or to love his dear mistress more than ever for the obstinate innocency with which she chose to regard the conduct of a man of the world whose designs he knew better how to interpret he told the lady guardedly but so as to make his meaning quite clear to her what he knew in respect of the former life and conduct of this nobleman of other women against whom he had plotted and whom he had overcome of the conversation which he harry himself had had with lord mohun wherein the lord made a boast of his libertinism and frequently avowed that he held all women to be fair game as his lordship styled this pretty sport and that they were all without exception to be won and the return harry had for his entreaties and remonstrances was a fit of anger on lady castlewood’s part who would not listen to his accusations she said and retorted that he himself must be very wicked and perverted to suppose evil designs where she was sure none were meant “and this is the good meddlers get of interfering” harry thought to himself with much bitterness and his perplexity and annoyance were only the greater because he could not speak to my lord castlewood himself upon a subject of this nature or venture to advise or warn him regarding a matter so very sacred as his own honour of which my lord was naturally the best guardian  but though lady castlewood would listen to no advice from her young dependant and appeared indignantly to refuse it when offered harry had the satisfaction to find that she adopted the counsel which she professed to reject for the next day she pleaded a headache when my lord mohun would have had her drive out and the next day the headache continued and next day in a laughing gay way she proposed that the children should take her place in his lordship’s car for they would be charmed with a ride of all things and she must not have all the pleasure for herself my lord gave them a drive with a very good grace though i dare say with rage and disappointment inwardly—not that his heart was very seriously engaged in his designs upon this simple lady but the life of such men is often one of intrigue and they can no more go through the day without a woman to pursue than a foxhunter without his sport after breakfast  under an affected carelessness of demeanour and though there was no outward demonstration of doubt upon his patron’s part since the quarrel between the two lords harry yet saw that lord castlewood was watching his guest very narrowly and caught signs of distrust and smothered rage as harry thought which foreboded no good on the point of honour esmond knew how touchy his patron was and watched him almost as a physician watches a patient and it seemed to him that this one was slow to take the disease though he could not throw off the poison when once it had mingled with his blood we read in shakespeare whom the writer for his part considers to be far beyond mr congreve mr dryden or any of the wits of the present period that when jealousy is once declared nor poppy nor mandragora nor all the drowsy syrups of the east will ever soothe it or medicine it away  in fine the symptoms seemed to be so alarming to this young physician who indeed young as he was had felt the kind pulses of all those dear kinsmen that harry thought it would be his duty to warn my lord mohun and let him know that his designs were suspected and watched so one day when in rather a pettish humour his lordship had sent to lady castlewood who had promised to drive with him and now refused to come harry said—“my lord if you will kindly give me a place by your side i will thank you i have much to say to you and would like to speak to you alone”  “you honour me by giving me your confidence mr henry esmond” says the other with a very grand bow my lord was always a fine gentleman and young as he was there was that in esmond’s manner which showed that he was a gentleman too and that none might take a liberty with him—so the pair went out and mounted the little carriage which was in waiting for them in the court with its two little creamcoloured hanoverian horses covered with splendid furniture and champing at the bit  “my lord” says harry esmond after they were got into the country and pointing to my lord mohun’s foot which was swathed in flannel and put up rather ostentatiously on a cushion—“my lord i studied medicine at cambridge”  “indeed parson harry” says he “and are you going to take out a diploma and cure your fellow student of the——”  “of the gout” says harry interrupting him and looking him hard in the face “i know a good deal about the gout”  “i hope you may never have it ’tis an infernal disease” says my lord “and its twinges are diabolical ah” and he made a dreadful wry face as if he just felt a twinge  “your lordship would be much better if you took off all that flannel—it only serves to inflame the toe” harry continued looking his man full in the face  “oh it only serves to inflame the toe does it” says the other with an innocent air  “if you took off that flannel and flung that absurd slipper away and wore a boot” continues harry  “you recommend me boots mr esmond” asks my lord  “yes boots and spurs i saw your lordship three days ago run down the gallery fast enough” harry goes on “i am sure that taking gruel at night is not so pleasant as claret to your lordship and besides it keeps your lordship’s head cool for play whilst my patron’s is hot and flustered with drink”  “’sdeath sir you dare not say that i don’t play fair” cries my lord whipping his horses which went away at a gallop  “you are cool when my lord is drunk” harry continued “your lordship gets the better of my patron i have watched you as i looked up from my books”  “you young argus” says lord mohun who liked harry esmond—and for whose company and wit and a certain daring manner harry had a great liking too—“you young argus you may look with all your hundred eyes and see we play fair i’ve played away an estate of a night and i’ve played my shirt off my back and i’ve played away my periwig and gone home in a nightcap but no man can say i ever took an advantage of him beyond the advantage of the game i played a dicecogging scoundrel in alsatia for his ears and won ’em and have one of ’em in my lodging in bow street in a bottle of spirits harry mohun will play any man for anything—always would”  “you are playing awful stakes my lord in my patron’s house” harry said “and more games than are on the cards”  “what do you mean sir” cries my lord turning round with a flush on his face  “i mean” answers harry in a sarcastic tone “that your gout is well—if ever you had it”  “sir” cried my lord getting hot  “and to tell the truth i believe your lordship has no more gout than i have at any rate change of air will do you good my lord mohun and i mean fairly that you had better go from castlewood”  “and were you appointed to give me this message” cries the lord mohun “did frank esmond commission you”  “no one did ’twas the honour of my family that commissioned me”  “and you are prepared to answer this” cries the other furiously lashing his horses  “quite my lord your lordship will upset the carriage if you whip so hotly”  “by george you have a brave spirit” my lord cried out bursting into a laugh “i suppose ’tis that infernal botte de jésuite that makes you so bold” he added  “’tis the peace of the family i love best in the world” harry esmond said warmly—“’tis the honour of a noble benefactor—the happiness of my dear mistress and her children i owe them everything in life my lord and would lay it down for any one of them what brings you here to disturb this quiet household what keeps you lingering month after month in the country what makes you feign illness and invent pretexts for delay is it to win my poor patron’s money be generous my lord and spare his weakness for the sake of his wife and children is it to practise upon the simple heart of a virtuous lady you might as well storm the tower singlehanded but you may blemish her name by light comments on it or by lawless pursuits—and i don’t deny that ’tis in your power to make her unhappy spare these innocent people and leave them”  “by the lord i believe thou hast an eye to the pretty puritan thyself master harry” says my lord with his reckless goodhumoured laugh and as if he had been listening with interest to the passionate appeal of the young man “whisper harry art thou in love with her thyself hath tipsy frank esmond come by the way of all flesh”  “my lord my lord” cried harry his face flushing and his eyes filling as he spoke “i never had a mother but i love this lady as one i worship her as a devotee worships a saint to hear her name spoken lightly seems blasphemy to me would you dare think of your own mother so or suffer any one so to speak of her it is a horror to me to fancy that any man should think of her impurely i implore you i beseech you to leave her danger will come out of it”  “danger psha” says my lord giving a cut to the horses which at this minute—for we were got on to the downs—fairly ran off into a gallop that no pulling could stop the rein broke in lord mohun’s hands and the furious beasts scampered madly forwards the carriage swaying to and fro and the persons within it holding on to the sides as best they might until seeing a great ravine before them where an upset was inevitable the two gentlemen leapt for their lives each out of his side of the chaise harry esmond was quit for a fall on the grass which was so severe that it stunned him for a minute but he got up presently very sick and bleeding at the nose but with no other hurt the lord mohun was not so fortunate he fell on his head against a stone and lay on the ground dead to all appearance  this misadventure happened as the gentlemen were on their return homewards and my lord castlewood with his son and daughter who were going out for a ride met the ponies as they were galloping with the car behind the broken traces entangling their heels and my lord’s people turned and stopped them it was young frank who spied out lord mohun’s scarlet coat as he lay on the ground and the party made up to that unfortunate gentleman and esmond who was now standing over him his large periwig and feathered hat had fallen off and he was bleeding profusely from a wound on the forehead and looking and being indeed a corpse  “great god he’s dead” says my lord “ride some one fetch a doctor—stay i’ll go home and bring back tusher he knows surgery” and my lord with his son after him galloped away  they were scarce gone when harry esmond who was indeed but just come to himself bethought him of a similar accident which he had seen on a ride from newmarket to cambridge and taking off a sleeve of my lord’s coat harry with a penknife opened a vein in his arm and was greatly relieved after a moment to see the blood flow he was near half an hour before he came to himself by which time doctor tusher and little frank arrived and found my lord not a corpse indeed but as pale as one  after a time and when he was able to bear motion they put my lord upon a groom’s horse and gave the other to esmond the men walking on each side of my lord to support him if need were and worthy doctor tusher with them little frank and harry rode together at a foot pace  when we rode together home the boy said “we met mamma who was walking on the terrace with the doctor and papa frightened her and told her you were dead——”  “that i was dead” asks harry  “yes papa says ‘here’s poor harry killed my dear’ on which mamma gives a great scream and oh harry she drops down and i thought she was dead too and you never saw such a way as papa was in he swore one of his great oaths and he turned quite pale and then he began to laugh somehow and he told the doctor to take his horse and me to follow him and we left him and i looked back and saw him dashing water out of the fountain on to mamma oh she was so frightened”  musing upon this curious history—for my lord mohun’s name was henry too and they called each other frank and harry often—and not a little disturbed and anxious esmond rode home his dear lady was on the terrace still one of her women with her and my lord no longer there there are steps and a little door thence down into the road my lord passed looking very ghastly with a handkerchief over his head and without his hat and periwig which a groom carried but his politeness did not desert him and he made a bow to the lady above  “thank heaven you are safe” she said  “and so is harry too mamma” says little frank—“huzzay”  harry esmond got off the horse to run to his mistress as did little frank and one of the grooms took charge of the two beasts while the other hat and periwig in hand walked by my lord’s bridle to the front gate which lay half a mile away  “oh my boy what a fright you have given me” lady castlewood said when harry esmond came up greeting him with one of her shining looks and a voice of tender welcome and she was so kind as to kiss the young man ’twas the second time she had so honoured him and she walked into the house between him and her son holding a hand of each    chapter xiv we ride after him to london   after a repose of a couple of days the lord mohun was so far recovered of his hurt as to be able to announce his departure for the next morning when accordingly he took leave of castlewood proposing to ride to london by easy stages and lie two nights upon the road his host treated him with a studied and ceremonious courtesy certainly different from my lord’s usual frank and careless demeanour but there was no reason to suppose that the two lords parted otherwise than good friends though harry esmond remarked that my lord viscount only saw his guest in company with other persons and seemed to avoid being alone with him nor did he ride any distance with lord mohun as his custom was with most of his friends whom he was always eager to welcome and unwilling to lose but contented himself when his lordship’s horses were announced and their owner appeared booted for his journey to take a courteous leave of the ladies of castlewood by following the lord mohun downstairs to his horses and by bowing and wishing him a good day in the courtyard “i shall see you in london before very long mohun” my lord said with a smile “when we will settle our accounts together”  “do not let them trouble you frank” said the other goodnaturedly and holding out his hand looked rather surprised at the grim and stately manner in which his host received his parting salutation and so followed by his people he rode away  harry esmond was witness of the departure it was very different to my lord’s coming for which great preparation had been made the old house putting on its best appearance to welcome its guest and there was a sadness and constraint about all persons that day which filled mr esmond with gloomy forebodings and sad indefinite apprehensions lord castlewood stood at the door watching his guest and his people as they went out under the arch of the outer gate when he was there lord mohun turned once more my lord viscount slowly raised his beaver and bowed his face wore a peculiar livid look harry thought he cursed and kicked away his dogs which came jumping about him—then he walked up to the fountain in the centre of the court and leaned against a pillar and looked into the basin as esmond crossed over to his own room late the chaplain’s on the other side of the court and turned to enter in at the low door he saw lady castlewood looking through the curtains of the great window of the drawingroom overhead at my lord as he stood regarding the fountain there was in the court a peculiar silence somehow and the scene remained long in esmond’s memory—the sky bright overhead the buttresses of the building and the sundial casting shadow over the gilt memento mori inscribed underneath the two dogs a black greyhound and a spaniel nearly white the one with his face up to the sun and the other snuffing amongst the grass and stones and my lord leaning over the fountain which was plashing audibly ’tis strange how that scene and the sound of that fountain remain fixed on the memory of a man who has beheld a hundred sights of splendour and danger too of which he has kept no account  it was lady castlewood she had been laughing all the morning and especially gay and lively before her husband and his guest who as soon as the two gentlemen went together from her room ran to harry the expression of her countenance quite changed now and with a face and eyes full of care and said “follow them harry i am sure something has gone wrong” and so it was that esmond was made an eavesdropper at this lady’s orders and retired to his own chamber to give himself time in truth to try and compose a story which would soothe his mistress for he could not but have his own apprehension that some serious quarrel was pending between the two gentlemen  and now for several days the little company at castlewood sat at table as of evenings this care though unnamed and invisible being nevertheless present alway in the minds of at least three persons there my lord was exceeding gentle and kind whenever he quitted the room his wife’s eyes followed him he behaved to her with a kind of mournful courtesy and kindness remarkable in one of his blunt ways and ordinary rough manner he called her by her christian name often and fondly was very soft and gentle with the children especially with the boy whom he did not love and being lax about church generally he went thither and performed all the offices down even to listening to doctor tusher’s sermon with great devotion  “he paces his room all night what is it henry find out what it is” lady castlewood said constantly to her young dependant “he has sent three letters to london” she said another day  “indeed madam they were to a lawyer” harry answered who knew of these letters and had seen a part of the correspondence which related to a new loan my lord was raising and when the young man remonstrated with his patron my lord said “he was only raising money to pay off an old debt on the property which must be discharged”  regarding the money lady castlewood was not in the least anxious few fond women feel moneydistressed indeed you can hardly give a woman a greater pleasure than to bid her pawn her diamonds for the man she loves and i remember hearing mr congreve say of my lord marlborough that the reason why my lord was so successful with women as a young man was because he took money of them “there are few men who will make such a sacrifice for them” says mr congreve who knew a part of the sex pretty well  harry esmond’s vacation was just over and as hath been said he was preparing to return to the university for his last term before taking his degree and entering into the church he had made up his mind for this office not indeed with that reverence which becomes a man about to enter upon a duty so holy but with a worldly spirit of acquiescence in the prudence of adopting that profession for his calling but his reasoning was that he owed all to the family of castlewood and loved better to be near them than anywhere else in the world that he might be useful to his benefactors who had the utmost confidence in him and affection for him in return that he might aid in bringing up the young heir of the house and acting as his governor that he might continue to be his dear patron’s and mistress’s friend and adviser who both were pleased to say that they should ever look upon him as such and so by making himself useful to those he loved best he proposed to console himself for giving up of any schemes of ambition which he might have had in his own bosom indeed his mistress had told him that she would not have him leave her and whatever she commanded was will to him  the lady castlewood’s mind was greatly relieved in the last few days of this wellremembered holiday time by my lord’s announcing one morning after the post had brought him letters from london in a careless tone that the lord mohun was gone to paris and was about to make a great journey in europe and though lord castlewood’s own gloom did not wear off or his behaviour alter yet this cause of anxiety being removed from his lady’s mind she began to be more hopeful and easy in her spirits striving too with all her heart and by all the means of soothing in her power to call back my lord’s cheerfulness and dissipate his moody humour  he accounted for it himself by saying that he was out of health that he wanted to see his physician that he would go to london and consult doctor cheyne it was agreed that his lordship and harry esmond should make the journey as far as london together and of a monday morning the 10th of october in the year 1700 they set forwards towards london on horseback the day before being sunday and the rain pouring down the family did not visit church and at night my lord read the service to his family very finely and with a peculiar sweetness and gravity—speaking the parting benediction harry thought as solemn as ever he heard it and he kissed and embraced his wife and children before they went to their own chambers with more fondness than he was ordinarily wont to show and with a solemnity and feeling of which they thought in after days with no small comfort  they took horse the next morning after adieux from the family as tender as on the night previous lay that night on the road and entered london at nightfall my lord going to the “trumpet” in the cockpit whitehall a house used by the military in his time as a young man and accustomed by his lordship ever since  an hour after my lord’s arrival which showed that his visit had been arranged beforehand my lord’s man of business arrived from gray’s inn and thinking that his patron might wish to be private with the lawyer esmond was for leaving them but my lord said his business was short introduced mr esmond particularly to the lawyer who had been engaged for the family in the old lord’s time who said that he had paid the money as desired that day to my lord mohun himself at his lodgings in bow street that his lordship had expressed some surprise as it was not customary to employ lawyers he said in such transactions between men of honour but nevertheless he had returned my lord viscount’s note of hand which he held at his client’s disposition  “i thought the lord mohun had been in paris” cried mr esmond in great alarm and astonishment  “he is come back at my invitation” said my lord viscount “we have accounts to settle together”  “i pray heaven they are over sir” says esmond  “oh quite” replied the other looking hard at the young man “he was rather troublesome about that money which i told you i had lost to him at play and now ’tis paid and we are quits on that score and we shall meet good friends again”  “my lord” cried out esmond “i am sure you are deceiving me and that there is a quarrel between the lord mohun and you”  “quarrel—pish we shall sup together this very night and drink a bottle every man is illhumoured who loses such a sum as i have lost but now ’tis paid and my anger is gone with it”  “where shall we sup sir” says harry  “we let some gentlemen wait till they are asked” says my lord viscount with a laugh “you go to duke street and see mr betterton you love the play i know leave me to follow my own devices and in the morning we’ll breakfast together with what appetite we may as the play says”  “by g—— my lord i will not leave you this night” says harry esmond “i think i know the cause of your dispute i swear to you ’tis nothing on the very day the accident befell lord mohun i was speaking to him about it i know that nothing has passed but idle gallantry on his part”  “you know that nothing has passed but idle gallantry between lord mohun and my wife” says my lord in a thundering voice—“you knew of this and did not tell me”  “i knew more of it than my dear mistress did herself sir—a thousand times more how was she who was as innocent as a child to know what was the meaning of the covert addresses of a villain”  “a villain he is you allow and would have taken my wife away from me”  “sir she is as pure as an angel” cried young esmond  “have i said a word against her” shrieks out my lord “did i ever doubt that she was pure it would have been the last day of her life when i did do you fancy i think that she would go astray no she hasn’t passion enough for that she neither sins nor forgives i know her temper—and now i’ve lost her by heaven i love her ten thousand times more than ever i did—yes when she was young and as beautiful as an angel—when she smiled at me in her old father’s house and used to lie in wait for me there as i came from hunting—when i used to fling my head down on her little knees and cry like a child on her lap—and swear i would reform and drink no more and play no more and follow women no more when all the men of the court used to be following her—when she used to look with her child more beautiful by george than the madonna in the queen’s chapel i am not good like her i know it who is—by heaven who is i tired and wearied her i know that very well i could not talk to her you men of wit and books could do that and i couldn’t—i felt i couldn’t why when you was but a boy of fifteen i could hear you two together talking your poetry and your books till i was in such a rage that i was fit to strangle you but you were always a good lad harry and i loved you you know i did and i felt she didn’t belong to me and the children don’t and i besotted myself and gambled and drank and took to all sorts of devilries out of despair and fury and now comes this mohun and she likes him i know she likes him”  “indeed and on my soul you are wrong sir” esmond cried  “she takes letters from him” cries my lord—“look here harry” and he pulled out a paper with a brown stain of blood upon it “it fell from him that day he wasn’t killed one of the grooms picked it up from the ground and gave it me here it is in their d——d comedy jargon ‘divine gloriana—why look so coldly on your slave who adores you have you no compassion on the tortures you have seen me suffering do you vouchsafe no reply to billets that are written with the blood of my heart’ she had more letters from him”  “but she answered none” cries esmond  “that’s not mohun’s fault” says my lord “and i will be revenged on him as god’s in heaven i will”  “for a light word or two will you risk your lady’s honour and your family’s happiness my lord” esmond interposed beseechingly  “psha—there shall be no question of my wife’s honour” said my lord “we can quarrel on plenty of grounds beside if i live that villain will be punished if i fall my family will be only the better there will only be a spendthrift the less to keep in the world and frank has better teaching than his father my mind is made up harry esmond and whatever the event is i am easy about it i leave my wife and you as guardians to the children”  seeing that my lord was bent upon pursuing this quarrel and that no entreaties would draw him from it harry esmond then of a hotter and more impetuous nature than now when care and reflection and grey hairs have calmed him thought it was his duty to stand by his kind generous patron and said—“my lord if you are determined upon war you must not go into it alone ’tis the duty of our house to stand by its chief and i should neither forgive myself nor you if you did not call me or i should be absent from you at a moment of danger”  “why harry my poor boy you are bred for a parson” says my lord taking esmond by the hand very kindly “and it were a great pity that you should meddle in the matter”  “your lordship thought of being a churchman once” harry answered “and your father’s orders did not prevent him fighting at castlewood against the roundheads your enemies are mine sir i can use the foils as you have seen indifferently well and don’t think i shall be afraid when the buttons are taken off ’em” and then harry explained with some blushes and hesitation for the matter was delicate and he feared lest by having put himself forward in the quarrel he might have offended his patron how he had himself expostulated with the lord mohun and proposed to measure swords with him if need were and he could not be got to withdraw peaceably in this dispute “and i should have beat him sir” says harry laughing “he never could parry that botte i brought from cambridge let us have half an hour of it and rehearse—i can teach it your lordship ’tis the most delicate point in the world and if you miss it your adversary’s sword is through you”  “by george harry you ought to be the head of the house” says my lord gloomily “you had been better lord castlewood than a lazy sot like me” he added drawing his hand across his eyes and surveying his kinsman with very kind and affectionate glances  “let us take our coats off and have half an hour’s practice before nightfall” says harry after thankfully grasping his patron’s manly hand  “you are but a little bit of a lad” says my lord goodhumouredly “but in faith i believe you could do for that fellow no my boy” he continued “i’ll have none of your feints and tricks of stabbing i can use my sword pretty well too and will fight my own quarrel my own way”  “but i shall be by to see fair play” cries harry  “yes god bless you—you shall be by”  “when is it sir” says harry for he saw that the matter had been arranged privately and beforehand by my lord  “’tis arranged thus i sent off a courier to jack westbury to say that i wanted him specially he knows for what and will be here presently and drink part of that bottle of sack then we shall go to the theatre in duke street where we shall meet mohun and then we shall all go sup at the ‘rose’ or the ‘greyhound’ then we shall call for cards and there will be probably a difference over the cards—and then god help us—either a wicked villain and traitor shall go out of the world or a poor worthless devil that doesn’t care to remain in it i am better away hal—my wife will be all the happier when i am gone” says my lord with a groan that tore the heart of harry esmond so that he fairly broke into a sob over his patron’s kind hand  “the business was talked over with mohun before he left home—castlewood i mean”—my lord went on “i took the letter in to him which i had read and i charged him with his villany and he could make no denial of it only he said that my wife was innocent”  “and so she is before heaven my lord she is” cries harry  “no doubt no doubt they always are” says my lord “no doubt when she heard he was killed she fainted from accident”  “but my lord my name is harry” cried out esmond burning red “you told my lady ‘harry was killed’ ”  “damnation shall i fight you too” shouts my lord in a fury “are you you little serpent warmed by my fire going to sting—you—no my boy you’re an honest boy you are a good boy” and here he broke from rage into tears even more cruel to see “you are an honest boy and i love you and by heavens i am so wretched that i don’t care what sword it is that ends me stop here’s jack westbury well jack welcome old boy this is my kinsman harry esmond”  “who brought your bowls for you at castlewood sir” says harry bowing and the three gentlemen sat down and drank of that bottle of sack which was prepared for them  “harry is number three” says my lord “you needn’t be afraid of him jack” and the colonel gave a look as much as to say “indeed he don’t look as if i need” and then my lord explained what he had only told by hints before when he quarrelled with lord mohun he was indebted to his lordship in a sum of sixteen hundred pounds for which lord mohun said he proposed to wait until my lord viscount should pay him my lord had raised the sixteen hundred pounds and sent them to lord mohun that morning and before quitting home had put his affairs into order and was now quite ready to abide the issue of the quarrel  when we had drunk a couple of bottles of sack a coach was called and the three gentlemen went to the duke’s playhouse as agreed the play was one of mr wycherley’s—love in a wood  harry esmond has thought of that play ever since with a kind of terror and of mrs bracegirdle the actress who performed the girl’s part in the comedy she was disguised as a page and came and stood before the gentlemen as they sat on the stage and looked over her shoulder with a pair of arch black eyes and laughed at my lord and asked what ailed the gentlemen from the country and had he had bad news from bullock fair  between the acts of the play the gentlemen crossed over and conversed freely there were two of lord mohun’s party captain macartney in a military habit and a gentleman in a suit of blue velvet and silver in a fair periwig with a rich fall of point of venice lace—my lord the earl of warwick and holland my lord had a paper of oranges which he ate and offered to the actresses joking with them and mrs bracegirdle when my lord mohun said something rude turned on him and asked him what he did there and whether he and his friends had come to stab anybody else as they did poor will mountford my lord’s dark face grew darker at this taunt and wore a mischievous fatal look they that saw it remembered it and said so afterward  when the play was ended the two parties joined company and my lord castlewood then proposed that they should go to a tavern and sup lockit’s the “greyhound” in charing cross was the house selected all six marched together that way the three lords going ahead lord mohun’s captain and colonel westbury and harry esmond walking behind them as they walked westbury told harry esmond about his old friend dick the scholar who had got promotion and was cornet of the guards and had wrote a book called the christian hero and had all the guards to laugh at him for his pains for the christian hero was breaking the commandments constantly westbury said and had fought one or two duels already and in a lower tone westbury besought young mr esmond to take no part in the quarrel “there was no need for more seconds than one” said the colonel “and the captain or lord warwick might easily withdraw” but harry said no he was bent on going through with the business indeed he had a plan in his head which he thought might prevent my lord viscount from engaging  they went in at the bar of the tavern and desired a private room and wine and cards and when the drawer had brought these they began to drink and call healths and as long as the servants were in the room appeared very friendly  harry esmond’s plan was no other than to engage in talk with lord mohun to insult him and so get the first of the quarrel so when cards were proposed he offered to play “psha” says my lord mohun whether wishing to save harry or not choosing to try the botte de jésuite it is not to be known—“young gentlemen from college should not play these stakes you are too young”  “who dares say i am too young” broke out harry “is your lordship afraid”  “afraid” cries out mohun  but my good lord viscount saw the move—“i’ll play you for ten moidores mohun” says he—“you silly boy we don’t play for groats here as you do at cambridge” and harry who had no such sum in his pocket for his halfyear’s salary was always pretty well spent before it was due fell back with rage and vexation in his heart that he had not money enough to stake  “i’ll stake the young gentleman a crown” says the lord mohun’s captain  “i thought crowns were rather scarce with the gentlemen of the army” says harry  “do they birch at college” says the captain  “they birch fools” says harry “and they cane bullies and they fling puppies into the water”  “faith then there’s some escapes drowning” says the captain who was an irishman and all the gentlemen began to laugh and made poor harry only more angry  my lord mohun presently snuffed a candle it was when the drawers brought in fresh bottles and glasses and were in the room—on which my lord viscount said—“the deuce take you mohun how damned awkward you are light the candle you drawer”  “damned awkward is a damned awkward expression my lord” says the other “town gentlemen don’t use such words—or ask pardon if they do”  “i’m a country gentleman” says my lord viscount  “i see it by your manner” says my lord mohun “no man shall say ‘damned awkward’ to me”  “i fling the words in your face my lord” says the other “shall i send the cards too”  “gentlemen gentlemen before the servants” cry out colonel westbury and my lord warwick in a breath the drawers go out of the room hastily they tell the people below of the quarrel upstairs  “enough has been said” says colonel westbury “will your lordships meet tomorrow morning”  “will my lord castlewood withdraw his words” asks the earl of warwick  “my lord castlewood will be —— first” says colonel westbury  “then we have nothing for it take notice gentlemen there have been outrageous words—reparation asked and refused”  “and refused” says my lord castlewood putting on his hat “where shall the meeting be and when”  “since my lord refuses me satisfaction which i deeply regret there is no time so good as now” says my lord mohun “let us have chairs and go to leicester field”  “are your lordship and i to have the honour of exchanging a pass or two” says colonel westbury with a low bow to my lord of warwick and holland  “it is an honour for me” says my lord with a profound congée “to be matched with a gentleman who has been at mons and namur”  “will your reverence permit me to give you a lesson” says the captain  “nay nay gentlemen two on a side are plenty” says harry’s patron “spare the boy captain macartney” and he shook harry’s hand—for the last time save one in his life  at the bar of the tavern all the gentlemen stopped and my lord viscount said laughing to the barwoman that those cards set people sadly aquarrelling but that the dispute was over now and the parties were all going away to my lord mohun’s house in bow street to drink a bottle more before going to bed  a halfdozen of chairs were now called and the six gentlemen stepping into them the word was privately given to the chairmen to go to leicester field where the gentlemen were set down opposite the “standard” tavern it was midnight and the town was abed by this time and only a few lights in the windows of the houses but the night was bright enough for the unhappy purpose which the disputants came about and so all six entered into that fatal square the chairmen standing without the railing and keeping the gate lest any persons should disturb the meeting  all that happened there hath been matter of public notoriety and is recorded for warning to lawless men in the annals of our country after being engaged for not more than a couple of minutes as harry esmond thought though being occupied at the time with his own adversary’s point which was active he may not have taken a good note of time a cry from the chairmen without who were smoking their pipes and leaning over the railings of the field as they watched the dim combat within announced that some catastrophe had happened which caused esmond to drop his sword and look round at which moment his enemy wounded him in the right hand but the young man did not heed this hurt much and ran up to the place where he saw his dear master was down  my lord mohun was standing over him  “are you much hurt frank” he asked in a hollow voice  “i believe i’m a dead man” my lord said from the ground  “no no not so” says the other “and i call god to witness frank esmond that i would have asked your pardon had you but given me a chance in—in the first cause of our falling out i swear that no one was to blame but me and—and that my lady——”  “hush” says my poor lord viscount lifting himself on his elbow and speaking faintly “’twas a dispute about the cards—the cursed cards harry my boy are you wounded too god help thee i loved thee harry and thou must watch over my little frank—and—and carry this little heart to my wife”  and here my dear lord felt in his breast for a locket he wore there and in the act fell back fainting  we were all at this terrified thinking him dead but esmond and colonel westbury bade the chairmen to come into the field and so my lord was carried to one mr aimes a surgeon in long acre who kept a bath and there the house was wakened up and the victim of this quarrel carried in  my lord viscount was put to bed and his wound looked to by the surgeon who seemed both kind and skilful when he had looked to my lord he bandaged up harry esmond’s hand who from loss of blood had fainted too in the house and may have been some time unconscious and when the young man came to himself you may be sure he eagerly asked what news there were of his dear patron on which the surgeon carried him to the room where the lord castlewood lay who had already sent for a priest and desired earnestly they said to speak with his kinsman he was lying on a bed very pale and ghastly with that fixed fatal look in his eyes which betokens death and faintly beckoning all the other persons away from him with his hand and crying out “only harry esmond” the hand fell powerless down on the coverlet as harry came forward and knelt down and kissed it  “thou art all but a priest harry” my lord viscount gasped out with a faint smile and pressure of his cold hand “are they all gone let me make thee a deathbed confession”  and with sacred death waiting as it were at the bedfoot as an awful witness of his words the poor dying soul gasped out his last wishes in respect of his family—his humble profession of contrition for his faults—and his charity towards the world he was leaving some things he said concerned harry esmond as much as they astonished him and my lord viscount sinking visibly was in the midst of these strange confessions when the ecclesiastic for whom my lord had sent mr atterbury arrived  this gentleman had reached to no great church dignity as yet but was only preacher at st bride’s drawing all the town thither by his eloquent sermons he was godson to my lord who had been pupil to his father had paid a visit to castlewood from oxford more than once and it was by his advice i think that harry esmond was sent to cambridge rather than to oxford of which place mr atterbury though a distinguished member spoke but ill  our messenger found the good priest already at his books at five o’clock in the morning and he followed the man eagerly to the house where my poor lord viscount lay—esmond watching him and taking his dying words from his mouth  my lord hearing of mr atterbury’s arrival and squeezing esmond’s hand asked to be alone with the priest and esmond left them there for this solemn interview you may be sure that his own prayers and grief accompanied that dying benefactor my lord had said to him that which confounded the young man—informed him of a secret which greatly concerned him indeed after hearing it he had had good cause for doubt and dismay for mental anguish as well as resolution while the colloquy between mr atterbury and his dying penitent took place within an immense contest of perplexity was agitating lord castlewood’s young companion  at the end of an hour—it may be more—mr atterbury came out of the room looking very hard at esmond and holding a paper  “he is on the brink of god’s awful judgement” the priest whispered “he has made his breast clean to me he forgives and believes and makes restitution shall it be in public shall we call a witness to sign it”  “god knows” sobbed out the young man “my dearest lord has only done me kindness all his life”  the priest put the paper into esmond’s hand he looked at it it swam before his eyes  “’tis a confession” he said  “’tis as you please” said mr atterbury  there was a fire in the room where the cloths were drying for the baths and there lay a heap in a corner saturated with the blood of my dear lord’s body esmond went to the fire and threw the paper into it ’twas a great chimney with glazed dutch tiles how we remember such trifles in such awful moments—the scrap of the book that we have read in a great grief—the taste of that last dish that we have eaten before a duel or some such supreme meeting or parting on the dutch tiles at the bagnio was a rude picture representing jacob in hairy gloves cheating isaac of esau’s birthright the burning paper lighted it up  “’tis only a confession mr atterbury” said the young man he leaned his head against the mantelpiece a burst of tears came to his eyes they were the first he had shed as he sat by his lord scared by this calamity and more yet by what the poor dying gentleman had told him and shocked to think that he should be the agent of bringing this double misfortune on those he loved best  “let us go to him” said mr esmond and accordingly they went into the next chamber where by this time the dawn had broke which showed my lord’s poor pale face and wild appealing eyes that wore that awful fatal look of coming dissolution the surgeon was with him he went into the chamber as atterbury came out thence my lord viscount turned round his sick eyes towards esmond it choked the other to hear that rattle in his throat  “my lord viscount” says mr atterbury “mr esmond wants no witnesses and hath burned the paper”  “my dearest master” esmond said kneeling down and taking his hand and kissing it  my lord viscount sprang up in his bed and flung his arms round esmond “god bl—bless” was all he said the blood rushed from his mouth deluging the young man my dearest lord was no more he was gone with a blessing on his lips and love and repentance and kindness in his manly heart  “benedicti benedicentes” says mr atterbury and the young man kneeling at the bedside groaned out an amen  “who shall take the news to her” was mr esmond’s next thought and on this he besought mr atterbury to bear the tidings to castlewood he could not face his mistress himself with those dreadful news mr atterbury complying kindly esmond writ a hasty note on his tablebook to my lord’s man bidding him get the horses for mr atterbury and ride with him and send esmond’s own valise to the gatehouse prison whither he resolved to go and give himself up     book ii contains mr esmond’s military life and other matters appertaining to the esmond family    chapter i i am in prison and visited but not consoled there   those may imagine who have seen death untimely strike down persons revered and beloved and know how unavailing consolation is what was harry esmond’s anguish after being an actor in that ghastly midnight scene of blood and homicide he could not he felt have faced his dear mistress and told her that story he was thankful that kind atterbury consented to break the sad news to her but besides his grief which he took into prison with him he had that in his heart which secretly cheered and consoled him  a great secret had been told to esmond by his unhappy stricken kinsman lying on his deathbed were he to disclose it as in equity and honour he might do the discovery would but bring greater grief upon those whom he loved best in the world and who were sad enough already should he bring down shame and perplexity upon all those beings to whom he was attached by so many tender ties of affection and gratitude degrade his father’s widow impeach and sully his father’s and kinsman’s honour and for what for a barren title to be worn at the expense of an innocent boy the son of his dearest benefactress he had debated this matter in his conscience whilst his poor lord was making his dying confession on one side were ambition temptation justice even but love gratitude and fidelity pleaded on the other and when the struggle was over in harry’s mind a glow of righteous happiness filled it and it was with grateful tears in his eyes that he returned thanks to god for that decision which he had been enabled to make  “when i was denied by my own blood” thought he “these dearest friends received and cherished me when i was a nameless orphan myself and needed a protector i found one in yonder kind soul who has gone to his account repenting of the innocent wrong he has done”  and with this consoling thought he went away to give himself up at the prison after kissing the cold lips of his benefactor  it was on the third day after he had come to the gatehouse prison where he lay in no small pain from his wound which inflamed and ached severely and with those thoughts and resolutions that have been just spoke of to depress and yet to console him that h esmond’s keeper came and told him that a visitor was asking for him and though he could not see her face which was enveloped in a black hood her whole figure too being veiled and covered with the deepest mourning esmond knew at once that his visitor was his dear mistress  he got up from his bed where he was lying being very weak and advancing towards her as the retiring keeper shut the door upon him and his guest in that sad place he put forward his left hand for the right was wounded and bandaged and he would have taken that kind one of his mistress which had done so many offices of friendship for him for so many years  but the lady castlewood went back from him putting back her hood and leaning against the great stanchioned door which the gaoler had just closed upon them her face was ghastly white as esmond saw it looking from the hood and her eyes ordinarily so sweet and tender were fixed at him with such a tragic glance of woe and anger as caused the young man unaccustomed to unkindness from that person to avert his own glances from her face  “and this mr esmond” she said “is where i see you and ’tis to this you have brought me”  “you have come to console me in my calamity madam” said he though in truth he scarce knew how to address her his emotions at beholding her so overpowered him  she advanced a little but stood silent and trembling looking out at him from her black draperies with her small white hands clasped together and quivering lips and hollow eyes  “not to reproach me” he continued after a pause “my grief is sufficient as it is”  “take back your hand—do not touch me with it” she cried “look there’s blood on it”  “i wish they had taken it all” said esmond “if you are unkind to me”  “where is my husband” she broke out “give me back my husband henry why did you stand by at midnight and see him murdered why did the traitor escape who did it you the champion of your house who offered to die for us you that he loved and trusted and to whom i confided him—you that vowed devotion and gratitude and i believed you—yes i believed you—why are you here and my noble francis gone why did you come among us you have only brought us grief and sorrow and repentance bitter bitter repentance as a return for our love and kindness did i ever do you a wrong henry you were but an orphan child when i first saw you—when he first saw you who was so good and noble and trusting he would have had you sent away but like a foolish woman i besought him to let you stay and you pretended to love us and we believed you—and you made our house wretched and my husband’s heart went from me and i lost him through you—i lost him—the husband of my youth i say i worshipped him you know i worshipped him—and he was changed to me he was no more my francis of old—my dear dear soldier he loved me before he saw you and i loved him oh god is my witness how i loved him why did he not send you from among us ’twas only his kindness that could refuse me nothing then and young as you were—yes and weak and alone—there was evil i knew there was evil in keeping you i read it in your face and eyes i saw that they boded harm to us—and it came i knew it would why did you not die when you had the smallpox—and i came myself and watched you and you didn’t know me in your delirium—and you called out for me though i was there at your side all that has happened since was a just judgement on my wicked heart—my wicked jealous heart oh i am punished—awfully punished my husband lies in his blood—murdered for defending me my kind kind generous lord—and you were by and you let him die henry”  these words uttered in the wildness of her grief by one who was ordinarily quiet and spoke seldom except with a gentle smile and a soothing tone rung in esmond’s ear and ’tis said that he repeated many of them in the fever into which he now fell from his wound and perhaps from the emotion which such passionate undeserved upbraidings caused him it seemed as if his very sacrifices and love for this lady and her family were to turn to evil and reproach as if his presence amongst them was indeed a cause of grief and the continuance of his life but woe and bitterness to theirs as the lady castlewood spoke bitterly rapidly without a tear he never offered a word of appeal or remonstrance but sat at the foot of his prisonbed stricken only with the more pain at thinking it was that soft and beloved hand which should stab him so cruelly and powerless against her fatal sorrow her words as she spoke struck the chords of all his memory and the whole of his boyhood and youth passed within him whilst this lady so fond and gentle but yesterday—this good angel whom he had loved and worshipped—stood before him pursuing him with keen words and aspect malign  “i wish i were in my lord’s place” he groaned out “it was not my fault that i was not there madam but fate is stronger than all of us and willed what has come to pass it had been better for me to have died when i had the illness”  “yes henry” said she—and as she spoke she looked at him with a glance that was at once so fond and so sad that the young man tossing up his arms wildly fell back hiding his head in the coverlet of the bed as he turned he struck against the wall with his wounded hand displacing the ligature and he felt the blood rushing again from the wound he remembered feeling a secret pleasure at the accident—and thinking “suppose i were to end now who would grieve for me”  this haemorrhage or the grief and despair in which the luckless young man was at the time of the accident must have brought on a deliquium presently for he had scarce any recollection afterwards save of some one his mistress probably seizing his hand—and then of the buzzing noise in his ears as he awoke with two or three persons of the prison around his bed whereon he lay in a pool of blood from his arm  it was now bandaged up again by the prison surgeon who happened to be in the place and the governor’s wife and servant kind people both were with the patient esmond saw his mistress still in the room when he awoke from his trance but she went away without a word though the governor’s wife told him that she sat in her room for some time afterward and did not leave the prison until she heard that esmond was likely to do well  days afterwards when esmond was brought out of a fever which he had and which attacked him that night pretty sharply the honest keeper’s wife brought her patient a handkerchief fresh washed and ironed and at the corner of which he recognized his mistress’s wellknown cipher and viscountess’s crown “the lady had bound it round his arm when he fainted and before she called for help” the keeper’s wife said “poor lady she took on sadly about her husband he has been buried today and a many of the coaches of the nobility went with him—my lord marlborough’s and my lord sunderland’s and many of the officers of the guards in which he served in the old king’s time and my lady has been with her two children to the king at kensington and asked for justice against my lord mohun who is in hiding and my lord the earl of warwick and holland who is ready to give himself up and take his trial”  such were the news coupled with assertions about her own honesty and that of molly her maid who would never have stolen a certain trumpery gold sleevebutton of mr esmond’s that was missing after his fainting fit that the keeper’s wife brought to her lodger his thoughts followed to that untimely grave the brave heart the kind friend the gallant gentleman honest of word and generous of thought if feeble of purpose but are his betters much stronger than he who had given him bread and shelter when he had none home and love when he needed them and who if he had kept one vital secret from him had done that of which he repented ere dying—a wrong indeed but one followed by remorse and occasioned by almost irresistible temptation  esmond took his handkerchief when his nurse left him and very likely kissed it and looked at the bauble embroidered in the corner “it has cost thee grief enough” he thought “dear lady so loving and so tender shall i take it from thee and thy children no never keep it and wear it my little frank my pretty boy if i cannot make a name for myself i can die without one some day when my dear mistress sees my heart i shall be righted or if not here or now why elsewhere where honour doth not follow us but where love reigns perpetual”  ’tis needless to narrate here as the reports of the lawyers already have chronicled them the particulars or issue of that trial which ensued upon my lord castlewood’s melancholy homicide of the two lords engaged in that said matter the second my lord the earl of warwick and holland who had been engaged with colonel westbury and wounded by him was found not guilty by his peers before whom he was tried under the presidence of the lord steward lord somers and the principal the lord mohun being found guilty of the manslaughter which indeed was forced upon him and of which he repented most sincerely pleaded his clergy and so was discharged without any penalty the widow of the slain nobleman as it was told us in prison showed an extraordinary spirit and though she had to wait for ten years before her son was old enough to compass it declared she would have revenge of her husband’s murderer so much and suddenly had grief anger and misfortune appeared to change her but fortune good or ill as i take it does not change men and women it but develops their characters as there are a thousand thoughts lying within a man that he does not know till he takes up the pen to write so the heart is a secret even to him or her who has it in his own breast who hath not found himself surprised into revenge or action or passion for good or evil whereof the seeds lay within him latent and unsuspected until the occasion called them forth with the death of her lord a change seemed to come over the whole conduct and mind of lady castlewood but of this we shall speak in the right season and anon  the lords being tried then before their peers at westminster according to their privilege being brought from the tower with state processions and barges and accompanied by lieutenants and axemen the commoners engaged in that melancholy fray took their trial at newgate as became them and being all found guilty pleaded likewise their benefit of clergy the sentence as we all know in these cases is that the culprit lies a year in prison or during the king’s pleasure and is burned in the hand or only stamped with a cold iron or this part of the punishment is altogether remitted at the grace of the sovereign so harry esmond found himself a criminal and a prisoner at twoandtwenty years old as for the two colonels his comrades they took the matter very lightly duelling was a part of their business and they could not in honour refuse any invitations of that sort  but the case was different with mr esmond his life was changed by that stroke of the sword which destroyed his kind patron’s as he lay in prison old dr tusher fell ill and died and lady castlewood appointed thomas tusher to the vacant living about the filling of which she had a thousand times fondly talked to harry esmond how they never should part how he should educate her boy how to be a country clergyman like saintly george herbert or pious dr ken was the happiness and greatest lot in life how if he were obstinately bent on it though for her part she owned rather to holding queen bess’s opinion that a bishop should have no wife and if not a bishop why a clergyman she would find a good wife for harry esmond and so on with a hundred pretty prospects told by fireside evenings in fond prattle as the children played about the hall all these plans were overthrown now thomas tusher wrote to esmond as he lay in prison announcing that his patroness had conferred upon him the living his reverend father had held for many years that she never after the tragical events which had occurred whereof tom spoke with a very edifying horror could see in the revered tusher’s pulpit or at her son’s table the man who was answerable for the father’s life that her ladyship bade him to say that she prayed for her kinsman’s repentance and his worldly happiness that he was free to command her aid for any scheme of life which he might propose to himself but that on this side of the grave she would see him no more and tusher for his own part added that harry should have his prayers as a friend of his youth and commended him whilst he was in prison to read certain works of theology which his reverence pronounced to be very wholesome for sinners in his lamentable condition  and this was the return for a life of devotion—this the end of years of affectionate intercourse and passionate fidelity harry would have died for his patron and was held as little better than his murderer he had sacrificed she did not know how much for his mistress and she threw him aside—he had endowed her family with all they had and she talked about giving him alms as to a menial the grief for his patron’s loss the pains of his own present position and doubts as to the future all these were forgotten under the sense of the consummate outrage which he had to endure and overpowered by the superior pang of that torture  he writ back a letter to mr tusher from his prison congratulating his reverence upon his appointment to the living of castlewood sarcastically bidding him to follow in the footsteps of his admirable father whose gown had descended upon him—thanking her ladyship for her offer of alms which he said he should trust not to need and beseeching her to remember that if ever her determination should change towards him he would be ready to give her proofs of a fidelity which had never wavered and which ought never to have been questioned by that house “and if we meet no more or only as strangers in this world” mr esmond concluded “a sentence against the cruelty and injustice of which i disdain to appeal hereafter she will know who was faithful to her and whether she had any cause to suspect the love and devotion of her kinsman and servant”  after the sending of this letter the poor young fellow’s mind was more at ease than it had been previously the blow had been struck and he had borne it his cruel goddess had shaken her wings and fled and left him alone and friendless but virtute sua and he had to bear him up at once the sense of his right and the feeling of his wrongs his honour and his misfortune as i have seen men waking and running to arms at a sudden trumpet before emergency a manly heart leaps up resolute meets the threatening danger with undaunted countenance and whether conquered or conquering faces it always ah no man knows his strength or his weakness till occasion proves them if there be some thoughts and actions of his life from the memory of which a man shrinks with shame sure there are some which he may be proud to own and remember forgiven injuries conquered temptations now and then and difficulties vanquished by endurance                      it was these thoughts regarding the living far more than any great poignancy of grief respecting the dead which affected harry esmond whilst in prison after his trial but it may be imagined that he could take no comrade of misfortune into the confidence of his feelings and they thought it was remorse and sorrow for his patron’s loss which affected the young man in error of which opinion he chose to leave them as a companion he was so moody and silent that the two officers his fellow sufferers left him to himself mostly liked little very likely what they knew of him consoled themselves with dice cards and the bottle and whiled away their own captivity in their own way it seemed to esmond as if he lived years in that prison and was changed and aged when he came out of it at certain periods of life we live years of emotion in a few weeks—and look back on those times as on great gaps between the old life and the new you do not know how much you suffer in those critical maladies of the heart until the disease is over and you look back on it afterwards during the time the suffering is at least sufferable the day passes in more or less of pain and the night wears away somehow ’tis only in afterdays that we see what the danger has been—as a man out ahunting or riding for his life looks at a leap and wonders how he should have survived the taking of it o dark months of grief and rage of wrong and cruel endurance he is old now who recalls you long ago he has forgiven and blest the soft hand that wounded him but the mark is there and the wound is cicatrized only—no time tears caresses or repentance can obliterate the scar we are indocile to put up with grief however reficimus rates quassas we tempt the ocean again and again and try upon new ventures esmond thought of his early time as a novitiate and of this past trial as an initiation before entering into life—as our young indians undergo tortures silently before they pass to the rank of warriors in the tribe  the officers meanwhile who were not let into the secret of the grief which was gnawing at the side of their silent young friend and being accustomed to such transactions in which one comrade or another was daily paying the forfeit of the sword did not of course bemoan themselves very inconsolably about the fate of their late companion in arms this one told stories of former adventures of love or war or pleasure in which poor frank esmond had been engaged t’other recollected how a constable had been bilked or a tavernbully beaten whilst my lord’s poor widow was sitting at his tomb worshipping him as an actual saint and spotless hero—so the visitors said who had news of lady castlewood and westbury and macartney had pretty nearly had all the town to come and see them  the duel its fatal termination the trial of the two peers and the three commoners concerned had caused the greatest excitement in the town the prints and news letters were full of them the three gentlemen in newgate were almost as much crowded as the bishops in the tower or a highwayman before execution we were allowed to live in the governor’s house as hath been said both before trial and after condemnation waiting the king’s pleasure nor was the real cause of the fatal quarrel known so closely had my lord and the two other persons who knew it kept the secret but every one imagined that the origin of the meeting was a gambling dispute except fresh air the prisoners had upon payment most things they could desire interest was made that they should not mix with the vulgar convicts whose ribald choruses and loud laughter and curses could be heard from their own part of the prison where they and the miserable debtors were confined pellmell    chapter ii i come to the end of my captivity but not of my trouble   among the company which came to visit the two officers was an old acquaintance of harry esmond that gentleman of the guards namely who had been so kind to harry when captain westbury’s troop had been quartered at castlewood more than seven years before dick the scholar was no longer dick the trooper now but captain steele of lucas’s fusiliers and secretary to my lord cutts that famous officer of king william’s the bravest and most beloved man of the english army the two jolly prisoners had been drinking with a party of friends for our cellar and that of the keepers of newgate too were supplied with endless hampers of burgundy and champagne that the friends of the colonels sent in and harry having no wish for their drink or their conversation being too feeble in health for the one and too sad in spirits for the other was sitting apart in his little room reading such books as he had one evening when honest colonel westbury flushed with liquor and always goodhumoured in and out of his cups came laughing into harry’s closet and said “ho young killjoy here’s a friend come to see thee he’ll pray with thee or he’ll drink with thee or he’ll drink and pray turn about dick my christian hero here’s the little scholar of castlewood”  dick came up and kissed esmond on both cheeks imparting a strong perfume of burnt sack along with his caress to the young man  “what is this the little man that used to talk latin and fetch our bowls how tall thou art grown i protest i should have known thee anywhere and so you have turned ruffian and fighter and wanted to measure swords with mohun did you i protest that mohun said at the guard dinner yesterday where there was a pretty company of us that the young fellow wanted to fight him and was the better man of the two”  “i wish we could have tried and proved it mr steele” says esmond thinking of his dead benefactor and his eyes filling with tears  with the exception of that one cruel letter which he had from his mistress mr esmond heard nothing from her and she seemed determined to execute her resolve of parting from him and disowning him but he had news of her such as it was which mr steele assiduously brought him from the prince’s and princesses’ court where our honest captain had been advanced to the post of gentleman waiter when off duty there captain dick often came to console his friends in captivity a good nature and a friendly disposition towards all who were in ill fortune no doubt prompting him to make his visits and good fellowship and good wine to prolong them  “faith” says westbury “the little scholar was the first to begin the quarrel—i mind me of it now—at lockit’s i always hated that fellow mohun what was the real cause of the quarrel betwixt him and poor frank i would wager ’twas a woman”  “’twas a quarrel about play—on my word about play” harry said “my poor lord lost great sums to his guest at castlewood angry words passed between them and though lord castlewood was the kindest and most pliable soul alive his spirit was very high and hence that meeting which has brought us all here” says mr esmond resolved never to acknowledge that there had ever been any other but cards for the duel  “i do not like to use bad words of a nobleman” says westbury “but if my lord mohun were a commoner i would say ’twas a pity he was not hanged he was familiar with dice and women at a time other boys are at school being birched he was as wicked as the oldest rake years ere he had done growing and handled a sword and a foil and a bloody one too before ever he used a razor he held poor will mountford in talk that night when bloody dick hill ran him through he will come to a bad end will that young lord and no end is bad enough for him” says honest mr westbury whose prophecy was fulfilled twelve years after upon that fatal day when mohun fell dragging down one of the bravest and greatest gentlemen in england in his fall  from mr steele then who brought the public rumour as well as his own private intelligence esmond learned the movements of his unfortunate mistress steele’s heart was of very inflammable composition and the gentleman usher spoke in terms of boundless admiration both of the widow that most beautiful woman as he said and of her daughter who in the captain’s eyes was a still greater paragon if the pale widow whom captain richard in his poetic rapture compared to a niobe in tears—to a sigismunda—to a weeping belvidera was an object the most lovely and pathetic which his eyes had ever beheld or for which his heart had melted even her ripened perfections and beauty were as nothing compared to the promise of that extreme loveliness which the good captain saw in her daughter it was matre pulcra filia pulcrior steele composed sonnets whilst he was on duty in his prince’s antechamber to the maternal and filial charms he would speak for hours about them to harry esmond and indeed he could have chosen few subjects more likely to interest the unhappy young man whose heart was now as always devoted to these ladies and who was thankful to all who loved them or praised them or wished them well  not that his fidelity was recompensed by any answering kindness or show of relenting even on the part of a mistress obdurate now after ten years of love and benefactions the poor young man getting no answer save tusher’s to that letter which he had written and being too proud to write more opened a part of his heart to steele than whom no man when unhappy could find a kinder hearer or more friendly emissary described in words which were no doubt pathetic for they came imo pectore and caused honest dick to weep plentifully his youth his constancy his fond devotion to that household which had reared him his affection how earned and how tenderly requited until but yesterday and as far as he might the circumstances and causes for which that sad quarrel had made of esmond a prisoner under sentence a widow and orphans of those whom in life he held dearest in terms that might well move a harderhearted man than young esmond’s confidant—for indeed the speaker’s own heart was half broke as he uttered them he described a part of what had taken place in that only sad interview which his mistress had granted him how she had left him with anger and almost imprecation whose words and thoughts until then had been only blessing and kindness how she had accused him of the guilt of that blood in exchange for which he would cheerfully have sacrificed his own indeed in this the lord mohun the lord warwick and all the gentlemen engaged as well as the common rumour out of doors—steele told him—bore out the luckless young man and with all his heart and tears he besought mr steele to inform his mistress of her kinsman’s unhappiness and to deprecate that cruel anger she showed him half frantic with grief at the injustice done him and contrasting it with a thousand soft recollections of love and confidence gone by that made his present misery inexpressibly more bitter the poor wretch passed many a lonely day and wakeful night in a kind of powerless despair and rage against his iniquitous fortune it was the softest hand that struck him the gentlest and most compassionate nature that persecuted him “i would as lief” he said “have pleaded guilty to the murder and have suffered for it like any other felon as have to endure the torture to which my mistress subjects me”  although the recital of esmond’s story and his passionate appeals and remonstrances drew so many tears from dick who heard them they had no effect upon the person whom they were designed to move esmond’s ambassador came back from the mission with which the poor young gentleman had charged him with a sad blank face and a shake of the head which told that there was no hope for the prisoner and scarce a wretched culprit in that prison of newgate ordered for execution and trembling for a reprieve felt more cast down than mr esmond innocent and condemned  as had been arranged between the prisoner and his counsel in their consultations mr steele had gone to the dowager’s house in chelsey where it has been said the widow and her orphans were had seen my lady viscountess and pleaded the cause of her unfortunate kinsman “and i think i spoke well my poor boy” says mr steele “for who would not speak well in such a cause and before so beautiful a judge i did not see the lovely beatrix sure her famous namesake of florence was never half so beautiful only the young viscount was in the room with the lord churchill my lord of marlborough’s eldest son but these young gentlemen went off to the garden i could see them from the window tilting at each other with poles in a mimic tournament grief touches the young but lightly and i remember that i beat a drum at the coffin of my own father my lady viscountess looked out at the two boys at their game and said—‘you see sir children are taught to use weapons of death as toys and to make a sport of murder’ and as she spoke she looked so lovely and stood there in herself so sad and beautiful an instance of that doctrine whereof i am a humble preacher that had i not dedicated my little volume of the christian hero i perceive harry thou hast not cut the leaves of it the sermon is good believe me though the preacher’s life may not answer it—i say hadn’t i dedicated the volume to lord cutts i would have asked permission to place her ladyship’s name on the first page i think i never saw such a beautiful violet as that of her eyes harry her complexion is of the pink of the blushrose she hath an exquisite turned wrist and dimpled hand and i make no doubt——”  “did you come to tell me about the dimples on my lady’s hand” broke out mr esmond sadly  “a lovely creature in affliction seems always doubly beautiful to me” says the poor captain who indeed was but too often in a state to see double and so checked he resumed the interrupted thread of his story “as i spoke my business” mr steele said “and narrated to your mistress what all the world knows and the other side hath been eager to acknowledge—that you had tried to put yourself between the two lords and to take your patron’s quarrel on your own point i recounted the general praises of your gallantry besides my lord mohun’s particular testimony to it i thought the widow listened with some interest and her eyes—i have never seen such a violet harry—looked up at mine once or twice but after i had spoken on this theme for a while she suddenly broke away with a cry of grief ‘i would to god sir’ she said ‘i had never heard that word gallantry which you use or known the meaning of it my lord might have been here but for that my home might be happy my poor boy have a father it was what you gentlemen call gallantry came into my home and drove my husband on to the cruel sword that killed him you should not speak the word to a christian woman sir—a poor widowed mother of orphans whose home was happy until the world came into it—the wicked godless world that takes the blood of the innocent and lets the guilty go free’  “as the afflicted lady spoke in this strain sir” mr steele continued “it seemed as if indignation moved her even more than grief ‘compensation’ she went on passionately her cheeks and eyes kindling ‘what compensation does your world give the widow for her husband and the children for the murderer of their father the wretch who did the deed has not even a punishment conscience what conscience has he who can enter the house of a friend whisper falsehood and insult to a woman that never harmed him and stab the kind heart that trusted him my lord—my lord wretch my lord villain’s my lord murderer’s peers meet to try him and they dismiss him with a word or two of reproof and send him into the world again to pursue women with lust and falsehood and to murder unsuspecting guests that harbour him that day my lord—my lord murderer—i will never name him—was let loose a woman was executed at tyburn for stealing in a shop but a man may rob another of his life or a lady of her honour and shall pay no penalty i take my child run to the throne and on my knees ask for justice and the king refuses me the king he is no king of mine—he never shall be he too robbed the throne from the king his father—the true king—and he has gone unpunished as the great do’  “i then thought to speak for you” mr steele continued “and i interposed by saying ‘there was one madam who at least would have put his own breast between your husband’s and my lord mohun’s sword your poor young kinsman harry esmond hath told me that he tried to draw the quarrel on himself’  “ ‘are you come from him’ asked the lady” so mr steele went on “rising up with a great severity and stateliness ‘i thought you had come from the princess i saw mr esmond in his prison and bade him farewell he brought misery into my house he never should have entered it’  “ ‘madam madam he is not to blame’ i interposed” continued mr steele  “ ‘do i blame him to you sir’ asked the widow ‘if ’tis he who sent you say that i have taken counsel where’—she spoke with a very pallid cheek now and a break in her voice—‘where all who ask may have it—and that it bids me to part from him and to see him no more we met in the prison for the last time—at least for years to come it may be in years hence when—when our knees and our tears and our contrition have changed our sinful hearts sir and wrought our pardon we may meet again—but not now after what has passed i could not bear to see him i wish him well sir but i wish him farewell too and if he has that—that regard towards us which he speaks of i beseech him to prove it by obeying me in this’  “ ‘i shall break the young man’s heart madam by this hard sentence’ ” mr steele said  “the lady shook her head” continued my kind scholar “ ‘the hearts of young men mr steele are not so made’ she said ‘mr esmond will find other—other friends the mistress of this house has relented very much towards the late lord’s son’ she added with a blush ‘and has promised me that is has promised that she will care for his fortune whilst i live in it after the horrid horrid deed which has passed castlewood must never be a home to him—never nor would i have him write to me—except—no—i would have him never write to me nor see him more give him if you will my parting—hush not a word of this before my daughter’  “here the fair beatrix entered from the river with her cheeks flushing with health and looking only the more lovely and fresh for the mourning habiliments which she wore and my lady viscountess said—  “ ‘beatrix this is mr steele gentlemanusher to the prince’s highness when does your new comedy appear mr steele’ i hope thou wilt be out of prison for the first night harry”  the sentimental captain concluded his sad tale saying “faith the beauty of filia pulcrior drove pulcram matrem out of my head and yet as i came down the river and thought about the pair the pallid dignity and exquisite grace of the matron had the uppermost and i thought her even more noble than the virgin”                      the party of prisoners lived very well in newgate and with comforts very different to those which were awarded to the poor wretches there his insensibility to their misery their gaiety still more frightful their curses and blasphemy hath struck with a kind of shame since—as proving how selfish during his imprisonment his own particular grief was and how entirely the thoughts of it absorbed him if the three gentlemen lived well under the care of the warden of newgate it was because they paid well and indeed the cost at the dearest ordinary or the grandest tavern in london could not have furnished a longer reckoning than our host of the “handcuff inn”—as colonel westbury called it our rooms were the three in the gate over newgate—on the second story looking up newgate street towards cheapside and paul’s church and we had leave to walk on the roof and could see thence smithfield and the bluecoat boys’ school gardens and the chartreux where as harry esmond remembered dick the scholar and his friend tom tusher had had their schooling  harry could never have paid his share of that prodigious heavy reckoning which my landlord brought to his guests once a week for he had but three pieces in his pockets that fatal night before the duel when the gentlemen were at cards and offered to play five but whilst he was yet ill at the gatehouse after lady castlewood had visited him there and before his trial there came one in an orangetawny coat and blue lace the livery which the esmonds always wore and brought a sealed packet for mr esmond which contained twenty guineas and a note saying that a counsel had been appointed for him and that more money would be forthcoming whenever he needed it  ’twas a queer letter from the scholar as she was or as she called herself the dowager viscountess castlewood written in the strange barbarous french which she and many other fine ladies of that time—witness her grace of portsmouth—employed indeed spelling was not an article of general commodity in the world then and my lord marlborough’s letters can show that he for one had but a little share of this part of grammar       mong coussin my lady viscountess dowager wrote je scay que vous     vous etes bravement

by the late king james to harry esmond’s father and in this state she had her train carried by a knight’s wife a cup and cover of assay to drink from and fringed cloth  he who was of the same age as little francis whom we shall henceforth call viscount castlewood here was hrh the prince of wales born in the same year and month with frank and just proclaimed at st germains king of great britain france and ireland    chapter iii i take the queen’s pay in quin’s regiment   the fellow in the orangetawny livery with blue lace and facings was in waiting when esmond came out of prison and taking the young gentleman’s slender baggage led the way out of that odious newgate and by fleet conduit down to the thames where a pair of oars was called and they went up the river to chelsea esmond thought the sun had never shone so bright nor the air felt so fresh and exhilarating temple garden as they rowed by looked like the garden of eden to him and the aspect of the quays wharves and buildings by the river somerset house and westminster where the splendid new bridge was just beginning lambeth tower and palace and that busy shining scene of the thames swarming with boats and barges filled his heart with pleasure and cheerfulness—as well such a beautiful scene might to one who had been a prisoner so long and with so many dark thoughts deepening the gloom of his captivity they rowed up at length to the pretty village of chelsey where the nobility have many handsome countryhouses and so came to my lady viscountess’s house a cheerful new house in the row facing the river with a handsome garden behind it and a pleasant lookout both towards surrey and kensington where stands the noble ancient palace of the lord warwick harry’s reconciled adversary  here in her ladyship’s saloon the young man saw again some of those pictures which had been at castlewood and which she had removed thence on the death of her lord harry’s father specially and in the place of honour was sir peter lely’s picture of the honourable mistress isabella esmond as diana in yellow satin with a bow in her hand and a crescent in her forehead and dogs frisking about her ’twas painted about the time when royal endymions were said to find favour with this virgin huntress and as goddesses have youth perpetual this one believed to the day of her death that she never grew older and always persisted in supposing the picture was still like her  after he had been shown to her room by the groom of the chamber who filled many offices besides in her ladyship’s modest household and after a proper interval his elderly goddess diana vouchsafed to appear to the young man a blackamoor in a turkish habit with red boots and a silver collar on which the viscountess’s arms were engraven preceded her and bore her cushion then came her gentlewoman a little pack of spaniels barking and frisking about preceded the austere huntress—then behold the viscountess herself “dropping odours” esmond recollected from his childhood that rich aroma of musk which his motherinlaw for she may be called so exhaled as the sky grows redder and redder towards sunset so in the decline of her years the cheeks of my lady dowager blushed more deeply her face was illuminated with vermilion which appeared the brighter from the white paint employed to set it off she wore the ringlets which had been in fashion in king charles’s time whereas the ladies of king william’s had headdresses like the towers of cybele her eyes gleamed out from the midst of this queer structure of paint dyes and pomatums such was my lady viscountess mr esmond’s father’s widow  he made her such a profound bow as her dignity and relationship merited and advanced with the greatest gravity and once more kissed that hand upon the trembling knuckles of which glittered a score of rings—remembering old times when that trembling hand made him tremble “marchioness” says he bowing and on one knee “is it only the hand i may have the honour of saluting” for accompanying that inward laughter which the sight of such an astonishing old figure might well produce in the young man there was goodwill too and the kindness of consanguinity she had been his father’s wife and was his grandfather’s daughter she had suffered him in old days and was kind to him now after her fashion and now that barsinister was removed from esmond’s thought and that secret opprobrium no longer cast upon his mind he was pleased to feel family ties and own them—perhaps secretly vain of the sacrifice he had made and to think that he esmond was really the chief of his house and only prevented by his own magnanimity from advancing his claim  at least ever since he had learned that secret from his poor patron on his dying bed actually as he was standing beside it he had felt an independency which he had never known before and which since did not desert him so he called his old aunt marchioness but with an air as if he was the marquis of esmond who so addressed her  did she read in the young gentleman’s eyes which had now no fear of hers or their superannuated authority that he knew or suspected the truth about his birth she gave a start of surprise at his altered manner indeed it was quite a different bearing to that of the cambridge student who had paid her a visit two years since and whom she had dismissed with five pieces sent by the groom of the chamber she eyed him then trembled a little more than was her wont perhaps and said “welcome cousin” in a frightened voice  his resolution as has been said before had been quite different namely so to bear himself through life as if the secret of his birth was not known to him but he suddenly and rightly determined on a different course he asked that her ladyship’s attendants should be dismissed and when they were private—“welcome nephew at least madam it should be” he said “a great wrong has been done to me and to you and to my poor mother who is no more”  “i declare before heaven that i was guiltless of it” she cried out giving up her cause at once “it was your wicked father who——”  “who brought this dishonour on our family” says mr esmond “i know it full well i want to disturb no one those who are in present possession have been my dearest benefactors and are quite innocent of intentional wrong to me the late lord my dear patron knew not the truth until a few months before his death when father holt brought the news to him”  “the wretch he had it in confession he had it in confession” cried out the dowager lady  “not so he learned it elsewhere as well as in confession” mr esmond answered “my father when wounded at the boyne told the truth to a french priest who was in hiding after the battle as well as to the priest there at whose house he died this gentleman did not think fit to divulge the story till he met with mr holt at st omer’s and the latter kept it back for his own purpose and until he had learned whether my mother was alive or no she is dead years since my poor patron told me with his dying breath and i doubt him not i do not know even whether i could prove a marriage i would not if i could i do not care to bring shame on our name or grief upon those whom i love however hardly they may use me my father’s son madam won’t aggravate the wrong my father did you continue to be his widow and give me your kindness ’tis all i ask from you and i shall never speak of this matter again”  “mais vous êtes un noble jeune homme” breaks out my lady speaking as usual with her when she was agitated in the french language  “noblesse oblige” says mr esmond making her a low bow “there are those alive to whom in return for their love to me i often fondly said i would give my life away shall i be their enemy now and quarrel about a title what matters who has it ’tis with the family still”  “what can there be in that little prude of a woman that makes men so raffoler about her” cries out my lady dowager “she was here for a month petitioning the king she is pretty and well conserved but she has not the bel air in his late majesty’s court all the men pretended to admire her and she was no better than a little wax doll she is better now and looks the sister of her daughter but what mean you all by bepraising her mr steele who was in waiting on prince george seeing her with her two children going to kensington writ a poem about her and says he shall wear her colours and dress in black for the future mr congreve says he will write a mourning widow that shall be better than his mourning bride though their husbands quarrelled and fought when that wretch churchill deserted the king for which he deserved to be hung lady marlborough has again gone wild about the little widow insulted me in my own drawingroom by saying that ’twas not the old widow but the young viscountess she had come to see little castlewood and little lord churchill are to be sworn friends and have boxed each other twice or thrice like brothers already ’twas that wicked young mohun who coming back from the provinces last year where he had disinterred her raved about her all the winter said she was a pearl set before swine and killed poor stupid frank the quarrel was all about his wife i know ’twas all about her was there anything between her and mohun nephew tell me now was there anything about yourself i do not ask you to answer questions” mr esmond blushed up “my lady’s virtue is like that of a saint in heaven madam” he cried out  “eh—mon neveu many saints get to heaven after having a deal to repent of i believe you are like all the rest of the fools and madly in love with her”  “indeed i loved and honoured her before all the world” esmond answered “i take no shame in that”  “and she has shut her door on you—given the living to that horrid young cub son of that horrid old bear tusher and says she will never see you more monsieur mon neveu—we are all like that when i was a young woman i’m positive that a thousand duels were fought about me and when poor monsieur de souchy drowned himself in the canal at bruges because i danced with count springbock i couldn’t squeeze out a single tear but danced till five o’clock the next morning ’twas the count—no ’twas my lord ormonde that paid the fiddles and his majesty did me the honour of dancing all night with me—how you are grown you have got the bel air you are a black man our esmonds are all black the little prude’s son is fair so was his father—fair and stupid you were an ugly little wretch when you came to castlewood—you were all eyes like a young crow we intended you should be a priest that awful father holt—how he used to frighten me when i was ill i have a comfortable director now—the abbé douillette—a dear man we make meagre on fridays always my cook is a devout pious man you of course are of the right way of thinking they say the prince of orange is very ill indeed”  in this way the old dowager rattled on remorselessly to mr esmond who was quite astounded with her present volubility contrasting it with her former haughty behaviour to him but she had taken him into favour for the moment and chose not only to like him as far as her nature permitted but to be afraid of him and he found himself to be as familiar with her now as a young man as when a boy he had been timorous and silent she was as good as her word respecting him she introduced him to her company of which she entertained a good deal—of the adherents of king james of course—and a great deal of loud intriguing took place over her cardtables she presented mr esmond as her kinsman to many persons of honour she supplied him not illiberally with money which he had no scruple in accepting from her considering the relationship which he bore to her and the sacrifices which he himself was making in behalf of the family but he had made up his mind to continue at no woman’s apronstrings longer and perhaps had cast about how he should distinguish himself and make himself a name which his singular fortune had denied him a discontent with his former bookish life and quietude—a bitter feeling of revolt at that slavery in which he had chosen to confine himself for the sake of those whose hardness towards him made his heart bleed—a restless wish to see men and the world—led him to think of the military profession at any rate to desire to see a few campaigns and accordingly he pressed his new patroness to get him a pair of colours and one day had the honour of finding himself appointed an ensign in colonel quin’s regiment of fusiliers on the irish establishment  mr esmond’s commission was scarce three weeks old when that accident befell king william which ended the life of the greatest the wisest the bravest and most clement sovereign whom england ever knew ’twas the fashion of the hostile party to assail this great prince’s reputation during his life but the joy which they and all his enemies in europe showed at his death is a proof of the terror in which they held him young as esmond was he was wise enough and generous enough too let it be said to scorn that indecency of gratulation which broke out amongst the followers of king james in london upon the death of this illustrious prince this invincible warrior this wise and moderate statesman loyalty to the exiled king’s family was traditional as has been said in that house to which mr esmond belonged his father’s widow had all her hopes sympathies recollections prejudices engaged on king james’s side and was certainly as noisy a conspirator as ever asserted the king’s rights or abused his opponent’s over a quadrille table or a dish of bohea her ladyship’s house swarmed with ecclesiastics in disguise and out with talebearers from st germains and quidnuncs that knew the last news from versailles nay the exact force and number of the next expedition which the french king was to send from dunkirk and which was to swallow up the prince of orange his army and his court she had received the duke of berwick when he landed here in ’96 she kept the glass he drank from vowing she never would use it till she drank king james the third’s health in it on his majesty’s return she had tokens from the queen and relics of the saint who if the story was true had not always been a saint as far as she and many others were concerned she believed in the miracles wrought at his tomb and had a hundred authentic stories of wondrous cures effected by the blessed king’s rosaries the medals which he wore the locks of his hair or what not esmond remembered a score of marvellous tales which the credulous old woman told him there was the bishop of autun that was healed of a malady he had for forty years and which left him after he said mass for the repose of the king’s soul there was monsieur marais a surgeon in auvergne who had a palsy in both his legs which was cured through the king’s intercession there was philip pitet of the benedictines who had a suffocating cough which wellnigh killed him but he besought relief of heaven through the merits and intercession of the blessed king and he straightway felt a profuse sweat breaking out all over him and was recovered perfectly and there was the wife of monsieur lepervier dancingmaster to the duke of saxegotha who was entirely eased of a rheumatism by the king’s intercession of which miracle there could be no doubt for her surgeon and his apprentice had given their testimony under oath that they did not in any way contribute to the cure of these tales and a thousand like them mr esmond believed as much as he chose his kinswoman’s greater faith had swallow for them all  the english high church party did not adopt these legends but truth and honour as they thought bound them to the exiled king’s side nor had the banished family any warmer supporter than that kind lady of castlewood in whose house esmond was brought up she influenced her husband very much more perhaps than my lord knew who admired his wife prodigiously though he might be inconstant to her and who adverse to the trouble of thinking himself gladly enough adopted the opinions which she chose for him to one of her simple and faithful heart allegiance to any sovereign but the one was impossible to serve king william for interest’s sake would have been a monstrous hypocrisy and treason her pure conscience could no more have consented to it than to a theft a forgery or any other base action lord castlewood might have been won over no doubt but his wife never could and he submitted his conscience to hers in this case as he did in most others when he was not tempted too sorely and it was from his affection and gratitude most likely and from that eager devotion for his mistress which characterized all esmond’s youth that the young man subscribed to this and other articles of faith which his fond benefactress set him had she been a whig he had been one had she followed mr fox and turned quaker no doubt he would have abjured ruffles and a periwig and have forsworn swords lace coats and clocked stockings in the scholars’ boyish disputes at the university where parties ran very high esmond was noted as a jacobite and very likely from vanity as much as affection took the side of his family  almost the whole of the clergy of the country and more than a half of the nation were on this side ours is the most loyal people in the world surely we admire our kings and are faithful to them long after they have ceased to be true to us ’tis a wonder to any one who looks back at the history of the stuart family to think how they kicked their crowns away from them how they flung away chances after chances what treasures of loyalty they dissipated and how fatally they were bent on consummating their own ruin if ever men had fidelity ’twas they if ever men squandered opportunity ’twas they and of all the enemies they had they themselves were the most fatal8  when the princess anne succeeded the wearied nation was glad enough to cry a truce from all these wars controversies and conspiracies and to accept in the person of a princess of the blood royal a compromise between the parties into which the country was divided the tories could serve under her with easy consciences though a tory herself she represented the triumph of the whig opinion the people of england always liking that their princes should be attached to their own families were pleased to think the princess was faithful to hers and up to the very last day and hour of her reign and but for that fatality which he inherited from his fathers along with their claims to the english crown king james the third might have worn it but he neither knew how to wait an opportunity nor to use it when he had it he was venturesome when he ought to have been cautious and cautious when he ought to have dared everything ’tis with a sort of rage at his inaptitude that one thinks of his melancholy story do the fates deal more specially with kings than with common men one is apt to imagine so in considering the history of that royal race in whose behalf so much fidelity so much valour so much blood were desperately and bootlessly expended  the king dead then the princess anne ugly anne hyde’s daughter our dowager at chelsey called her was proclaimed by trumpeting heralds all over the town from westminster to ludgate hill amidst immense jubilations of the people  next week my lord marlborough was promoted to the garter and to be captaingeneral of her majesty’s forces at home and abroad this appointment only inflamed the dowager’s rage or as she thought it her fidelity to her rightful sovereign “the princess is but a puppet in the hands of that fury of a woman who comes into my drawingroom and insults me to my face what can come to a country that is given over to such a woman” says the dowager “as for that doublefaced traitor my lord marlborough he has betrayed every man and every woman with whom he has had to deal except his horrid wife who makes him tremble ’tis all over with the country when it has got into the clutches of such wretches as these”  esmond’s old kinswoman saluted the new powers in this way but some good fortune at least occurred to a family which stood in great need of it by the advancement of these famous personages who benefited humbler people that had the luck of being in their favour before mr esmond left england in the month of august and being then at portsmouth where he had joined his regiment and was busy at drill learning the practice and mysteries of the musket and pike he heard that a pension on the stamp office had been got for his late beloved mistress and that the young mistress beatrix was also to be taken into court so much good at least had come of the poor widow’s visit to london not revenge upon her husband’s enemies but reconcilement to old friends who pitied and seemed inclined to serve her as for the comrades in prison and the late misfortune colonel westbury was with the captaingeneral gone to holland captain macartney was now at portsmouth with his regiment of fusiliers and the force under command of his grace the duke of ormonde bound for spain it was said my lord warwick was returned home and lord mohun so far from being punished for the homicide which had brought so much grief and change into the esmond family was gone in company of my lord macclesfield’s splendid embassy to the elector of hanover carrying the garter to his highness and a complimentary letter from the queen    chapter iv recapitulations   from such fitful lights as could be cast upon his dark history by the broken narrative of his poor patron torn by remorse and struggling in the last pangs of dissolution mr esmond had been made to understand so far that his mother was long since dead and so there could be no question as regarded her or her honour tarnished by her husband’s desertion and injury to influence her son in any steps which he might take either for prosecuting or relinquishing his own just claims it appeared from my poor lord’s hurried confession that he had been made acquainted with the real facts of the case only two years since when mr holt visited him and would have implicated him in one of those many conspiracies by which the secret leaders of king james’s party in this country were ever endeavouring to destroy the prince of orange’s life or power conspiracies so like murder so cowardly in the means used so wicked in the end that our nation has sure done well in throwing off all allegiance and fidelity to the unhappy family that could not vindicate its right except by such treachery—by such dark intrigue and base agents there were designs against king william that were no more honourable than the ambushes of cutthroats and footpads ’tis humiliating to think that a great prince possessor of a great and sacred right and upholder of a great cause should have stooped to such baseness of assassination and treasons as are proved by the unfortunate king james’s own warrant and signmanual given to his supporters in this country what he and they called levying war was in truth no better than instigating murder the noble prince of orange burst magnanimously through those feeble meshes of conspiracy in which his enemies tried to envelop him it seemed as if their cowardly daggers broke upon the breast of his undaunted resolution after king james’s death the queen and her people at st germains—priests and women for the most part—continued their intrigues in behalf of the young prince james the third as he was called in france and by his party here this prince or chevalier de st george was born in the same year with esmond’s young pupil frank my lord viscount’s son and the prince’s affairs being in the hands of priests and women were conducted as priests and women will conduct them artfully cruelly feebly and to a certain bad issue the moral of the jesuit’s story i think as wholesome a one as ever was writ the artfullest the wisest the most toilsome and dexterous plotbuilders in the world—there always comes a day when the roused public indignation kicks their flimsy edifice down and sends its cowardly enemies aflying mr swift hath finely described that passion for intrigue that love of secrecy slander and lying which belongs to weak people hangerson of weak courts ’tis the nature of such to hate and envy the strong and conspire their ruin and the conspiracy succeeds very well and everything presages the satisfactory overthrow of the great victim until one day gulliver rouses himself shakes off the little vermin of an enemy and walks away unmolested ah the irish soldiers might well say after the boyne “change kings with us and we will fight it over again” indeed the fight was not fair between the two ’twas a weak priestridden womanridden man with such puny allies and weapons as his own poor nature led him to choose contending against the schemes the generalship the wisdom and the heart of a hero  on one of these many coward’s errands then for as i view them now i can call them no less mr holt had come to my lord at castlewood proposing some infallible plan for the prince of orange’s destruction in which my lord viscount loyalist as he was had indignantly refused to join as far as mr esmond could gather from his dying words holt came to my lord with a plan of insurrection and offer of the renewal in his person of that marquis’s title which king james had conferred on the preceding viscount and on refusal of this bribe a threat was made on holt’s part to upset my lord viscount’s claim to his estate and title of castlewood altogether to back this astounding piece of intelligence of which henry esmond’s patron now had the first light holt came armed with the late lord’s dying declaration after the affair of the boyne at trim in ireland made both to the irish priest and a french ecclesiastic of holt’s order that was with king james’s army holt showed or pretended to show the marriage certificate of the late viscount esmond with my mother in the city of brussels in the year 1677 when the viscount then thomas esmond was serving with the english army in flanders he could show he said that this gertrude deserted by her husband long since was alive and a professed nun in the year 1685 at brussels in which year thomas esmond married his uncle’s daughter isabella now called viscountess dowager of castlewood and leaving him for twelve hours to consider this astounding news so the poor dying lord said disappeared with his papers in the mysterious way in which he came esmond knew how well enough by that window from which he had seen the father issue—but there was no need to explain to my poor lord only to gather from his parting lips the words which he would soon be able to utter no more  ere the twelve hours were over holt himself was a prisoner implicated in sir john fenwick’s conspiracy and locked up at hexton first whence he was transferred to the tower leaving the poor lord viscount who was not aware of the others being taken in daily apprehension of his return when as my lord castlewood declared calling god to witness and with tears in his dying eyes it had been his intention at once to give up his estate and his title to their proper owner and to retire to his own house at walcote with his family “and would to god i had done it” the poor lord said “i would not be here now wounded to death a miserable stricken man”  my lord waited day after day and as may be supposed no messenger came but at a month’s end holt got means to convey to him a message out of the tower which was to this effect that he should consider all unsaid that had been said and that things were as they were  “i had a sore temptation” said my poor lord “since i had come into this cursed title of castlewood which hath never prospered with me i have spent far more than the income of that estate and my paternal one too i calculated all my means down to the last shilling and found i never could pay you back my poor harry whose fortune i had had for twelve years my wife and children must have gone out of the house dishonoured and beggars god knows it hath been a miserable one for me and mine like a coward i clung to that respite which holt gave me i kept the truth from rachel and you i tried to win money of mohun and only plunged deeper into debt i scarce dared look thee in the face when i saw thee this sword hath been hanging over my head these two years i swear i felt happy when mohun’s blade entered my side”  after lying ten months in the tower holt against whom nothing could be found except that he was a jesuit priest known to be in king james’s interest was put on shipboard by the incorrigible forgiveness of king william who promised him however a hanging if ever he should again set foot on english shore more than once whilst he was in prison himself esmond had thought where those papers could be which the jesuit had shown to his patron and which had such an interest for himself they were not found on mr holt’s person when that father was apprehended for had such been the case my lords of the council had seen them and this family history had long since been made public however esmond cared not to seek the papers his resolution being taken his poor mother dead what matter to him that documents existed proving his right to a title which he was determined not to claim and of which he vowed never to deprive that family which he loved best in the world perhaps he took a greater pride out of his sacrifice than he would have had in those honours which he was resolved to forgo again as long as these titles were not forthcoming esmond’s kinsman dear young francis was the honourable and undisputed owner of the castlewood estate and title the mere word of a jesuit could not overset frank’s right of occupancy and so esmond’s mind felt actually at ease to think the papers were missing and in their absence his dear mistress and her son the lawful lady and lord of castlewood  very soon after his liberation mr esmond made it his business to ride to that village of ealing where he had passed his earliest years in this country and to see if his old guardians were still alive and inhabitants of that place but the only relic which he found of old monsieur pastoureau was a stone in the churchyard which told that athanasius pastoureau a native of flanders lay there buried aged 87 years the old man’s cottage which esmond perfectly recollected and the garden where in his childhood he had passed many hours of play and reverie and had many a beating from his termagant of a fostermother were now in the occupation of quite a different family and it was with difficulty that he could learn in the village what had come of pastoureau’s widow and children the clerk of the parish recollected her—the old man was scarce altered in the fourteen years that had passed since last esmond set eyes on him it appeared she had pretty soon consoled herself after the death of her old husband whom she ruled over by taking a new one younger than herself who spent her money and illtreated her and her children the girl died one of the boys ’listed the other had gone apprentice old mr rogers the clerk said he had heard that mrs pastoureau was dead too she and her husband had left ealing this seven year and so mr esmond’s hopes of gaining any information regarding his parentage from this family were brought to an end he gave the old clerk a crownpiece for his news smiling to think of the time when he and his little playfellows had slunk out of the churchyard or hidden behind the gravestones at the approach of this awful authority  who was his mother what had her name been when did she die esmond longed to find some one who could answer these questions to him and thought even of putting them to his aunt the viscountess who had innocently taken the name which belonged of right to henry’s mother but she knew nothing or chose to know nothing on this subject nor indeed could mr esmond press her much to speak on it father holt was the only man who could enlighten him and esmond felt he must wait until some fresh chance or new intrigue might put him face to face with his old friend or bring that restless indefatigable spirit back to england again  the appointment to his ensigncy and the preparations necessary for the campaign presently gave the young gentleman other matters to think of his new patroness treated him very kindly and liberally she promised to make interest and pay money too to get him a company speedily she bade him procure a handsome outfit both of clothes and of arms and was pleased to admire him when he made his first appearance in his laced scarlet coat and to permit him to salute her on the occasion of this interesting investiture “red” says she tossing up her old head “hath always been the colour worn by the esmonds” and so her ladyship wore it on her own cheeks very faithfully to the last she would have him be dressed she said as became his father’s son and paid cheerfully for his fivepound beaver his black buckled periwig and his fine holland shirts and his swords and his pistols mounted with silver since the day he was born poor harry had never looked such a fine gentleman his liberal stepmother filled his purse with guineas too some of which captain steele and a few choice spirits helped harry to spend in an entertainment which dick ordered and indeed would have paid for but that he had no money when the reckoning was called for nor would the landlord give him any more credit at the “garter” over against the gate of the palace in pall mall  the old viscountess indeed if she had done esmond any wrong formerly seemed inclined to repair it by the present kindness of her behaviour she embraced him copiously at parting wept plentifully bade him write by every packet and gave him an inestimable relic which she besought him to wear round his neck—a medal blessed by i know not what pope and worn by his late sacred majesty king james so esmond arrived at his regiment with a better equipage than most young officers could afford he was older than most of his seniors and had a further advantage which belonged but to very few of the army gentlemen in his day—many of whom could do little more than write their names—that he had read much both at home and at the university was master of two or three languages and had that further education which neither books nor years will give but which some men get from the silent teaching of adversity she is a great schoolmistress as many a poor fellow knows that hath held his hand out to her ferule and whimpered over his lesson before her awful chair    chapter v i go on the vigo bay expedition taste salt water and smell powder   the first expedition in which mr esmond had the honour to be engaged rather resembled one of the invasions projected by the redoubted captain avory or captain kid than a war between crowned heads carried on by generals of rank and honour on the 1st day of july 1702 a great fleet of a hundred and fifty sail set sail from spithead under the command of admiral shovell having on board 12000 troops with his grace the duke of ormond as the captaingeneral of the expedition one of these 12000 heroes having never been to sea before or at least only once in his infancy when he made the voyage to england from that unknown country where he was born—one of those 12000—the junior ensign of colonel quin’s regiment of fusiliers—was in a quite unheroic state of corporal prostration a few hours after sailing and an enemy had he boarded the ship would have had easy work of him from portsmouth we put into plymouth and took in fresh reinforcements we were off finisterre on the 31st of july so esmond’s tablebook informs him and on the 8th of august made the rock of lisbon by this time the ensign was grown as bold as an admiral and a week afterwards had the fortune to be under fire for the first time—and under water too—his boat being swamped in the surf in toros bay where the troops landed the ducking of his new coat was all the harm the young soldier got in this expedition for indeed the spaniards made no stand before our troops and were not in strength to do so  but the campaign if not very glorious was very pleasant new sights of nature by sea and land—a life of action beginning now for the first time—occupied and excited the young man the many accidents and the routine of shipboard—the military duty—the new acquaintances both of his comrades in arms and of the officers of the fleet—served to cheer and occupy his mind and waken it out of that selfish depression into which his late unhappy fortunes had plunged him he felt as if the ocean separated him from his past care and welcomed the new era of life which was dawning for him wounds heal rapidly in a heart of twoandtwenty hopes revive daily and courage rallies in spite of a man perhaps as esmond thought of his late despondency and melancholy and how irremediable it had seemed to him as he lay in his prison a few months back he was almost mortified in his secret mind at finding himself so cheerful  to see with one’s own eyes men and countries is better than reading all the books of travel in the world and it was with extreme delight and exultation that the young man found himself actually on his grand tour and in the view of people and cities which he had read about as a boy he beheld war for the first time—the pride pomp and circumstance of it at least if not much of the danger he saw actually and with his own eyes those spanish cavaliers and ladies whom he had beheld in imagination in that immortal story of cervantes which had been the delight of his youthful leisure ’tis forty years since mr esmond witnessed those scenes but they remain as fresh in his memory as on the day when first he saw them as a young man a cloud as of grief that had lowered over him and had wrapped the last years of his life in gloom seemed to clear away from esmond during this fortunate voyage and campaign his energies seemed to awaken and to expand under a cheerful sense of freedom was his heart secretly glad to have escaped from that fond but ignoble bondage at home was it that the inferiority to which the idea of his base birth had compelled him vanished with the knowledge of that secret which though perforce kept to himself was yet enough to cheer and console him at any rate young esmond of the army was quite a different being to the sad little dependant of the kind castlewood household and the melancholy student of trinity walks discontented with his fate and with the vocation into which that drove him and thinking with a secret indignation that the cassock and bands and the very sacred office with which he had once proposed to invest himself were in fact but marks of a servitude which was to continue all his life long for disguise it as he might to himself he had all along felt that to be castlewood’s chaplain was to be castlewood’s inferior still and that his life was but to be a long hopeless servitude so indeed he was far from grudging his old friend tom tusher’s good fortune as tom no doubt thought it had it been a mitre and lambeth which his friends offered him and not a small living and a country parsonage he would have felt as much a slave in one case as in the other and was quite happy and thankful to be free  the bravest man i ever knew in the army and who had been present in most of king william’s actions as well as in the campaigns of the great duke of marlborough could never be got to tell us of any achievement of his except that once prince eugene ordered him up a tree to reconnoitre the enemy which feat he could not achieve on account of the horseman’s boots he wore and on another day that he was very nearly taken prisoner because of these jackboots which prevented him from running away the present narrator shall imitate this laudable reserve and doth not intend to dwell upon his military exploits which were in truth not very different from those of a thousand other gentlemen this first campaign of mr esmond’s lasted but a few days and as a score of books have been written concerning it it may be dismissed very briefly here  when our fleet came within view of cadiz our commander sent a boat with a white flag and a couple of officers to the governor of cadiz don scipio de brancaccio with a letter from his grace in which he hoped that as don scipio had formerly served with the austrians against the french in england ’twas to be hoped that his excellency would now declare himself against the french king and for the austrian in the war between king philip and king charles but his excellency don scipio prepared a reply in which he announced that having served his former king with honour and fidelity he hoped to exhibit the same loyalty and devotion towards his present sovereign king philip v and by the time this letter was ready the officers who had been taken to see the town and the alameda and the theatre where bullfights are fought and the convents where the admirable works of don bartholomew murillo inspired one of them with a great wonder and delight—such as he had never felt before—concerning this divine art of painting and these sights over and a handsome refection and chocolate being served to the english gentlemen they were accompanied back to their shallop with every courtesy and were the only two officers of the english army that saw at that time that famous city  the general tried the power of another proclamation on the spaniards in which he announced that we only came in the interest of spain and king charles and for ourselves wanted to make no conquest nor settlement in spain at all but all this eloquence was lost upon the spaniards it would seem the captaingeneral of andalusia would no more listen to us than the governor of cadiz and in reply to his grace’s proclamation the marquis of villadarias fired off another which those who knew the spanish thought rather the best of the two and of this number was harry esmond whose kind jesuit in old days had instructed him and now had the honour of translating for his grace these harmless documents of war there was a hard touch for his grace and indeed for other generals in her majesty’s service in the concluding sentence of the don “that he and his council had the generous example of their ancestors to follow who had never yet sought their elevation in the blood or in the flight of their kings ‘mori pro patria’ was his device which the duke might communicate to the princess who governed england”  whether the troops were angry at this repartee or no ’tis certain something put them in a fury for not being able to get possession of cadiz our people seized upon port st mary’s and sacked it burning down the merchants’ storehouses getting drunk with the famous wines there pillaging and robbing quiet houses and convents murdering and doing worse and the only blood which mr esmond drew in this shameful campaign was the knocking down an english sentinel with a halfpike who was offering insult to a poor trembling nun is she going to turn out a beauty or a princess or perhaps esmond’s mother that he had lost and never seen alas no it was but a poor wheezy old dropsical woman with a wart on her nose but having been early taught a part of the roman religion he never had the horror of it that some protestants have shown and seem to think to be a part of ours  after the pillage and plunder of st mary’s and an assault upon a fort or two the troops all took shipping and finished their expedition at any rate more brilliantly than it had begun hearing that the french fleet with a great treasure was in vigo bay our admirals rooke and hopson pursued the enemy thither the troops landed and carried the forts that protected the bay hopson passing the boom first on board his ship the torbay and the rest of the ships english and dutch following him twenty ships were burned or taken in the port of redondilla and a vast deal more plunder than was ever accounted for but poor men before that expedition were rich afterwards and so often was it found and remarked that the vigo officers came home with pockets full of money that the notorious jack shafto who made such a figure at the coffeehouses and gamingtables in london and gave out that he had been a soldier at vigo owned when he was about to be hanged that bagshot heath had been his vigo and that he only spoke of la redondilla to turn away people’s eyes from the real place where the booty lay indeed hounslow or vigo—which matters much the latter was a bad business though mr addison did sing its praises in latin that honest gentleman’s muse had an eye to the main chance and i doubt whether she saw much inspiration in the losing side  but though esmond for his part got no share of this fabulous booty one great prize which he had out of the campaign was that excitement of action and change of scene which shook off a great deal of his previous melancholy he learnt at any rate to bear his fate cheerfully he brought back a browned face a heart resolute enough and a little pleasant store of knowledge and observation from that expedition which was over with the autumn when the troops were back in england again and esmond giving up his post of secretary to general lumley whose command was over and parting with that officer with many kind expressions of goodwill on the general’s side had leave to go to london to see if he could push his fortunes any way further and found himself once more in his dowager aunt’s comfortable quarters at chelsey and in greater favour than ever with the old lady he propitiated her with a present of a comb a fan and a black mantle such as the ladies of cadiz wear and which my lady viscountess pronounced became her style of beauty mightily and she was greatly edified at hearing of that story of his rescue of the nun and felt very little doubt but that her king james’s relic which he had always dutifully worn in his desk had kept him out of danger and averted the shot of the enemy my lady made feasts for him introduced him to more company and pushed his fortunes with such enthusiasm and success that she got a promise of a company for him through the lady marlborough’s interest who was graciously pleased to accept of a diamond worth a couple of hundred guineas which mr esmond was enabled to present to her ladyship through his aunt’s bounty and who promised that she would take charge of esmond’s fortune he had the honour to make his appearance at the queen’s drawingroom occasionally and to frequent my lord marlborough’s levees that great man received the young one with very especial favour so esmond’s comrades said and deigned to say that he had received the best reports of mr esmond both for courage and ability whereon you may be sure the young gentleman made a profound bow and expressed himself eager to serve under the most distinguished captain in the world  whilst his business was going on thus prosperously esmond had his share of pleasure too and made his appearance along with other young gentlemen at the coffeehouses the theatres and the mall he longed to hear of his dear mistress and her family many a time in the midst of the gaieties and pleasures of the town his heart fondly reverted to them and often as the young fellows of his society were making merry at the tavern and calling toasts as the fashion of that day was over their wine esmond thought of persons—of two fair women whom he had been used to adore almost and emptied his glass with a sigh  by this time the elder viscountess had grown tired again of the younger and whenever she spoke of my lord’s widow ’twas in terms by no means complimentary towards that poor lady the younger woman not needing her protection any longer the elder abused her most of the family quarrels that i have seen in life saving always those arising from money disputes when a division of twopencehalfpenny will often drive the dearest relatives into war and estrangement spring out of jealousy and envy jack and tom born of the same family and to the same fortune live very cordially together not until jack is ruined when tom deserts him but until tom makes a sudden rise in prosperity which jack can’t forgive ten times to one ’tis the unprosperous man that is angry not the other who is in fault ’tis mrs jack who can only afford a chair that sickens at mrs tom’s new coachandsix cries out against her sister’s airs and sets her husband against his brother ’tis jack who sees his brother shaking hands with a lord with whom jack would like to exchange snuffboxes himself that goes home and tells his wife how poor tom is spoiled he fears and no better than a sneak parasite and beggar on horseback i remember how furious the coffeehouse wits were with dick steele when he set up his coach and fine house in bloomsbury they began to forgive him when the bailiffs were after him and abused mr addison for selling dick’s countryhouse and yet dick in the spunginghouse or dick in the park with his four mares and plated harness was exactly the same gentle kindly improvident jovial dick steele and yet mr addison was perfectly right in getting the money which was his and not giving up the amount of his just claim to be spent by dick upon champagne and fiddlers laced clothes fine furniture and parasites jew and christian male and female who clung to him as according to the famous maxim of monsieur de rochefoucault “in our friends’ misfortunes there’s something secretly pleasant to us” so on the other hand their good fortune is disagreeable if ’tis hard for a man to bear his own good luck ’tis harder still for his friends to bear it for him and but few of them ordinarily can stand that trial whereas one of the “precious uses” of adversity is that it is a great reconciler that it brings back averted kindness disarms animosity and causes yesterday’s enemy to fling his hatred aside and hold out a hand to the fallen friend of old days there’s pity and love as well as envy in the same heart and towards the same person the rivalry stops when the competitor tumbles and as i view it we should look at these agreeable and disagreeable qualities of our humanity humbly alike they are consequent and natural and our kindness and meanness both manly  so you may either read the sentence that the elder of esmond’s two kinswomen pardoned the younger her beauty when that had lost somewhat of its freshness perhaps and forgot most her grievances against the other when the subject of them was no longer prosperous and enviable or we may say more benevolently but the sum comes to the same figures worked either way that isabella repented of her unkindness towards rachel when rachel was unhappy and bestirring herself in behalf of the poor widow and her children gave them shelter and friendship the ladies were quite good friends as long as the weaker one needed a protector before esmond went away on his first campaign his mistress was still on terms of friendship though a poor little chit a woman that had evidently no spirit in her c with the elder lady castlewood and mistress beatrix was allowed to be a beauty  but between the first year of queen anne’s reign and the second sad changes for the worse had taken place in the two younger ladies at least in the elder’s description of them rachel viscountess castlewood had no more face than a dumpling and mrs beatrix was grown quite coarse and was losing all her beauty little lord blandford she never would call him lord blandford his father was lord churchill—the king whom he betrayed had made him lord churchill and he was lord churchill still—might be making eyes at her but his mother that vixen of a sarah jennings would never hear of such a folly lady marlborough had got her to be a maid of honour at court to the princess but she would repent of it the widow francis she was but mrs francis esmond was a scheming artful heartless hussy she was spoiling her brat of a boy and she would end by marrying her chaplain  “what tusher” cried mr esmond feeling a strange pang of rage and astonishment  “yes—tusher my maid’s son and who has got all the qualities of his father the lackey in black and his accomplished mamma the waitingwoman” cries my lady “what do you suppose that a sentimental widow who will live down in that dingy dungeon of a castlewood where she spoils her boy kills the poor with her drugs has prayers twice a day and sees nobody but the chaplain—what do you suppose she can do mon cousin but let the horrid parson with his great square toes and hideous little green eyes make love to her cela c’est vu mon cousin when i was a girl at castlewood all the chaplains fell in love with me—they’ve nothing else to do”  my lady went on with more talk of this kind though in truth esmond had no idea of what she said further so entirely did her first words occupy his thought were they true not all nor half nor a tenth part of what the garrulous old woman said was true could this be so no ear had esmond for anything else though his patroness chattered on for an hour  some young gentlemen of the town with whom esmond had made acquaintance had promised to present him to that most charming of actresses and lively and agreeable of women mrs bracegirdle about whom harry’s old adversary mohun had drawn swords a few years before my poor lord and he fell out the famous mr congreve had stamped with his high approval to the which there was no gainsaying this delightful person and she was acting in dick steele’s comedies and finally and for twentyfour hours after beholding her mr esmond felt himself or thought himself to be as violently enamoured of this lovely brunette as were a thousand other young fellows about the city to have once seen her was to long to behold her again and to be offered the delightful privilege of her acquaintance was a pleasure the very idea of which set the young lieutenant’s heart on fire a man cannot live with comrades under the tents without finding out that he too is fiveandtwenty a young fellow cannot be cast down by grief and misfortune ever so severe but some night he begins to sleep sound and some day when dinnertime comes to feel hungry for a beefsteak time youth and good health new scenes and the excitement of action and a campaign had pretty well brought esmond’s mourning to an end and his comrades said that don dismal as they called him was don dismal no more so when a party was made to dine at the “rose” and go to the playhouse afterward esmond was as pleased as another to take his share of the bottle and the play  how was it that the old aunt’s news or it might be scandal about tom tusher caused such a strange and sudden excitement in tom’s old playfellow hadn’t he sworn a thousand times in his own mind that the lady of castlewood who had treated him with such kindness once and then had left him so cruelly was and was to remain henceforth indifferent to him for ever had his pride and his sense of justice not long since helped him to cure the pain of that desertion—was it even a pain to him now why but last night as he walked across the fields and meadows to chelsey from pall mall had he not composed two or three stanzas of a song celebrating bracegirdle’s brown eyes and declaring them a thousand times more beautiful than the brightest blue ones that ever languished under the lashes of an insipid fair beauty but tom tusher tom tusher the waitingwoman’s son raising up his little eyes to his mistress tom tusher presuming to think of castlewood’s widow rage and contempt filled mr harry’s heart at the very notion the honour of the family of which he was the chief made it his duty to prevent so monstrous an alliance and to chastise the upstart who could dare to think of such an insult to their house ’tis true mr esmond often boasted of republican principles and could remember many fine speeches he had made at college and elsewhere with worth and not birth for a text but tom tusher to take the place of the noble castlewood—faugh ’twas as monstrous as king hamlet’s widow taking off her weeds for claudius esmond laughed at all widows all wives all women and were the banns about to be published as no doubt they were that very next sunday at walcote church esmond swore that he would be present to shout no in the face of the congregation and to take a private revenge upon the ears of the bridegroom  instead of going to dinner then at the “rose” that night mr esmond bade his servant pack a portmanteau and get horses and was at farnham halfway on the road to walcote thirty miles off before his comrades had got to their supper after the play he bade his man give no hint to my lady dowager’s household of the expedition on which he was going and as chelsey was distant from london the roads bad and infested by footpads and esmond often in the habit when engaged in a party of pleasure of lying at a friend’s lodging in town there was no need that his old aunt should be disturbed at his absence—indeed nothing more delighted the old lady than to fancy that mon cousin the incorrigible young sinner was abroad boxing the watch or scouring st giles’s when she was not at her books of devotion she thought etheridge and sedley very good reading she had a hundred pretty stories about rochester harry jermyn and hamilton and if esmond would but have run away with the wife even of a citizen ’tis my belief she would have pawned her diamonds the best of them went to our lady of chaillot to pay his damages  my lord’s little house of walcote which he inhabited before he took his title and occupied the house of castlewood—lies about a mile from winchester and his widow had returned to walcote after my lord’s death as a place always dear to her and where her earliest and happiest days had been spent cheerfuller than castlewood which was too large for her straitened means and giving her too the protection of the exdean her father the young viscount had a year’s schooling at the famous college there with mr tusher as his governor so much news of them mr esmond had had during the past year from the old viscountess his own father’s widow from the young one there had never been a word  twice or thrice in his benefactor’s lifetime esmond had been to walcote and now taking but a couple of hours’ rest only at the inn on the road he was up again long before daybreak and made such good speed that he was at walcote by two o’clock of the day he rid to the inn of the village where he alighted and sent a man thence to mr tusher with a message that a gentleman from london would speak with him on urgent business the messenger came back to say the doctor was in town most likely at prayers in the cathedral my lady viscountess was there too she always went to cathedral prayers every day  the horses belonged to the posthouse at winchester esmond mounted again and rode on to the “george” whence he walked leaving his grumbling domestic at last happy with a dinner straight to the cathedral the organ was playing the winter’s day was already growing grey as he passed under the streetarch into the cathedralyard and made his way into the ancient solemn edifice    chapter vi the 29th december   there was scarce a score of persons in the cathedral besides the dean and some of his clergy and the choristers young and old that performed the beautiful evening prayer but dr tusher was one of the officiants and read from the eagle in an authoritative voice and a great black periwig and in the stalls still in her black widow’s hood sat esmond’s dear mistress her son by her side very much grown and indeed a noblelooking youth with his mother’s eyes and his father’s curling brown hair that fell over his point de venise—a pretty picture such as vandyke might have painted monsieur rigaud’s portrait of my lord viscount done at paris afterwards gives but a french version of his manly frank english face when he looked up there were two sapphire beams out of his eyes such as no painter’s palette has the colour to match i think on this day there was not much chance of seeing that particular beauty of my young lord’s countenance for the truth is he kept his eyes shut for the most part and the anthem being rather long was asleep  but the music ceasing my lord woke up looking about him and his eyes lighting on mr esmond who was sitting opposite him gazing with no small tenderness and melancholy upon two persons who had had so much of his heart for so many years lord castlewood with a start pulled at his mother’s sleeve her face had scarce been lifted from her book and said “look mother” so loud that esmond could hear on the other side of the church and the old dean on his throned stall lady castlewood looked for an instant as her son bade her and held up a warning finger to frank esmond felt his whole face flush and his heart throbbing as that dear lady beheld him once more the rest of the prayers were speedily over mr esmond did not hear them nor did his mistress very likely whose hood went more closely over her face and who never lifted her head again until the service was over the blessing given and mr dean and his procession of ecclesiastics out of the inner chapel  young castlewood came clambering over the stalls before the clergy were fairly gone and running up to esmond eagerly embraced him “my dear dearest old harry” he said “are you come back have you been to the wars you’ll take me with you when you go again why didn’t you write to us come to mother”  mr esmond could hardly say more than a “god bless you my boy” for his heart was very full and grateful at all this tenderness on the lad’s part and he was as much moved at seeing frank as he was fearful about that other interview which was now to take place for he knew not if the widow would reject him as she had done so cruelly a year ago  “it was kind of you to come back to us henry” lady esmond said “i thought you might come”  “we read of the fleet coming to portsmouth why did you not come from portsmouth” frank asked or my lord viscount as he now must be called  esmond had thought of that too he would have given one of his eyes so that he might see his dear friends again once more but believing that his mistress had forbidden him her house he had obeyed her and remained at a distance  “you had but to ask and you knew i would be here” he said  she gave him her hand her little fair hand there was only her marriage ring on it the quarrel was all over the year of grief and estrangement was passed they never had been separated his mistress had never been out of his mind all that time no not once no not in the prison nor in the camp nor on shore before the enemy nor at sea under the stars of solemn midnight nor as he watched the glorious rising of the dawn not even at the table where he sat carousing with friends or at the theatre yonder where he tried to fancy that other eyes were brighter than hers brighter eyes there might be and faces more beautiful but none so dear—no voice so sweet as that of his beloved mistress who had been sister mother goddess to him during his youth—goddess now no more for he knew of her weaknesses and by thought by suffering and that experience it brings was older now than she but more fondly cherished as woman perhaps than ever she had been adored as divinity  what is it where lies it the secret which makes one little hand the dearest of all whoever can unriddle that mystery here she was her son by his side his dear boy here she was weeping and happy she took his hand in both hers he felt her tears it was a rapture of reconciliation  “here comes squaretoes” says frank “here’s tusher”  tusher indeed now appeared creaking on his great heels mr tom had divested himself of his alb or surplice and came forward habited in his cassock and great black periwig how had harry esmond ever been for a moment jealous of this fellow  “give us thy hand tom tusher” he said the chaplain made him a very low and stately bow “i am charmed to see captain esmond” says he “my lord and i have read the reddas incolumem precor and applied it i am sure to you you come back with gaditanian laurels when i heard you were bound thither i wished i am sure i was another septimius my lord viscount your lordship remembers septimi gades aditure mecum”  “there’s an angle of earth that i love better than gades tusher” says mr esmond “’tis that one where your reverence hath a parsonage and where our youth was brought up”  “a house that has so many sacred recollections to me” says mr tusher and harry remembered how tom’s father used to flog him there—“a house near to that of my respected patron my most honoured patroness must ever be a dear abode to me but madam the verger waits to close the gates on your ladyship”  “and harry’s coming home to supper huzzay huzzay” cries my lord “mother shall i run home and bid beatrix put her ribbons on beatrix is a maid of honour harry such a fine setup minx”  “your heart was never in the church harry” the widow said in her sweet low tone as they walked away together now it seemed they had never been parted and again as if they had been ages asunder “i always thought you had no vocation that way and that ’twas a pity to shut you out from the world you would but have pined and chafed at castlewood and ’tis better you should make a name for yourself i often said so to my dear lord how he loved you ’twas my lord that made you stay with us”  “i asked no better than to stay near you always” said mr esmond  “but to go was best harry when the world cannot give peace you will know where to find it but one of your strong imagination and eager desires must try the world first before he tires of it ’twas not to be thought of or if it once was it was only by my selfishness that you should remain as chaplain to a country gentleman and tutor to a little boy you are of the blood of the esmonds kinsman and that was always wild in youth look at francis he is but fifteen and i scarce can keep him in my nest his talk is all of war and pleasure and he longs to serve in the next campaign perhaps he and the young lord churchill shall go the next lord marlborough has been good to us you know how kind they were in my misfortune and so was your—your father’s widow no one knows how good the world is till grief comes to try us ’tis through my lady marlborough’s goodness that beatrix hath her place at court and frank is under my lord chamberlain and the dowager lady your father’s widow has promised to provide for you—has she not”  esmond said “yes as far as present favour went lady castlewood was very good to him and should her mind change” he added gaily “as ladies’ minds will i am strong enough to bear my own burden and make my way somehow not by the sword very likely thousands have a better genius for that than i but there are many ways in which a young man of good parts and education can get on in the world and i am pretty sure one way or other of promotion” indeed he had found patrons already in the army and amongst persons very able to serve him too and told his mistress of the flattering aspect of fortune they walked as though they had never been parted slowly with the grey twilight closing round them  “and now we are drawing near to home” she continued “i knew you would come harry if—if it was but to forgive me for having spoken unjustly to you after that horrid—horrid misfortune i was half frantic with grief then when i saw you and i know now—they have told me that wretch whose name i can never mention even has said it how you tried to avert the quarrel and would have taken it on yourself my poor child but it was god’s will that i should be punished and that my dear lord should fall”  “he gave me his blessing on his deathbed” esmond said “thank god for that legacy”  “amen amen dear henry” says the lady pressing his arm “i knew it mr atterbury of st bride’s who was called to him told me so and i thanked god too and in my prayers ever since remembered it”  “you had spared me many a bitter night had you told me sooner” mr esmond said  “i know it i know it” she answered in a tone of such sweet humility as made esmond repent that he should ever have dared to reproach her “i know how wicked my heart has been and i have suffered too my dear i confessed to mr atterbury—i must not tell any more he—i said i would not write to you or go to you—and it was better even that having parted we should part but i knew you would come back—i own that that is no one’s fault and today henry in the anthem when they sang it ‘when the lord turned the captivity of zion we were like them that dream’ i thought yes like them that dream—them that dream and then it went ‘they that sow in tears shall reap in joy and he that goeth forth and weepeth shall doubtless come home again with rejoicing bringing his sheaves with him’ i looked up from the book and saw you i was not surprised when i saw you i knew you would come my dear and saw the gold sunshine round your head”  she smiled an almost wild smile as she looked up at him the moon was up by this time glittering keen in the frosty sky he could see for the first time now clearly her sweet careworn face  “do you know what day it is” she continued “it is the 29th of december—it is your birthday but last year we did not drink it—no no my lord was cold and my harry was likely to die and my brain was in a fever and we had no wine but now—now you are come again bringing your sheaves with you my dear” she burst into a wild flood of weeping as she spoke she laughed and sobbed on the young man’s heart crying out wildly “bringing your sheaves with you—your sheaves with you”  as he had sometimes felt gazing up from the deck at midnight into the boundless starlit depths overhead in a rapture of devout wonder at that endless brightness and beauty—in some such a way as now the depth of this pure devotion which was for the first time revealed to him quite smote upon him and filled his heart with thanksgiving gracious god who was he weak and friendless creature that such a love should be poured out upon him not in vain not in vain has he lived—hard and thankless should he be to think so—that has such a treasure given him what is ambition compared to that but selfish vanity to be rich to be famous what do these profit a year hence when other names sound louder than yours when you lie hidden away under the ground along with the idle titles engraven on your coffin but only true love lives after you—follows your memory with secret blessing—or precedes you and intercedes for you non omnis moriar—if dying i yet live in a tender heart or two nor am lost and hopeless living if a sainted departed soul still loves and prays for me  “if—if ’tis so dear lady” mr esmond said “why should i ever leave you if god hath given me this great boon—and near or far from me as i know now—the heart of my dearest mistress follows me let me have that blessing near me nor ever part with it till life separate us come away—leave this europe this place which has so many sad recollections for you begin a new life in a new world my good lord often talked of visiting that land in virginia which king charles gave us—gave his ancestor frank will give us that no man there will ask if there is a blot on my name or inquire in the woods what my title is”  “and my children—and my duty—and my good father—henry” she broke out “he has none but me now for soon my sister will leave him and the old man will be alone he has conformed since the new queen’s reign and here in winchester where they love him they have found a church for him when the children leave me i will stay with him i cannot follow them into the great world where their way lies—it scares me they will come and visit me and you will sometimes henry—yes sometimes as now in the holy advent season when i have seen and blessed you once more”  “i would leave all to follow you” said mr esmond “and can you not be as generous for me dear lady”  “hush boy” she said and it was with a mother’s sweet plaintive tone and look that she spoke “the world is beginning for you for me i have been so weak and sinful that i must leave it and pray out an expiation dear henry had we houses of religion as there were once and many divines of our church would have them again i often think i would retire to one and pass my life in penance but i would love you still—yes there is no sin in such a love as mine now and my dear lord in heaven may see my heart and knows the tears that have washed my sin away—and now—now my duty is here by my children whilst they need me and by my poor old father and——”  “and not by me” henry said  “hush” she said again and raised her hand up to his lip “i have been your nurse you could not see me harry when you were in the smallpox and i came and sat by you ah i prayed that i might die but it would have been in sin henry oh it is horrid to look back to that time it is over now and past and it has been forgiven me when you need me again i will come ever so far when your heart is wounded then come to me my dear be silent let me say all you never loved me dear henry—no you do not now and i thank heaven for it i used to watch you and knew by a thousand signs that it was so do you remember how glad you were to go away to college ’twas i sent you i told my papa that and mr atterbury too when i spoke to him in london and they both gave me absolution—both—and they are godly men having authority to bind and to loose and they forgave me as my dear lord forgave me before he went to heaven”  “i think the angels are not all in heaven” mr esmond said and as a brother folds a sister to his heart and as a mother cleaves to her son’s breast—so for a few moments esmond’s beloved mistress came to him and blessed him    chapter vii i am made welcome at walcote   as they came up to the house at walcote the windows from within were lighted up with friendly welcome the suppertable was spread in the oakparlour it seemed as if forgiveness and love were awaiting the returning prodigal two or three familiar faces of domestics were on the lookout at the porch—the old housekeeper was there and young lockwood from castlewood in my lord’s livery of tawny and blue his dear mistress pressed his arm as they passed into the hall her eyes beamed out on him with affection indescribable “welcome” was all she said as she looked up putting back her fair curls and black hood a sweet rosy smile blushed on her face harry thought he had never seen her look so charming her face was lighted with a joy that was brighter than beauty—she took a hand of her son who was in the hall waiting his mother—she did not quit esmond’s arm  “welcome harry” my young lord echoed after her “here we are all come to say so here’s old pincot hasn’t she grown handsome” and pincot who was older and no handsomer than usual made a curtsy to the captain as she called esmond and told my lord to “have done now”  “and here’s jack lockwood he’ll make a famous grenadier jack and so shall i we’ll both ’list under you cousin as soon as i am seventeen i go to the army—every gentleman goes to the army look who comes here—ho ho” he burst into a laugh “’tis mistress trix with a new ribbon i knew she would put one on as soon as she heard a captain was coming to supper”  this laughing colloquy took place in the hall of walcote house in the midst of which is a staircase that leads from an open gallery where are the doors of the sleepingchambers and from one of these a wax candle in her hand and illuminating her came mistress beatrix—the light falling indeed upon the scarlet ribbon which she wore and upon the most brilliant white neck in the world  esmond had left a child and found a woman grown beyond the common height and arrived at such a dazzling completeness of beauty that his eyes might well show surprise and delight at beholding her in hers there was a brightness so lustrous and melting that i have seen a whole assembly follow her as if by an attraction irresistible and that night the great duke was at the playhouse after ramillies every soul turned and looked she chanced to enter at the opposite side of the theatre at the same moment at her and not at him she was a brown beauty that is her eyes hair and eyebrows and eyelashes were dark her hair curling with rich undulations and waving over her shoulders but her complexion was as dazzling white as snow in sunshine except her cheeks which were a bright red and her lips which were of a still deeper crimson her mouth and chin they said were too large and full and so they might be for a goddess in marble but not for a woman whose eyes were fire whose look was love whose voice was the sweetest low song whose shape was perfect symmetry health decision activity whose foot as it planted itself on the ground was firm but flexible and whose motion whether rapid or slow was always perfect grace—agile as a nymph lofty as a queen—now melting now imperious now sarcastic there was no single movement of hers but was beautiful as he thinks of her he who writes feels young again and remembers a paragon  so she came holding her dress with one fair rounded arm and her taper before her tripping down the stair to greet esmond  “she hath put on her scarlet stockings and white shoes” says my lord still laughing “oh my fine mistress is this the way you set your cap at the captain” she approached shining smiles upon esmond who could look at nothing but her eyes she advanced holding forward her head as if she would have him kiss her as he used to do when she was a child  “stop” she said “i am grown too big welcome cousin harry” and she made him an arch curtsy sweeping down to the ground almost with the most gracious bend looking up the while with the brightest eyes and sweetest smile love seemed to radiate from her harry eyed her with such a rapture as the first lover is described as having by milton  “n’estce pas” says my lady in a low sweet voice still hanging on his arm  esmond turned round with a start and a blush as he met his mistress’s clear eyes he had forgotten her wrapt in admiration of the filia pulcrior  “right foot forward toe turned out so now drop the curtsy and show the red stockings trix they’ve silver clocks harry the dowager sent ’em she went to put ’em on” cries my lord  “hush you stupid child” says miss smothering her brother with kisses and then she must come and kiss her mamma looking all the while at harry over his mistress’s shoulder and if she did not kiss him she gave him both her hands and then took one of his in both hands and said “oh harry we’re so so glad you’re come”  “there are woodcocks for supper” says my lord “huzzay it was such a hungry sermon”  “and it is the 29th of december and our harry has come home”  “huzzay old pincot” again says my lord and my dear lady’s lips looked as if they were trembling with a prayer she would have harry lead in beatrix to the supperroom going herself with my young lord viscount and to this party came tom tusher directly whom four at least out of the company of five wished away away he went however as soon as the sweetmeats were put down and then by the great crackling fire his mistress or beatrix with her blushing graces filling his glass for him harry told the story of his campaign and passed the most delightful night his life had ever known the sun was up long ere he was so deep sweet and refreshing was his slumber he woke as if angels had been watching at his bed all night i dare say one that was as pure and loving as an angel had blest his sleep with her prayers  next morning the chaplain read prayers to the little household at walcote as the custom was esmond thought mistress beatrix did not listen to tusher’s exhortation much her eyes were wandering everywhere during the service at least whenever he looked up he met them perhaps he also was not very attentive to his reverence the chaplain “this might have been my life” he was thinking “this might have been my duty from now till old age well were it not a pleasant one to be with these dear friends and part from ’em no more until—until the destined lover comes and takes away pretty beatrix”—and the best part of tom tusher’s exposition which may have been very learned and eloquent was quite lost to poor harry by this vision of the destined lover who put the preacher out  all the while of the prayers beatrix knelt a little way before harry esmond the red stockings were changed for a pair of grey and black shoes in which her feet looked to the full as pretty all the roses of spring could not vie with the brightness of her complexion esmond thought he had never seen anything like the sunny lustre of her eyes my lady viscountess looked fatigued as if with watching and her face was pale  miss beatrix remarked these signs of indisposition in her mother and deplored them “i am an old woman” says my lady with a kind smile “i cannot hope to look as young as you do my dear”  “she’ll never look as good as you do if she lives till she’s a hundred” says my lord taking his mother by the waist and kissing her hand  “do i look very wicked cousin” says beatrix turning full round on esmond with her pretty face so close under his chin that the soft perfumed hair touched it she laid her fingertips on his sleeve as she spoke and he put his other hand over hers  “i’m like your lookingglass” says he “and that can’t flatter you”  “he means that you are always looking at him my dear” says her mother archly beatrix ran away from esmond at this and flew to her mamma whom she kissed stopping my lady’s mouth with her pretty hand  “and harry is very good to look at” says my lady with her fond eyes regarding the young man  “if ’tis good to see a happy face” says he “you see that” my lady said “amen” with a sigh and harry thought the memory of her dead lord rose up and rebuked her back again into sadness for her face lost the smile and resumed its look of melancholy  “why harry how fine we look in our scarlet and silver and our black periwig” cries my lord “mother i am tired of my own hair when shall i have a peruke where did you get your steenkirk harry”  “it’s some of my lady dowager’s lace” says harry “she gave me this and a number of other fine things”  “my lady dowager isn’t such a bad woman” my lord continued  “she’s not so—so red as she’s painted” says miss beatrix  her brother broke into a laugh “i’ll tell her you said so by the lord trix i will” he cries out  “she’ll know that you hadn’t the wit to say it my lord” says miss beatrix  “we won’t quarrel the first day harry’s here will we mother” said the young lord “we’ll see if we can get on to the new year without a fight have some of this christmas pie and here comes the tankard no it’s pincot with the tea”  “will the captain choose a dish” asks mistress beatrix  “i say harry” my lord goes on “i’ll show thee my horses after breakfast and we’ll go a birdnetting tonight and on monday there’s a cockmatch at winchester—do you love cockfighting harry—between the gentlemen of sussex and the gentlemen of hampshire at ten pound the battle and fifty pound the odd battle to show oneandtwenty cocks”  “and what will you do beatrix to amuse our kinsman” asks my lady  “i’ll listen to him” says beatrix “i am sure he has a hundred things to tell us and i’m jealous already of the spanish ladies was that a beautiful nun at cadiz that you rescued from the soldiers your man talked of it last night in the kitchen and mrs betty told me this morning as she combed my hair and he says you must be in love for you sat on deck all night and scribbled verses all day in your tablebook” harry thought if he had wanted a subject for verses yesterday today he had found one and not all the lindamiras and ardelias of the poets were half so beautiful as this young creature but he did not say so though some one did for him  this was his dear lady who after the meal was over and the young people were gone began talking of her children with mr esmond and of the characters of one and the other and of her hopes and fears for both of them “’tis not while they are at home” she said “and in their mother’s nest i fear for them—’tis when they are gone into the world whither i shall not be able to follow them beatrix will begin her service next year you may have heard a rumour about—about my lord blandford they were both children and it is but idle talk i know my kinswoman would never let him make such a poor marriage as our beatrix would be there’s scarce a princess in europe that she thinks is good enough for him or for her ambition”  “there’s not a princess in europe to compare with her” says esmond  “in beauty no perhaps not” answered my lady “she is most beautiful isn’t she ’tis not a mother’s partiality that deceives me i marked you yesterday when she came down the stair and read it in your face we look when you don’t fancy us looking and see better than you think dear harry and just now when they spoke about your poems—you writ pretty lines when you were but a boy—you thought beatrix was a pretty subject for verse did not you harry” the gentleman could only blush for a reply “and so she is—nor are you the first her pretty face has captivated ’tis quickly done such a pair of bright eyes as hers learn their power very soon and use it very early” and looking at him keenly with hers the fair widow left him  and so it is—a pair of bright eyes with a dozen glances suffice to subdue a man to enslave him and inflame him to make him even forget they dazzle him so that the past becomes straightway dim to him and he so prizes them that he would give all his life to possess ’em what is the fond love of dearest friends compared to this treasure is memory as strong as expectancy fruition as hunger gratitude as desire i have looked at royal diamonds in the jewelrooms in europe and thought how wars have been made about ’em mogul sovereigns deposed and strangled for them or ransomed with them millions expended to buy them and daring lives lost in digging out the little shining toys that i value no more than the button in my hat and so there are other glittering baubles of rare water too for which men have been set to kill and quarrel ever since mankind began and which last but for a score of years when their sparkle is over where are those jewels now that beamed under cleopatra’s forehead or shone in the sockets of helen  the second day after esmond’s coming to walcote tom tusher had leave to take a holiday and went off in his very best gown and bands to court the young woman whom his reverence desired to marry and who was not a viscount’s widow as it turned out but a brewer’s relict at southampton with a couple of thousand pounds to her fortune for honest tom’s heart was under such excellent control that venus herself without a portion would never have caused it to flutter so he rode away on his heavypaced gelding to pursue his jogtrot loves leaving esmond to the society of his dear mistress and her daughter and with his young lord for a companion who was charmed not only to see an old friend but to have the tutor and his latin books put out of the way  the boy talked of things and people and not a little about himself in his frank artless way ’twas easy to see that he and his sister had the better of their fond mother for the first place in whose affections though they fought constantly and though the kind lady persisted that she loved both equally ’twas not difficult to understand that frank was his mother’s darling and favourite he ruled the whole household always excepting rebellious beatrix not less now than when he was a child marshalling the village boys in playing at soldiers and caning them lustily too like the sturdiest corporal as for tom tusher his reverence treated the young lord with that politeness and deference which he always showed for a great man whatever his age or his stature was indeed with respect to this young one it was impossible not to love him so frank and winning were his manners his beauty his gaiety the ring of his laughter and the delightful tone of his voice wherever he went he charmed and domineered i think his old grandfather the dean and the grim old housekeeper mrs pincot were as much his slaves as his mother was and as for esmond he found himself presently submitting to a certain fascination the boy had and slaving it like the rest of the family the pleasure which he had in frank’s mere company and converse exceeded that which he ever enjoyed in the society of any other man however delightful in talk or famous for wit his presence brought sunshine into a room his laugh his prattle his noble beauty and brightness of look cheered and charmed indescribably at the least tale of sorrow his hands were in his purse and he was eager with sympathy and bounty the way in which women loved and petted him when a year or two afterwards he came upon the world yet a mere boy and the follies which they did for him as indeed he for them recalled the career of rochester and outdid the successes of grammont his very creditors loved him and the hardest usurers and some of the rigid prudes of the other sex too could deny him nothing he was no more witty than another man but what he said he said and looked as no man else could say or look it i have seen the women at the comedy at bruxelles crowd round him in the lobby and as he sat on the stage more people looked at him than at the actors and watched him and i remember at ramillies when he was hit and fell a great big redhaired scotch sergeant flung his halbert down burst out acrying like a woman seizing him up as if he had been an infant and carrying him out of the fire this brother and sister were the most beautiful couple ever seen though after he winged away from the maternal nest this pair were seldom together  sitting at dinner two days after esmond’s arrival it was the last day of the year and so happy a one to harry esmond that to enjoy it was quite worth all the previous pain which he had endured and forgot my young lord filling a bumper and bidding harry take another drank to his sister saluting her under the title of “marchioness”  “marchioness” says harry not without a pang of wonder for he was curious and jealous already  “nonsense my lord” says beatrix with a toss of her head my lady viscountess looked up for a moment at esmond and cast her eyes down  “the marchioness of blandford” says frank “don’t you know—hath not rouge dragon told you” my lord used to call the dowager at chelsey by this and other names “blandford has a lock of her hair the duchess found him on his knees to mistress ’trix and boxed his ears and said dr hare should whip him”  “i wish mr tusher would whip you too” says beatrix  my lady only said “i hope you will tell none of these silly stories elsewhere than at home francis”  “’tis true on my word” continues frank “look at harry scowling mother and see how beatrix blushes as red as the silverclocked stockings”  “i think we had best leave the gentlemen to their wine and their talk” says mistress beatrix rising up with the air of a young queen tossing her rustling flowing draperies about her and quitting the room followed by her mother  lady castlewood again looked at esmond as she stooped down and kissed frank “do not tell those silly stories child” she said “do not drink much wine sir harry never loved to drink wine” and she went away too in her black robes looking back on the young man with her fair fond face  “egad it’s true” says frank sipping his wine with the air of a lord “what think you of this lisbon—real collares ’tis better than your heady port we got it out of one of the spanish ships that came from vigo last year my mother bought it at southampton as the ship was lying there—the rose captain hawkins”  “why i came home in that ship” says harry  “and it brought home a good fellow and good wine” says my lord “i say harry i wish thou hadst not that cursed bar sinister”  “and why not the bar sinister” asks the other  “suppose i go to the army and am killed—every gentleman goes to the army—who is to take care of the women ’trix will never stop at home mother’s in love with you—yes i think mother’s in love with you she was always praising you and always talking about you and when she went to southampton to see the ship i found her out but you see it is impossible we are of the oldest blood in england we came in with the conqueror we were only baronets—but what then we were forced into that james the first forced our greatgrandfather we are above titles we old english gentry don’t want ’em the queen can make a duke any day look at blandford’s father duke churchill and duchess jennings what were they harry damn it sir what are they to turn up their noses at us where were they when our ancestor rode with king henry at agincourt and filled up the french king’s cup after poictiers ’fore george sir why shouldn’t blandford marry beatrix by g—— he shall marry beatrix or tell me the reason why we’ll marry with the best blood of england and none but the best blood of england you are an esmond and you can’t help your birth my boy let’s have another bottle what no more i’ve drunk three parts of this myself i had many a night with my father you stood to him like a man harry you backed your blood you can’t help your misfortune you know—no man can help that”  the elder said he would go in to his mistress’s teatable the young lad with a heightened colour and voice began singing a snatch of a song and marched out of the room esmond heard him presently calling his dogs about him and cheering and talking to them and by a hundred of his looks and gestures tricks of voice and gait was reminded of the dead lord frank’s father  and so the sylvester night passed away the family parted long before midnight lady castlewood remembering no doubt former newyear’s eves when healths were drunk and laughter went round in the company of him to whom years past and present and future were to be as one and so cared not to sit with her children and hear the cathedral bells ringing the birth of the year 1703 esmond heard the chimes as he sat in his own chamber ruminating by the blazing fire there and listened to the last notes of them looking out from his window towards the city and the great grey towers of the cathedral lying under the frosty sky with the keen stars shining above  the sight of these brilliant orbs no doubt made him think of other luminaries “and so her eyes have already done execution” thought esmond—“on whom—who can tell me” luckily his kinsman was by and esmond knew he would have no difficulty in finding out mistress beatrix’s history from the simple talk of the boy    chapter viii family talk   what harry admired and submitted to in the pretty lad his kinsman was for why should he resist it the calmness of patronage which my young lord assumed as if to command was his undoubted right and all the world below his degree ought to bow down to viscount castlewood  “i know my place harry” he said “i’m not proud—the boys at winchester college say i’m proud but i’m not proud i am simply francis james viscount castlewood in the peerage of ireland i might have been do you know that francis james marquis and earl of esmond in that of england the late lord refused the title which was offered to him by my godfather his late majesty you should know that—you are of our family you know—you cannot help your bar sinister harry my dear fellow and you belong to one of the best families in england in spite of that and you stood by my father and by g—— i’ll stand by you you shall never want a friend harry while francis james viscount castlewood has a shilling it’s now 1703—i shall come of age in 1709 i shall go back to castlewood i shall live at castlewood i shall build up the house my property will be pretty well restored by then the late viscount mismanaged my property and left it in a very bad state my mother is living close as you see and keeps me in a way hardly befitting a peer of these realms for i have but a pair of horses a governor and a man that is valet and groom but when i am of age these things will be set right harry our house will be as it should be you’ll always come to castlewood won’t you you shall always have your two rooms in the court kept for you and if anybody slights you d—— them let them have a care of me i shall marry early—’trix will be a duchess by that time most likely for a cannonball may knock over his grace any day you know”  “how” says harry  “hush my dear” says my lord viscount “you are of the family—you are faithful to us by george and i tell you everything blandford will marry her—or ——” and here he put his little hand on his sword—“you understand the rest blandford knows which of us two is the best weapon at smallsword or backsword or sword and dagger if he likes i can beat him i have tried him harry and begad he knows i am a man not to be trifled with”  “but you do not mean” says harry concealing his laughter but not his wonder “that you can force my lord blandford the son of the first man of this kingdom to marry your sister at sword’s point”  “i mean to say that we are cousins by the mother’s side though that’s nothing to boast of i mean to say that an esmond is as good as a churchill and when the king comes back the marquis of esmond’s sister may be a match for any nobleman’s daughter in the kingdom there are but two marquises in all england william herbert marquis of powis and francis james marquis of esmond and hark you harry now swear you’ll never mention this give me your honour as a gentleman for you are a gentleman though you are a——”  “well well” says harry a little impatient  “well then when after my late viscount’s misfortune my mother went up with us to london to ask for justice against you all as for mohun i’ll have his blood as sure as my name is francis viscount esmond we went to stay with our cousin my lady marlborough with whom we had quarrelled for ever so long but when misfortune came she stood by her blood—so did the dowager viscountess stand by her blood—so did you well sir whilst my mother was petitioning the late prince of orange—for i will never call him king—and while you were in prison we lived at my lord marlborough’s house who was only a little there being away with the army in holland and then  i say harry you won’t tell now”  harry again made a vow of secrecy  “well there used to be all sorts of fun you know my lady marlborough was very fond of us and she said i was to be her page and she got ’trix to be a maid of honour and while she was up in her room crying we used to be always having fun you know and the duchess used to kiss me and so did her daughters and blandford fell tremendous in love with ’trix and she liked him and one day he—he kissed her behind a door—he did though—and the duchess caught him and she banged such a box of the ear both to ’trix and blandford—you should have seen it and then she said that we must leave directly and abused my mamma who was cognizant of the business but she wasn’t—never thinking about anything but father and so we came down to walcote blandford being locked up and not allowed to see ’trix but i got at him i climbed along the gutter and in through the window where he was crying  “ ‘marquis’ says i when he had opened it and helped me in ‘you know i wear a sword’ for i had brought it  “ ‘oh viscount’ says he—‘oh my dearest frank’ and he threw himself into my arms and burst out acrying ‘i do love mistress beatrix so that i shall die if i don’t have her’  “ ‘my dear blandford’ says i ‘you are young to think of marrying’ for he was but fifteen and a young fellow of that age can scarce do so you know  “ ‘but i’ll wait twenty years if she’ll have me’ says he ‘i’ll never marry—no never never never marry anybody but her no not a princess though they would have me do it ever so if beatrix will wait for me her blandford swears he will be faithful’ and he wrote a paper it wasn’t spelt right for he wrote ‘i’m ready to sine with my blode’ which you know harry isn’t the way of spelling it and vowing that he would marry none other but the honourable mistress gertrude beatrix esmond only sister of his dearest friend francis james fourth viscount esmond and so i gave him a locket of her hair”  “a locket of her hair” cries esmond  “yes ’trix gave me one after the fight with the duchess that very day i am sure i didn’t want it and so i gave it him and we kissed at parting and said—‘goodbye brother’ and i got back through the gutter and we set off home that very evening and he went to king’s college in cambridge and i’m going to cambridge soon and if he doesn’t stand to his promise for he’s only wrote once—he knows i wear a sword harry come along and let’s go see the cockingmatch at winchester  “but i say” he added laughing after a pause “i don’t think ’trix will break her heart about him law bless you whenever she sees a man she makes eyes at him and young sir wilmot crawley of queen’s crawley and anthony henley of alresford were at swords drawn about her at the winchester assembly a month ago”  that night mr harry’s sleep was by no means so pleasant or sweet as it had been on the first two evenings after his arrival at walcote “so the bright eyes have been already shining on another” thought he “and the pretty lips or the cheeks at any rate have begun the work which they were made for here’s a girl not sixteen and one young gentleman is already whimpering over a lock of her hair and two country squires are ready to cut each other’s throats that they may have the honour of a dance with her what a fool am i to be dallying about this passion and singeing my wings in this foolish flame wings—why not say crutches there is but eight years’ difference between us to be sure but in life i am thirty years older how could i ever hope to please such a sweet creature as that with my rough ways and glum face say that i have merit ever so much and won myself a name could she ever listen to me she must be my lady marchioness and i remain a nameless bastard o my master my master” here he fell to thinking with a passionate grief of the vow which he had made to his poor dying lord “o my mistress dearest and kindest will you be contented with the sacrifice which the poor orphan makes for you whom you love and who so loves you”  and then came a fiercer pang of temptation “a word from me” harry thought “a syllable of explanation and all this might be changed but no i swore it over the dying bed of my benefactor for the sake of him and his for the sacred love and kindness of old days i gave my promise to him and may kind heaven enable me to keep my vow”  the next day although esmond gave no sign of what was going on in his mind but strove to be more than ordinarily gay and cheerful when he met his friends at the morning meal his dear mistress whose clear eyes it seemed no emotion of his could escape perceived that something troubled him for she looked anxiously towards him more than once during the breakfast and when he went up to his chamber afterwards she presently followed him and knocked at his door  as she entered no doubt the whole story was clear to her at once for she found our young gentleman packing his valise pursuant to the resolution which he had come to overnight of making a brisk retreat out of this temptation  she closed the door very carefully behind her and then leant against it very pale her hands folded before her looking at the young man who was kneeling over his work of packing “are you going so soon” she said  he rose up from his knees blushing perhaps to be so discovered in the very act as it were and took one of her fair little hands—it was that which had her marriage ring on—and kissed it  “it is best that it should be so dearest lady” he said  “i knew you were going at breakfast i—i thought you might stay what has happened why can’t you remain longer with us what has frank told you—you were talking together late last night”  “i had but three days’ leave from chelsea” esmond said as gaily as he could “my aunt—she lets me call her aunt—is my mistress now i owe her my lieutenancy and my laced coat she has taken me into high favour and my new general is to dine at chelsea tomorrow—general lumley madam—who has appointed me his aide de camp and on whom i must have the honour of waiting see here is a letter from the dowager the post brought it last night and i would not speak of it for fear of disturbing our last merry meeting”  my lady glanced at the letter and put it down with a smile that was somewhat contemptuous “i have no need to read the letter” says she—indeed ’twas as well she did not for the chelsea missive in the poor dowager’s usual french jargon permitted him a longer holiday than he said “je vous donne” quoth her ladyship “oui jour pour vous fatigay parfaictement de vos parens fatigans”—“i have no need to read the letter” says she “what was it frank told you last night”  “he told me little i did not know” mr esmond answered “but i have thought of that little and here’s the result i have no right to the name i bear dear lady and it is only by your sufferance that i am allowed to keep it if i thought for an hour of what has perhaps crossed your mind too——”  “yes i did harry” said she “i thought of it and think of it i would sooner call you my son than the greatest prince in europe—yes than the greatest prince for who is there so good and so brave and who would love her as you would but there are reasons a mother can’t tell”  “i know them” said mr esmond interrupting her with a smile—“i know there’s sir wilmot crawley of queen’s crawley and mr anthony henley of the grange and my lord marquis of blandford that seems to be the favoured suitor you shall ask me to wear my lady marchioness’s favours and to dance at her ladyship’s wedding”  “oh harry harry it is none of these follies that frighten me” cried out lady castlewood “lord churchill is but a child his outbreak about beatrix was a mere boyish folly his parents would rather see him buried than married to one below him in rank and do you think that i would stoop to sue for a husband for francis esmond’s daughter or submit to have my girl smuggled into that proud family to cause a quarrel between son and parents and to be treated only as an inferior i would disdain such a meanness beatrix would scorn it ah henry ’tis not with you the fault lies ’tis with her i know you both and love you need i be ashamed of that love now no never never and ’tis not you dear harry that is unworthy ’tis for my poor beatrix i tremble—whose headstrong will frightens me whose jealous temper they say i was jealous too but pray god i am cured of that sin and whose vanity no words or prayers of mine can cure—only suffering only experience and remorse afterwards oh henry she will make no man happy who loves her go away my son leave her love us always and think kindly of us and for me my dear you know that these walls contain all that i love in the world”  in afterlife did esmond find the words true which his fond mistress spoke from her sad heart warning he had but i doubt others had warning before his time and since and he benefited by it as most men do  my young lord viscount was exceeding sorry when he heard that harry could not come to the cockmatch with him and must go to london but no doubt my lord consoled himself when the hampshire cocks won the match and he saw every one of the battles and crowed properly over the conquered sussex gentlemen  as esmond rode towards town his servant coming up to him informed him with a grin that mistress beatrix had brought out a new gown and blue stockings for that day’s dinner in which she intended to appear and had flown into a rage and given her maid a slap on the face soon after she heard he was going away mistress beatrix’s woman the fellow said came down to the servants’ hall crying and with the mark of a blow still on her cheek but esmond peremptorily ordered him to fall back and be silent and rode on with thoughts enough of his own to occupy him—some sad ones some inexpressibly dear and pleasant  his mistress from whom he had been a year separated was his dearest mistress again the family from which he had been parted and which he loved with the fondest devotion was his family once more if beatrix’s beauty shone upon him it was with a friendly lustre and he could regard it with much such a delight as he brought away after seeing the beautiful pictures of the smiling madonnas in the convent at cadiz when he was dispatched thither with a flag and as for his mistress ’twas difficult to say with what a feeling he regarded her ’twas happiness to have seen her ’twas no great pang to part a filial tenderness a love that was at once respect and protection filled his mind as he thought of her and near her or far from her and from that day until now and from now till death is past and beyond it he prays that sacred flame may ever burn    chapter ix i make the campaign of 1704   mr esmond rode up to london then where if the dowager had been angry at the abrupt leave of absence he took she was mightily pleased at his speedy return  he went immediately and paid his court to his new general general lumley who received him graciously having known his father and also he was pleased to say having had the very best accounts of mr esmond from the officer whose aide de camp he had been at vigo during this winter mr esmond was gazetted to a lieutenancy in brigadier webb’s regiment of fusiliers then with their colonel in flanders but being now attached to the suite of mr lumley esmond did not join his own regiment until more than a year afterwards and after his return from the campaign of blenheim which was fought the next year the campaign began very early our troops marching out of their quarters before the winter was almost over and investing the city of bonn on the rhine under the duke’s command his grace joined the army in deep grief of mind with crape on his sleeve and his household in mourning and the very same packet which brought the commanderinchief over brought letters to the forces which preceded him and one from his dear mistress to esmond which interested him not a little  the young marquis of blandford his grace’s son who had been entered in king’s college in cambridge whither my lord viscount had also gone to trinity with mr tusher as his governor had been seized with smallpox and was dead at sixteen years of age and so poor frank’s schemes for his sister’s advancement were over and that innocent childish passion nipped in the birth  esmond’s mistress would have had him return at least her letters hinted as much but in the presence of the enemy this was impossible and our young man took his humble share in the siege which need not be described here and had the good luck to escape without a wound of any sort and to drink his general’s health after the surrender he was in constant military duty this year and did not think of asking for a leave of absence as one or two of his less fortunate friends did who were cast away in that tremendous storm which happened towards the close of november that “which of late o’er pale britannia past” as mr addison sang of it and in which scores of our greatest ships and 15000 of our seamen went down  they said that our duke was quite heartbroken by the calamity which had befallen his family but his enemies found that he could subdue them as well as master his grief successful as had been this great general’s operations in the past year they were far enhanced by the splendour of his victory in the ensuing campaign his grace the captaingeneral went to england after bonn and our army fell back into holland where in april 1704 his grace again found the troops embarking from harwich and landing at maesland sluys thence his grace came immediately to the hague where he received the foreign ministers general officers and other people of quality the greatest honours were paid to his grace everywhere—at the hague utrecht ruremonde and maestricht the civic authorities coming to meet his coaches salvos of cannon saluting him canopies of state being erected for him where he stopped and feasts prepared for the numerous gentlemen following in his suite his grace reviewed the troops of the statesgeneral between liége and maestricht and afterwards the english forces under the command of general churchill near boisleduc every preparation was made for a long march and the army heard with no small elation that it was the commanderinchief’s intention to carry the war out of the low countries and to march on the mozelle before leaving our camp at maestricht we heard that the french under the marshal villeroy were also bound towards the mozelle  towards the end of may the army reached coblentz and next day his grace and the generals accompanying him went to visit the elector of treves at his castle of ehrenbreitstein the horse and dragoons passing the rhine whilst the duke was entertained at a grand feast by the elector all as yet was novelty festivity and splendour—a brilliant march of a great and glorious army through a friendly country and sure through some of the most beautiful scenes of nature which i ever witnessed  the foot and artillery following after the horse as quick as possible crossed the rhine under ehrenbreitstein and so to castel over against mayntz in which city his grace his generals and his retinue were received at the landingplace by the elector’s coaches carried to his highness’s palace amidst the thunder of cannon and then once more magnificently entertained gidlingen in bavaria was appointed as the general rendezvous of the army and thither by different routes the whole forces of english dutch danes and german auxiliaries took their way the foot and artillery under general churchill passed the neckar at heidelberg and esmond had an opportunity of seeing that city and palace once so famous and beautiful though shattered and battered by the french under turenne in the late war where his grandsire had served the beautiful and unfortunate electresspalatine the first king charles’s sister  at mindelsheim the famous prince of savoy came to visit our commander all of us crowding eagerly to get a sight of that brilliant and intrepid warrior and our troops were drawn up in battalia before the prince who was pleased to express his admiration of this noble english army at length we came in sight of the enemy between dillingen and lawingen the brentz lying between the two armies the elector judging that donauwort would be the point of his grace’s attack sent a strong detachment of his best troops to count darcos who was posted at schellenberg near that place where great entrenchments were thrown up and thousands of pioneers employed to strengthen the position  on the 2nd of july his grace stormed the post with what success on our part need scarce be told his grace advanced with six thousand foot english and dutch thirty squadrons and three regiments of imperial cuirassiers the duke crossing the river at the head of the cavalry although our troops made the attack with unparalleled courage and fury—rushing up to the very guns of the enemy and being slaughtered before their works—we were driven back many times and should not have carried them but that the imperialists came up under the prince of baden when the enemy could make no head against us we pursued him into the trenches making a terrible slaughter there and into the very danube where a great part of his troops following the example of their generals count darcos and the elector himself tried to save themselves by swimming our army entered donauwort which the bavarians evacuated and where ’twas said the elector purposed to have given us a warm reception by burning us in our beds the cellars of the houses when we took possession of them being found stuffed with straw but though the links were there the linkboys had run away the townsmen saved their houses and our general took possession of the enemy’s ammunition in the arsenals his stores and magazines five days afterwards a great te deum was sung in prince lewis’s army and a solemn day of thanksgiving held in our own the prince of savoy’s compliments coming to his grace the captaingeneral during the day’s religious ceremony and concluding as it were with an amen  and now having seen a great military march through a friendly country the pomps and festivities of more than one german court the severe struggle of a hotlycontested battle and the triumph of victory mr esmond beheld another part of military duty our troops entering the enemy’s territory and putting all around them to fire and sword burning farms wasted fields shrieking women slaughtered sons and fathers and drunken soldiery cursing and carousing in the midst of tears terror and murder why does the stately muse of history that delights in describing the valour of heroes and the grandeur of conquest leave out these scenes so brutal mean and degrading that yet form by far the greater part of the drama of war you gentlemen of england who live at home at ease and compliment yourselves in the songs of triumph with which our chieftains are bepraised—you pretty maidens that come tumbling down the stairs when the fife and drum call you and huzzah for the british grenadiers—do you take account that these items go to make up the amount of the triumph you admire and form part of the duties of the heroes you fondle our chief whom england and all europe saving only the frenchmen worshipped almost had this of the godlike in him that he was impassible before victory before danger before defeat before the greatest obstacle or the most trivial ceremony before a hundred thousand men drawn in battalia or a peasant slaughtered at the door of his burning hovel before a carouse of drunken german lords or a monarch’s court or a cottagetable where his plans were laid or an enemy’s battery vomiting flame and death and strewing corpses round about him—he was always cold calm resolute like fate he performed a treason or a courtbow he told a falsehood as black as styx as easily as he paid a compliment or spoke about the weather he took a mistress and left her he betrayed his benefactor and supported him or would have murdered him with the same calmness always and having no more remorse than clotho when she weaves the thread or lachesis when she cuts it in the hour of battle i have heard the prince of savoy’s officers say the prince became possessed with a sort of warlike fury his eyes lighted up he rushed hither and thither raging he shrieked curses and encouragement yelling and harking his bloody wardogs on and himself always at the first of the hunt our duke was as calm at the mouth of the cannon as at the door of a drawingroom perhaps he could not have been the great man he was had he had a heart either for love or hatred or pity or fear or regret or remorse he achieved the highest deed of daring or deepest calculation of thought as he performed the very meanest action of which a man is capable told a lie or cheated a fond woman or robbed a poor beggar of a halfpenny with a like awful serenity and equal capacity of the highest and lowest acts of our nature  his qualities were pretty well known in the army where there were parties of all politics and of plenty of shrewdness and wit but there existed such a perfect confidence in him as the first captain of the world and such a faith and admiration in his prodigious genius and fortune that the very men whom he notoriously cheated of their pay the chiefs whom he used and injured—for he used all men great and small that came near him as his instruments alike and took something of theirs either some quality or some property—the blood of a soldier it might be or a jewelled hat or a hundred thousand crowns from a king or a portion out of a starving sentinel’s three farthings or when he was young a kiss from a woman and the gold chain off her neck taking all he could from woman or man and having as i have said this of the godlike in him that he could see a hero perish or a sparrow fall with the same amount of sympathy for either not that he had no tears he could always order up this reserve at the proper moment to battle he could draw upon tears or smiles alike and whenever need was for using this cheap coin he would cringe to a shoeblack as he would flatter a minister or a monarch be haughty be humble threaten repent weep grasp your hand or stab you whenever he saw occasion—but yet those of the army who knew him best and had suffered most from him admired him most of all and as he rode along the lines to battle or galloped up in the nick of time to a battalion reeling from before the enemy’s charge or shot the fainting men and officers got new courage as they saw the splendid calm of his face and felt that his will made them irresistible  after the great victory of blenheim the enthusiasm of the army for the duke even of his bitterest personal enemies in it amounted to a sort of rage—nay the very officers who cursed him in their hearts were among the most frantic to cheer him who could refuse his meed of admiration to such a victory and such a victor not he who writes a man may profess to be ever so much a philosopher but he who fought on that day must feel a thrill of pride as he recalls it  the french right was posted near to the village of blenheim on the danube where the marshal tallard’s quarters were their line extending through it may be a league and a half before lutzingen and up to a woody hill round the base of which and acting against the prince of savoy were forty of his squadrons here was a village that the frenchmen had burned the wood being in fact a better shelter and easier of guard than any village  before these two villages and the french lines ran a little stream not more than two foot broad through a marsh that was mostly dried up from the heats of the weather and this stream was the only separation between the two armies—ours coming up and ranging themselves in line of battle before the french at six o’clock in the morning so that our line was quite visible to theirs and the whole of this great plain was black and swarming with troops for hours before the cannonading began  on one side and the other this cannonading lasted many hours the french guns being in position in front of their line and doing severe damage among our horse especially and on our right wing of imperialists under the prince of savoy who could neither advance his artillery nor his lines the ground before him being cut up by ditches morasses and very difficult of passage for the guns  it was past midday when the attack began on our left where lord cutts commanded the bravest and most beloved officer in the english army and now as if to make his experience in war complete our young aide de camp having seen two great armies facing each other in line of battle and had the honour of riding with orders from one end to other of the line came in for a not uncommon accompaniment of military glory and was knocked on the head along with many hundred of brave fellows almost at the very commencement of this famous day of blenheim a little after noon the disposition for attack being completed with much delay and difficulty and under a severe fire from the enemy’s guns that were better posted and more numerous than ours a body of english and hessians with majorgeneral wilkes commanding at the extreme left of our line marched upon blenheim advancing with great gallantry the majorgeneral on foot with his officers at the head of the column and marching with his hat off intrepidly in the face of the enemy who was pouring in a tremendous fire from his guns and musketry to which our people were instructed not to reply except with pike and bayonet when they reached the french palisades to these wilkes walked intrepidly and struck the woodwork with his sword before our people charged it he was shot down at the instant with his colonel major and several officers and our troops cheering and huzzaing and coming on as they did with immense resolution and gallantry were nevertheless stopped by the murderous fire from behind the enemy’s defences and then attacked in flank by a furious charge of french horse which swept out of blenheim and cut down our men in great numbers three fierce and desperate assaults of our foot were made and repulsed by the enemy so that our columns of foot were quite shattered and fell back scrambling over the little rivulet which we had crossed so resolutely an hour before and pursued by the french cavalry slaughtering us and cutting us down  and now the conquerors were met by a furious charge of english horse under esmond’s general general lumley behind whose squadrons the flying foot found refuge and formed again whilst lumley drove back the french horse charging up to the village of blenheim and the palisades where wilkes and many hundred more gallant englishmen lay in slaughtered heaps beyond this moment and of this famous victory mr esmond knows nothing for a shot brought down his horse and our young gentleman on it who fell crushed and stunned under the animal and came to his senses he knows not how long after only to lose them again from pain and loss of blood a dim sense as of people groaning round about him a wild incoherent thought or two for her who occupied so much of his heart now and that here his career and his hopes and misfortunes were ended he remembers in the course of these hours when he woke up it was with a pang of extreme pain his breastplate was taken off his servant was holding his head up the good and faithful lad of hampshire9 was blubbering over his master whom he found and had thought dead and a surgeon was probing a wound in the shoulder which he must have got at the same moment when his horse was shot and fell over him the battle was over at this end of the field by this time the village was in possession of the english its brave defenders prisoners or fled or drowned many of them in the neighbouring waters of the donau but for honest lockwood’s faithful search after his master there had no doubt been an end of esmond here and of this his story the marauders were out rifling the bodies as they lay on the field and jack had brained one of these gentry with the clubend of his musket who had eased esmond of his hat and periwig his purse and fine silvermounted pistols which the dowager gave him and was fumbling in his pockets for further treasure when jack lockwood came up and put an end to the scoundrel’s triumph  hospitals for our wounded were established at blenheim and here for several weeks esmond lay in very great danger of his life the wound was not very great from which he suffered and the ball extracted by the surgeon on the spot where our young gentleman received it but a fever set in next day as he was lying in hospital and that almost carried him away jack lockwood said he talked in the wildest manner during his delirium that he called himself the marquis of esmond and seizing one of the surgeon’s assistants who came to dress his wounds swore that he was madam beatrix and that he would make her a duchess if she would but say yes he was passing the days in these crazy fancies and vana somnia whilst the army was singing te deum for the victory and those famous festivities were taking place at which our duke now made a prince of the empire was entertained by the king of the romans and his nobility his grace went home by berlin and hanover and esmond lost the festivities which took place at those cities and which his general shared in company of the other general officers who travelled with our great captain when he could move it was by the duke of wirtemburg’s city of stuttgard that he made his way homewards revisiting heidelberg again whence he went to manheim and hence had a tedious but easy water journey down the river of rhine which he had thought a delightful and beautiful voyage indeed but that his heart was longing for home and something far more beautiful and delightful  as bright and welcome as the eyes almost of his mistress shone the lights of harwich as the packet came in from holland it was not many hours ere he esmond was in london of that you may be sure and received with open arms by the old dowager of chelsea who vowed in her jargon of french and english that he had the air noble that his pallor embellished him that he was an amadis and deserved a gloriana and o flames and darts what was his joy at hearing that his mistress was come into waiting and was now with her majesty at kensington although mr esmond had told jack lockwood to get horses and they would ride for winchester that night when he heard this news he countermanded the horses at once his business lay no longer in hants all his hope and desire lay within a couple of miles of him in kensington park wall poor harry had never looked in the glass before so eagerly to see whether he had the bel air and his paleness really did become him he never took such pains about the curl of his periwig and the taste of his embroidery and pointlace as now before mr amadis presented himself to madam gloriana was the fire of the french lines half so murderous as the killing glances from her ladyship’s eyes o darts and raptures how beautiful were they  and as before the blazing sun of morning the moon fades away in the sky almost invisible esmond thought with a blush perhaps of another sweet pale face sad and faint and fading out of sight with its sweet fond gaze of affection such a last look it seemed to cast as eurydice might have given yearning after her lover when fate and pluto summoned her and she passed away into the shades    chapter x an old story about a fool and a woman   any taste for pleasure which esmond had and he liked to desipere in loco neither more nor less than most young men of his age he could now gratify to the utmost extent and in the best company which the town afforded when the army went into winter quarters abroad those of the officers who had interest or money easily got leave of absence and found it much pleasanter to spend their time in pall mall and hyde park than to pass the winter away behind the fortifications of the dreary old flanders towns where the english troops were gathered yatches and packets passed daily between the dutch and flemish ports and harwich the roads thence to london and the great inns were crowded with army gentlemen the taverns and ordinaries of the town swarmed with redcoats and our great duke’s levees at st james’s were as thronged as they had been at ghent and brussels where we treated him and he us with the grandeur and ceremony of a sovereign though esmond had been appointed to a lieutenancy in the fusilier regiment of which that celebrated officer brigadier john richmond webb was colonel he had never joined the regiment nor been introduced to its excellent commander though they had made the same campaign together and been engaged in the same battle but being aide de camp to general lumley who commanded the division of horse and the army marching to its point of destination on the danube by different routes esmond had not fallen in as yet with his commander and future comrades of the fort and it was in london in golden square where majorgeneral webb lodged that captain esmond had the honour of first paying his respects to his friend patron and commander of afterdays  those who remember this brilliant and accomplished gentleman may recollect his character upon which he prided himself i think not a little of being the handsomest man in the army a poet who writ a dull copy of verses upon the battle of oudenarde three years after describing webb says—       to noble danger webb conducts the way     his great example all his troops obey     before the front the general sternly rides     with such an air as mars to battle strides     propitious heaven must sure a hero save     like paris handsome and like hector brave   mr webb thought these verses quite as fine as mr addison’s on the blenheim campaign and indeed to be hector à la mode de paris was part of this gallant gentleman’s ambition it would have been difficult to find an officer in the whole army or amongst the splendid courtiers and cavaliers of the maisonduroy that fought under vendosme and villeroy in the army opposed to ours who was a more accomplished soldier and perfect gentleman and either braver or betterlooking and if mr webb believed of himself what the world said of him and was deeply convinced of his own indisputable genius beauty and valour who has a right to quarrel with him very much this selfcontent of his kept him in general good humour of which his friends and dependants got the benefit  he came of a very ancient wiltshire family which he respected above all families in the world he could prove a lineal descent from king edward the first and his first ancestor roaldus de richmond rode by william the conqueror’s side on hastings field “we were gentlemen esmond” he used to say “when the churchills were horseboys” he was a very tall man standing in his pumps six feet three inches in his great jackboots with his tall fair periwig and hat and feather he could not have been less than eight feet high “i am taller than churchill” he would say surveying himself in the glass “and i am a better made man and if the women won’t like a man that hasn’t a wart on his nose faith i can’t help myself and churchill has the better of me there” indeed he was always measuring himself with the duke and always asking his friends to measure them and talking in this frank way as he would do over his cups wags would laugh and encourage him friends would be sorry for him schemers and flatterers would egg him on and talebearers carry the stories to head quarters and widen the difference which already existed there between the great captain and one of the ablest and bravest lieutenants he ever had  his rancour against the duke was so apparent that one saw it in the first halfhour’s conversation with general webb and his lady who adored her general and thought him a hundred times taller handsomer and braver than a prodigal nature had made him hated the great duke with such an intensity as it becomes faithful wives to feel against their husbands’ enemies not that my lord duke was so yet mr webb had said a thousand things against him which his superior had pardoned and his grace whose spies were everywhere had heard a thousand things more that webb had never said but it cost this great man no pains to pardon and he passed over an injury or a benefit alike easily  should any child of mine take the pains to read these his ancestor’s memoirs i would not have him judge of the great duke10 by what a contemporary has written of him no man hath been so immensely lauded and decried as this great statesman and warrior as indeed no man ever deserved better the very greatest praise and the strongest censure if the present writer joins with the latter faction very likely a private pique of his own may be the cause of his illfeeling  on presenting himself at the commanderinchief’s levee his grace had not the least remembrance of general lumley’s aide de camp and though he knew esmond’s family perfectly well having served with both lords my lord francis and the viscount esmond’s father in flanders and in the duke of york’s guard the duke of marlborough who was friendly and serviceable to the sostyled legitimate representatives of the viscount castlewood took no sort of notice of the poor lieutenant who bore their name a word of kindness or acknowledgement or a single glance of approbation might have changed esmond’s opinion of the great man and instead of a satire which his pen cannot help writing who knows but that the humble historian might have taken the other side of panegyric we have but to change the point of view and the greatest action looks mean as we turn the perspectiveglass and a giant appears a pigmy you may describe but who can tell whether your sight is clear or not or your means of information accurate had the great man said but a word of kindness to the small one as he would have stepped out of his gilt chariot to shake hands with lazarus in rags and sores if he thought lazarus could have been of any service to him no doubt esmond would have fought for him with pen and sword to the utmost of his might but my lord the lion did not want master mouse at this moment and so muscipulus went off and nibbled in opposition  so it was however that a young gentleman who in the eyes of his family and in his own doubtless was looked upon as a consummate hero found that the great hero of the day took no more notice of him than of the smallest drummer in his grace’s army the dowager at chelsea was furious against this neglect of her family and had a great battle with lady marlborough as lady castlewood insisted on calling the duchess her grace was now mistress of the robes to her majesty and one of the greatest personages in this kingdom as her husband was in all europe and the battle between the two ladies took place in the queen’s drawingroom  the duchess in reply to my aunt’s eager clamour said haughtily that she had done her best for the legitimate branch of the esmonds and could not be expected to provide for the bastard brats of the family  “bastards” says the viscountess in a fury “there are bastards amongst the churchills as your grace knows and the duke of berwick is provided for well enough”  “madam” says the duchess “you know whose fault it is that there are no such dukes in the esmond family too and how that little scheme of a certain lady miscarried”  esmond’s friend dick steele who was in waiting on the prince heard the controversy between the ladies at court “and faith” says dick “i think harry thy kinswoman had the worst of it”  he could not keep the story quiet ’twas all over the coffeehouses ere night it was printed in a news letter before a month was over and “the reply of her grace the duchess of mrlbrgh to a popish lady of the court once a favourite of the late k— jms” was printed in half a dozen places with a note stating that this duchess when the head of this lady’s family came by his death lately in a fatal duel never rested until she got a pension for the orphan heir and widow from her majesty’s bounty the squabble did not advance poor esmond’s promotion much and indeed made him so ashamed of himself that he dared not show his face at the commanderinchief’s levees again                      during those eighteen months which had passed since esmond saw his dear mistress her good father the old dean quitted this life firm in his principles to the very last and enjoining his family always to remember that the queen’s brother king james the third was their rightful sovereign he made a very edifying end as his daughter told esmond and not a little to her surprise after his death for he had lived always very poorly my lady found that her father had left no less a sum than 3000l behind him which he bequeathed to her  with this little fortune lady castlewood was enabled when her daughter’s turn at court came to come to london where she took a small genteel house at kensington in the neighbourhood of the court bringing her children with her and here it was that esmond found his friends  as for the young lord his university career had ended rather abruptly honest tusher his governor had found my young gentleman quite ungovernable my lord worried his life away with tricks and broke out as homebred lads will into a hundred youthful extravagances so that dr bentley the new master of trinity thought fit to write to the viscountess castlewood my lord’s mother and beg her to remove the young nobleman from a college where he declined to learn and where he only did harm by his riotous example indeed i believe he nearly set fire to nevil’s court that beautiful new quadrangle of our college which sir christopher wren had lately built he knocked down a proctor’s man that wanted to arrest him in a midnight prank he gave a dinner party on the prince of wales’s birthday which was within a fortnight of his own and the twenty young gentlemen then present sallied out after their wine having toasted king james’s health with open windows and sung cavalier songs and shouted “god save the king” in the great court so that the master came out of his lodge at midnight and dissipated the riotous assembly  this was my lord’s crowning freak and the rev thomas tusher domestic chaplain to the right honourable the lord viscount castlewood finding his prayers and sermons of no earthly avail to his lordship gave up his duties of governor went and married his brewer’s widow at southampton and took her and her money to his parsonagehouse at castlewood  my lady could not be angry with her son for drinking king james’s health being herself a loyal tory as all the castlewood family were and acquiesced with a sigh knowing perhaps that her refusal would be of no avail to the young lord’s desire for a military life she would have liked him to be in mr esmond’s regiment hoping that harry might act as guardian and adviser to his wayward young kinsman but my young lord would hear of nothing but the guards and a commission was got for him in the duke of ormonde’s regiment so esmond found my lord ensign and lieutenant when he returned from germany after the blenheim campaign  the effect produced by both lady castlewood’s children when they appeared in public was extraordinary and the whole town speedily rang with their fame such a beautiful couple it was declared never had been seen the young maid of honour was toasted at every table and tavern and as for my young lord his good looks were even more admired than his sister’s a hundred songs were written about the pair and as the fashion of that day was my young lord was praised in these anacreontics as warmly as bathyllus you may be sure that he accepted very complacently the town’s opinion of him and acquiesced with that frankness and charming good humour he always showed in the idea that he was the prettiest fellow in all london  the old dowager at chelsea though she could never be got to acknowledge that mrs beatrix was any beauty at all in which opinion as it may be imagined a vast number of the ladies agreed with her yet on the very first sight of young castlewood she owned she fell in love with him and henry esmond on his return to chelsea found himself quite superseded in her favour by her younger kinsman that feat of drinking the king’s health at cambridge would have won her heart she said if nothing else did “how had the dear young fellow got such beauty” she asked “not from his father—certainly not from his mother how had he come by such noble manners and the perfect bel air that countrified walcote widow could never have taught him” esmond had his own opinion about the countrified walcote widow who had a quiet grace and serene kindness that had always seemed to him the perfection of good breeding though he did not try to argue this point with his aunt but he could agree in most of the praises which the enraptured old dowager bestowed on my lord viscount than whom he never beheld a more fascinating and charming gentleman castlewood had not wit so much as enjoyment “the lad looks good things” mr steele used to say “and his laugh lights up a conversation as much as ten repartees from mr congreve i would as soon sit over a bottle with him as with mr addison and rather listen to his talk than hear nicolini was ever man so gracefully drunk as my lord castlewood i would give anything to carry my wine though indeed dick bore his very kindly and plenty of it too like this incomparable young man when he is sober he is delightful and when tipsy perfectly irresistible” and referring to his favourite shakespeare who was quite out of fashion until steele brought him back into the mode dick compared lord castlewood to prince hal and was pleased to dub esmond as ancient pistol  the mistress of the robes the greatest lady in england after the queen or even before her majesty as the world said though she never could be got to say a civil word to beatrix whom she had promoted to her place as maid of honour took her brother into instant favour when young castlewood in his new uniform and looking like a prince out of a fairytale went to pay his duty to her grace she looked at him for a minute in silence the young man blushing and in confusion before her then fairly burst out acrying and kissed him before her daughters and company “he was my boy’s friend” she said through her sobs “my blandford might have been like him” and everybody saw after this mark of the duchess’s favour that my young lord’s promotion was secure and people crowded round the favourite’s favourite who became vainer and gayer and more goodhumoured than ever  meanwhile madam beatrix was making her conquests on her own side and amongst them was one poor gentleman who had been shot by her young eyes two years before and had never been quite cured of that wound he knew to be sure how hopeless any passion might be directed in that quarter and had taken that best though ignoble remedium amoris a speedy retreat from before the charmer and a long absence from her and not being dangerously smitten in the first instance esmond pretty soon got the better of his complaint and if he had it still did not know he had it and bore it easily but when he returned after blenheim the young lady of sixteen who had appeared the most beautiful object his eyes had ever looked on two years back was now advanced to a perfect ripeness and perfection of beauty such as instantly enthralled the poor devil who had already been a fugitive from her charms then he had seen her but for two days and fled now he beheld her day after day and when she was at court watched after her when she was at home made one of the family party when she went abroad rode after her mother’s chariot when she appeared in public places was in the box near her or in the pit looking at her when she went to church was sure to be there though he might not listen to the sermon and be ready to hand her to her chair if she deigned to accept of his services and select him from a score of young men who were always hanging round about her when she went away accompanying her majesty to hampton court a darkness fell over london gods what nights has esmond passed thinking of her rhyming about her talking about her his friend dick steele was at this time courting the young lady mrs scurlock whom he married she had a lodging in kensington square hard by my lady castlewood’s house there dick and harry being on the same errand used to meet constantly at kensington they were always prowling about that place or dismally walking thence or eagerly running thither they emptied scores of bottles at the “king’s arms” each man prating of his love and allowing the other to talk on condition that he might have his own turn as a listener hence arose an intimacy between them though to all the rest of their friends they must have been insufferable esmond’s verses to “gloriana at the harpsichord” to “gloriana’s nosegay” to “gloriana at court” appeared this year in the observator—have you never read them they were thought pretty poems and attributed by some to mr prior  this passion did not escape—how should it—the clear eyes of esmond’s mistress he told her all what will a man not do when frantic with love to what baseness will he not demean himself what pangs will he not make others suffer so that he may ease his selfish heart of a part of its own pain day after day he would seek his dear mistress pour insane hopes supplications rhapsodies raptures into her ear she listened smiled consoled with untiring pity and sweetness esmond was the eldest of her children so she was pleased to say and as for her kindness who ever had or would look for aught else from one who was an angel of goodness and pity after what has been said ’tis needless almost to add that poor esmond’s suit was unsuccessful what was a nameless penniless lieutenant to do when some of the greatest in the land were in the field esmond never so much as thought of asking permission to hope so far above his reach as he knew this prize was—and passed his foolish useless life in mere abject sighs and impotent longing what nights of rage what days of torment of passionate unfulfilled desire of sickening jealousy can he recall beatrix thought no more of him than of the lackey that followed her chair his complaints did not touch her in the least his raptures rather fatigued her she cared for his verses no more than for dan chaucer’s who’s dead these ever so many hundred years she did not hate him she rather despised him and just suffered him  one day after talking to beatrix’s mother his dear fond constant mistress—for hours—for all day long—pouring out his flame and his passion his despair and rage returning again and again to the theme pacing the room tearing up the flowers on the table twisting and breaking into bits the wax out of the standish and performing a hundred mad freaks of passionate folly seeing his mistress at last quite pale and tired out with sheer weariness of compassion and watching over his fever for the hundredth time esmond seized up his hat and took his leave as he got into kensington square a sense of remorse came over him for the wearisome pain he had been inflicting upon the dearest and kindest friend ever man had he went back to the house where the servant still stood at the open door ran up the stairs and found his mistress where he had left her in the embrasure of the window looking over the fields towards chelsea she laughed wiping away at the same time the tears which were in her kind eyes he flung himself down on his knees and buried his head in her lap she had in her hand the stalk of one of the flowers a pink that he had torn to pieces “oh pardon me pardon me my dearest and kindest” he said “i am in hell and you are the angel that brings me a drop of water”  “i am your mother you are my son and i love you always” she said holding her hands over him and he went away comforted and humbled in mind as he thought of that amazing and constant love and tenderness with which this sweet lady ever blessed and pursued him    chapter xi the famous mr joseph addison   the gentlemen ushers had a table at kensington and the guard a very splendid dinner daily at st james’s at either of which ordinaries esmond was free to dine dick steele liked the guardtable better than his own at the gentleman ushers’ where there was less wine and more ceremony and esmond had many a jolly afternoon in company of his friend and a hundred times at least saw dick into his chair if there is verity in wine according to the old adage what an amiablenatured character dick’s must have been in proportion as he took in wine he overflowed with kindness his talk was not witty so much as charming he never said a word that could anger anybody and only became the more benevolent the more tipsy he grew many of the wags derided the poor fellow in his cups and chose him as a butt for their satire but there was a kindness about him and a sweet playful fancy that seemed to esmond far more charming than the pointed talk of the brightest wits with their elaborate repartees and affected severities i think steele shone rather than sparkled those famous beauxesprits of the coffeehouses mr william congreve for instance when his gout and his grandeur permitted him to come among us would make many brilliant hits—half a dozen in a night sometimes—but like sharpshooters when they had fired their shot they were obliged to retire under cover till their pieces were loaded again and wait till they got another chance at their enemy whereas dick never thought that his bottlecompanion was a butt to aim at—only a friend to shake by the hand the poor fellow had half the town in his confidence everybody knew everything about his loves and his debts his creditors or his mistress’s obduracy when esmond first came on to the town honest dick was all flames and raptures for a young lady a west india fortune whom he married in a couple of years the lady was dead the fortune was all but spent and the honest widower was as eager in pursuit of a new paragon of beauty as if he had never courted and married and buried the last one  quitting the guardtable on one sunny afternoon when by chance dick had a sober fit upon him he and his friend were making their way down germain street and dick all of a sudden left his companion’s arm and ran after a gentleman who was poring over a folio volume at the bookshop near to st james’s church he was a fair tall man in a snuffcoloured suit with a plain sword very sober and almost shabby in appearance—at least when compared to captain steele who loved to adorn his jolly round person with the finest of clothes and shone in scarlet and gold lace the captain rushed up then to the student of the bookstall took him in his arms hugged him and would have kissed him—for dick was always hugging and bussing his friends—but the other stepped back with a flush on his pale face seeming to decline this public manifestation of steele’s regard  “my dearest joe where hast thou hidden thyself this age” cries the captain still holding both his friend’s hands “i have been languishing for thee this fortnight”  “a fortnight is not an age dick” says the other very goodhumouredly he had light blue eyes extraordinary bright and a face perfectly regular and handsome like a tinted statue “and i have been hiding myself—where do you think”  “what not across the water my dear joe” says steele with a look of great alarm “thou knowest i have always——”  “no” says his friend interrupting him with a smile “we are not come to such straits as that dick i have been hiding sir at a place where people never think of finding you—at my own lodgings whither i am going to smoke a pipe now and drink a glass of sack will your honour come”  “harry esmond come hither” cries out dick “thou hast heard me talk over and over again at my dearest joe my guardian angel”  “indeed” says mr esmond with a bow “it is not from you only that i have learnt to admire mr addison we loved good poetry at cambridge as well as at oxford and i have some of yours by heart though i have put on a redcoat  ‘o qui canoro blandius orpheo vocale ducis carmen’ shall i go on sir” says mr esmond who indeed had read and loved the charming latin poems of mr addison as every scholar of that time knew and admired them  “this is captain esmond who was at blenheim” says steele  “lieutenant esmond” says the other with a low bow “at mr addison’s service”  “i have heard of you” says mr addison with a smile as indeed everybody about town had heard that unlucky story about esmond’s dowager aunt and the duchess  “we were going to the ‘george’ to take a bottle before the play” says steele “wilt thou be one joe”  mr addison said his own lodgings were hard by where he was still rich enough to give a good bottle of wine to his friends and invited the two gentlemen to his apartment in the haymarket whither we accordingly went  “i shall get credit with my landlady” says he with a smile “when she sees two such fine gentlemen as you come up my stair” and he politely made his visitors welcome to his apartment which was indeed but a shabby one though no grandee of the land could receive his guests with a more perfect and courtly grace than this gentleman a frugal dinner consisting of a slice of meat and a penny loaf was awaiting the owner of the lodgings “my wine is better than my meat” says mr addison “my lord halifax sent me the burgundy” and he set a bottle and glasses before his friends and eat his simple dinner in a very few minutes after which the three fell to and began to drink “you see” says mr addison pointing to his writingtable whereon was a map of the action at hochstedt and several other gazettes and pamphlets relating to the battle “that i too am busy about your affairs captain i am engaged as a poetical gazetteer to say truth and am writing a poem on the campaign”  so esmond at the request of his host told him what he knew about the famous battle drew the river on the table aliquo mero and with the aid of some bits of tobaccopipe showed the advance of the left wing where he had been engaged  a sheet or two of the verses lay already on the table beside our bottles and glasses and dick having plentifully refreshed himself from the latter took up the pages of manuscript writ out with scarce a blot or correction in the author’s slim neat handwriting and began to read therefrom with great emphasis and volubility at pauses of the verse the enthusiastic reader stopped and fired off a great salvo of applause  esmond smiled at the enthusiasm of addison’s friend  “you are like the german burghers” says he “and the princes on the mozelle when our army came to a halt they always sent a deputation to compliment the chief and fired a salute with all their artillery from their walls”  “and drunk the great chief’s health afterward did not they” says captain steele gaily filling up a bumper—he never was tardy at that sort of acknowledgement of a friend’s merit  “and the duke since you will have me act his grace’s part” says mr addison with a smile and something of a blush “pledged his friends in return most serene elector of covent garden i drink to your highness’s health” and he filled himself a glass joseph required scarce more pressing than dick to that sort of amusement but the wine never seemed at all to fluster mr addison’s brains it only unloosed his tongue whereas captain steele’s head and speech were quite overcome by a single bottle  no matter what the verses were and to say truth mr esmond found some of them more than indifferent dick’s enthusiasm for his chief never faltered and in every line from addison’s pen steele found a masterstroke by the time dick had come to that part of the poem wherein the bard describes as blandly as though he were recording a dance at the opera or a harmless bout of bucolic cudgelling at a village fair that bloody and ruthless part of our campaign with the remembrance whereof every soldier who bore a part in it must sicken with shame—when we were ordered to ravage and lay waste the elector’s country and with fire and murder slaughter and crime a great part of his dominions was overrun when dick came to the lines—       in vengeance roused the soldier fills his hand     with sword and fire and ravages the land     in crackling flames a thousand harvests burn     a thousand villages to ashes turn     to the thick woods the woolly flocks retreat     and mixed with bellowing herds confusedly bleat     their trembling lords the common shade partake     and cries of infants found in every brake     the listening soldier fixed in sorrow stands     loath to obey his leader’s just commands     the leader grieves by generous pity swayed     to see his just commands so well obeyed   by this time wine and friendship had brought poor dick to a perfectly maudlin state and he hiccuped out the last line with a tenderness that set one of his auditors alaughing  “i admire the licence of you poets” says esmond to mr addison dick after reading of the verses was fain to go off insisting on kissing his two dear friends before his departure and reeling away with his periwig over his eyes “i admire your art the murder of the campaign is done to military music like a battle at the opera and the virgins shriek in harmony as our victorious grenadiers march into their villages do you know what a scene it was” by this time perhaps the wine had warmed mr esmond’s head too—“what a triumph you are celebrating what scenes of shame and horror were enacted over which the commander’s genius presided as calm as though he didn’t belong to our sphere you talk of the ‘listening soldier fixed in sorrow’ the ‘leader’s grief swayed by generous pity’ to my belief the leader cared no more for bleating flocks than he did for infants’ cries and many of our ruffians butchered one or the other with equal alacrity i was ashamed of my trade when i saw those horrors perpetrated which came under every man’s eyes you hew out of your polished verses a stately image of smiling victory i tell you ’tis an uncouth distorted savage idol hideous bloody and barbarous the rites performed before it are shocking to think of you great poets should show it as it is—ugly and horrible not beautiful and serene oh sir had you made the campaign believe me you never would have sung it so”  during this little outbreak mr addison was listening smoking out of his long pipe and smiling very placidly “what would you have” says he “in our polished days and according to the rules of art ’tis impossible that the muse should depict tortures or begrime her hands with the horrors of war these are indicated rather than described as in the greek tragedies that i dare say you have read and sure there can be no more elegant specimens of composition agamemnon is slain or medea’s children destroyed away from the scene—the chorus occupying the stage and singing of the action to pathetic music something of this i attempt my dear sir in my humble way ’tis a panegyric i mean to write and not a satire were i to sing as you would have me the town would tear the poet in pieces and burn his book by the hands of the common hangman do you not use tobacco of all the weeds grown on earth sure the nicotian is the most soothing and salutary we must paint our great duke” mr addison went on “not as a man which no doubt he is with weaknesses like the rest of us but as a hero ’tis in a triumph not a battle that your humble servant is riding his sleek pegasus we collegepoets trot you know on very easy nags it hath been time out of mind part of the poet’s profession to celebrate the actions of heroes in verse and to sing the deeds which you men of war perform i must follow the rules of my art and the composition of such a strain as this must be harmonious and majestic not familiar or too near the vulgar truth si parva licet if virgil could invoke the divine augustus a humbler poet from the banks of the isis may celebrate a victory and a conqueror of our own nation in whose triumphs every briton has a share and whose glory and genius contributes to every citizen’s individual honour when hath there been since our henrys’ and edwards’ days such a great feat of arms as that from which you yourself have brought away marks of distinction if ’tis in my power to sing that song worthily i will do so and be thankful to my muse if i fail as a poet as a briton at least i will show my loyalty and fling up my cap and huzzah for the conqueror       ————“rheni pacator et istri     omnis in hoc uno variis discordia cessit     ordinibus laetatur eques plauditque senator     votaque patricio certant plebeia favori”   “there were as brave men on that field” says mr esmond who never could be made to love the duke of marlborough nor to forget those stories which he used to hear in his youth regarding that great chief’s selfishness and treachery—“there were men at blenheim as good as the leader whom neither knights nor senators applauded nor voices plebeian or patrician favoured and who lie there forgotten under the clods what poet is there to sing them”  “to sing the gallant souls of heroes sent to hades” says mr addison with a smile “would you celebrate them all if i may venture to question anything in such an admirable work the catalogue of the ships in homer hath always appeared to me as somewhat wearisome what had the poem been supposing the writer had chronicled the names of captains lieutenants rank and file one of the greatest of a great man’s qualities is success ’tis the result of all the others ’tis a latent power in him which compels the favour of the gods and subjugates fortune of all his gifts i admire that one in the great marlborough to be brave every man is brave but in being victorious as he is i fancy there is something divine in presence of the occasion the great soul of the leader shines out and the god is confessed death itself respects him and passes by him to lay others low war and carnage flee before him to ravage other parts of the field as hector from before the divine achilles you say he hath no pity no more have the gods who are above it and superhuman the fainting battle gathers strength at his aspect and wherever he rides victory charges with him”  a couple of days after when mr esmond revisited his poetic friend he found this thought struck out in the fervour of conversation improved and shaped into those famous lines which are in truth the noblest in the poem of the campaign as the two gentlemen sat engaged in talk mr addison solacing himself with his customary pipe the little maidservant that waited on his lodging came up preceding a gentleman in fine laced clothes that had evidently been figuring at court or a great man’s levee the courtier coughed a little at the smoke of the pipe and looked round the room curiously which was shabby enough as was the owner in his worn snuffcoloured suit and plain tiewig  “how goes on the magnum opus mr addison” says the court gentleman on looking down at the papers that were on the table  “we were but now over it” says addison the greatest courtier in the land could not have a more splendid politeness or greater dignity of manner “here is the plan” says he “on the table hac ibat simois here ran the little river nebel hic est sigeia tellus here are tallard’s quarters at the bowl of this pipe at the attack of which captain esmond was present i have the honour to introduce him to mr boyle and mr esmond was but now depicting aliquo praelia mixta mero when you came in” in truth the two gentlemen had been so engaged when the visitor arrived and addison in his smiling way speaking of mr webb colonel of esmond’s regiment who commanded a brigade in the action and greatly distinguished himself there was lamenting that he could find never a suitable rhyme for webb otherwise the brigade should have had a place in the poet’s verses “and for you you are but a lieutenant” says addison “and the muse can’t occupy herself with any gentleman under the rank of a fieldofficer”  mr boyle was all impatient to hear saying that my lord treasurer and my lord halifax were equally anxious and addison blushing began reading of his verses and i suspect knew their weak parts as well as the most critical hearer when he came to the lines describing the angel that       inspired repulsed battalions to engage     and taught the doubtful battle where to rage   he read with great animation looking at esmond as much as to say “you know where that simile came from—from our talk and our bottle of burgundy the other day”  the poet’s two hearers were caught with enthusiasm and applauded the verses with all their might the gentleman of the court sprang up in great delight “not a word more my dear sir” says he “trust me with the papers—i’ll defend them with my life let me read them over to my lord treasurer whom i am appointed to see in half an hour i venture to promise the verses shall lose nothing by my reading and then sir we shall see whether lord halifax has a right to complain that his friend’s pension is no longer paid” and without more ado the courtier in lace seized the manuscript pages placed them in his breast with his ruffled hand over his heart executed a most gracious wave of the hat with the disengaged hand and smiled and bowed out of the room leaving an odour of pomander behind him  “does not the chamber look quite dark” says addison surveying it “after the glorious appearance and disappearance of that gracious messenger why he illuminated the whole room your scarlet mr esmond will bear any light but this threadbare old coat of mine how very worn it looked under the glare of that splendour i wonder whether they will do anything for me” he continued “when i came out of oxford into the world my patrons promised me great things and you see where their promises have landed me in a lodging up two pair of stairs with a sixpenny dinner from the cook’s shop well i suppose this promise will go after the others and fortune will jilt me as the jade has been doing any time these seven years ‘i puff the prostitute away’ ” says he smiling and blowing a cloud out of his pipe “there is no hardship in poverty esmond that is not bearable no hardship even in honest dependence that an honest man may not put up with i came out of the lap of alma mater puffed up with her praises of me and thinking to make a figure in the world with the parts and learning which had got me no small name in our college the world is the ocean and isis and charwell are but little drops of which the sea takes no account my reputation ended a mile beyond maudlin tower no one took note of me and i learned this at least to bear up against evil fortune with a cheerful heart friend dick hath made a figure in the world and has passed me in the race long ago what matters a little name or a little fortune there is no fortune that a philosopher cannot endure i have been not unknown as a scholar and yet forced to live by turning bearleader and teaching a boy to spell what then the life was not pleasant but possible—the bear was bearable should this venture fail i will go back to oxford and some day when you are a general you shall find me a curate in a cassock and bands and i shall welcome your honour to my cottage in the country and to a mug of penny ale ’tis not poverty that’s the hardest to bear or the least happy lot in life” says mr addison shaking the ash out of his pipe “see my pipe is smoked out shall we have another bottle i have still a couple in the cupboard and of the right sort no more—let us go abroad and take a turn on the mall or look in at the theatre and see dick’s comedy ’tis not a masterpiece of wit but dick is a good fellow though he doth not set the thames on fire”  within a month after this day mr addison’s ticket had come up a prodigious prize in the lottery of life all the town was in an uproar of admiration of his poem the campaign which dick steele was spouting at every coffeehouse in whitehall and covent garden the wits on the other side of temple bar saluted him at once as the greatest poet the world had seen for ages the people huzza’ed for marlborough and for addison and more than this the party in power provided for the meritorious poet and mr addison got the appointment of commissioner of excise which the famous mr locke vacated and rose from this place to other dignities and honours his prosperity from henceforth to the end of his life being scarce ever interrupted but i doubt whether he was not happier in his garret in the haymarket than ever he was in his splendid palace at kensington and i believe the fortune that came to him in the shape of the countess his wife was no better than a shrew and a vixen                      gay as the town was ’twas but a dreary place for mr esmond whether his charmer was in it or out of it and he was glad when his general gave him notice that he was going back to his division of the army which lay in winter quarters at boisleduc his dear mistress bade him farewell with a cheerful face her blessing he knew he had always and wheresoever fate carried him mrs beatrix was away in attendance on her majesty at hampton court and kissed her fair fingertips to him by way of adieu when he rode thither to take his leave she received her kinsman in a waitingroom where there were half a dozen more ladies of the court so that his highflown speeches had he intended to make any and very likely he did were impossible and she announced to her friends that her cousin was going to the army in as easy a manner as she would have said he was going to a chocolatehouse he asked with a rather rueful face if she had any orders for the army and she was pleased to say that she would like a mantle of mechlin lace she made him a saucy curtsy in reply to his own dismal bow she deigned to kiss her fingertips from the window where she stood laughing with the other ladies and chanced to see him as he made his way to the “toy” the dowager at chelsea was not sorry to part with him this time “mon cher vous êtes triste comme un sermon” she did him the honour to say to him indeed gentlemen in his condition are by no means amusing companions and besides the fickle old woman had now found a much more amiable favourite and raffole’d for her darling lieutenant of the guard frank remained behind for a while and did not join the army till later in the suite of his grace the commanderinchief his dear mother on the last day before esmond went away and when the three dined together made esmond promise to befriend her boy and besought frank to take the example of his kinsman as of a loyal gentleman and brave soldier so she was pleased to say and at parting betrayed not the least sign of faltering or weakness though god knows that fond heart was fearful enough when others were concerned though so resolute in bearing its own pain  esmond’s general embarked at harwich ’twas a grand sight to see mr webb dressed in scarlet on the deck waving his hat as our yacht put off and the guns saluted from the shore harry did not see his viscount again until three months after at boisleduc when his grace the duke came to take the command and frank brought a budget of news from home how he had supped with this actress and got tired of that how he had got the better of mr st john both over the bottle and with mrs mountford of the haymarket theatre a veteran charmer of fifty with whom the young scapegrace chose to fancy himself in love how his sister was always at her tricks and had jilted a young baron for an old earl “i can’t make out beatrix” he said “she cares for none of us—she only thinks about herself she is never happy unless she is quarrelling but as for my mother—my mother harry is an angel” harry tried to impress on the young fellow the necessity of doing everything in his power to please that angel not to drink too much not to go into debt not to run after the pretty flemish girls and so forth as became a senior speaking to a lad “but lord bless thee” the boy said “i may do what i like and i know she will love me all the same” and so indeed he did what he liked everybody spoiled him and his grave kinsman as much as the rest    chapter xii i get a company in the campaign of 1706   on whit sunday the famous 23rd of may 1706 my young lord first came under the fire of the enemy whom we found posted in order of battle their lines extending three miles or more over the high ground behind the little gheet river and having on his left the little village of anderkirk or autreéglise and on his right ramillies which has given its name to one of the most brilliant and disastrous days of battle that history ever hath recorded  our duke here once more met his old enemy of blenheim the bavarian elector and the mareschal villeroy over whom the prince of savoy had gained the famous victory of chiari what englishman or frenchman doth not know the issue of that day having chosen his own ground having a force superior to the english and besides the excellent spanish and bavarian troops the whole maisonduroy with him the most splendid body of horse in the world—in an hour and in spite of the prodigious gallantry of the french royal household who charged through the centre of our line and broke it this magnificent army of villeroy was utterly routed by troops that had been marching for twelve hours and by the intrepid skill of a commander who did indeed seem in the presence of the enemy to be the very genius of victory  i think it was more from conviction than policy though that policy was surely the most prudent in the world that the great duke always spoke of his victories with an extraordinary modesty and as if it was not so much his own admirable genius and courage which achieved these amazing successes but as if he was a special and fatal instrument in the hands of providence that willed irresistibly the enemy’s overthrow before his actions he always had the church service read solemnly and professed an undoubting belief that our queen’s arms were blessed and our victory sure all the letters which he writ after his battles show awe rather than exultation and he attributes the glory of these achievements about which i have heard mere petty officers and men bragging with a pardonable vainglory in no wise to his own bravery or skill but to the superintending protection of heaven which he ever seemed to think was our especial ally and our army got to believe so and the enemy learnt to think so too for we never entered into a battle without a perfect confidence that it was to end in a victory nor did the french after the issue of blenheim and that astonishing triumph of ramillies ever meet us without feeling that the game was lost before it was begun to be played and that our general’s fortune was irresistible here as at blenheim the duke’s charger was shot and ’twas thought for a moment he was dead as he mounted another binfield his master of the horse kneeling to hold his grace’s stirrup had his head shot away by a cannonball a french gentleman of the royal household that was a prisoner with us told the writer that at the time of the charge of the household when their horse and ours were mingled an irish officer recognized the princeduke and calling out—“marlborough marlborough” fired his pistol at him à bout portant and that a score more carbines and pistols were discharged at him not one touched him he rode through the french cuirassiers sword in hand and entirely unhurt and calm and smiling rallied the german horse that was reeling before the enemy brought these and twenty squadrons of orkney’s back upon them and drove the french across the river again—leading the charge himself and defeating the only dangerous move the french made that day  majorgeneral webb commanded on the left of our line and had his own regiment under the orders of their beloved colonel neither he nor they belied their character for gallantry on this occasion but it was about his dear young lord that esmond was anxious never having sight of him save once in the whole course of the day when he brought an order from the commanderinchief to mr webb when our horse having charged round the right flank of the enemy by overkirk had thrown him into entire confusion a general advance was made and our whole line of foot crossing the little river and the morass ascended the high ground where the french were posted cheering as they went the enemy retreating before them ’twas a service of more glory than danger the french battalions never waiting to exchange push of pike or bayonet with ours and the gunners flying from their pieces which our line left behind us as they advanced and the french fell back  at first it was a retreat orderly enough but presently the retreat became a rout and a frightful slaughter of the french ensued on this panic so that an army of sixty thousand men was utterly crushed and destroyed in the course of a couple of hours it was as if a hurricane had seized a compact and numerous fleet flung it all to the winds shattered sunk and annihilated it afflavit deus et dissipati sunt the french army of flanders was gone their artillery their standards their treasure provisions and ammunition were all left behind them the poor devils had even fled without their soupkettles which are as much the palladia of the french infantry as of the grand signor’s janizaries and round which they rally even more than round their lilies  the pursuit and a dreadful carnage which ensued for the dregs of a battle however brilliant are ever a base residue of rapine cruelty and drunken plunder was carried far beyond the field of ramillies  honest lockwood esmond’s servant no doubt wanted to be among the marauders himself and take his share of the booty for when the action over and the troops got to their ground for the night the captain bade lockwood get a horse he asked with a very rueful countenance whether his honour would have him come too but his honour only bade him go about his own business and jack hopped away quite delighted as soon as he saw his master mounted esmond made his way and not without danger and difficulty to his grace’s head quarters and found for himself very quickly where the aides de camp’s quarters were in an outbuilding of a farm where several of these gentlemen were seated drinking and singing and at supper if he had any anxiety about his boy ’twas relieved at once one of the gentlemen was singing a song to a tune that mr farquhar and mr gay both had used in their admirable comedies and very popular in the army of that day after the song came a chorus “over the hills and far away” and esmond heard frank’s fresh voice soaring as it were over the songs of the rest of the young men—a voice that had always a certain artless indescribable pathos with it and indeed which caused mr esmond’s eyes to fill with tears now out of thankfulness to god the child was safe and still alive to laugh and sing  when the song was over esmond entered the room where he knew several of the gentlemen present and there sat my young lord having taken off his cuirass his waistcoat open his face flushed his long yellow hair hanging over his shoulders drinking with the rest the youngest gayest handsomest there as soon as he saw esmond he clapped down his glass and running towards his friend put both his arms round him and embraced him the other’s voice trembled with joy as he greeted the lad he had thought but now as he stood in the courtyard under the clearshining moonlight “great god what a scene of murder is here within a mile of us what hundreds and thousands have faced danger today and here are these lads singing over their cups and the same moon that is shining over yonder horrid field is looking down on walcote very likely while my lady sits and thinks about her boy that is at the war” as esmond embraced his young pupil now ’twas with the feeling of quite religious thankfulness and an almost paternal pleasure that he beheld him  round his neck was a star with a striped ribbon that was made of small brilliants and might be worth a hundred crowns “look” says he “won’t that be a pretty present for mother”  “who gave you the order” says harry saluting the gentleman “did you win it in battle”  “i won it” cried the other “with my sword and my spear there was a mousquetaire that had it round his neck—such a big mousquetaire as big as general webb i called out to him to surrender and that i’d give him quarter he called me a petit polisson and fired his pistol at me and then sent it at my head with a curse i rode at him sir drove my sword right under his armhole and broke it in the rascal’s body i found a purse in his holster with sixtyfive louis in it and a bundle of loveletters and a flask of hungarywater vive la guerre there are the ten pieces you lent me i should like to have a fight every day” and he pulled at his little moustache and bade a servant bring a supper to captain esmond  harry fell to with a very good appetite he had tasted nothing since twenty hours ago at early dawn master grandson who read this do you look for the history of battles and sieges go find them in the proper books this is only the story of your grandfather and his family far more pleasant to him than the victory though for that too he may say meminisse juvat it was to find that the day was over and his dear young castlewood was unhurt  and would you sirrah wish to know how it was that a sedate captain of foot a studious and rather solitary bachelor of eight or nine and twenty years of age who did not care very much for the jollities which his comrades engaged in and was never known to lose his heart in any garrison town—should you wish to know why such a man had so prodigious a tenderness and tended so fondly a boy of eighteen wait my good friend until thou art in love with thy schoolfellow’s sister and then see how mighty tender thou wilt be towards him esmond’s general and his grace the princeduke were notoriously at variance and the former’s friendship was in no wise likely to advance any man’s promotion of whose services webb spoke well but rather likely to injure him so the army said in the favour of the greater man however mr esmond had the good fortune to be mentioned very advantageously by majorgeneral webb in his report after the action and the major of his regiment and two of the captains having been killed upon the day of ramillies esmond who was second of the lieutenants got his company and had the honour of serving as captain esmond in the next campaign  my lord went home in the winter but esmond was afraid to follow him his dear mistress wrote him letters more than once thanking him as mothers know how to thank for his care and protection of her boy extolling esmond’s own merits with a great deal more praise than they deserved for he did his duty no better than any other officer and speaking sometimes though gently and cautiously of beatrix news came from home of at least half a dozen grand matches that the beautiful maid of honour was about to make she was engaged to an earl our gentlemen of st james’s said and then jilted him for a duke who in his turn had drawn off earl or duke it might be who should win this helen esmond knew she would never bestow herself on a poor captain her conduct it was clear was little satisfactory to her mother who scarcely mentioned her or else the kind lady thought it was best to say nothing and leave time to work out its cure at any rate harry was best away from the fatal object which always wrought him so much mischief and so he never asked for leave to go home but remained with his regiment that was garrisoned in brussels which city fell into our hands when the victory of ramillies drove the french out of flanders    chapter xiii i meet an old acquaintance in flanders and find my mother’s grave and my own cradle there   being one day in the church of st gudule at brussels admiring the antique splendour of the architecture and always entertaining a great tenderness and reverence for the mother church that hath been as wickedly persecuted in england as ever she herself persecuted in the days of her prosperity esmond saw kneeling at a side altar an officer in a green uniform coat very deeply engaged in devotion something familiar in the figure and posture of the kneeling man struck captain esmond even before he saw the officer’s face as he rose up putting away into his pocket a little black breviary such as priests use esmond beheld a countenance so like that of his friend and tutor of early days father holt that he broke out into an exclamation of astonishment and advanced a step towards the gentleman who was making his way out of church the german officer too looked surprised when he saw esmond and his face from being pale grew suddenly red by this mark of recognition the englishman knew that he could not be mistaken and though the other did not stop but on the contrary rather hastily walked away towards the door esmond pursued him and faced him once more as the officer helping himself to holy water turned mechanically towards the altar to bow to it ere he quitted the sacred edifice  “my father” says esmond in english  “silence i do not understand i do not speak english” says the other in latin  esmond smiled at this sign of confusion and replied in the same language “i should know my father in any garment black or white shaven or bearded” for the austrian officer was habited quite in the military manner and had as warlike a moustachio as any pandour  he laughed—we were on the church steps by this time passing through the crowd of beggars that usually is there holding up little trinkets for sale and whining for alms “you speak latin” says he “in the english way harry esmond you have forsaken the old true roman tongue you once knew” his tone was very frank and friendly quite the kind voice of fifteen years back he gave esmond his hand as he spoke  “others have changed their coats too my father” says esmond glancing at his friend’s military decoration  “hush i am mr or captain von holtz in the bavarian elector’s service and on a mission to his highness the prince of savoy you can keep a secret i know from old times”  “captain von holtz” says esmond “i am your very humble servant”  “and you too have changed your coat” continues the other in his laughing way “i have heard of you at cambridge and afterwards we have friends everywhere and i am told that mr esmond at cambridge was as good a fencer as he was a bad theologian” so thinks esmond my old maitre d’armes was a jesuit as they said  “perhaps you are right” says the other reading his thoughts quite as he used to do in old days “you were all but killed at hochstedt of a wound in the left side you were before that at vigo aide de camp to the duke of ormonde you got your company the other day after ramillies your general and the princeduke are not friends he is of the webbs of lydiard tregoze in the county of york a relation of my lord st john your cousin monsieur de castlewood served his first campaign this year in the guard yes i do know a few things as you see”  captain esmond laughed in his turn “you have indeed a curious knowledge” he says a foible of mr holt’s who did know more about books and men than perhaps almost any person esmond had ever met was omniscience thus in every point he here professed to know he was nearly right but not quite esmond’s wound was in the right side not the left his first general was general lumley mr webb came out of wiltshire not out of yorkshire and so forth esmond did not think fit to correct his old master in these trifling blunders but they served to give him a knowledge of the other’s character and he smiled to think that this was his oracle of early days only now no longer infallible or divine  “yes” continues father holt or captain von holtz “for a man who has not been in england these eight years i know what goes on in london very well the old dean is dead my lady castlewood’s father do you know that your recusant bishops wanted to consecrate him bishop of southampton and that collier is bishop of thetford by the same imposition the princess anne has the gout and eats too much when the king returns collier will be an archbishop”  “amen” says esmond laughing “and i hope to see your eminence no longer in jackboots but red stockings at whitehall”  “you are always with us—i know that—i heard of that when you were at cambridge so was the late lord so is the young viscount”  “and so was my father before me” said mr esmond looking calmly at the other who did not however show the least sign of intelligence in his impenetrable grey eyes—how well harry remembered them and their look only crows’ feet were wrinkled round them—marks of black old time had settled there  esmond’s face chose to show no more sign of meaning than the father’s there may have been on the one side and the other just the faintest glitter of recognition as you see a bayonet shining out of an ambush but each party fell back when everything was again dark  “and you mon capitaine where have you been” says esmond turning away the conversation from this dangerous ground where neither chose to engage  “i may have been in pekin” says he “or i may have been in paraguay—who knows where i am now captain von holtz in the service of his electoral highness come to negotiate exchange of prisoners with his highness of savoy”  ’twas well known that very many officers in our army were wellaffected towards the young king at st germains whose right to the throne was undeniable and whose accession to it at the death of his sister by far the greater part of the english people would have preferred to the having a petty german prince for a sovereign about whose cruelty rapacity boorish manners and odious foreign ways a thousand stories were current it wounded our english pride to think that a shabby highdutch duke whose revenues were not a tithe as great as those of many of the princes of our ancient english nobility who could not speak a word of our language and whom we chose to represent as a sort of german boor feeding on trainoil and sauerkraut with a bevy of mistresses in a barn should come to reign over the proudest and most polished people in the world were we the conquerors of the grand monarch to submit to that ignoble domination what did the hanoverian’s protestantism matter to us was it not notorious we were told and led to believe so that one of the daughters of this protestant hero was being bred up with no religion at all as yet and ready to be made lutheran or roman according as the husband might be whom her parents should find for her this talk very idle and abusive much of it was went on at a hundred messtables in the army there was scarce an ensign that did not hear it or join in it and everybody knew or affected to know that the commanderinchief himself had relations with his nephew the duke of berwick ’twas by an englishman thank god that we were beaten at almanza and that his grace was most anxious to restore the royal race of his benefactors and to repair his former treason  this is certain that for a considerable period no officer in the duke’s army lost favour with the commanderinchief for entertaining or proclaiming his loyalty towards the exiled family when the chevalier de st george as the king of england called himself came with the dukes of the french blood royal to join the french army under vendosme hundreds of ours saw him and cheered him and we all said he was like his father in this who seeing the action of la hogue fought between the french ships and ours was on the side of his native country during the battle but this at least the chevalier knew and every one knew that however well our troops and their general might be inclined towards the prince personally in the face of the enemy there was no question at all wherever my lord duke found a french army he would fight and beat it as he did at oudenarde two years after ramillies where his grace achieved another of his transcendent victories and the noble young prince who charged gallantly along with the magnificent maisonduroy sent to compliment his conquerors after the action  in this battle where the young electoral prince of hanover behaved himself very gallantly fighting on our side esmond’s dear general webb distinguished himself prodigiously exhibiting consummate skill and coolness as a general and fighting with the personal bravery of a common soldier esmond’s good luck again attended him he escaped without a hurt although more than a third of his regiment was killed had again the honour to be favourably mentioned in his commander’s report and was advanced to the rank of major but of this action there is little need to speak as it hath been related in every gazette and talked of in every hamlet in this country to return from it to the writer’s private affairs which here in his old age and at a distance he narrates for his children who come after him before oudenarde and after that chance rencontre with captain von holtz at brussels a space of more than a year elapsed during which the captain of jesuits and the captain of webb’s fusiliers were thrown very much together esmond had no difficulty in finding out indeed the other made no secret of it to him being assured from old times of his pupil’s fidelity that the negotiator of prisoners was an agent from st germains and that he carried intelligence between great personages in our camp and that of the french “my business” said he “and i tell you both because i can trust you and your keen eyes have already discovered it is between the king of england and his subjects here engaged in fighting the french king as between you and them all the jesuits in the world will not prevent your quarrelling fight it out gentlemen st george for england i say—and you know who says so wherever he may be”  i think holt loved to make a parade of mystery as it were and would appear and disappear at our quarters as suddenly as he used to return and vanish in the old days at castlewood he had passes between both armies and seemed to know but with that inaccuracy which belonged to the good father’s omniscience equally well what passed in the french camp and in ours one day he would give esmond news of a great feste that took place in the french quarters of a supper of monsieur de rohan’s where there was play and violins and then dancing and masques the king drove thither in marshal villar’s own guinguette another day he had the news of his majesty’s ague the king had not had a fit these ten days and might be said to be well captain holtz made a visit to england during this time so eager was he about negotiating prisoners and ’twas on returning from this voyage that he began to open himself more to esmond and to make him as occasion served at their various meetings several of those confidences which are here set down all together  the reason of his increased confidence was this upon going to london the old director of esmond’s aunt the dowager paid her ladyship a visit at chelsey and there learnt from her that captain esmond was acquainted with the secret of his family and was determined never to divulge it the knowledge of this fact raised esmond in his old tutor’s eyes so holt was pleased to say and he admired harry very much for his abnegation  “the family at castlewood have done far more for me than my own ever did” esmond said “i would give my life for them why should i grudge the only benefit that ’tis in my power to confer on them” the good father’s eyes filled with tears at this speech which to the other seemed very simple he embraced esmond and broke out into many admiring expressions he said he was a noble cœur that he was proud of him and fond of him as his pupil and friend—regretted more than ever that he had lost him and been forced to leave him in those early times when he might have had an influence over him have brought him into that only true church to which the father belonged and enlisted him in the noblest army in which a man ever engaged—meaning his own society of jesus which numbers says he in its troops the greatest heroes the world ever knew—warriors brave enough to dare or endure anything to encounter any odds to die any death—soldiers that have won triumphs a thousand times more brilliant than those of the greatest general that have brought nations on their knees to their sacred banner the cross that have achieved glories and palms incomparably brighter than those awarded to the most splendid earthly conquerors—crowns of immortal light and seats in the high places of heaven  esmond was thankful for his old friend’s good opinion however little he might share the jesuit father’s enthusiasm “i have thought of that question too” says he “dear father” and he took the other’s hand—“thought it out for myself as all men must and contrive to do the right and trust to heaven as devoutly in my way as you in yours another six months of you as a child and i had desired no better i used to weep upon my pillow at castlewood as i thought of you and i might have been a brother of your order and who knows” esmond added with a smile “a priest in full orders and with a pair of moustachios and a bavarian uniform”  “my son” says father holt turning red “in the cause of religion and loyalty all disguises are fair”  “yes” broke in esmond “all disguises are fair you say and all uniforms say i black or red—a black cockade or a white one—or a laced hat or a sombrero with a tonsure under it i cannot believe that st francis xavier sailed over the sea in a cloak or raised the dead—i tried and very nearly did once but cannot suffer me to do the right and to hope for the best in my own way”  esmond wished to cut short the good father’s theology and succeeded and the other sighing over his pupil’s invincible ignorance did not withdraw his affection from him but gave him his utmost confidence—as much that is to say as a priest can give more than most do for he was naturally garrulous and too eager to speak  holt’s friendship encouraged captain esmond to ask what he long wished to know and none could tell him some history of the poor mother whom he had often imagined in his dreams and whom he never knew he described to holt those circumstances which are already put down in the first part of this story—the promise he had made to his dear lord and that dying friend’s confession and he besought mr holt to tell him what he knew regarding the poor woman from whom he had been taken  “she was of this very town” holt said and took esmond to see the street where her father lived and where as he believed she was born “in 1676 when your father came hither in the retinue of the late king then duke of york and banished hither in disgrace captain thomas esmond became acquainted with your mother pursued her and made a victim of her he hath told me in many subsequent conversations which i felt bound to keep private then that she was a woman of great virtue and tenderness and in all respects a most fond faithful creature he called himself captain thomas having good reason to be ashamed of his conduct towards her and hath spoken to me many times with sincere remorse for that as with fond love for her many amiable qualities he owned to having treated her very ill and that at this time his life was one of profligacy gambling and poverty she became with child of you was cursed by her own parents at that discovery though she never upbraided except by her involuntary tears and the misery depicted on her countenance the author of her wretchedness and ruin  “thomas esmond—captain thomas as he was called—became engaged in a gaminghouse brawl of which the consequence was a duel and a wound so severe that he never—his surgeon said—could outlive it thinking his death certain and touched with remorse he sent for a priest of the very church of st gudule where i met you and on the same day after his making submission to our church was married to your mother a few weeks before you were born my lord viscount castlewood marquis of esmond by king james’s patent which i myself took to your father your lordship was christened at st gudule by the same curé who married your parents and by the name of henry thomas son of e thomas officier anglais and gertrude maes you see you belong to us from your birth and why i did not christen you when you became my dear little pupil at castlewood  “your father’s wound took a favourable turn—perhaps his conscience was eased by the right he had done—and to the surprise of the doctors he recovered but as his health came back his wicked nature too returned he was tired of the poor girl whom he had ruined and receiving some remittance from his uncle my lord the old viscount then in england he pretended business promised return and never saw your poor mother more  “he owned to me in confession first but afterwards in talk before your aunt his wife else i never could have disclosed what i now tell you that on coming to london he writ a pretended confession to poor gertrude maes—gertrude esmond—of his having been married in england previously before uniting himself with her said that his name was not thomas that he was about to quit europe for the virginia plantations where indeed your family had a grant of land from king charles the first sent her a supply of money the half of the last hundred guineas he had entreated her pardon and bade her farewell  “poor gertrude never thought that the news in this letter might be untrue as the rest of your father’s conduct to her but though a young man of her own degree who knew her history and whom she liked before she saw the english gentleman who was the cause of all her misery offered to marry her and to adopt you as his own child and give you his name she refused him this refusal only angered her father who had taken her home she never held up her head there being the subject of constant unkindness after her fall and some devout ladies of her acquaintance offering to pay a little pension for her she went into a convent and you were put out to nurse  “a sister of the young fellow who would have adopted you as his son was the person who took charge of you your mother and this person were cousins she had just lost a child of her own which you replaced your own mother being too sick and feeble to feed you and presently your nurse grew so fond of you that she even grudged letting you visit the convent where your mother was and where the nuns petted the little infant as they pitied and loved its unhappy parent her vocation became stronger every day and at the end of two years she was received as a sister of the house  “your nurse’s family were silkweavers out of france whither they returned to arras in french flanders shortly before your mother took her vows carrying you with them then a child of three years old ’twas a town before the late vigorous measures of the french king full of protestants and here your nurse’s father old pastoureau he with whom you afterwards lived at ealing adopted the reformed doctrines perverting all his house with him they were expelled thence by the edict of his most christian majesty and came to london and set up their looms in spittlefields the old man brought a little money with him and carried on his trade but in a poor way he was a widower by this time his daughter a widow too kept house for him and his son and he laboured together at their vocation meanwhile your father had publicly owned his conversion just before king charles’s death in whom our church had much such another convert was reconciled to my lord viscount castlewood and married as you know to his daughter  “it chanced that the younger pastoureau going with a piece of brocade to the mercer who employed him on ludgate hill met his old rival coming out of an ordinary there pastoureau knew your father at once seized him by the collar and upbraided him as a villain who had seduced his mistress and afterwards deserted her and her son mr thomas esmond also recognized pastoureau at once besought him to calm his indignation and not to bring a crowd round about them and bade him to enter into the tavern out of which he had just stepped when he would give him any explanation pastoureau entered and heard the landlord order the drawer to show captain thomas to a room it was by his christian name that your father was familiarly called at his tavern haunts which to say the truth were none of the most reputable  “i must tell you that captain thomas or my lord viscount afterwards was never at a loss for a story and could cajole a woman or a dun with a volubility and an air of simplicity at the same time of which many a creditor of his has been the dupe his tales used to gather verisimilitude as he went on with them he strung together fact after fact with a wonderful rapidity and coherence it required saving your presence a very long habit of acquaintance with your father to know when his lordship was l———telling the truth or no  “he told me with rueful remorse when he was ill—for the fear of death set him instantly repenting and with shrieks of laughter when he was well his lordship having a very great sense of humour—how in half an hour’s time and before a bottle was drunk he had completely succeeded in biting poor pastoureau the seduction he owned too that he could not help he was quite ready with tears at a moment’s warning and shed them profusely to melt his credulous listener he wept for your mother even more than pastoureau did who cried very heartily poor fellow as my lord informed me he swore upon his honour that he had twice sent money to brussels and mentioned the name of the merchant with whom it was lying for poor gertrude’s use he did not even know whether she had a child or no or whether she was alive or dead but got these facts easily out of honest pastoureau’s answers to him when he heard that she was in a convent he said he hoped to end his days in one himself should he survive his wife whom he hated and had been forced by a cruel father to marry and when he was told that gertrude’s son was alive and actually in london ‘i started’ says he ‘for then damme my wife was expecting to liein and i thought should this old put my fatherinlaw run rusty here would be a good chance to frighten him’  “he expressed the deepest gratitude to the pastoureau family for their care of the infant you were now near six years old and on pastoureau bluntly telling him when he proposed to go that instant and see the darling child that they never wished to see his illomened face again within their doors that he might have the boy though they should all be very sorry to lose him and that they would take his money they being poor if he gave it or bring him up by god’s help as they had hitherto done without he acquiesced in this at once with a sigh said ‘well ’twas better that the dear child should remain with friends who had been so admirably kind to him’ and in his talk to me afterwards honestly praised and admired the weaver’s conduct and spirit owned that the frenchman was a right fellow and he the lord have mercy upon him a sad villain  “your father” mr holt went on to say “was goodnatured with his money when he had it and having that day received a supply from his uncle gave the weaver ten pieces with perfect freedom and promised him further remittances he took down eagerly pastoureau’s name and place of abode in his tablebook and when the other asked him for his own gave with the utmost readiness his name as captain thomas new lodge penzance cornwall he said he was in london for a few days only on business connected with his wife’s property described her as a shrew though a woman of kind disposition and depicted his father as a cornish squire in an infirm state of health at whose death he hoped for something handsome when he promised richly to reward the admirable protector of his child and to provide for the boy ‘and by gad sir’ he said to me in his strange laughing way ‘i ordered a piece of brocade of the very same pattern as that which the fellow was carrying and presented it to my wife for a morning wrapper to receive company after she layin of our little boy’  “your little pension was paid regularly enough and when your father became viscount castlewood on his uncle’s demise i was employed to keep a watch over you and ’twas at my instance that you were brought home your fostermother was dead her father made acquaintance with a woman whom he married who quarrelled with his son the faithful creature came back to brussels to be near the woman he loved and died too a few months before her will you see her cross in the convent cemetery the superior is an old penitent of mine and remembers sœur marie madeleine fondly still”                      esmond came to this spot in one sunny evening of spring and saw amidst a thousand black crosses casting their shadows across the grassy mounds that particular one which marked his mother’s restingplace many more of those poor creatures that lay there had adopted that same name with which sorrow had rebaptized her and which fondly seemed to hint their individual story of love and grief he fancied her in tears and darkness kneeling at the foot of her cross under which her cares were buried  surely he knelt down and said his own prayer there not in sorrow so much as in awe for even his memory had no recollection of her and in pity for the pangs which the gentle soul in life had been made to suffer to this cross she brought them for this heavenly bridegroom she exchanged the husband who had wooed her the traitor who had left her a thousand such hillocks lay round about the gentle daisies springing out of the grass over them and each bearing its cross and requiescat a nun veiled in black was kneeling hard by at a sleeping sister’s bedside so fresh made that the spring had scarce had time to spin a coverlid for it beyond the cemetery walls you had glimpses of life and the world and the spires and gables of the city a bird came down from a roof opposite and lit first on a cross and then on the grass below it whence it flew away presently with a leaf in its mouth then came a sound as of chanting from the chapel of the sisters hard by others had long since filled the place which poor mary magdalene once had there were kneeling at the same stall and hearing the same hymns and prayers in which her stricken heart had found consolation might she sleep in peace—might she sleep in peace and we too when our struggles and pains are over but the earth is the lord’s as the heaven is we are alike his creatures here and yonder i took a little flower off the hillock and kissed it and went my way like the bird that had just lighted on the cross by me back into the world again silent receptacle of death tranquil depth of calm out of reach of tempest and trouble i felt as one who had been walking below the sea and treading amidst the bones of shipwrecks    chapter xiv the campaign of 1707 1708   during the whole of the year which succeeded that in which the glorious battle of ramillies had been fought our army made no movement of importance much to the disgust of very many of our officers remaining inactive in flanders who said that his grace the captaingeneral had had fighting enough and was all for money now and the enjoyment of his five thousand a year and his splendid palace at woodstock which was now being built and his grace had sufficient occupation fighting his enemies at home this year where it begun to be whispered that his favour was decreasing and his duchess losing her hold on the queen who was transferring her royal affections to the famous mrs masham and mrs masham’s humble servant mr harley against their intrigues our duke passed a great part of his time intriguing mr harley was got out of office and his grace in so far had a victory but her majesty convinced against her will was of that opinion still of which the poet says people are when so convinced and mr harley before long had his revenge  meanwhile the business of fighting did not go on any way to the satisfaction of marlborough’s gallant lieutenants during all 1707 with the french before us we had never so much as a battle our army in spain was utterly routed at almanza by the gallant duke of berwick and we of webb’s which regiment the young duke had commanded before his father’s abdication were a little proud to think that it was our colonel who had achieved this victory “i think if i had had galway’s place and my fusiliers” says our general “we would not have laid down our arms even to our old colonel as galway did and webb’s officers swore if we had had webb at least we would not have been taken prisoners” our dear old general talked incautiously of himself and of others a braver or a more brilliant soldier never lived than he but he blew his honest trumpet rather more loudly than became a commander of his station and mighty man of valour as he was shook his great spear and blustered before the army too fiercely  mysterious mr holtz went off on a secret expedition in the early part of 1708 with great elation of spirits and a prophecy to esmond that a wonderful something was about to take place this secret came out on my friend’s return to the army whither he brought a most rueful and dejected countenance and owned that the great something he had been engaged upon had failed utterly he had been indeed with that luckless expedition of the chevalier de st george who was sent by the french king with ships and an army from dunkirk and was to have invaded and conquered scotland but that ill wind which ever opposed all the projects upon which the prince ever embarked prevented the chevalier’s invasion of scotland as ’tis known and blew poor monsieur von holtz back into our camp again to scheme and foretell and to pry about as usual the chevalier the king of england as some of us held him went from dunkirk to the french army to make the campaign against us the duke of burgundy had the command this year having the duke of berry with him and the famous mareschal vendosme and the duke of matignon to aid him in the campaign holtz who knew everything that was passing in flanders and france and the indies for what i know insisted that there would be no more fighting in 1708 than there had been in the previous year and that our commander had reasons for keeping him quiet indeed esmond’s general who was known as a grumbler and to have a hearty mistrust of the great duke and hundreds more officers besides did not scruple to say that these private reasons came to the duke in the shape of crownpieces from the french king by whom the generalissimo was bribed to avoid a battle there were plenty of men in our lines quidnuncs to whom mr webb listened only too willingly who could specify the exact sums the duke got how much fell to cadogan’s share and what was the precise fee given to doctor hare  and the successes with which the french began the campaign of 1708 served to give strength to these reports of treason which were in everybody’s mouth our general allowed the enemy to get between us and ghent and declined to attack him though for eightandforty hours the armies were in presence of each other ghent was taken and on the same day monsieur de la mothe summoned bruges and these two great cities fell into the hands of the french without firing a shot a few days afterwards la mothe seized upon the fort of plashendall and it began to be supposed that all spanish flanders as well as brabant would fall into the hands of the french troops when the prince eugene arrived from the mozelle and then there was no more shillyshallying  the prince of savoy always signalized his arrival at the army by a great feast my lord duke’s entertainments were both seldom and shabby and i remember our general returning from this dinner with the two commandersinchief his honest head a little excited by wine which was dealt out much more liberally by the austrian than by the english commander—“now” says my general slapping the table with an oath “he must fight and when he is forced to it d—— it no man in europe can stand up against jack churchill” within a week the battle of oudenarde was fought when hate each other as they might esmond’s general and the commanderinchief were forced to admire each other so splendid was the gallantry of each upon this day  the brigade commanded by majorgeneral webb gave and received about as hard knocks as any that were delivered in that action in which mr esmond had the fortune to serve at the head of his own company in his regiment under the command of their own colonel as majorgeneral and it was his good luck to bring the regiment out of action as commander of it the four senior officers above him being killed in the prodigious slaughter which happened on that day i like to think that jack haythorn who sneered at me for being a bastard and a parasite of webb’s as he chose to call me and with whom i had had words shook hands with me the day before the battle begun three days before poor brace our lieutenantcolonel had heard of his elder brother’s death and was heir to a baronetcy in norfolk and four thousand a year fate that had left him harmless through a dozen campaigns seized on him just as the world was worth living for and he went into action knowing as he said that the luck was going to turn against him the major had just joined us—a creature of lord marlborough put in much to the dislike of the other officers and to be a spy upon us as it was said i know not whether the truth was so nor who took the tattle of our mess to head quarters but webb’s regiment as its colonel was known to be in the commanderinchief’s black books “and if he did not dare to break it up at home” our gallant old chief used to say “he was determined to destroy it before the enemy” so that poor major proudfoot was put into a post of danger  esmond’s dear young viscount serving as aide de camp to my lord duke received a wound and won an honourable name for himself in the gazette and captain esmond’s name was sent in for promotion by his general too whose favourite he was it made his heart beat to think that certain eyes at home the brightest in the world might read the page on which his humble services were recorded but his mind was made up steadily to keep out of their dangerous influence and to let time and absence conquer that passion he had still lurking about him away from beatrix it did not trouble him but he knew as certain that if he returned home his fever would break out again and avoided walcote as a lincolnshire man avoids returning to his fens where he is sure that the ague is lying in wait for him  we of the english party in the army who were inclined to sneer at everything that came out of hanover and to treat as little better than boors and savages the elector’s court and family were yet forced to confess that on the day of oudenarde the young electoral prince then making his first campaign conducted himself with the spirit and courage of an approved soldier on this occasion his electoral highness had better luck than the king of england who was with his cousins in the enemy’s camp and had to run with them at the ignominious end of the day with the most consummate generals in the world before them and an admirable commander on their own side they chose to neglect the councils and to rush into a combat with the former which would have ended in the utter annihilation of their army but for the great skill and bravery of the duke of vendosme who remedied as far as courage and genius might the disasters occasioned by the squabbles and follies of his kinsmen the legitimate princes of the blood royal  “if the duke of berwick had but been in the army the fate of the day would have been very different” was all that poor mr von holtz could say “and you would have seen that the hero of almanza was fit to measure swords with the conqueror of blenheim”  the business relative to the exchange of prisoners was always going on and was at least that ostensible one which kept mr holtz perpetually on the move between the forces of the french and the allies i can answer for it that he was once very near hanged as a spy by majorgeneral wayne when he was released and sent on to head quarters by a special order of the commanderinchief he came and went always favoured wherever he was by some high though occult protection he carried messages between the duke of berwick and his uncle our duke he seemed to know as well what was taking place in the prince’s quarter as our own he brought the compliments of the king of england to some of our officers the gentlemen of webb’s among the rest for their behaviour on that great day and after wynendael when our general was chafing at the neglect of our commanderinchief he said he knew how that action was regarded by the chiefs of the french army and that the stand made before wynendael wood was the passage by which the allies entered lille  “ah” says holtz and some folks were very willing to listen to him “if the king came by his own how changed the conduct of affairs would be his majesty’s very exile has this advantage that he is enabled to read england impartially and to judge honestly of all the eminent men his sister is always in the hand of one greedy favourite or another through whose eyes she sees and to whose flattery or dependants she gives away everything do you suppose that his majesty knowing england so well as he does would neglect such a man as general webb he ought to be in the house of peers as lord lydiard the enemy and all europe know his merit it is that very reputation which certain great people who hate all equality and independence can never pardon” it was intended that these conversations should be carried to mr webb they were welcome to him for great as his services were no man could value them more than john richmond webb did himself and the differences between him and marlborough being notorious his grace’s enemies in the army and at home began to court webb and set him up against the allgrasping domineering chief and soon after the victory of oudenarde a glorious opportunity fell into general webb’s way which that gallant warrior did not neglect and which gave him the means of immensely increasing his reputation at home  after oudenarde and against the counsels of marlborough it was said the prince of savoy sat down before lille the capital of french flanders and commenced that siege the most celebrated of our time and almost as famous as the siege of troy itself for the feats of valour performed in the assault and the defence the enmity of that prince of savoy against the french king was a furious personal hate quite unlike the calm hostility of our great english general who was no more moved by the game of war than that of billiards and pushed forward his squadrons and drove his red battalions hither and thither as calmly as he would combine a stroke or make a cannon with the balls the game over and he played it so as to be pretty sure to win it not the least animosity against the other party remained in the breast of this consummate tactician whereas between the prince of savoy and the french it was guerre à mort beaten off in one quarter as he had been at toulon in the last year he was back again on another frontier of france assailing it with his indefatigable fury when the prince came to the army the smouldering fires of war were lighted up and burst out into a flame our phlegmatic dutch allies were made to advance at a quick march—our calm duke forced into action the prince was an army in himself against the french the energy of his hatred prodigious indefatigable—infectious over hundreds of thousands of men the emperor’s general was repaying and with a vengeance the slight the french king had put upon the fiery little abbé of savoy brilliant and famous as a leader himself and beyond all measure daring and intrepid and enabled to cope with almost the best of those famous men of war who commanded the armies of the french king eugene had a weapon the equal of which could not be found in france since the cannonshot of sasbach laid low the noble turenne and could hurl marlborough at the heads of the french host and crush them as with a rock under which all the gathered strength of their strongest captains must go down  the english duke took little part in that vast siege of lille which the imperial generalissimo pursued with all his force and vigour further than to cover the besieging lines from the duke of burgundy’s army between which and the imperialists our duke lay once when prince eugene was wounded our duke took his highness’s place in the trenches but the siege was with the imperialists not with us a division under webb and rantzau was detached into artois and picardy upon the most painful and odious service that mr esmond ever saw in the course of his military life the wretched towns of the defenceless provinces whose young men had been drafted away into the french armies which year after year the insatiable war devoured were left at our mercy and our orders were to show them none we found places garrisoned by invalids and children and women poor as they were and as the costs of this miserable war had made them our commission was to rob these almost starving wretches—to tear the food out of their granaries and strip them of their rags ’twas an expedition of rapine and murder we were sent on our soldiers did deeds such as an honest man must blush to remember we brought back money and provisions in quantity to the duke’s camp there had been no one to resist us and yet who dares to tell with what murder and violence with what brutal cruelty outrage insult that ignoble booty had been ravished from the innocent and miserable victims of the war  meanwhile gallantly as the operations before lille had been conducted the allies had made but little progress and ’twas said when we returned to the duke of marlborough’s camp that the siege would never be brought to a satisfactory end and that the prince of savoy would be forced to raise it my lord marlborough gave this as his opinion openly those who mistrusted him and mr esmond owns himself to be of the number hinted that the duke had his reasons why lille should not be taken and that he was paid to that end by the french king if this was so and i believe it general webb had now a remarkable opportunity of gratifying his hatred of the commanderinchief of balking that shameful avarice which was one of the basest and most notorious qualities of the famous duke and of showing his own consummate skill as a commander and when i consider all the circumstances preceding the event which will now be related that my lord duke was actually offered certain millions of crowns provided that the siege of lille should be raised that the imperial army before it was without provisions and ammunition and must have decamped but for the supplies that they received that the march of the convoy destined to relieve the siege was accurately known to the french and that the force covering it was shamefully inadequate to that end and by six times inferior to count de la mothe’s army which was sent to intercept the convoy when ’tis certain that the duke of berwick de la mothe’s chief was in constant correspondence with his uncle the english generalissimo i believe on my conscience that ’twas my lord marlborough’s intention to prevent those supplies of which the prince of savoy stood in absolute need from ever reaching his highness that he meant to sacrifice the little army which covered this convoy and to betray it as he had betrayed tollemache at brest as he betrayed every friend he had to further his own schemes of avarice or ambition but for the miraculous victory which esmond’s general won over an army six or seven times greater than his own the siege of lille must have been raised and it must be remembered that our gallant little force was under the command of a general whom marlborough hated that he was furious with the conqueror and tried by the most open and shameless injustice afterwards to rob him of the credit of his victory    chapter xv general webb wins the battle of wynendael   by the besiegers and besieged of lille some of the most brilliant feats of valour were performed that ever illustrated any war on the french side whose gallantry was prodigious the skill and bravery of marshal boufflers actually eclipsing those of his conqueror the prince of savoy may be mentioned that daring action of messieurs de luxembourg and tournefort who with a body of horse and dragoons carried powder into the town of which the besieged were in extreme want each soldier bringing a bag with forty pounds of powder behind him with which perilous provision they engaged our own horse faced the fire of the foot brought out to meet them and though half of the men were blown up in the dreadful errand they rode on a part of them got into the town with the succours of which the garrison was so much in want a french officer monsieur du bois performed an act equally daring and perfectly successful the duke’s great army lying at helchin and covering the siege and it being necessary for monsieur de vendosme to get news of the condition of the place captain du bois performed his famous exploit not only passing through the lines of the siege but swimming afterwards no less than seven moats and ditches and coming back the same way swimming with his letters in his mouth  by these letters monsieur de boufflers said that he could undertake to hold the place till october and that if one of the convoys of the allies could be intercepted they must raise the siege altogether  such a convoy as hath been said was now prepared at ostend and about to march for the siege and on the 27th september we and the french too had news that it was on its way it was composed of 700 waggons containing ammunition of all sorts and was escorted out of ostend by 2000 infantry and 300 horse at the same time monsieur de la mothe quitted bruges having with him fiveandthirty battalions and upwards of sixty squadrons and forty guns in pursuit of the convoy  majorgeneral webb had meanwhile made up a force of twenty battalions and three squadrons of dragoons at turout whence he moved to cover the convoy and pursue la mothe with whose advanced guard ours came up upon the great plain of turout and before the little wood and castle of wynendael behind which the convoy was marching  as soon as they came in sight of the enemy our advanced troops were halted with the wood behind them and the rest of our force brought up as quickly as possible our little body of horse being brought forward to the opening of the plain as our general said to amuse the enemy when monsieur la mothe came up he found us posted in two lines in front of the wood and formed his own army in battle facing ours in eight lines four of infantry in front and dragoons and cavalry behind  the french began the action as usual with a cannonade which lasted three hours when they made their attack advancing in twelve lines four of foot and four of horse upon the allied troops in the wood where we were posted their infantry behaved ill they were ordered to charge with the bayonet but instead began to fire and almost at the very first discharge from our men broke and fled the cavalry behaved better with these alone who were three or four times as numerous as our whole force monsieur de la mothe might have won victory but only two of our battalions were shaken in the least and these speedily rallied nor could the repeated attacks of the french horse cause our troops to budge an inch from the position in the wood in which our general had placed them  after attacking for two hours the french retired at nightfall entirely foiled with all the loss we had inflicted upon him the enemy was still three times stronger than we and it could not be supposed that our general could pursue m de la mothe or do much more than hold our ground about the wood from which the frenchman had in vain attempted to dislodge us la mothe retired behind his forty guns his cavalry protecting them better than it had been enabled to annoy us and meanwhile the convoy which was of more importance than all our little force and the safe passage of which we would have dropped to the last man to accomplish marched away in perfect safety during the action and joyfully reached the besieging camp before lille  majorgeneral cadogan my lord duke’s quartermastergeneral and between whom and mr webb there was no love lost accompanied the convoy and joined mr webb with a couple of hundred horse just as the battle was over and the enemy in full retreat he offered readily enough to charge with his horse upon the french as they fell back but his force was too weak to inflict any damage upon them and mr webb commanding as cadogan’s senior thought enough was done in holding our ground before an enemy that might still have overwhelmed us had we engaged him in the open territory and in securing the safe passage of the convoy accordingly the horse brought up by cadogan did not draw a sword and only prevented by the good countenance they showed any disposition the french might have had to renew the attack on us and no attack coming at nightfall general cadogan drew off with his squadron being bound for head quarters the two generals at parting grimly saluting each other  “he will be at roncq time enough to lick my lord duke’s trenchers at supper” says mr webb  our own men lay out in the woods of wynendael that night and our general had his supper in the little castle there  “if i was cadogan i would have a peerage for this day’s work” general webb said “and harry thou shouldst have a regiment thou hast been reported in the last two actions thou wert near killed in the first i shall mention thee in my dispatch to his grace the commanderinchief and recommend thee to poor dick harwood’s vacant majority have you ever a hundred guineas to give cardonnel slip them into his hand tomorrow when you go to head quarters with my report”  in this report the majorgeneral was good enough to mention captain esmond’s name with particular favour and that gentleman carried the dispatch to head quarters the next day and was not a little pleased to bring back a letter by his grace’s secretary addressed to lieutenantgeneral webb the dutch officer dispatched by count nassau woudenbourg væltmareschal auverquerque’s son brought back also a complimentary letter to his commander who had seconded mr webb in the action with great valour and skill  esmond with a low bow and a smiling face presented his dispatch and saluted mr webb as lieutenantgeneral as he gave it in the gentlemen round about him—he was riding with his suite on the road to menin as esmond came up with him—gave a cheer and he thanked them and opened the dispatch with rather a flushed eager face  he slapped it down on his boot in a rage after he had read it “’tis not even writ with his own hand read it out esmond” and esmond read it out—       “sir—mr cadogan is just now come in and has acquainted me with     the success of the action you had yesterday in the afternoon     against the body of troops commanded by monsieur de la mothe at     wynendael which must be attributed chiefly to your good conduct     and resolution you may be sure i shall do you justice at home     and be glad on all occasions to own the service you have done in     securing this convoy—yours c m”   “two lines by that d——d cardonnel and no more for the taking of lille—for beating five times our number—for an action as brilliant as the best he ever fought” says poor mr webb “lieutenantgeneral that’s not his doing i was the oldest majorgeneral by —— i believe he had been better pleased if i had been beat”  the letter to the dutch officer was in french and longer and more complimentary than that to mr webb  “and this is the man” he broke out “that’s gorged with gold—that’s covered with titles and honours that we won for him—and that grudges even a line of praise to a comrade in arms hasn’t he enough don’t we fight that he may roll in riches well well wait for the gazette gentlemen the queen and the country will do us justice if his grace denies it us” there were tears of rage in the brave warrior’s eyes as he spoke and he dashed them off his face on to his glove he shook his fist in the air “oh by the lord” says he “i know what i had rather have than a peerage”  “and what is that sir” some of them asked  “i had rather have a quarter of an hour with john churchill on a fair green field and only a pair of rapiers between my shirt and his ——”  “sir” interposes one  “tell him so i know that’s what you mean i know every word goes to him that’s dropped from every general officer’s mouth i don’t say he’s not brave curse him he’s brave enough but we’ll wait for the gazette gentlemen god save her majesty she’ll do us justice”  the gazette did not come to us till a month afterwards when my general and his officers had the honour to dine with prince eugene in lille his highness being good enough to say that we had brought the provisions and ought to share in the banquet ’twas a great banquet his grace of marlborough was on his highness’s right and on his left the mareschal de boufflers who had so bravely defended the place the chief officers of either army were present and you may be sure esmond’s general was splendid this day his tall noble person and manly beauty of face made him remarkable anywhere he wore for the first time the star of the order of generosity that his prussian majesty had sent to him for his victory his highness the prince of savoy called a toast to the conqueror of wynendael my lord duke drank it with rather a sickly smile the aides de camp were present and harry esmond and his dear young lord were together as they always strove to be when duty would permit they were over against the table where the generals were and could see all that passed pretty well frank laughed at my lord duke’s glum face the affair of wynendael and the captaingeneral’s conduct to webb had been the talk of the whole army when his highness spoke and gave—“le vainqueur de wynendael son armée et sa victoire” adding “qui nous font diner à lille aujourdhuy”—there was a great cheer through the hall for mr webb’s bravery generosity and very weaknesses of character caused him to be beloved in the army  “like hector handsome and like paris brave” whispers frank castlewood “a venus an elderly venus couldn’t refuse him a pippin stand up harry see we are drinking the army of wynendael ramillies is nothing to it huzzay huzzay”  at this very time and just after our general had made his acknowledgement some one brought in an english gazette—and was passing it from hand to hand down the table officers were eager enough to read it mothers and sisters at home must have sickened over it there scarce came out a gazette for six years that did not tell of some heroic death or some brilliant achievement  “here it is—action of wynendael—here you are general” says frank seizing hold of the little dingy paper that soldiers love to read so and scrambling over from our bench he went to where the general sat who knew him and had seen many a time at his table his laughing handsome face which everybody loved who saw the generals in their great perukes made way for him he handed the paper over general dohna’s buff coat to our general on the opposite side  he came hobbling back and blushing at his feat “i thought he’d like it harry” the young fellow whispered “didn’t i like to read my name after ramillies in the london gazette—viscount castlewood serving a volunteer—i say what’s yonder”  mr webb reading the gazette looked very strange—slapped it down on the table—then sprung up in his place and began—“will your highness please to ——”  his grace the duke of marlborough here jumped up too—“there’s some mistake my dear general webb”  “your grace had better rectify it” says mr webb holding out the letter but he was five off his grace the prince duke who besides was higher than the general being seated with the prince of savoy the electoral prince of hanover and the envoys of prussia and denmark under a baldaquin and webb could not reach him tall as he was  “stay” says he with a smile as if catching at some idea and then with a perfect courtesy drawing his sword he ran the gazette through with the point and said “permit me to hand it to your grace”  the duke looked very black “take it” says he to his master of the horse who was waiting behind him  the lieutenantgeneral made a very low bow and retired and finished his glass the gazette in which mr cardonnel the duke’s secretary gave an account of the victory of wynendael mentioned mr webb’s name but gave the sole praise and conduct of the action to the duke’s favourite mr cadogan  there was no little talk and excitement occasioned by this strange behaviour of general webb who had almost drawn a sword upon the commanderinchief but the general after the first outbreak of his anger mastered it outwardly altogether and by his subsequent behaviour had the satisfaction of even more angering the commanderinchief than he could have done by any public exhibition of resentment  on returning to his quarters and consulting with his chief adviser mr esmond who was now entirely in the general’s confidence and treated by him as a friend and almost a son mr webb writ a letter to his grace the commanderinchief in which he said—       your grace must be aware that the sudden perusal of the london     gazette in which your grace’s secretary mr cardonnel hath     mentioned majorgeneral cadogan’s name as the officer commanding     in the late action of wynendael must have caused a feeling of     anything but pleasure to the general who fought that action      your grace must be aware that mr cadogan was not even present at     the battle though he arrived with squadrons of horse at its     close and put himself under the command of his superior officer     and as the result of the battle of wynendael in which     lieutenantgeneral webb had the good fortune to command was the     capture of lille the relief of brussels then invested by the     enemy under the elector of bavaria the restoration of the great     cities of ghent and bruges of which the enemy by treason within     the walls had got possession in the previous year mr webb     cannot consent to forgo the honours of such a success and service     for the benefit of mr cadogan or any other person      as soon as the military operations of the year are over     lieutenantgeneral webb will request permission to leave the army     and return to his place in parliament where he gives notice to     his grace the commanderinchief that he shall lay his case     before the house of commons the country and her majesty the     queen      by his eagerness to rectify that false statement of the gazette     which had been written by his grace’s secretary mr cardonnel     mr webb not being able to reach his grace the commanderinchief     on account of the gentlemen seated between them placed the paper     containing the false statement on his sword so that it might more     readily arrive in the hands of his grace the duke of marlborough     who surely would wish to do justice to every officer of his army      mr webb knows his duty too well to think of insubordination to     his superior officer or of using his sword in a campaign against     any but the enemies of her majesty he solicits permission to     return to england immediately the military duties will permit and     take with him to england captain esmond of his regiment who     acted as his aide de camp and was present during the entire     action and noted by his watch the time when mr cadogan arrived     at its close   the commanderinchief could not but grant this permission nor could he take notice of webb’s letter though it was couched in terms the most insulting half the army believed that the cities of ghent and bruges were given up by a treason which some in our army very well understood that the commanderinchief would not have relieved lille if he could have helped himself that he would not have fought that year had not the prince of savoy forced him when the battle once began then for his own renown my lord marlborough would fight as no man in the world ever fought better and no bribe on earth could keep him from beating the enemy11  but the matter was taken up by the subordinates and half the army might have been by the ears if the quarrel had not been stopped general cadogan sent an intimation to general webb to say that he was ready if webb liked and would meet him this was a kind of invitation our stout old general was always too ready to accept and ’twas with great difficulty we got the general to reply that he had no quarrel with mr cadogan who had behaved with perfect gallantry but only with those at head quarters who had belied him mr cardonnel offered general webb reparation mr webb said he had a cane at the service of mr cardonnel and the only satisfaction he wanted from him was one he was not likely to get namely the truth the officers in our staff of webb’s and those in the immediate suite of the general were ready to come to blows and hence arose the only affair in which mr esmond ever engaged as principal and that was from a revengeful wish to wipe off an old injury  my lord mohun who had a troop in lord macclesfield’s regiment of the horse guards rode this campaign with the duke he had sunk by this time to the very worst reputation he had had another fatal duel in spain he had married and forsaken his wife he was a gambler a profligate and debauchee he joined just before oudenarde and as esmond feared as soon as frank castlewood heard of his arrival frank was for seeking him out and killing him the wound my lord got at oudenarde prevented their meeting but that was nearly healed and mr esmond trembled daily lest any chance should bring his boy and this known assassin together they met at the messtable of handyside’s regiment at lille the officer commanding not knowing of the feud between the two noblemen  esmond had not seen the hateful handsome face of mohun for nine years since they had met on that fatal night in leicester field it was degraded with crime and passion now it wore the anxious look of a man who has three deaths—and who knows how many hidden shames and lusts and crimes on his conscience he bowed with a sickly low bow and slunk away when our host presented us round to one another frank castlewood had not known him till then so changed was he he knew the boy well enough  ’twas curious to look at the two—especially the young man whose face flushed up when he heard the hated name of the other and who said in his bad french and his brave boyish voice—“he had long been anxious to meet my lord mohun” the other only bowed and moved away from him i do him justice he wished to have no quarrel with the lad  esmond put himself between them at table “d—— it” says frank “why do you put yourself in the place of a man who is above you in degree my lord mohun should walk after me i want to sit by my lord mohun”  esmond whispered to lord mohun that frank was hurt in the leg at oudenarde and besought the other to be quiet quiet enough he was for some time disregarding the many taunts which young castlewood flung at him until after several healths when my lord mohun got to be rather in liquor  “will you go away my lord” mr esmond said to him imploring him to quit the table  “no by g——” says my lord mohun “i’ll not go away for any man” he was quite flushed with wine by this time  the talk got round to the affairs of yesterday webb had offered to challenge the commanderinchief webb had been illused webb was the bravest handsomest vainest man in the army lord mohun did not know that esmond was webb’s aide de camp he began to tell some stories against the general which from t’other side of esmond young castlewood contradicted  “i can’t bear any more of this” says my lord mohun  “nor can i my lord” says mr esmond starting up “the story my lord mohun has told respecting general webb is false gentlemen—false i repeat” and making a low bow to lord mohun and without a single word more esmond got up and left the diningroom these affairs were common enough among the military of those days there was a garden behind the house and all the party turned instantly into it and the two gentlemen’s coats were off and their points engaged within two minutes after esmond’s words had been spoken if captain esmond had put mohun out of the world as he might a villain would have been punished and spared further villanies—but who is one man to punish another i declare upon my honour that my only thought was to prevent lord mohun from mischief with frank and the end of this meeting was that after half a dozen passes my lord went home with a hurt which prevented him from lifting his right arm for three months  “oh harry why didn’t you kill the villain” young castlewood asked “i can’t walk without a crutch but i could have met him on horseback with sword and pistol” but harry esmond said “’twas best to have no man’s life on one’s conscience not even that villain’s” and this affair which did not occupy three minutes being over the gentlemen went back to their wine and my lord mohun to his quarters where he was laid up with a fever which had spared mischief had it proved fatal and very soon after this affair harry esmond and his general left the camp for london whither a certain reputation had preceded the captain for my lady castlewood of chelsea received him as if he had been a conquering hero she gave a great dinner to mr webb where the general’s chair was crowned with laurels and her ladyship called esmond’s health in a toast to which my kind general was graciously pleased to bear the strongest testimony and took down a mob of at least forty coaches to cheer our general as he came out of the house of commons the day when he received the thanks of parliament for his action the mob huzza’ed and applauded him as well as the fine company it was splendid to see him waving his hat and bowing and laying his hand upon his order of generosity he introduced mr esmond to mr st john and the right honourable robert harley esquire as he came out of the house walking between them and was pleased to make many flattering observations regarding mr esmond’s behaviour during the three last campaigns  mr st john who had the most winning presence of any man i ever saw excepting always my peerless young frank castlewood said he had heard of mr esmond before from captain steele and how he had helped mr addison to write his famous poem of the campaign  “’twas as great an achievement as the victory of blenheim itself” mr harley said who was famous as a judge and patron of letters and so perhaps it may be—though for my part i think there are twenty beautiful lines but all the rest is commonplace and mr addison’s hymn worth a thousand such poems  all the town was indignant at my lord duke’s unjust treatment of general webb and applauded the vote of thanks which the house of commons gave to the general for his victory at wynendael ’tis certain that the capture of lille was the consequence of that lucky achievement and the humiliation of the old french king who was said to suffer more at the loss of this great city than from any of the former victories our troops had won over him and i think no small part of mr webb’s exultation at his victory arose from the idea that marlborough had been disappointed of a great bribe the french king had promised him should the siege be raised the very sum of money offered to him was mentioned by the duke’s enemies and honest mr webb chuckled at the notion not only of beating the french but of beating marlborough too and intercepting a convoy of three millions of french crowns that were on their way to the generalissimo’s insatiable pockets when the general’s lady went to the queen’s drawingroom all the tory women crowded round her with congratulations and made her a train greater than the duchess of marlborough’s own feasts were given to the general by all the chiefs of the tory party who vaunted him as the duke’s equal in military skill and perhaps used the worthy soldier as their instrument whilst he thought they were but acknowledging his merits as a commander as the general’s aide de camp and favourite officer mr esmond came in for a share of his chief’s popularity and was presented to her majesty and advanced to the rank of lieutenantcolonel at the request of his grateful chief  we may be sure there was one family in which any good fortune that happened to esmond caused such a sincere pride and pleasure that he for his part was thankful he could make them so happy with these fond friends blenheim and oudenarde seemed to be mere trifling incidents of the war and wynendael was its crowning victory esmond’s mistress never tired to hear accounts of the battle and i think general webb’s lady grew jealous of her for the general was for ever at kensington and talking on that delightful theme as for his aide de camp though no doubt esmond’s own natural vanity was pleased at the little share of reputation which his good fortune had won him yet it was chiefly precious to him he may say so now that he hath long since outlived it because it pleased his mistress and above all because beatrix valued it  as for the old dowager of chelsea never was an old woman in all england more delighted nor more gracious than she esmond had his quarters in her ladyship’s house where the domestics were instructed to consider him as their master she bade him give entertainments of which she defrayed the charges and was charmed when his guests were carried away tipsy in their coaches she must have his picture taken and accordingly he was painted by mr jervas in his red coat and smiling upon a bombshell which was bursting at the corner of the piece she vowed that unless he made a great match she should never die easy and was for ever bringing young ladies to chelsea with pretty faces and pretty fortunes at the disposal of the colonel he smiled to think how times were altered with him and of the early days in his father’s lifetime when a trembling page he stood before her with her ladyship’s basin and ewer or crouched in her coachstep the only fault she found with him was that he was more sober than an esmond ought to be and would neither be carried to bed by his valet nor lose his heart to any beauty whether of st james’s or covent garden  what is the meaning of fidelity in love and whence the birth of it ’tis a state of mind that men fall into and depending on the man rather than the woman we love being in love that’s the truth on’t if we had not met joan we should have met kate and adored her we know our mistresses are no better than many other women nor no prettier nor no wiser nor no wittier ’tis not for these reasons we love a woman or for any special quality or charm i know of we might as well demand that a lady should be the tallest woman in the world like the shropshire giantess12 as that she should be a paragon in any other character before we began to love her esmond’s mistress had a thousand faults beside her charms he knew both perfectly well she was imperious she was lightminded she was flighty she was false she had no reverence in her character she was in everything even in beauty the contrast of her mother who was the most devoted and the least selfish of women well from the very first moment he saw her on the stairs at walcote esmond knew he loved beatrix there might be better women—he wanted that one he cared for none other was it because she was gloriously beautiful beautiful as she was he had heard people say a score of times in their company that beatrix’s mother looked as young and was the handsomer of the two why did her voice thrill in his ear so she could not sing near so well as nicolini or mrs tofts nay she sang out of tune and yet he liked to hear her better than st cecilia she had not a finer complexion than mrs steele dick’s wife whom he had now got and who ruled poor dick with a rod of pickle and yet to see her dazzled esmond he would shut his eyes and the thought of her dazzled him all the same she was brilliant and lively in talk but not so incomparably witty as her mother who when she was cheerful said the finest things but yet to hear her and to be with her was esmond’s greatest pleasure days passed away between him and these ladies he scarce knew how he poured his heart out to them so as he never could in any other company where he hath generally passed for being moody or supercilious and silent this society13 was more delightful than that of the greatest wits to him may heaven pardon him the lies he told the dowager at chelsea in order to get a pretext for going away to kensington the business at the ordnance which he invented the interview with his general the courts and statesman’s levees which he didn’t frequent and describe who wore a new suit on sunday at st james’s or at the queen’s birthday how many coaches filled the street at mr harley’s levee how many bottles he had had the honour to drink overnight with mr st john at the “cocoa tree” or at the “garter” with mr walpole and mr steele  mistress beatrix esmond had been a dozen times on the point of making great matches so the court scandal said but for his part esmond never would believe the stories against her and came back after three years’ absence from her not so frantic as he had been perhaps but still hungering after her and no other still hopeful still kneeling with his heart in his hand for the young lady to take we were now got to 1709 she was near twentytwo years old and three years at court and without a husband  “’tis not for want of being asked” lady castlewood said looking into esmond’s heart as she could with that perceptiveness affection gives “but she will make no mean match harry she will not marry as i would have her the person whom i should like to call my son and henry esmond knows who that is is best served by my not pressing his claim beatrix is so wilful that what i would urge on her she would be sure to resist the man who would marry her will not be happy with her unless he be a great person and can put her in a great position beatrix loves admiration more than love and longs beyond all things for command why should a mother speak so of her child you are my son too harry you should know the truth about your sister i thought you might cure yourself of your passion” my lady added fondly “other people can cure themselves of that folly you know but i see you are still as infatuated as ever when we read your name in the gazette i pleaded for you my poor boy poor boy indeed you are growing a grave old gentleman now and i am an old woman she likes your fame well enough and she likes your person she says you have wit and fire and good breeding and are more natural than the fine gentlemen of the court but this is not enough she wants a commanderinchief and not a colonel were a duke to ask her she would leave an earl whom she had promised i told you so before i know not how my poor girl is so worldly”  “well” says esmond “a man can but give his best and his all she has that from me what little reputation i have won i swear i cared for it because i thought beatrix would be pleased with it what care i to be a colonel or a general think you ’twill matter a few score years hence what our foolish honours today are i would have had a little fame that she might wear it in her hat if i had anything better i would endow her with it if she wants my life i would give it her if she marries another i will say god bless him i make no boast nor no complaint i think my fidelity is folly perhaps but so it is i cannot help myself i love her you are a thousand times better the fondest the fairest the dearest of women sure my dear lady i see all beatrix’s faults as well as you do but she is my fate ’tis endurable i shall not die for not having her i think i should be no happier if i won her que voulezvous as my lady of chelsea would say je l’aime”  “i wish she would have you” said harry’s fond mistress giving a hand to him he kissed the fair hand ’twas the prettiest dimpled little hand in the world and my lady castlewood though now almost forty years old did not look to be within ten years of her age he kissed and kept her fair hand as they talked together  “why” says he “should she hear me she knows what i would say far or near she knows i’m her slave i have sold myself for nothing it may be well ’tis the price i choose to take i am worth nothing or i am worth all”  “you are such a treasure” esmond’s mistress was pleased to say “that the woman who has your love shouldn’t change it away against a kingdom i think i am a countrybred woman and cannot say but the ambitions of the town seem mean to me i never was awestricken by my lady duchess’s rank and finery or afraid” she added with a sly laugh “of anything but her temper i hear of court ladies who pine because her majesty looks cold on them and great noblemen who would give a limb that they might wear a garter on the other this worldliness which i can’t comprehend was born with beatrix who on the first day of her waiting was a perfect courtier we are like sisters and she the eldest sister somehow she tells me i have a mean spirit i laugh and say she adores a coachandsix i cannot reason her out of her ambition ’tis natural to her as to me to love quiet and be indifferent about rank and riches what are they harry and for how long do they last our home is not here” she smiled as she spoke and looked like an angel that was only on earth on a visit “our home is where the just are and where our sins and sorrows enter not my father used to rebuke me and say that i was too hopeful about heaven but i cannot help my nature and grow obstinate as i grow to be an old woman and as i love my children so sure our father loves us with a thousand and a thousand times greater love it must be that we shall meet yonder and be happy yes you—and my children and my dear lord do you know harry since his death it has always seemed to me as if his love came back to me and that we are parted no more perhaps he is here now harry—i think he is forgiven i am sure he is even mr atterbury absolved him and he died forgiving oh what a noble heart he had how generous he was i was but fifteen and a child when he married me how good he was to stoop to me he was always good to the poor and humble” she stopped then presently with a peculiar expression as if her eyes were looking into heaven and saw my lord there she smiled and gave a little laugh “i laugh to see you sir” she says “when you come it seems as if you never were away” one may put her words down and remember them but how describe her sweet tones sweeter than music  my young lord did not come home at the end of the campaign and wrote that he was kept at bruxelles on military duty indeed i believe he was engaged in laying siege to a certain lady who was of the suite of madame de soissons the prince of savoy’s mother who was just dead and who like the flemish fortresses was taken and retaken a great number of times during the war and occupied by french english and imperialists of course mr esmond did not think fit to enlighten lady castlewood regarding the young scapegrace’s doings nor had he said a word about the affair with lord mohun knowing how abhorrent that man’s name was to his mistress frank did not waste much time or money on pen and ink and when harry came home with his general only writ two lines to his mother to say his wound in the leg was almost healed that he would keep his coming of age next year—that the duty aforesaid would keep him at bruxelles and that cousin harry would tell all the news  but from bruxelles knowing how the lady castlewood always liked to have a letter about the famous 29th of december my lord writ her a long and full one and in this he must have described the affair with mohun for when mr esmond came to visit his mistress one day early in the new year to his great wonderment she and her daughter both came up and saluted him and after them the dowager of chelsea too whose chairman had just brought her ladyship from her village to kensington across the fields after this honour i say from the two ladies of castlewood the dowager came forward in great state with her grand tall headdress of king james’s reign that she never forsook and said “cousin henry all our family have met and we thank you cousin for your noble conduct towards the head of our house” and pointing to her blushing cheek she made mr esmond aware that he was to enjoy the rapture of an embrace there having saluted one cheek she turned to him the other “cousin harry” said both the other ladies in a little chorus “we thank you for your noble conduct” and then harry became aware that the story of the lille affair had come to his kinswomen’s ears it pleased him to hear them all saluting him as one of their family  the tables of the diningroom were laid for a great entertainment and the ladies were in gala dresses—my lady of chelsea in her highest tour my lady viscountess out of black and looking fair and happy à ravir and the maid of honour attired with that splendour which naturally distinguished her and wearing on her beautiful breast the french officer’s star which frank had sent home after ramillies  “you see ’tis a gala day with us” says she glancing down to the star complacently “and we have our orders on does not mamma look charming ’twas i dressed her” indeed esmond’s dear mistress blushing as he looked at her with her beautiful fair hair and an elegant dress according to the mode appeared to have the shape and complexion of a girl of twenty  on the table was a fine sword with a red velvet scabbard and a beautiful chased silver handle with a blue ribbon for a swordknot “what is this” says the captain going up to look at this pretty piece  mrs beatrix advanced towards it “kneel down” says she “we dub you our knight with this”—and she waved the sword over his head—“my lady dowager hath given the sword and i give the ribbon and mamma hath sewn on the fringe”  “put the sword on him beatrix” says her mother “you are our knight harry—our true knight take a mother’s thanks and prayers for defending her son my dear dear friend” she could say no more and even the dowager was affected for a couple of rebellious tears made sad marks down those wrinkled old roses which esmond had just been allowed to salute  “we had a letter from dearest frank” his mother said “three days since whilst you were on your visit to your friend captain steele at hampton he told us all that you had done and how nobly you had put yourself between him and that—that wretch”  “and i adopt you from this day” says the dowager “and i wish i was richer for your sake son esmond” she added with a wave of her hand and as mr esmond dutifully went down on his knee before her ladyship she cast her eyes up to the ceiling the gilt chandelier and the twelve wax candles in it for the party was numerous and invoked a blessing from that quarter upon the newly adopted son  “dear frank” says the other viscountess “how fond he is of his military profession he is studying fortification very hard i wish he were here we shall keep his coming of age at castlewood next year”  “if the campaign permit us” says mr esmond  “i am never afraid when he is with you” cries the boy’s mother “i am sure my henry will always defend him”  “but there will be a peace before next year we know it for certain” cries the maid of honour “lord marlborough will be dismissed and that horrible duchess turned out of all her places her majesty won’t speak to her now did you see her at bushy harry she is furious and she ranges about the park like a lioness and tears people’s eyes out”  “and the princess anne will send for somebody” says my lady of chelsea taking out her medal and kissing it  “did you see the king at oudenarde harry” his mistress asked she was a stanch jacobite and would no more have thought of denying her king than her god  “i saw the young hanoverian only” harry said “the chevalier de st george——”  “the king sir the king” said the ladies and miss beatrix and she clapped her pretty hands and cried “vive le roy”  by this time there came a thundering knock that drove in the doors of the house almost it was three o’clock and the company were arriving and presently the servant announced captain steele and his lady  captain and mrs steele who were the first to arrive had driven to kensington from their countryhouse the hovel at hampton wick “not from our mansion in bloomsbury square” as mrs steele took care to inform the ladies indeed harry had ridden away from hampton that very morning leaving the couple by the ears for from the chamber where he lay in a bed that was none of the cleanest and kept awake by the company which he had in his own bed and the quarrel which was going on in the next room he could hear both night and morning the curtain lecture which mrs steele was in the habit of administering to poor dick  at night it did not matter so much for the culprit dick was fuddled and when in that way no scolding could interrupt his benevolence mr esmond could hear him coaxing and speaking in that maudlin manner which punch and claret produce to his beloved prue and beseeching her to remember that there was a distiwisht officer ithe nex roob who would overhear her she went on nevertheless calling him a drunken wretch and was only interrupted in her harangues by the captain’s snoring  in the morning the unhappy victim awoke to a headache and consciousness and the dialogue of the night was resumed “why do you bring captains home to dinner when there’s not a guinea in the house how am i to give dinners when you leave me without a shilling how am i to go trapesing to kensington in my yellow satin sack before all the fine company i’ve nothing fit to put on i never have” and so the dispute went on—mr esmond interrupting the talk when it seemed to be growing too intimate by blowing his nose as loudly as ever he could at the sound of which trumpet there came a lull but dick was charming though his wife was odious and ’twas to give mr steele pleasure that the ladies of castlewood who were ladies of no small fashion invited mrs steele  besides the captain and his lady there was a great and notable assemblage of company my lady of chelsea having sent her lackeys and liveries to aid the modest attendance at kensington there was lieutenantgeneral webb harry’s kind patron of whom the dowager took possession and who resplended in velvet and gold lace there was harry’s new acquaintance the right honourable henry st john esquire the general’s kinsman who was charmed with the lady castlewood even more than with her daughter there was one of the greatest noblemen in the kingdom the scots duke of hamilton just created duke of brandon in england and two other noble lords of the tory party my lord ashburnham and another i have forgot and for ladies her grace the duchess of ormonde and her daughters the lady mary and the lady betty the former one of mistress beatrix’s colleagues in waiting on the queen  “what a party of tories” whispered captain steele to esmond as we were assembled in the parlour before dinner indeed all the company present save steele were of that faction  mr st john made his special compliments to mrs steele and so charmed her that she declared she would have steele a tory too  “or will you have me a whig” says mr st john “i think madam you could convert a man to anything”  “if mr st john ever comes to bloomsbury square i will teach him what i know” says mrs steele dropping her handsome eyes “do you know bloomsbury square”  “do i know the mall do i know the opera do i know the reigning toast why bloomsbury is the very height of the mode” says mr st john “’tis rus in urbe you have gardens all the way to hampstead and palaces round about you—southampton house and montague house”  “where you wretches go and fight duels” cries mrs steele  “of which the ladies are the cause” says her entertainer “madam is dick a good swordsman how charming the tatler is we all recognized your portrait in the 49th number and i have been dying to know you ever since i read it ‘aspasia must be allowed to be the first of the beauteous order of love’ doth not the passage run so ‘in this accomplished lady love is the constant effect though it is never the design yet though her mien carries much more invitation than command to behold her is an immediate check to loose behaviour and to love her is a liberal education’ ”  “oh indeed” says mrs steele who did not seem to understand a word of what the gentleman was saying  “who could fail to be accomplished under such a mistress” says mr st john still gallant and bowing  “mistress upon my word sir” cries the lady “if you mean me sir i would have you know that i am the captain’s wife”  “sure we all know it” answers mr st john keeping his countenance very gravely and steele broke in saying “’twas not about mrs steele i writ that paper—though i am sure she is worthy of any compliment i can pay her—but of the lady elizabeth hastings”14  “i hear mr addison is equally famous as a wit and a poet” says mr st john “is it true that his hand is to be found in your tatler mr steele”  “whether ’tis the sublime or the humorous no man can come near him” cries steele  “a fig dick for your mr addison” cries out his lady “a gentleman who gives himself such airs and holds his head so high now i hope your ladyship thinks as i do i can’t bear those very fair men with white eyelashes—a black man for me” all the black men at table applauded and made mrs steele a bow for this compliment “as for this mr addison” she went on “he comes to dine with the captain sometimes never says a word to me and then they walk upstairs both tipsy to a dish of tea i remember your mr addison when he had but one coat to his back and that with a patch at the elbow”  “indeed—a patch at the elbow you interest me” says mr st john “’tis charming to hear of one man of letters from the charming wife of another”  “law i could tell you ever so much about ’em” continues the voluble lady “what do you think the captain has got now—a little hunchback fellow—a little hopo’mythumb creature that he calls a poet—a little popish brat”  “hush there are two in the room” whispers her companion  “well i call him popish because his name is pope” says the lady “’tis only my joking way and this little dwarf of a fellow has wrote a pastoral poem—all about shepherds and shepherdesses you know”  “a shepherd should have a little crook” says my mistress laughing from her end of the table on which mrs steele said “she did not know but the captain brought home this queer little creature when she was in bed with her first boy and it was a mercy he had come no sooner and dick raved about his genus and was always raving about some nonsense or other”  “which of the tatlers do you prefer mrs steele” asked mr st john  “i never read but one and think it all a pack of rubbish sir” says the lady “such stuff about bickerstaffe and distaff and quarterstaff as it all is there’s the captain going on still with the burgundy—i know he’ll be tipsy before he stops—captain steele”  “i drink to your eyes my dear” says the captain who seemed to think his wife charming and to receive as genuine all the satiric compliments which mr st john paid her  all this while the maid of honour had been trying to get mr esmond to talk and no doubt voted him a dull fellow for by some mistake just as he was going to pop into the vacant place he was placed far away from beatrix’s chair who sat between his grace and my lord ashburnham and shrugged her lovely white shoulders and cast a look as if to say “pity me” to her cousin my lord duke and his young neighbour were presently in a very animated and close conversation mrs beatrix could no more help using her eyes than the sun can help shining and setting those it shines on aburning by the time the first course was done the dinner seemed long to esmond by the time the soup came he fancied they must have been hours at table and as for the sweets and jellies he thought they never would be done  at length the ladies rose beatrix throwing a parthian glance at her duke as she retreated a fresh bottle and glasses were fetched and toasts were called mr st john asked his grace the duke of hamilton and the company to drink to the health of his grace the duke of brandon another lord gave general webb’s health “and may he get the command the bravest officer in the world deserves” mr webb thanked the company complimented his aide de camp and fought his famous battle over again  “il est fatiguant” whispers mr st john “avec sa trompette de wynendael”  captain steele who was not of our side loyally gave the health of the duke of marlborough the greatest general of the age  “i drink to the greatest general with all my heart” says mr webb “there can be no gainsaying that character of him my glass goes to the general and not to the duke mr steele” and the stout old gentleman emptied his bumper to which dick replied by filling and emptying a pair of brimmers one for the general and one for the duke  and now his grace of hamilton rising up with flashing eyes we had all been drinking pretty freely proposed a toast to the lovely to the incomparable mrs beatrix esmond we all drank it with cheers and my lord ashburnham especially with a shout of enthusiasm  “what a pity there is a duchess of hamilton” whispers st john who drank more wine and yet was more steady than most of the others and we entered the drawingroom where the ladies were at their tea as for poor dick we were obliged to leave him alone at the diningtable where he was hiccupping out the lines from the campaign in which the greatest poet had celebrated the greatest general in the world and harry esmond found him half an hour afterwards in a more advanced stage of liquor and weeping about the treachery of tom boxer  the drawingroom was all dark to poor harry in spite of the grand illumination beatrix scarce spoke to him when my lord duke went away she practised upon the next in rank and plied my young lord ashburnham with all the fire of her eyes and the fascinations of her wit most of the party were set to cards and mr st john after yawning in the face of mrs steele whom he did not care to pursue any more and talking in his most brilliant animated way to lady castlewood whom he pronounced to be beautiful of a far higher order of beauty than her daughter presently took his leave and went his way the rest of the company speedily followed my lord ashburnham the last throwing fiery glances at the smiling young temptress who had bewitched more hearts than his in her thrall  no doubt as a kinsman of the house mr esmond thought fit to be the last of all in it he remained after the coaches had rolled away—after his dowager aunt’s chair and flambeaux had marched off in the darkness towards chelsea and the town’speople had gone to bed who had been drawn into the square to gape at the unusual assemblage of chairs and chariots lackeys and torchmen the poor mean wretch lingered yet for a few minutes to see whether the girl would vouchsafe him a smile or a parting word of consolation but her enthusiasm of the morning was quite died out or she chose to be in a different mood she fell to joking about the dowdy appearance of lady betty and mimicked the vulgarity of mrs steele and then she put up her little hand to her mouth and yawned lighted a taper and shrugged her shoulders and dropping mr esmond a saucy curtsy sailed off to bed  “the day began so well henry that i had hoped it might have ended better” was all the consolation that poor esmond’s fond mistress could give him and as he trudged home through the dark alone he thought with bitter rage in his heart and a feeling of almost revolt against the sacrifice he had made—“she would have me” thought he “had i but a name to give her but for my promise to her father i might have my rank and my mistress too”  i suppose a man’s vanity is stronger than any other passion in him for i blush even now as i recall the humiliation of those distant days the memory of which still smarts though the fever of baulked desire has passed away more than a score of years ago when the writer’s descendants come to read this memoir i wonder will they have lived to experience a similar defeat and shame will they ever have knelt to a woman who has listened to them and played with them and laughed at them—who beckoning them with lures and caresses and with yes smiling from her eyes has tricked them on to their knees and turned her back and left them all this shame mr esmond had to undergo and he submitted and revolted and presently came crouching back for more  after this feste my young lord ashburnham’s coach was for ever rolling in and out of kensington square his ladymother came to visit esmond’s mistress and at every assembly in the town wherever the maid of honour made her appearance you might be pretty sure to see the young gentleman in a new suit every week and decked out in all the finery that his tailor or embroiderer could furnish for him my lord was for ever paying mr esmond compliments bidding him to dinner offering him horses to ride and giving him a thousand uncouth marks of respect and goodwill at last one night at the coffeehouse whither my lord came considerably flushed and excited with drink he rushes up to mr esmond and cries out—“give me joy my dearest colonel i am the happiest of men”  “the happiest of men needs no dearest colonel to give him joy” says mr esmond “what is the cause of this supreme felicity”  “haven’t you heard” says he “don’t you know i thought the family told you everything the adorable beatrix hath promised to be mine”  “what” cries out mr esmond who had spent happy hours with beatrix that very morning—had writ verses for her that she had sung at the harpsichord  “yes” says he “i waited on her today i saw you walking towards knightsbridge as i passed in my coach and she looked so lovely and spoke so kind that i couldn’t help going down on my knees and—and—sure i’m the happiest of men in all the world and i’m very young but she says i shall get older and you know i shall be of age in four months and there’s very little difference between us and i’m so happy i should like to treat the company to something let us have a bottle—a dozen bottles—and drink the health of the finest woman in england”                      esmond left the young lord tossing off bumper after bumper and strolled away to kensington to ask whether the news was true ’twas only too sure his mistress’s sad compassionate face told him the story and then she related what particulars of it she knew and how my young lord had made his offer half an hour after esmond went away that morning and in the very room where the song lay yet on the harpsichord which esmond had writ and they had sung together     book iii containing the end of mr esmond’s adventures in england    chapter i i come to an end of my battles and bruises   that feverish desire to gain a little reputation which esmond had had left him now perhaps that he had attained some portion of his wish and the great motive of his ambition was over his desire for military honour was that it might raise him in beatrix’s eyes ’twas next to nobility and wealth the only kind of rank she valued it was the stake quickest won or lost too for law is a very long game that requires a life to practise and to be distinguished in letters or the church would not have forwarded the poor gentleman’s plans in the least so he had no suit to play but the red one and he played it and this in truth was the reason of his speedy promotion for he exposed himself more than most gentlemen do and risked more to win more is he the only man that hath set his life against a stake which may be not worth the winning another risks his life and his honour too sometimes against a bundle of banknotes or a yard of blue ribbon or a seat in parliament and some for the mere pleasure and excitement of the sport as a field of a hundred huntsmen will do each outbawling and outgalloping the other at the tail of a dirty fox that is to be the prize of the foremost happy conqueror  when he heard this news of beatrix’s engagement in marriage colonel esmond knocked under to his fate and resolved to surrender his sword that could win him nothing now he cared for and in this dismal frame of mind he determined to retire from the regiment to the great delight of the captain next in rank to him who happened to be a young gentleman of good fortune who eagerly paid mr esmond a thousand guineas for his majority in webb’s regiment and was knocked on the head the next campaign perhaps esmond would not have been sorry to share his fate he was more the knight of the woful countenance than ever he had been his moodiness must have made him perfectly odious to his friends under the tents who like a jolly fellow and laugh at a melancholy warrior always sighing after dulcinea at home  both the ladies of castlewood approved of mr esmond quitting the army and his kind general coincided in his wish of retirement and helped in the transfer of his commission which brought a pretty sum into his pocket but when the commanderinchief came home and was forced in spite of himself to appoint lieutenantgeneral webb to the command of a division of the army in flanders the lieutenantgeneral prayed colonel esmond so urgently to be his aide de camp and military secretary that esmond could not resist his kind patron’s entreaties and again took the field not attached to any regiment but under webb’s orders what must have been the continued agonies of fears15 and apprehensions which racked the gentle breasts of wives and matrons in those dreadful days when every gazette brought accounts of deaths and battles and when the present anxiety over and the beloved person escaped the doubt still remained that a battle might be fought possibly of which the next flanders letter would bring the account so they the poor tender creatures had to go on sickening and trembling through the whole campaign whatever these terrors were on the part of esmond’s mistress and that tenderest of women must have felt them most keenly for both her sons as she called them she never allowed them outwardly to appear but hid her apprehension as she did her charities and devotion ’twas only by chance that esmond wandering in kensington found his mistress coming out of a mean cottage there and heard that she had a score of poor retainers whom she visited and comforted in their sickness and poverty and who blessed her daily she attended the early church daily though of a sunday especially she encouraged and advanced all sorts of cheerfulness and innocent gaiety in her little household and by notes entered into a tablebook of hers at this time and devotional compositions writ with a sweet artless fervour such as the best divines could not surpass showed how fond her heart was how humble and pious her spirit what pangs of apprehension she endured silently and with what a faithful reliance she committed the care of those she loved to the awful dispenser of death and life  as for her ladyship at chelsea esmond’s newlyadopted mother she was now of an age when the danger of any second party doth not disturb the rest much she cared for trumps more than for most things in life she was firm enough in her own faith but no longer very bitter against ours she had a very goodnatured easy french director monsieur gauthier by name who was a gentleman of the world and would take a hand of cards with dean atterbury my lady’s neighbour at chelsea and was well with all the high church party no doubt monsieur gauthier knew what esmond’s peculiar position was for he corresponded with holt and always treated colonel esmond with particular respect and kindness but for good reasons the colonel and the abbé never spoke on this matter together and so they remained perfect good friends  all the frequenters of my lady of chelsea’s house were of the tory and high church party madame beatrix was as frantic about the king as her elderly kinswoman she wore his picture on her heart she had a piece of his hair she vowed he was the most injured and gallant and accomplished and unfortunate and beautiful of princes steele who quarrelled with very many of his tory friends but never with esmond used to tell the colonel that his kinswoman’s house was a rendezvous of tory intrigues that gauthier was a spy that atterbury was a spy that letters were constantly going from that house to the queen at st germains on which esmond laughing would reply that they used to say in the army the duke of marlborough was a spy too and as much in correspondence with that family as any jesuit and without entering very eagerly into the controversy esmond had frankly taken the side of his family it seemed to him that king james the third was undoubtedly king of england by right and at his sister’s death it would be better to have him than a foreigner over us no man admired king william more a hero and a conqueror the bravest justest wisest of men—but ’twas by the sword he conquered the country and held and governed it by the very same right that the great cromwell held it who was truly and greatly a sovereign but that a foreign despotic prince out of germany who happened to be descended from king james the first should take possession of this empire seemed to mr esmond a monstrous injustice—at least every englishman had a right to protest and the english prince the heiratlaw the first of all what man of spirit with such a cause would not back it what man of honour with such a crown to win would not fight for it but that race was destined that prince had himself against him an enemy he could not overcome he never dared to draw his sword though he had it he let his chances slip by as he lay in the lap of operagirls or snivelled at the knees of priests asking pardon and the blood of heroes and the devotedness of honest hearts and endurance courage fidelity were all spent for him in vain  but let us return to my lady of chelsea who when her son esmond announced to her ladyship that he proposed to make the ensuing campaign took leave of him with perfect alacrity and was down to piquet with her gentlewoman before he had well quitted the room on his last visit “tierce to a king” were the last words he ever heard her say the game of life was pretty nearly over for the good lady and three months afterwards she took to her bed where she flickered out without any pain so the abbé gauthier wrote over to mr esmond then with his general on the frontier of france the lady castlewood was with her at her ending and had written too but these letters must have been taken by a privateer in the packet that brought them for esmond knew nothing of their contents until his return to england  my lady castlewood had left everything to colonel esmond “as a reparation for the wrong done to him” ’twas writ in her will but her fortune was not much for it never had been large and the honest viscountess had wisely sunk most of the money she had upon an annuity which terminated with her life however there was the house and furniture plate and pictures at chelsea and a sum of money lying at her merchant’s sir josiah child which altogether would realize a sum of near three hundred pounds per annum so that mr esmond found himself if not rich at least easy for life likewise there were the famous diamonds which had been said to be worth fabulous sums though the goldsmith pronounced they would fetch no more than four thousand pounds these diamonds however colonel esmond reserved having a special use for them but the chelsea house plate goods c with the exception of a few articles which he kept back were sold by his orders and the sums resulting from the sale invested in the public securities so as to realize the aforesaid annual income of three hundred pounds  having now something to leave he made a will and dispatched it home the army was now in presence of the enemy and a great battle expected every day ’twas known that the generalinchief was in disgrace and the parties at home strong against him and there was no stroke this great and resolute player would not venture to recall his fortune when it seemed desperate frank castlewood was with colonel esmond his general having gladly taken the young nobleman on to his staff his studies of fortifications at bruxelles were over by this time the fort he was besieging had yielded i believe and my lord had not only marched in with flying colours but marched out again he used to tell his boyish wickednesses with admirable humour and was the most charming young scapegrace in the army  ’tis needless to say that colonel esmond had left every penny of his little fortune to this boy it was the colonel’s firm conviction that the next battle would put an end to him for he felt aweary of the sun and quite ready to bid that and the earth farewell frank would not listen to his comrade’s gloomy forebodings but swore they would keep his birthday at castlewood that autumn after the campaign he had heard of the engagement at home “if prince eugene goes to london” says frank “and trix can get hold of him she’ll jilt ashburnham for his highness i tell you she used to make eyes at the duke of marlborough when she was only fourteen and ogling poor little blandford i wouldn’t marry her harry no not if her eyes were twice as big i’ll take my fun i’ll enjoy for the next three years every possible pleasure i’ll sow my wild oats then and marry some quiet steady modest sensible viscountess hunt my harriers and settle down at castlewood perhaps i’ll represent the county—no damme you shall represent the county you have the brains of the family by the lord my dear old harry you have the best head and the kindest heart in all the army and every man says so—and when the queen dies and the king comes back why shouldn’t you go to the house of commons and be a minister and be made a peer and that sort of thing you be shot in the next action i wager a dozen of burgundy you are not touched mohun is well of his wound he is always with corporal john now as soon as ever i see his ugly face i’ll spit in it i took lessons of father—of captain holtz at bruxelles what a man that is he knows everything” esmond bade frank have a care that father holt’s knowledge was rather dangerous not indeed knowing as yet how far the father had pushed his instructions with his young pupil  the gazetteers and writers both of the french and english side have given accounts sufficient of that bloody battle of blarignies or malplaquet which was the last and the hardestearned of the victories of the great duke of marlborough in that tremendous combat near upon two hundred and fifty thousand men were engaged more than thirty thousand of whom were slain or wounded the allies lost twice as many men as they killed of the french whom they conquered and this dreadful slaughter very likely took place because a great general’s credit was shaken at home and he thought to restore it by a victory if such were the motives which induced the duke of marlborough to venture that prodigious stake and desperately sacrifice thirty thousand brave lives so that he might figure once more in a gazette and hold his places and pensions a little longer the event defeated the dreadful and selfish design for the victory was purchased at a cost which no nation greedy of glory as it may be would willingly pay for any triumph the gallantry of the french was as remarkable as the furious bravery of their assailants we took a few score of their flags and a few pieces of their artillery but we left twenty thousand of the bravest soldiers of the world round about the entrenched lines from which the enemy was driven he retreated in perfect good order the panicspell seemed to be broke under which the french had laboured ever since the disaster of hochstedt and fighting now on the threshold of their country they showed an heroic ardour of resistance such as had never met us in the course of their aggressive war had the battle been more successful the conqueror might have got the price for which he waged it as it was and justly i think the party adverse to the duke in england were indignant at the lavish extravagance of slaughter and demanded more eagerly than ever the recall of a chief whose cupidity and desperation might urge him further still after this bloody fight of malplaquet i can answer for it that in the dutch quarters and our own and amongst the very regiments and commanders whose gallantry was most conspicuous upon this frightful day of carnage the general cry was that there was enough of the war the french were driven back into their own boundary and all their conquests and booty of flanders disgorged as for the prince of savoy with whom our commanderinchief for reasons of his own consorted more closely than ever ’twas known that he was animated not merely by a political hatred but by personal rage against the old french king the imperial generalissimo never forgot the slight put by lewis upon the abbé de savoie and in the humiliation or ruin of his most christian majesty the holy roman emperor found his account but what were these quarrels to us the free citizens of england and holland despot as he was the french monarch was yet the chief of european civilization more venerable in his age and misfortunes than at the period of his most splendid successes whilst his opponent was but a semibarbarous tyrant with a pillaging murderous horde of croats and pandours composing a half of his army filling our camp with their strange figures bearded like the miscreant turks their neighbours and carrying into christian warfare their native heathen habits of rapine lust and murder why should the best blood in england and france be shed in order that the holy roman and apostolic master of these ruffians should have his revenge over the christian king and it was to this end we were fighting for this that every village and family in england was deploring the death of beloved sons and fathers we dared not speak to each other even at table of malplaquet so frightful were the gaps left in our army by the cannon of that bloody action ’twas heartrending for an officer who had a heart to look down his line on a paradeday afterwards and miss hundreds of faces of comrades—humble or of high rank—that had gathered but yesterday full of courage and cheerfulness round the torn and blackened flags where were our friends as the great duke reviewed us riding along our lines with his fine suite of prancing aides de camp and generals stopping here and there to thank an officer with those eager smiles and bows of which his grace was always lavish scarce a huzzah could be got for him though cadogan with an oath rode up and cried—“d—n you why don’t you cheer” but the men had no heart for that not one of them but was thinking “where’s my comrade—where’s my brother that fought by me or my dear captain that led me yesterday” ’twas the most gloomy pageant i ever looked on and the te deum sung by our chaplains the most woful and dreary satire  esmond’s general added one more to the many marks of honour which he had received in the front of a score of battles and got a wound in the groin which laid him on his back and you may be sure he consoled himself by abusing the commanderinchief as he lay groaning—“corporal john’s as fond of me” he used to say “as king david was of general uriah and so he always gives me the post of danger” he persisted to his dying day in believing that the duke intended he should be beat at wynendael and sent him purposely with a small force hoping that he might be knocked on the head there esmond and frank castlewood both escaped without hurt though the division which our general commanded suffered even more than any other having to sustain not only the fury of the enemy’s cannonade which was very hot and wellserved but the furious and repeated charges of the famous maisonduroy which we had to receive and beat off again and again with volleys of shot and hedges of iron and our four lines of musketeers and pikemen they said the king of england charged us no less than twelve times that day along with the french household esmond’s late regiment general webb’s own fusiliers served in the division which their colonel commanded the general was thrice in the centre of the square of the fusiliers calling the fire at the french charges and after the action his grace the duke of berwick sent his compliments to his old regiment and their colonel for their behaviour on the field  we drank my lord castlewood’s health and majority the 25th of september the army being then before mons and here colonel esmond was not so fortunate as he had been in actions much more dangerous and was hit by a spent ball just above the place where his former wound was which caused the old wound to open again fever spitting of blood and other ugly symptoms to ensue and in a word brought him near to death’s door the kind lad his kinsman attended his elder comrade with a very praiseworthy affectionateness and care until he was pronounced out of danger by the doctors when frank went off passed the winter at bruxelles and besieged no doubt some other fortress there very few lads would have given up their pleasures so long and so gaily as frank did his cheerful prattle soothed many long days of esmond’s pain and languor frank was supposed to be still at his kinsman’s bedside for a month after he had left it for letters came from his mother at home full of thanks to the younger gentleman for his care of his elder brother so it pleased esmond’s mistress now affectionately to style him nor was mr esmond in a hurry to undeceive her when the good young fellow was gone for his christmas holiday it was as pleasant to esmond on his couch to watch the young man’s pleasure at the idea of being free as to note his simple efforts to disguise his satisfaction on going away there are days when a flask of champagne at a cabaret and a redcheeked partner to share it are too strong temptations for any young fellow of spirit i am not going to play the moralist and cry “fie” for ages past i know how old men preach and what young men practise and that patriarchs have had their weak moments too long since father noah toppled over after discovering the vine frank went off then to his pleasures at bruxelles in which capital many young fellows of our army declared they found infinitely greater diversion even than in london and mr henry esmond remained in his sickroom where he writ a fine comedy that his mistress pronounced to be sublime and that was acted no less than three successive nights in london in the next year  here as he lay nursing himself ubiquitous mr holtz reappeared and stopped a whole month at mons where he not only won over colonel esmond to the king’s side in politics that side being always held by the esmond family but where he endeavoured to reopen the controversial question between the churches once more and to recall esmond to that religion in which in his infancy he had been baptized holtz was a casuist both dexterous and learned and presented the case between the english church and his own in such a way that those who granted his premisses ought certainly to allow his conclusions he touched on esmond’s delicate state of health chance of dissolution and so forth and enlarged upon the immense benefits that the sick man was likely to forgo—benefits which the church of england did not deny to those of the roman communion as how should she being derived from that church and only an offshoot from it but mr esmond said that his church was the church of his country and to that he chose to remain faithful other people were welcome to worship and to subscribe any other set of articles whether at rome or at augsburg but if the good father meant that esmond should join the roman communion for fear of consequences and that all england ran the risk of being damned for heresy esmond for one was perfectly willing to take his chance of the penalty along with the countless millions of his fellow countrymen who were bred in the same faith and along with some of the noblest the truest the purest the wisest the most pious and learned men and women in the world  as for the political question in that mr esmond could agree with the father much more readily and had come to the same conclusion though perhaps by a different way the rightdivine about which dr sacheverel and the high church party in england were just now making a bother they were welcome to hold as they chose if henry cromwell and his father before him had been crowned and anointed and bishops enough would have been found to do it it seemed to mr esmond that they would have had the rightdivine just as much as any plantagenet or tudor or stuart but the desire of the country being unquestionably for an hereditary monarchy esmond thought an english king out of st germains was better and fitter than a german prince from herrenhausen and that if he failed to satisfy the nation some other englishman might be found to take his place and so though with no frantic enthusiasm or worship of that monstrous pedigree which the tories chose to consider divine he was ready to say “god save king james” when queen anne went the way of kings and commoners  “i fear colonel you are no better than a republican at heart” says the priest with a sigh  “i am an englishman” says harry “and take my country as i find her the will of the nation being for church and king i am for church and king too but english church and english king and that is why your church isn’t mine though your king is”  though they lost the day at malplaquet it was the french who were elated by that action whilst the conquerors were dispirited by it and the enemy gathered together a larger army than ever and made prodigious efforts for the next campaign marshal berwick was with the french this year and we heard that mareschal villars was still suffering of his wound was eager to bring our duke to action and vowed he would fight us in his coach young castlewood came flying back from bruxelles as soon as he heard that righting was to begin and the arrival of the chevalier de st george was announced about may “it’s the king’s third campaign and it’s mine” frank liked saying he was come back a greater jacobite than ever and esmond suspected that some fair conspirators at bruxelles had been inflaming the young man’s ardour indeed he owned that he had a message from the queen beatrix’s godmother who had given her name to frank’s sister the year before he and his sovereign were born  however desirous marshal villars might be to fight my lord duke did not seem disposed to indulge him this campaign last year his grace had been all for the whigs and hanoverians but finding on going to england his country cold towards himself and the people in a ferment of highchurch loyalty the duke comes back to his army cooled towards the hanoverians cautious with the imperialists and particularly civil and polite towards the chevalier de st george ’tis certain that messengers and letters were continually passing between his grace and his brave nephew the duke of berwick in the opposite camp no man’s caresses were more opportune than his grace’s and no man ever uttered expressions of regard and affection more generously he professed to monsieur de torcy so mr st john told the writer quite an eagerness to be cut in pieces for the exiled queen and her family nay more i believe this year he parted with a portion of the most precious part of himself—his money—which he sent over to the royal exiles mr tunstal who was in the prince’s service was twice or thrice in and out of our camp the french in theirs of arlieu and about arras a little river the canihe i think ’twas called but this is writ away from books and europe and the only map the writer hath of these scenes of his youth bears no mark of this little stream divided our pickets from the enemy’s our sentries talked across the stream when they could make themselves understood to each other and when they could not grinned and handed each other their brandyflasks or their pouches of tobacco and one fine day of june riding thither with the officer who visited the outposts colonel esmond was taking an airing on horseback being too weak for military duty they came to this river where a number of english and scots were assembled talking to the goodnatured enemy on the other side  esmond was especially amused with the talk of one long fellow with a great curling red moustache and blue eyes that was half a dozen inches taller than his swarthy little comrades on the french side of the stream and being asked by the colonel saluted him and said that he belonged to the royal cravats  from his way of saying “royal cravat” esmond at once knew that the fellow’s tongue had first wagged on the banks of the liffey and not the loire and the poor soldier—a deserter probably—did not like to venture very deep into french conversation lest his unlucky brogue should peep out he chose to restrict himself to such few expressions in the french language as he thought he had mastered easily and his attempt at disguise was infinitely amusing mr esmond whistled “lillibullero” at which teague’s eyes began to twinkle and then flung him a dollar when the poor boy broke out with a “god bless—that is dieu bénisse votre honor” that would infallibly have sent him to the provostmarshal had he been on our side of the river  whilst this parley was going on three officers on horseback on the french side appeared at some little distance and stopped as if eyeing us when one of them left the other two and rode close up to us who were by the stream “look look” says the royal cravat with great agitation “pas lui that’s he not him l’autre” and pointed to the distant officer on a chestnut horse with a cuirass shining in the sun and over it a broad blue ribbon  “please to take mr hamilton’s services to my lord marlborough—my lord duke” says the gentleman in english and looking to see that the party were not hostilely disposed he added with a smile “there’s a friend of yours gentlemen yonder he bids me to say that he saw some of your faces on the 11th of september last year”  as the gentleman spoke the other two officers rode up and came quite close we knew at once who it was it was the king then twoandtwenty years old tall and slim with deep brown eyes that looked melancholy though his lips wore a smile we took off our hats and saluted him no man sure could see for the first time without emotion the youthful inheritor of so much fame and misfortune it seemed to mr esmond that the prince was not unlike young castlewood whose age and figure he resembled the chevalier de st george acknowledged the salute and looked at us hard even the idlers on our side of the river set up a hurrah as for the royal cravat he ran to the prince’s stirrup knelt down and kissed his boot and bawled and looked a hundred ejaculations and blessings the prince bade the aide de camp give him a piece of money and when the party saluting us had ridden away cravat spat upon the piece of gold by way of benediction and swaggered away pouching his coin and twirling his honest carroty moustache  the officer in whose company esmond was the same little captain of handyside’s regiment mr sterne who had proposed the garden at lille when my lord mohun and esmond had their affair was an irishman too and as brave a little soul as ever wore a sword “bedad” says roger sterne “that long fellow spoke french so beautiful that i shouldn’t have known he wasn’t a foreigner till he broke out with his hullaballoing and only an irish calf can bellow like that”—and roger made another remark in his wild way in which there was sense as well as absurdity—“if that young gentleman” says he “would but ride over to our camp instead of villars’s toss up his hat and say ‘here am i the king who’ll follow me’ by the lord esmond the whole army would rise and carry him home again and beat villars and take paris by the way”  the news of the prince’s visit was all through the camp quickly and scores of ours went down in hopes to see him major hamilton whom we had talked with sent back by a trumpet several silver pieces for officers with us mr esmond received one of these and that medal and a recompense not uncommon amongst princes were the only rewards he ever had from a royal person whom he endeavoured not very long after to serve  esmond quitted the army almost immediately after this following his general home and indeed being advised to travel in the fine weather and attempt to take no further part in the campaign but he heard from the army that of the many who crowded to see the chevalier de st george frank castlewood had made himself most conspicuous my lord viscount riding across the little stream bareheaded to where the prince was and dismounting and kneeling before him to do him homage some said that the prince had actually knighted him but my lord denied that statement though he acknowledged the rest of the story and said—“from having been out of favour with corporal john” as he called the duke before his grace warned him not to commit those follies and smiled on him cordially ever after  “and he was so kind to me” frank writ “that i thought i would put in a good word for master harry but when i mentioned your name he looked as black as thunder and said he had never heard of you”    chapter ii i go home and harp on the old string   after quitting mons and the army and as he was waiting for a packet at ostend esmond had a letter from his young kinsman castlewood at bruxelles conveying intelligence whereof frank besought him to be the bearer to london and which caused colonel esmond no small anxiety  the young scapegrace being oneandtwenty years old and being anxious to sow his “wild otes” as he wrote had married mademoiselle de wertheim daughter of count de wertheim chamberlain to the emperor and having a post in the household of the governor of the netherlands       ps the young gentleman wrote clotilda is older than me     which perhaps may be objected to her but i am so old a raik     that the age makes no difference and i am determined to reform     we were married at st gudule by father holt she is heart and     soul for the good cause and here the cry is vifleroy which     my mother will join in and trix too break this news to ’em     gently and tell mr finch

  you and write and bid finch write amediately hostel de     ’l’aigle noire bruxelles flanders   so frank had married a roman catholic lady and an heir was expected and mr esmond was to carry this intelligence to his mistress at london ’twas a difficult embassy and the colonel felt not a little tremor as he neared the capital  he reached his inn late and sent a messenger to kensington to announce his arrival and visit the next morning the messenger brought back news that the court was at windsor and the fair beatrix absent and engaged in her duties there only esmond’s mistress remained in her house at kensington she appeared in court but once in the year beatrix was quite the mistress and ruler of the little mansion inviting the company thither and engaging in every conceivable frolic of town pleasure whilst her mother acting as the young lady’s protectress and elder sister pursued her own path which was quite modest and secluded  as soon as ever esmond was dressed and he had been awake long before the town he took a coach for kensington and reached it so early that he met his dear mistress coming home from morning prayers she carried her prayerbook never allowing a footman to bear it as everybody else did and it was by this simple sign esmond knew what her occupation had been he called to the coachman to stop and jumped out as she looked towards him she wore her hood as usual and she turned quite pale when she saw him to feel that kind little hand near to his heart seemed to give him strength they soon were at the door of her ladyship’s house—and within it  with a sweet sad smile she took his hand and kissed it  “how ill you have been how weak you look my dear henry” she said  ’tis certain the colonel did look like a ghost except that ghosts do not look very happy ’tis said esmond always felt so on returning to her after absence indeed whenever he looked in her sweet kind face  “i am come back to be nursed by my family” says he “if frank had not taken care of me after my wound very likely i should have gone altogether”  “poor frank good frank” says his mother “you’ll always be kind to him my lord” she went on “the poor child never knew he was doing you a wrong”  “my lord” cries out colonel esmond “what do you mean dear lady”  “i am no lady” says she “i am rachel esmond francis esmond’s widow my lord i cannot bear that title would we never had taken it from him who has it now but we did all in our power henry we did all in our power and my lord and i—that is——”  “who told you this tale dearest lady” asked the colonel  “have you not had the letter i writ you i writ to you at mons directly i heard it” says lady esmond  “and from whom” again asked colonel esmond—and his mistress then told him that on her deathbed the dowager countess sending for her had presented her with this dismal secret as a legacy “’twas very malicious of the dowager” lady esmond said “to have had it so long and to have kept the truth from me ‘cousin rachel’ she said” and esmond’s mistress could not forbear smiling as she told the story “ ‘cousin rachel’ cries the dowager ‘i have sent for you as the doctors say i may go off any day in this dysentery and to ease my conscience of a great load that has been on it you always have been a poor creature and unfit for great honour and what i have to say won’t therefore affect you so much you must know cousin rachel that i have left my house plate and furniture three thousand pounds in money and my diamonds that my late revered saint and sovereign king james presented me with to my lord viscount castlewood’  “ ‘to my frank’ ” says lady castlewood “ ‘i was in hopes——  “ ‘to viscount castlewood my dear viscount castlewood and baron esmond of shandon in the kingdom of ireland earl and marquis of esmond under patent of his majesty king james the second conferred upon my husband the late marquis—for i am marchioness of esmond before god and man’  “ ‘and have you left poor harry nothing dear marchioness’ ” asks lady castlewood she hath told me the story completely since with her quiet arch way the most charming any woman ever had and i set down the narrative here at length so as to have done with it “ ‘and have you left poor harry nothing’ ” asks my dear lady “for you know henry” she says with her sweet smile “i used always to pity esau—and i think i am on his side—though papa tried very hard to convince me the other way  “ ‘poor harry’ says the old lady ‘so you want something left to poor harry he he reach me the drops cousin well then my dear since you want poor harry to have a fortune you must understand that ever since the year 1691 a week after the battle of the boyne where the prince of orange defeated his royal sovereign and father for which crime he is now suffering in flames ugh ugh henry esmond hath been marquis of esmond and earl of castlewood in the united kingdom and baron and viscount castlewood of shandon in ireland and a baronet—and his eldest son will be by courtesy styled earl of castlewood—he he what do you think of that my dear’  “ ‘gracious mercy how long have you known this’ ” cries the other lady thinking perhaps that the old marchioness was wandering in her wits  “ ‘my husband before he was converted was a wicked wretch’ ” the sick sinner continued “ ‘when he was in the low countries he seduced a weaver’s daughter and added to his wickedness by marrying her and then he came to this country and married me—a poor girl—a poor innocent young thing—i say’ though she was past forty you know harry when she married and as for being innocent—‘well’ she went on ‘i knew nothing of my lord’s wickedness for three years after our marriage and after the burial of our poor little boy i had it done over again my dear i had myself married by father holt in castlewood chapel as soon as ever i heard the creature was dead—and having a great illness then arising from another sad disappointment i had the priest came and told me that my lord had a son before our marriage and that the child was at nurse in england and i consented to let the brat be brought home and a queer little melancholy child it was when it came  “ ‘our intention was to make a priest of him and he was bred for this until you perverted him from it you wicked woman and i had again hopes of giving an heir to my lord when he was called away upon the king’s business and died fighting gloriously at the boyne water  “ ‘should i be disappointed—i owed your husband no love my dear for he had jilted me in the most scandalous way and i thought there would be time to declare the little weaver’s son for the true heir but i was carried off to prison where your husband was so kind to me—urging all his friends to obtain my release and using all his credit in my favour—that i relented towards him especially as my director counselled me to be silent and that it was for the good of the king’s service that the title of our family should continue with your husband the late viscount whereby his fidelity would be always secured to the king and a proof of this is that a year before your husband’s death when he thought of taking a place under the prince of orange mr holt went to him and told him what the state of the matter was and obliged him to raise a large sum for his majesty and engaged him in the true cause so heartily that we were sure of his support on any day when it should be considered advisable to attack the usurper then his sudden death came and there was a thought of declaring the truth but ’twas determined to be best for the king’s service to let the title still go with the younger branch and there’s no sacrifice a castlewood wouldn’t make for that cause my dear  “ ‘as for colonel esmond he knew the truth already’ and then harry” my mistress said “she told me of what had happened at my dear husband’s deathbed ‘he doth not intend to take the title though it belongs to him but it eases my conscience that you should know the truth my dear and your son is lawfully viscount castlewood so long as his cousin doth not claim the rank’ ”  this was the substance of the dowager’s revelation dean atterbury had knowledge of it lady castlewood said and esmond very well knows how that divine being the clergyman for whom the late lord had sent on his deathbed and when lady castlewood would instantly have written to her son and conveyed the truth to him the dean’s advice was that a letter should be writ to colonel esmond rather that the matter should be submitted to his decision by which alone the rest of the family were bound to abide  “and can my dearest lady doubt what that will be” says the colonel  “it rests with you harry as the head of our house”  “it was settled twelve years since by my dear lord’s bedside” says colonel esmond “the children must know nothing of this frank and his heirs after him must bear our name ’tis his rightfully i have not even a proof of that marriage of my father and mother though my poor lord on his deathbed told me that father holt had brought such a proof to castlewood i would not seek it when i was abroad i went and looked at my poor mother’s grave in her convent what matter to her now no court of law on earth upon my mere word would deprive my lord viscount and set me up i am the head of the house dear lady but frank is viscount of castlewood still and rather than disturb him i would turn monk or disappear in america”  as he spoke so to his dearest mistress for whom he would have been willing to give up his life or to make any sacrifice any day the fond creature flung herself down on her knees before him and kissed both his hands in an outbreak of passionate love and gratitude such as could not but melt his heart and make him feel very proud and thankful that god had given him the power to show his love for her and to prove it by some little sacrifice on his own part to be able to bestow benefits or happiness on those one loves is sure the greatest blessing conferred upon a man—and what wealth or name or gratification of ambition or vanity could compare with the pleasure esmond now had of being able to confer some kindness upon his best and dearest friends  “dearest saint” says he—“purest soul that has had so much to suffer that has blest the poor lonely orphan with such a treasure of love ’tis for me to kneel not for you ’tis for me to be thankful that i can make you happy hath my life any other aim blessed be god that i can serve you what pleasure think you could all the world give me compared to that”  “don’t raise me” she said in a wild way to esmond who would have lifted her “let me kneel—let me kneel and—and—worship you”                      before such a partial judge as esmond’s dear mistress owned herself to be any cause which he might plead was sure to be given in his favour and accordingly he found little difficulty in reconciling her to the news whereof he was bearer of her son’s marriage to a foreign lady papist though she was lady castlewood never could be brought to think so ill of that religion as other people in england thought of it she held that ours was undoubtedly a branch of the church catholic but that the roman was one of the main stems on which no doubt many errors had been grafted she was for a woman extraordinarily well versed in this controversy having acted as a girl as secretary to her father the late dean and written many of his sermons under his dictation and if frank had chosen to marry a lady of the church of south europe as she would call the roman communion that was no need why she should not welcome her as a daughterinlaw and accordingly she writ to her new daughter a very pretty touching letter as esmond thought who had cognizance of it before it went in which the only hint of reproof was a gentle remonstrance that her son had not written to herself to ask a fond mother’s blessing for that step which he was about taking “castlewood knew very well” so she wrote to her son “that she never denied him anything in her power to give much less would she think of opposing a marriage that was to make his happiness as she trusted and keep him out of wild courses which had alarmed her a good deal and she besought him to come quickly to england to settle down in his family house of castlewood ‘it is his family house’ says she to colonel esmond ‘though only his own house by your forbearance’ and to receive the accompt of her stewardship during his ten years’ minority” by care and frugality she had got the estate into a better condition than ever it had been since the parliamentary wars and my lord was now master of a pretty small income not encumbered of debts as it had been during his father’s ruinous time “but in saving my son’s fortune” says she “i fear i have lost a great part of my hold on him” and indeed this was the case her ladyship’s daughter complaining that their mother did all for frank and nothing for her and frank himself being dissatisfied at the narrow simple way of his mother’s living at walcote where he had been brought up more like a poor parson’s son than a young nobleman that was to make a figure in the world ’twas this mistake in his early training very likely that set him so eager upon pleasure when he had it in his power nor is he the first lad that has been spoiled by the overcareful fondness of women no training is so useful for children great or small as the company of their betters in rank or natural parts in whose society they lose the overweening sense of their own importance which stayathome people very commonly learn  but as a prodigal that’s sending in a schedule of his debts to his friends never puts all down and you may be sure the rogue keeps back some immense swingeing bill that he doesn’t dare to own so the poor frank had a very heavy piece of news to break to his mother and which he hadn’t the courage to introduce into his first confession some misgivings esmond might have upon receiving frank’s letter and knowing into what hands the boy had fallen but whatever these misgivings were he kept them to himself not caring to trouble his mistress with any fears that might be groundless  however the next mail which came from bruxelles after frank had received his mother’s letter there brought back a joint composition from himself and his wife who could spell no better than her young scapegrace of a husband full of expressions of thanks love and duty to the dowager viscountess as my poor lady now was styled and along with this letter which was read in a family council namely the viscountess mistress beatrix and the writer of this memoir and which was pronounced to be vulgar by the maid of honour and felt to be so by the other two there came a private letter for colonel esmond from poor frank with another dismal commission for the colonel to execute at his best opportunity and this was to announce that frank had seen fit “by the exhortation of mr holt the influence of his clotilda and the blessing of heaven and the saints” says my lord demurely “to change his religion and be received into the bosom of that church of which his sovereign many of his family and the greater part of the civilized world were members” and his lordship added a postscript of which esmond knew the inspiring genius very well for it had the genuine twang of the seminary and was quite unlike poor frank’s ordinary style of writing and thinking in which he reminded colonel esmond that he too was by birth of that church and that his mother and sister should have his lordship’s prayers to the saints an inestimable benefit truly for their conversion  if esmond had wanted to keep this secret he could not for a day or two after receiving this letter a notice from bruxelles appeared in the postboy and other prints announcing that “a young irish lord the viscount cstlew—d just come to his majority and who had served the last campaigns with great credit as aide de camp to his grace the duke of marlborough had declared for the popish religion at bruxelles and had walked in a procession barefoot with a wax taper in his hand” the notorious mr holt who had been employed as a jacobite agent during the last reign and many times pardoned by king william had been the postboy said the agent of this conversion  the lady castlewood was as much cast down by this news as miss beatrix was indignant at it “so” says she “castlewood is no longer a home for us mother frank’s foreign wife will bring her confessor and there will be frogs for dinner and all tusher’s and my grandfather’s sermons are flung away upon my brother i used to tell you that you killed him with the catechism and that he would turn wicked as soon as he broke from his mammy’s leadingstrings oh mother you would not believe that the young scapegrace was playing you tricks and that sneak of a tusher was not a fit guide for him oh those parsons i hate ’em all” says mistress beatrix clapping her hands together “yes whether they wear cassocks and buckles or beards and bare feet there’s a horrid irish wretch who never misses a sunday at court and who pays me compliments there the horrible man and if you want to know what parsons are you should see his behaviour and hear him talk of his own cloth they’re all the same whether they’re bishops or bonzes or indian fakirs they try to domineer and they frighten us with kingdom come and they wear a sanctified air in public and expect us to go down on our knees and ask their blessing and they intrigue and they grasp and they backbite and they slander worse than the worst courtier or the wickedest old woman i heard this mr swift sneering at my lord duke of marlborough’s courage the other day he that teague from dublin because his grace is not in favour dares to say this of him and he says this that it may get to her majesty’s ear and to coax and wheedle mrs masham they say the elector of hanover has a dozen of mistresses in his court at herrenhausen and if he comes to be king over us i wager that the bishops and mr swift that wants to be one will coax and wheedle them oh those priests and their grave airs i’m sick of their square toes and their rustling cassocks i should like to go to a country where there was not one or turn quaker and get rid of ’em and i would only the dress is not becoming and i’ve much too pretty a figure to hide it haven’t i cousin” and here she glanced at her person and the lookingglass which told her rightly that a more beautiful shape and face never were seen  “i made that onslaught on the priests” says miss beatrix afterwards “in order to divert my poor dear mother’s anguish about frank frank is as vain as a girl cousin talk of us girls being vain what are we to you it was easy to see that the first woman who chose would make a fool of him or the first robe—i count a priest and a woman all the same we are always caballing we are not answerable for the fibs we tell we are always cajoling and coaxing or threatening and we are always making mischief colonel esmond—mark my word for that who know the the world sir and have to make my way in it i see as well as possible how frank’s marriage hath been managed the count our papainlaw is always away at the coffeehouse the countess our mother is always in the kitchen looking after the dinner the countess our sister is at the spinet when my lord comes to say he is going on the campaign the lovely clotilda bursts into tears and faints so he catches her in his arms—no sir keep your distance cousin if you please—she cries on his shoulder and he says ‘oh my divine my adored my beloved clotilda are you sorry to part with me’ ‘oh my francisco’ says she ‘oh my lord’ and at this very instant mamma and a couple of young brothers with moustachios and long rapiers come in from the kitchen where they have been eating bread and onions mark my word you will have all this woman’s relations at castlewood three months after she has arrived there the old count and countess and the young counts and all the little countesses her sisters counts every one of these wretches says he is a count guiscard that stabbed mr harvy said he was a count and i believe he was a barber all frenchmen are barbers—fiddledee don’t contradict me—or else dancingmasters or else priests” and so she rattled on  “who was it taught you to dance cousin beatrix” says the colonel  she laughed out the air of a minuet and swept a low curtsy coming up to the recover with the prettiest little foot in the world pointed out her mother came in as she was in this attitude my lady had been in her closet having taken poor frank’s conversion in a very serious way the madcap girl ran up to her mother put her arms round her waist kissed her tried to make her dance and said “don’t be silly you kind little mamma and cry about frank turning papist what a figure he must be with a white sheet and a candle walking in a procession barefoot” and she kicked off her little slippers the wonderfullest little shoes with wonderful tall red heels esmond pounced upon one as it fell close beside him and she put on the drollest little moue and marched up and down the room holding esmond’s cane by way of taper serious as her mood was lady castlewood could not refrain from laughing and as for esmond he looked on with that delight with which the sight of this fair creature always inspired him never had he seen any woman so arch so brilliant and so beautiful  having finished her march she put out her foot for her slipper the colonel knelt down “if you will be pope i will turn papist” says he and her holiness gave him gracious leave to kiss the little stockinged foot before he put the slipper on  mamma’s feet began to pat on the floor during this operation and beatrix whose bright eyes nothing escaped saw that little mark of impatience she ran up and embraced her mother with her usual cry of “oh you silly little mamma your feet are quite as pretty as mine” says she “they are cousin though she hides ’em but the shoemaker will tell you that he makes for both off the same last”  “you are taller than i am dearest” says her mother blushing over her whole sweet face—“and—and it is your hand my dear and not your foot he wants you to give him” and she said it with a hysteric laugh that had more of tears than laughter in it laying her head on her daughter’s fair shoulder and hiding it there they made a very pretty picture together and looked like a pair of sisters—the sweet simple matron seeming younger than her years and her daughter if not older yet somehow from a commanding manner and grace which she possessed above most women her mother’s superior and protectress  “but oh” cries my mistress recovering herself after this scene and returning to her usual sad tone “’tis a shame that we should laugh and be making merry on a day when we ought to be down on our knees and asking pardon”  “asking pardon for what” says saucy mrs beatrix—“because frank takes it into his head to fast on fridays and worship images you know if you had been born a papist mother a papist you would have remained to the end of your days ’tis the religion of the king and of some of the best quality for my part i’m no enemy to it and think queen bess was not a penny better than queen mary”  “hush beatrix do not jest with sacred things and remember of what parentage you come” cries my lady beatrix was ordering her ribbons and adjusting her tucker and performing a dozen provoking pretty ceremonies before the glass the girl was no hypocrite at least she never at that time could be brought to think but of the world and her beauty and seemed to have no more sense of devotion than some people have of music that cannot distinguish one air from another esmond saw this fault in her as he saw many others—a bad wife would beatrix esmond make he thought for any man under the degree of a prince she was born to shine in great assemblies and to adorn palaces and to command everywhere—to conduct an intrigue of politics or to glitter in a queen’s train but to sit at a homely table and mend the stockings of a poor man’s children that was no fitting duty for her or at least one that she wouldn’t have broke her heart in trying to do she was a princess though she had scarce a shilling to her fortune and one of her subjects—the most abject and devoted wretch sure that ever drivelled at a woman’s knees—was this unlucky gentleman who bound his good sense and reason and independence hand and foot and submitted them to her  and who does not know how ruthlessly women will tyrannize when they are let to domineer and who does not know how useless advice is i could give good counsel to my descendants but i know they’ll follow their own way for all their grandfather’s sermon a man gets his own experience about women and will take nobody’s hearsay nor indeed is the young fellow worth a fig that would ’tis i that am in love with my mistress not my old grandmother that counsels me ’tis i that have fixed the value of the thing i would have and know the price i would pay for it it may be worthless to you but ’tis all my life to me had esmond possessed the great mogul’s crown and all his diamonds or all the duke of marlborough’s money or all the ingots sunk at vigo he would have given them all for this woman a fool he was if you will but so is a sovereign a fool that will give half a principality for a little crystal as big as a pigeon’s egg and called a diamond so is a wealthy nobleman a fool that will face danger or death and spend half his life and all his tranquillity caballing for a blue ribbon so is a dutch merchant a fool that hath been known to pay ten thousand crowns for a tulip there’s some particular prize we all of us value and that every man of spirit will venture his life for with this it may be to achieve a great reputation for learning with that to be a man of fashion and the admiration of the town with another to consummate a great work of art or poetry and go to immortality that way and with another for a certain time of his life the sole object and aim is a woman  whilst esmond was under the domination of this passion he remembers many a talk he had with his intimates who used to rally our knight of the rueful countenance at his devotion whereof he made no disguise to beatrix and it was with replies such as the above he met his friends’ satire “granted i am a fool” says he “and no better than you but you are no better than i you have your folly you labour for give me the charity of mine what flatteries do you mr st john stoop to whisper in the ears of a queen’s favourite what nights of labour doth not the laziest man in the world endure forgoing his bottle and his boon companions forgoing lais in whose lap he would like to be yawning that he may prepare a speech full of lies to cajole three hundred stupid country gentlemen in the house of commons and get the hiccuping cheers of the october club what days will you spend in your jolting chariot” mr esmond often rode to windsor and especially of later days with the secretary “what hours will you pass on your gouty feet—and how humbly will you kneel down to present a dispatch—you the proudest man in the world that has not knelt to god since you were a boy and in that posture whisper flatter adore almost a stupid woman that’s often boozy with too much meat and drink when mr secretary goes for his audience if my pursuit is vanity sure yours is too” and then the secretary would fly out in such a rich flow of eloquence as this pen cannot pretend to recall advocating his scheme of ambition showing the great good he would do for his country when he was the undisputed chief of it backing his opinion with a score of pat sentences from greek and roman authorities of which kind of learning he made rather an ostentatious display and scornfully vaunting the very arts and meannesses by which fools were to be made to follow him opponents to be bribed or silenced doubters converted and enemies overawed  “i am diogenes” says esmond laughing “that is taken up for a ride in alexander’s chariot i have no desire to vanquish darius or to tame bucephalus i do not want what you want a great name or a high place to have them would bring me no pleasure but my moderation is taste not virtue and i know that what i do want is as vain as that which you long after do not grudge me my vanity if i allow yours or rather let us laugh at both indifferently and at ourselves and at each other”  “if your charmer holds out” says st john “at this rate she may keep you twenty years besieging her and surrender by the time you are seventy and she is old enough to be a grandmother i do not say the pursuit of a particular woman is not as pleasant a pastime as any other kind of hunting” he added “only for my part i find the game won’t run long enough they knock under too soon—that’s the fault i find with ’em”  “the game which you pursue is in the habit of being caught and used to being pulled down” says mr esmond  “but dulcinea del toboso is peerless eh” says the other “well honest harry go and attack windmills—perhaps thou art not more mad than other people” st john added with a sigh    chapter iii a paper out of the “spectator”   doth any young gentleman of my progeny who may read his old grandfather’s papers chance to be presently suffering under the passion of love there is a humiliating cure but one that is easy and almost specific for the malady—which is to try an alibi esmond went away from his mistress and was cured a halfdozen times he came back to her side and instantly fell ill again of the fever he vowed that he could leave her and think no more of her and so he could pretty well at least succeed in quelling that rage and longing he had whenever he was with her but as soon as he returned he was as bad as ever again truly a ludicrous and pitiable object at least exhausting everybody’s pity but his dearest mistress’s lady castlewood’s in whose tender breast he reposed all his dreary confessions and who never tired of hearing him and pleading for him  sometimes esmond would think there was hope then again he would be plagued with despair at some impertinence or coquetry of his mistress for days they would be like brother and sister or the dearest friends—she simple fond and charming—he happy beyond measure at her good behaviour but this would all vanish on a sudden either he would be too pressing and hint his love when she would rebuff him instantly and give his vanity a box on the ear or he would be jealous and with perfect good reason of some new admirer that had sprung up or some rich young gentleman newly arrived in the town that this incorrigible flirt would set her nets and baits to draw in if esmond remonstrated the little rebel would say—“who are you i shall go my own way sirrah and that way is towards a husband and i don’t want you on the way i am for your betters colonel for your betters do you hear that you might do if you had an estate and were younger only eight years older than i you say pish you are a hundred years older you are an old old graveairs and i should make you miserable that would be the only comfort i should have in marrying you but you have not money enough to keep a cat decently after you have paid your man his wages and your landlady her bill do you think i’m going to live in a lodging and turn the mutton at a string whilst your honour nurses the baby fiddlestick and why did you not get this nonsense knocked out of your head when you were in the wars you are come back more dismal and dreary than ever you and mamma are fit for each other you might be darby and joan and play cribbage to the end of your lives”  “at least you own to your worldliness my poor trix” says her mother  “worldliness—o my pretty lady do you think that i am a child in the nursery and to be frightened by bogey worldliness to be sure and pray madam where is the harm of wishing to be comfortable when you are gone you dearest old woman or when i am tired of you and have run away from you where shall i go shall i go and be head nurse to my popish sisterinlaw take the children their physic and whip ’em and put ’em to bed when they are naughty shall i be castlewood’s upper servant and perhaps marry tom tusher merci i have been long enough frank’s humble servant why am i not a man i have ten times his brains and had i worn the—well don’t let your ladyship be frightened—had i worn a sword and periwig instead of this mantle and commode to which nature has condemned me—though ’tis a pretty stuff too—cousin esmond you will go to the exchange tomorrow and get the exact counterpart of this ribbon sir do you hear—i would have made our name talked about so would graveairs here have made something out of our name if he had represented it my lord graveairs would have done very well yes you have a very pretty way and would have made a very decent grave speaker” and here she began to imitate esmond’s way of carrying himself and speaking to his face and so ludicrously that his mistress burst out alaughing and even he himself could see there was some likeness in the fantastical malicious caricature  “yes” says she “i solemnly vow own and confess that i want a good husband where’s the harm of one my face is my fortune who’ll come—buy buy buy i cannot toil neither can i spin but i can play twentythree games on the cards i can dance the last dance i can hunt the stag and i think i could shoot flying i can talk as wicked as any woman of my years and know enough stories to amuse a sulky husband for at least one thousand and one nights i have a pretty taste for dress diamonds gambling and old china i love sugarplums malines lace that you brought me cousin is very pretty the opera and everything that is useless and costly i have got a monkey and a little black boy—pompey sir go and give a dish of chocolate to colonel graveairs—and a parrot and a spaniel and i must have a husband cupid you hear”  “iss missis” says pompey a little grinning negro lord peterborow gave her with a bird of paradise in his turbant and a collar with his mistress’s name on it  “iss missis” says beatrix imitating the child “and if husband not come pompey must go fetch one”  and pompey went away grinning with his chocolate tray as miss beatrix ran up to her mother and ended her sally of mischief in her common way with a kiss—no wonder that upon paying such a penalty her fond judge pardoned her                      when mr esmond came home his health was still shattered and he took a lodging near to his mistress’s at kensington glad enough to be served by them and to see them day after day he was enabled to see a little company—and of the sort he liked best mr steele and mr addison both did him the honour to visit him and drank many a flask of good claret at his lodging whilst their entertainer through his wound was kept to diet drink and gruel these gentlemen were whigs and great admirers of my lord duke of marlborough and esmond was entirely of the other party but their different views of politics did not prevent the gentlemen from agreeing in private nor from allowing on one evening when esmond’s kind old patron lieutenantgeneral webb with a stick and a crutch hobbled up to the colonel’s lodging which was prettily situate at knightsbridge between london and kensington and looking over the gardens that the lieutenantgeneral was a noble and gallant soldier—and even that he had been hardly used in the wynendael affair he took his revenge in talk that must be confessed and if mr addison had had a mind to write a poem about wynendael he might have heard from the commander’s own lips the story a hundred times over  mr esmond forced to be quiet betook himself to literature for a relaxation and composed his comedy whereof the prompter’s copy lieth in my walnut escritoire sealed up and docketed the faithful fool a comedy as it was performed by her majesty’s servants ’twas a very sentimental piece and mr steele who had more of that kind of sentiment than mr addison admired it whilst the other rather sneered at the performance though he owned that here and there it contained some pretty strokes he was bringing out his own play of cato at the time the blaze of which quite extinguished esmond’s farthing candle and his name was never put to the piece which was printed as by a person of quality only nine copies were sold though mr dennis the great critic praised it and said ’twas a work of great merit and colonel esmond had the whole impression burned one day in a rage by jack lockwood his man  all this comedy was full of bitter satiric strokes against a certain young lady the plot of the piece was quite a new one a young woman was represented with a great number of suitors selecting a pert fribble of a peer in place of the hero but illacted i think by mr wilks the faithful fool who persisted in admiring her in the fifth act teraminta was made to discover the merits of eugenio the f f and to feel a partiality for him too late for he announced that he had bestowed his hand and estate upon rosaria a country lass endowed with every virtue but it must be owned that the audience yawned through the play and that it perished on the third night with only half a dozen persons to behold its agonies esmond and his two mistresses came to the first night and miss beatrix fell asleep whilst her mother who had not been to a play since king james the second’s time thought the piece though not brilliant had a very pretty moral  mr esmond dabbled in letters and wrote a deal of prose and verse at this time of leisure when displeased with the conduct of miss beatrix he would compose a satire in which he relieved his mind when smarting under the faithlessness of women he dashed off a copy of verses in which he held the whole sex up to scorn one day in one of these moods he made a little joke in which swearing him to secrecy he got his friend dick steele to help him and composing a paper he had it printed exactly like steele’s paper and by his printer and laid on his mistress’s breakfasttable the following—  “spectator  no 341 tuesday april 1 1712  mutato nomine de te fabula narratur—horace  thyself the moral of the fable see—creech  “jocasta is known as a woman of learning and fashion and as one of the most amiable persons of this court and country she is at home two mornings of the week and all the wits and a few of the beauties of london flock to her assemblies when she goes abroad to tunbridge or the bath a retinue of adorers rides the journey with her and besides the london beaux she has a crowd of admirers at the wells the polite amongst the natives of sussex and somerset pressing round her teatables and being anxious for a nod from her chair jocasta’s acquaintance is thus very numerous indeed ’tis one smart writer’s work to keep her visitingbook—a strong footman is engaged to carry it and it would require a much stronger head even than jocasta’s own to remember the names of all her dear friends  “either at epsom wells or at tunbridge for of this important matter jocasta cannot be certain it was her ladyship’s fortune to become acquainted with a young gentleman whose conversation was so sprightly and manners amiable that she invited the agreeable young spark to visit her if ever he came to london where her house in spring garden should be open to him charming as he was and without any manner of doubt a pretty fellow jocasta hath such a regiment of the like continually marching round her standard that ’tis no wonder her attention is distracted amongst them and so though this gentleman made a considerable impression upon her and touched her heart for at least threeandtwenty minutes it must be owned that she has forgotten his name he is a dark man and may be eightandtwenty years old his dress is sober though of rich materials he has a mole on his forehead over his left eye has a blue ribbon to his cane and sword and wears his own hair  “jocasta was much flattered by beholding her admirer for that everybody admires who sees her is a point which she never can for a moment doubt in the next pew to her at st james’s church last sunday and the manner in which he appeared to go to sleep during the sermon—though from under his fringed eyelids it was evident he was casting glances of respectful rapture towards jocasta—deeply moved and interested her on coming out of church he found his way to her chair and made her an elegant bow as she stepped into it she saw him at court afterwards where he carried himself with a most distinguished air though none of her acquaintances knew his name and the next night he was at the play where her ladyship was pleased to acknowledge him from the sidebox  “during the whole of the comedy she racked her brains so to remember his name that she did not hear a word of the piece and having the happiness to meet him once more in the lobby of the playhouse she went up to him in a flutter and bade him remember that she kept two nights in the week and that she longed to see him at spring garden  “he appeared on tuesday in a rich suit showing a very fine taste both in the tailor and wearer and though a knot of us were gathered round the charming jocasta fellows who pretended to know every face upon the town not one could tell the gentleman’s name in reply to jocasta’s eager inquiries flung to the right and left of her as he advanced up the room with a bow that would become a duke  “jocasta acknowledged this salute with one of those smiles and curtsies of which that lady hath the secret she curtsies with a languishing air as if to say ‘you are come at last i have been pining for you’ and then she finishes her victim with a killing look which declares ‘o philander i have no eyes but for you’ camilla hath as good a curtsy perhaps and thalestris much such another look but the glance and the curtsy together belong to jocasta of all the english beauties alone  “ ‘welcome to london sir’ says she ‘one can see you are from the country by your looks’ she would have said ‘epsom’ or ‘tunbridge’ had she remembered rightly at which place she had met the stranger but alas she had forgotten  “the gentleman said ‘he had been in town but three days and one of his reasons for coming hither was to have the honour of paying his court to jocasta’  “she said ‘the waters had agreed with her but indifferently’  “ ‘the waters were for the sick’ the gentleman said ‘the young and beautiful came but to make them sparkle and as the clergyman read the service on sunday’ he added ‘your ladyship reminded me of the angel that visited the pool’ a murmur of approbation saluted this sally manilio who is a wit when he is not at cards was in such a rage that he revoked when he heard it  “jocasta was an angel visiting the waters but at which of the bethesdas she was puzzled more and more and as her way always is looked the more innocent and simple the more artful her intentions were  “ ‘we were discoursing’ says she ‘about spelling of names and words when you came why should we say goold and write gold and call china chayny and cavendish candish and cholmondeley chumley if we call pulteney poltney why shouldn’t we call poultry pultry—and——’  “ ‘such an enchantress as your ladyship’ says he ‘is mistress of all sorts of spells’ but this was dr swift’s pun and we all knew it  “ ‘and—and how do you spell your name’ says she coming to the point at length for this sprightly conversation had lasted much longer than is here set down and been carried on through at least three dishes of tea  “ ‘oh madam’ says he ‘i spell my name with the y’ and laying down his dish my gentleman made another elegant bow and was gone in a moment  “jocasta hath had no sleep since this mortification and the stranger’s disappearance if balked in anything she is sure to lose her health and temper and we her servants suffer as usual during the angry fits of our queen can you help us mr spectator who know everything to read this riddle for her and set at rest all our minds we find in her list mr berty mr smith mr pike mr tyler—who may be mr bertie mr smyth mr pyke mr tiler for what we know she hath turned away the clerk of her visitingbook a poor fellow with a great family of children read me this riddle good mr shortface and oblige your admirer—oedipus”  the “trumpet” coffeehouse whitehall  “mr spectator—i am a gentleman but little acquainted with the town though i have had a university education and passed some years serving my country abroad where my name is better known than in the coffeehouses and st james’s  “two years since my uncle died leaving me a pretty estate in the county of kent and being at tunbridge wells last summer after my mourning was over and on the lookout if truth must be told for some young lady who would share with me the solitude of my great kentish house and be kind to my tenantry for whom a woman can do a great deal more good than the bestintentioned man can i was greatly fascinated by a young lady of london who was the toast of all the company at the wells everyone knows saccharissa’s beauty and i think mr spectator no one better than herself  “my tablebook informs me that i danced no less than sevenandtwenty sets with her at the assembly i treated her to the fiddles twice i was admitted on several days to her lodging and received by her with a great deal of distinction and for a time was entirely her slave it was only when i found from common talk of the company at the wells and from narrowly watching one who i once thought of asking the most sacred question a man can put to a woman that i became aware how unfit she was to be a country gentleman’s wife and that this fair creature was but a heartless worldly jilt playing with affections that she never meant to return and indeed incapable of returning them ’tis admiration such women want not love that touches them and i can conceive in her old age no more wretched creature than this lady will be when her beauty hath deserted her when her admirers have left her and she hath neither friendship nor religion to console her  “business calling me to london i went to st james’s church last sunday and there opposite me sat my beauty of the wells her behaviour during the whole service was so pert languishing and absurd she flirted her fan and ogled and eyed me in a manner so indecent that i was obliged to shut my eyes so as actually not to see her and whenever i opened them beheld hers and very bright they are still staring at me i fell in with her afterwards at court and at the playhouse and here nothing would satisfy her but she must elbow through the crowd and speak to me and invite me to the assembly which she holds at her house nor very far from chrng crss  “having made her a promise to attend of course i kept my promise and found the young widow in the midst of a halfdozen of cardtables and a crowd of wits and admirers i made the best bow i could and advanced towards her and saw by a peculiar puzzled look in her face though she tried to hide her perplexity that she had forgotten even my name  “her talk artful as it was convinced me that i had guessed aright she turned the conversation most ridiculously upon the spelling of names and words and i replied with as ridiculous fulsome compliments as i could pay her indeed one in which i compared her to an angel visiting the sickwells went a little too far nor should i have employed it but that the allusion came from the second lesson last sunday which we both had heard and i was pressed to answer her  “then she came to the question which i knew was awaiting me and asked how i spelt my name ‘madam’ says i turning on my heel ‘i spell it with the y’ and so i left her wondering at the lightheartedness of the townpeople who forget and make friends so easily and resolved to look elsewhere for a partner for your constant reader  “cymon wyldoats  “you know my real name mr spectator in which there is no such a letter as hupsilon but if the lady whom i have called saccharissa wonders that i appear no more at the teatables she is hereby respectfully informed the reason y”                      the above is a parable whereof the writer will now expound the meaning jocasta was no other than miss esmond maid of honour to her majesty she had told mr esmond this little story of having met a gentleman somewhere and forgetting his name when the gentleman with no such malicious intentions as those of “cymon” in the above fable made the answer simply as above and we all laughed to think how little mistress jocastabeatrix had profited by her artifice and precautions  as for cymon he was intended to represent yours and her very humble servant the writer of the apologue and of this story which we had printed on a spectator paper at mr steele’s office exactly as those famous journals were printed and which was laid on the table at breakfast in place of the real newspaper mistress jocasta who had plenty of wit could not live without her spectator to her tea and this sham spectator was intended to convey to the young woman that she herself was a flirt and that cymon was a gentleman of honour and resolution seeing all her faults and determined to break the chains once and for ever  for though enough hath been said about this love business already—enough at least to prove to the writer’s heirs what a silly fond fool their old grandfather was who would like them to consider him a a very wise old gentleman yet not near all has been told concerning this matter which if it were allowed to take in esmond’s journal the space it occupied in his time would weary his kinsmen and women of a hundred years’ time beyond all endurance and form such a diary of folly and drivelling raptures and rage as no man of ordinary vanity would like to leave behind him  the truth is that whether she laughed at him or encouraged him whether she smiled or was cold and turned her smiles on another—worldly and ambitious as he knew her to be hard and careless as she seemed to grow with her court life and a hundred admirers that came to her and left her esmond do what he would never could get beatrix out of his mind thought of her constantly at home or away if he read his name in a gazette or escaped the shot of a cannonball or a greater danger in the campaign as has happened to him more than once the instant thought after the honour achieved or the danger avoided was “what will she say of it” “will this distinction or the idea of this peril elate her or touch her so as to be better inclined towards me” he could no more help this passionate fidelity of temper than he could help the eyes he saw with—one or the other seemed a part of his nature and knowing every one of her faults as well as the keenest of her detractors and the folly of an attachment to such a woman of which the fruition could never bring him happiness for above a week there was yet a charm about this circe from which the poor deluded gentleman could not free himself and for a much longer period than ulysses another middleaged officer who had travelled much and been in the foreign wars esmond felt himself enthralled and besotted by the wiles of this enchantress quit her he could no more quit her as the cymon of this story was made to quit his false one than he could lose his consciousness of yesterday she had but to raise her finger and he would come back from ever so far she had but to say “i have discarded suchandsuch an adorer” and the poor infatuated wretch would be sure to come and rôder about her mother’s house willing to be put on the ranks of suitors though he knew he might be cast off the next week if he were like ulysses in his folly at least she was in so far like penelope that she had a crowd of suitors and undid day after day and night after night the handiwork of fascination and the web of coquetry with which she was wont to allure and entertain them  part of her coquetry may have come from her position about the court where the beautiful maid of honour was the light about which a thousand beaux came and fluttered where she was sure to have a ring of admirers round her crowding to listen to her repartees as much as to admire her beauty and where she spoke and listened to much free talk such as one never would have thought the lips or ears of rachel castlewood’s daughter would have uttered or heard when in waiting at windsor or hampton the court ladies and gentlemen would be making riding parties together mrs beatrix in a horseman’s coat and hat the foremost after the staghounds and over the park fences a crowd of young fellows at her heels if the english country ladies at this time were the most pure and modest of any ladies in the world—the english town and court ladies permitted themselves words and behaviour that were neither modest nor pure and claimed some of them a freedom which those who love that sex most would never wish to grant them the gentlemen of my family that follow after me for i don’t encourage the ladies to pursue any such studies may read in the works of mr congreve and dr swift and others what was the conversation and what the habits of our time  the most beautiful woman in england in 1712 when esmond returned to this country a lady of high birth and though of no fortune to be sure with a thousand fascinations of wit and manners—beatrix esmond—was now sixandtwenty years old and beatrix esmond still of her hundred adorers she had not chosen one for a husband and those who had asked had been jilted by her and more still had left her a succession of near ten years’ crops of beauties had come up since her time and had been reaped by proper husbandmen if we may make an agricultural simile and had been housed comfortably long ago her own contemporaries were sober mothers by this time girls with not a tithe of her charms or her wit having made good matches and now claiming precedence over the spinster who but lately had derided and outshone them the young beauties were beginning to look down on beatrix as an old maid and sneer and call her one of charles the second’s ladies and ask whether her portrait was not in the hampton court gallery but still she reigned at least in one man’s opinion superior over all the little misses that were the toasts of the young lads and in esmond’s eyes was ever perfectly lovely and young  who knows how many were nearly made happy by possessing her or rather how many were fortunate in escaping this siren ’tis a marvel to think that her mother was the purest and simplest woman in the whole world and that this girl should have been born from her i am inclined to fancy my mistress who never said a harsh word to her children and but twice or thrice only to one person must have been too fond and pressing with the maternal authority for her son and her daughter both revolted early nor after their first flight from the nest could they ever be brought back quite to the fond mother’s bosom lady castlewood and perhaps it was as well knew little of her daughter’s life and real thoughts how was she to apprehend what passed in queens’ antechambers and at court tables mrs beatrix asserted her own authority so resolutely that her mother quickly gave in the maid of honour had her own equipage went from home and came back at her own will her mother was alike powerless to resist her or to lead her or to command or to persuade her  she had been engaged once twice thrice to be married esmond believed when he quitted home it hath been said she was promised to my lord ashburnham and now on his return behold his lordship was just married to lady mary butler the duke of ormonde’s daughter and his fine houses and twelve thousand a year of fortune for which miss beatrix had rather coveted him was out of her power to her esmond could say nothing in regard to the breaking of this match and asking his mistress about it all lady castlewood answered was “do not speak to me about it harry i cannot tell you how or why they parted and i fear to inquire i have told you before that with all her kindness and wit and generosity and that sort of splendour of nature she has i can say but little good of poor beatrix and look with dread at the marriage she will form her mind is fixed on ambition only and making a great figure and this achieved she will tire of it as she does of everything heaven help her husband whoever he shall be my lord ashburnham was a most excellent young man gentle and yet manly of very good parts so they told me and as my little conversation would enable me to judge and a kind temper—kind and enduring i’m sure he must have been from all that he had to endure but he quitted her at last from some crowning piece of caprice or tyranny of hers and now he has married a young woman that will make him a thousand times happier than my poor girl ever could”  the rupture whatever its cause was i heard the scandal but indeed shall not take pains to repeat at length in this diary the trumpery coffeehouse story caused a good deal of low talk and mr esmond was present at my lord’s appearance at the birthday with his bride over whom the revenge that beatrix took was to look so imperial and lovely that the modest downcast young lady could not appear beside her and lord ashburnham who had his reasons for wishing to avoid her slunk away quite shamefaced and very early this time his grace the duke of hamilton whom esmond had seen about her before was constant at miss beatrix’s side he was one of the most splendid gentlemen of europe accomplished by books by travel by long command of the best company distinguished as a statesman having been ambassador in king william’s time and a noble speaker in the scots parliament where he had led the party that was against the union and though now five or sixandforty years of age a gentleman so high in stature accomplished in wit and favoured in person that he might pretend to the hand of any princess in europe  “should you like the duke for a cousin” says mr secretary st john whispering to colonel esmond in french “it appears that the widower consoles himself”  but to return to our little spectator paper and the conversation which grew out of it miss beatrix at first was quite bit as the phrase of that day was and did not “smoke” the authorship of the story indeed esmond had tried to imitate as well as he could mr steele’s manner as for the other author of the spectator his prose style i think is altogether inimitable and dick who was the idlest and bestnatured of men would have let the piece pass into his journal and go to posterity as one of his own lucubrations but that esmond did not care to have a lady’s name whom he loved sent forth to the world in a light so unfavourable beatrix pished and psha’d over the paper colonel esmond watching with no little interest her countenance as she read it  “how stupid your friend mr steele becomes” cries miss beatrix “epsom and tunbridge will he never have done with epsom and tunbridge and with beaux at church and jocastas and lindamiras why does he not call women nelly and betty as their godfathers and godmothers did for them in their baptism”  “beatrix beatrix” says her mother “speak gravely of grave things”  “mamma thinks the church catechism came from heaven i believe” says beatrix with a laugh “and was brought down by a bishop from a mountain oh how i used to break my heart over it besides i had a popish godmother mamma why did you give me one”  “i gave you the queen’s name” says her mother blushing “and a very pretty name it is” said somebody else  beatrix went on reading—“spell my name with a y—why you wretch” says she turning round to colonel esmond “you have been telling my story to mr steele—or stop—you have written the paper yourself to turn me into ridicule for shame sir”  poor mr esmond felt rather frightened and told a truth which was nevertheless an entire falsehood “upon my honour” says he “i have not even read the spectator of this morning” nor had he for that was not the spectator but a sham newspaper put in its place  she went on reading her face rather flushed as she read “no” she says “i think you couldn’t have written it i think it must have been mr steele when he was drunk—and afraid of his horrid vulgar wife whenever i see an enormous compliment to a woman and some outrageous panegyric about female virtue i always feel sure that the captain and his better half have fallen out overnight and that he has been brought home tipsy or has been found out in ——”  “beatrix” cries the lady castlewood  “well mamma do not cry out before you are hurt i am not going to say anything wrong i won’t give you more annoyance than i can help you pretty kind mamma yes and your little trix is a naughty little trix and she leaves undone those things which she ought to have done and does those things which she ought not to have done and there’s——well now—i won’t go on yes i will unless you kiss me” and with this the young lady lays aside her paper and runs up to her mother and performs a variety of embraces with her ladyship saying as plain as eyes could speak to mr esmond—“there sir would not you like to play the very same pleasant game”  “indeed madam i would” says he  “would what” asked miss beatrix  “what you meant when you looked at me in that provoking way” answers esmond  “what a confessor” cries beatrix with a laugh  “what is it henry would like my dear” asks her mother the kind soul who was always thinking what we would like and how she could please us  the girl runs up to her—“oh you silly kind mamma” she says kissing her again “that’s what harry would like” and she broke out into a great joyful laugh and lady castlewood blushed as bashful as a maid of sixteen  “look at her harry” whispers beatrix running up and speaking in her sweet low tones “doesn’t the blush become her isn’t she pretty she looks younger than i am and i am sure she is a hundred million thousand times better”  esmond’s kind mistress left the room carrying her blushes away with her  “if we girls at court could grow such roses as that” continues beatrix with her laugh “what wouldn’t we do to preserve ’em we’d clip their stalks and put ’em in salt and water but those flowers don’t bloom at hampton court and windsor henry” she paused for a minute and the smile fading away from her april face gave place to a menacing shower of tears “oh how good she is harry” beatrix went on to say “oh what a saint she is her goodness frightens me i’m not fit to live with her i should be better i think if she were not so perfect she has had a great sorrow in her life and a great secret and repented of it it could not have been my father’s death she talks freely about that nor could she have loved him very much—though who knows what we women do love and why”  “what and why indeed” says mr esmond  “no one knows” beatrix went on without noticing this interruption except by a look “what my mother’s life is she hath been at early prayer this morning she passes hours in her closet if you were to follow her thither you would find her at prayers now she tends the poor of the place—the horrid dirty poor she sits through the curate’s sermons—oh those dreary sermons and you see on a beau dire but good as they are people like her are not fit to commune with us of the world there is always as it were a third person present even when i and my mother are alone she can’t be frank with me quite who is always thinking of the next world and of her guardian angel perhaps that’s in company oh harry i’m jealous of that guardian angel” here broke out mistress beatrix “it’s horrid i know but my mother’s life is all for heaven and mine—all for earth we can never be friends quite and then she cares more for frank’s little finger than she does for me—i know she does and she loves you sir a great deal too much and i hate you for it i would have had her all to myself but she wouldn’t in my childhood it was my father she loved—oh how could she i remember him kind and handsome but so stupid and not being able to speak after drinking wine and then it was frank and now it is heaven and the clergyman how i would have loved her from a child i used to be in a rage that she loved anybody but me but she loved you all better—all i know she did and now she talks of the blessed consolation of religion dear soul she thinks she is happier for believing as she must that we are all of us wicked and miserable sinners and this world is only a pied à terre for the good where they stay for a night as we do coming from walcote at that great dreary uncomfortable hounslow inn in those horrid beds oh do you remember those horrid beds—and the chariot comes and fetches them to heaven the next morning”  “hush beatrix” says mr esmond  “hush indeed you are a hypocrite too henry with your grave airs and your glum face we are all hypocrites oh dear me we are all alone alone alone” says poor beatrix her fair breast heaving with a sigh  “it was i that writ every line of that paper my dear” says mr esmond “you are not so worldly as you think yourself beatrix and better than we believe you the good we have in us we doubt of and the happiness that’s to our hand we throw away you bend your ambition on a great marriage and establishment—and why you’ll tire of them when you win them and be no happier with a coronet on your coach——”  “than riding pillion with lubin to market” says beatrix “thank you lubin”  “i’m a dismal shepherd to be sure” answers esmond with a blush “and require a nymph that can tuck my bedclothes up and make me watergruel well tom lockwood can do that he took me out of the fire upon his shoulders and nursed me through my illness as love will scarce ever do only good wages and a hope of my clothes and the contents of my portmanteau how long was it that jacob served an apprenticeship for rachel”  “for mamma” says beatrix “is it mamma your honour wants and that i should have the happiness of calling you papa”  esmond blushed again “i spoke of a rachel that a shepherd courted five thousand years ago when shepherds were longer lived than now and my meaning was that since i saw you first after our separation—a child you were then——”  “and i put on my best stockings to captivate you i remember sir”  “you have had my heart ever since then such as it was and such as you were i cared for no other woman what little reputation i have won it was that you might be pleased with it and indeed it is not much and i think a hundred fools in the army have got and deserved quite as much was there something in the air of that dismal old castlewood that made us all gloomy and dissatisfied and lonely under its ruined old roof we were all so even when together and united as it seemed following our separate schemes each as we sat round the table”  “dear dreary old place” cries beatrix “mamma hath never had the heart to go back thither since we left it when—never mind how many years ago” and she flung back her curls and looked over her fair shoulder at the mirror superbly as if she said “time i defy you”  “yes” says esmond who had the art as she owned of divining many of her thoughts “you can afford to look in the glass still and only be pleased by the truth it tells you as for me do you know what my scheme is i think of asking frank to give me the virginia estate king charles gave our grandfather” she gave a superb curtsy as much as to say “our grandfather indeed thank you mr bastard” “yes i know you are thinking of my barsinister and so am i a man cannot get over it in this country unless indeed he wears it across a king’s arms when ’tis a highly honourable coat and i am thinking of retiring into the plantations and building myself a wigwam in the woods and perhaps if i want company suiting myself with a squaw we will send your ladyship furs over for the winter and when you are old we’ll provide you with tobacco i am not quite clever enough or not rogue enough—i know not which—for the old world i may make a place for myself in the new which is not so full and found a family there when you are a mother yourself and a great lady perhaps i shall send you over from the plantation some day a little barbarian that is half esmond half mohock and you will be kind to him for his father’s sake who was after all your kinsman and whom you loved a little”  “what folly you are talking harry” says miss beatrix looking with her great eyes  “’tis sober earnest” says esmond and indeed the scheme had been dwelling a good deal in his mind for some time past and especially since his return home when he found how hopeless and even degrading to himself his passion was “no” says he then “i have tried half a dozen times now i can bear being away from you well enough but being with you is intolerable” another low curtsy on mrs beatrix’s part “and i will go i have enough to buy axes and guns for my men and beads and blankets for the savages and i’ll go and live amongst them”  “mon ami” she says quite kindly and taking esmond’s hand with an air of great compassion “you can’t think that in our position anything more than our present friendship is possible you are our elder brother—as such we view you pitying your misfortune not rebuking you with it why you are old enough and grave enough to be our father i always thought you a hundred years old harry with your solemn face and grave air i feel as a sister to you and can no more isn’t that enough sir” and she put her face quite close to his—who knows with what intention  “it’s too much” says esmond turning away “i can’t bear this life and shall leave it i shall stay i think to see you married and then freight a ship and call it the beatrix and bid you all——”  here the servant flinging the door open announced his grace the duke of hamilton and esmond started back with something like an imprecation on his lips as the nobleman entered looking splendid in his star and green ribbon he gave mr esmond just that gracious bow which he would have given to a lackey who fetched him a chair or took his hat and seated himself by miss beatrix as the poor colonel went out of the room with a hangdog look  esmond’s mistress was in the lower room as he passed downstairs she often met him as he was coming away from beatrix and she beckoned him into the apartment  “has she told you harry” lady castlewood said  “she has been very frank—very” says esmond  “but—but about what is going to happen”  “what is going to happen” says he his heart beating  “his grace the duke of hamilton has proposed to her” says my lady “he made his offer yesterday they will marry as soon as his mourning is over and you have heard his grace is appointed ambassador to paris and the ambassadress goes with him”    chapter iv beatrix’s new suitor   the gentleman whom beatrix had selected was to be sure twenty years older than the colonel with whom she quarrelled for being too old but this one was but a nameless adventurer and the other the greatest duke in scotland with pretensions even to a still higher title my lord duke of hamilton had indeed every merit belonging to a gentleman and he had had the time to mature his accomplishments fully being upwards of fifty years old when madam beatrix selected him for a bridegroom duke hamilton then earl of arran had been educated at the famous scottish university of glasgow and coming to london became a great favourite of charles the second who made him a lord of his bedchamber and afterwards appointed him ambassador to the french king under whom the earl served two campaigns as his majesty’s aide de camp and he was absent on this service when king charles died  king james continued my lord’s promotion—made him master of the wardrobe and colonel of the royal regiment of horse and his lordship adhered firmly to king james being of the small company that never quitted that unfortunate monarch till his departure out of england and then it was in 1688 namely that he made the friendship with colonel francis esmond that had always been more or less maintained in the two families  the earl professed a great admiration for king william always but never could give him his allegiance and was engaged in more than one of the plots in the late great king’s reign which always ended in the plotters’ discomfiture and generally in their pardon by the magnanimity of the king lord arran was twice prisoner in the tower during this reign undauntedly saying when offered his release upon parole not to engage against king william that he would not give his word because “he was sure he could not keep it” but nevertheless he was both times discharged without any trial and the king bore this noble enemy so little malice that when his mother the duchess of hamilton of her own right resigned her claim on her husband’s death the earl was by patent signed at loo 1690 created duke of hamilton marquis of clydesdale and earl of arran with precedency from the original creation his grace took the oaths and his seat in the scottish parliament in 1700 was famous there for his patriotism and eloquence especially in the debates about the union bill which duke hamilton opposed with all his strength though he would not go the length of the scottish gentry who were for resisting it by force of arms ’twas said he withdrew his opposition all of a sudden and in consequence of letters from the king at st germains who entreated him on his allegiance not to thwart the queen his sister in this measure and the duke being always bent upon effecting the king’s return to his kingdom through a reconciliation between his majesty and queen anne and quite averse to his landing with arms and french troops held aloof and kept out of scotland during the time when the chevalier de st george’s descent from dunkirk was projected passing his time in england in his great estate of staffordshire  when the whigs went out of office in 1710 the queen began to show his grace the very greatest marks of her favour he was created duke of brandon and baron of dutton in england having the thistle already originally bestowed on him by king james the second his grace was now promoted to the honour of the garter—a distinction so great and illustrious that no subject hath ever borne them hitherto together when this objection was made to her majesty she was pleased to say “such a subject as the duke of hamilton has a preeminent claim to every mark of distinction which a crowned head can confer i will henceforth wear both orders myself”  at the chapter held at windsor in october 1712 the duke and other knights including lordtreasurer the newcreated earl of oxford and mortimer were installed and a few days afterwards his grace was appointed ambassadorextraordinary to france and his equipages plate and liveries commanded of the most sumptuous kind not only for his excellency the ambassador but for her excellency the ambassadress who was to accompany him her arms were already quartered on the coach panels and her brother was to hasten over on the appointed day to give her away  his lordship was a widower having married in 1698 elizabeth daughter of digby lord gerard by which marriage great estates came into the hamilton family and out of these estates came in part that tragic quarrel which ended the duke’s career                      from the loss of a tooth to that of a mistress there’s no pang that is not bearable the apprehension is much more cruel than the certainty and we make up our mind to the misfortune when ’tis irremediable part with the tormentor and mumble our crust on t’other side of the jaws i think colonel esmond was relieved when a ducal coachandsix came and whisked his charmer away out of his reach and placed her in a higher sphere as you have seen the nymph in the operamachine go up to the clouds at the end of the piece where mars bacchus apollo and all the divine company of olympians are seated and quaver out her last song as a goddess so when this portentous elevation was accomplished in the esmond family i am not sure that every one of us did not treat the divine beatrix with special honours at least the saucy little beauty carried her head with a toss of supreme authority and assumed a touchmenot air which all her friends very goodhumouredly bowed to  an old army acquaintance of colonel esmond’s honest tom trett who had sold his company married a wife and turned merchant in the city was dreadfully gloomy for a long time though living in a fine house on the river and carrying on a great trade to all appearance at length esmond saw his friend’s name in the gazette as a bankrupt and a week after this circumstance my bankrupt walks into mr esmond’s lodging with a face perfectly radiant with good humour and as jolly and careless as when they had sailed from southampton ten years before for vigo “this bankruptcy” says tom “has been hanging over my head these three years the thought hath prevented my sleeping and i have looked at poor polly’s head on t’other pillow and then towards my razor on the table and thought to put an end to myself and so give my woes the slip but now we are bankrupts tom trett pays as many shillings in the pound as he can his wife has a little cottage at fulham and her fortune secured to herself i am afraid neither of bailiff nor of creditor and for the last six nights have slept easy” so it was that when fortune shook her wings and left him honest tom cuddled himself up in his ragged virtue and fell asleep  esmond did not tell his friend how much his story applied to esmond too but he laughed at it and used it and having fairly struck his docket in this love transaction determined to put a cheerful face on his bankruptcy perhaps beatrix was a little offended at his gaiety “is this the way sir that you receive the announcement of your misfortune” says she “and do you come smiling before me as if you were glad to be rid of me”  esmond would not be put off from his good humour but told her the story of tom trett and his bankruptcy “i have been hankering after the grapes on the wall” says he “and lost my temper because they were beyond my reach was there any wonder they’re gone now and another has them—a taller man than your humble servant has won them” and the colonel made his cousin a low bow  “a taller man cousin esmond” says she “a man of spirit would have scaled the wall sir and seized them a man of courage would have fought for ’em not gaped for ’em”  “a duke has but to gape and they drop into his mouth” says esmond with another low bow  “yes sir” says she “a duke is a taller man than you and why should i not be grateful to one such as his grace who gives me his heart and his great name it is a great gift he honours me with i know ’tis a bargain between us and i accept it and will do my utmost to perform my part of it ’tis no question of sighing and philandering between a nobleman of his grace’s age and a girl who hath little of that softness in her nature why should i not own that i am ambitious harry esmond and if it be no sin in a man to covet honour why should a woman too not desire it shall i be frank with you harry and say that if you had not been down on your knees and so humble you might have fared better with me a woman of my spirit cousin is to be won by gallantry and not by sighs and rueful faces all the time you are worshipping and singing hymns to me i know very well i am no goddess and grow weary of the incense so would you have been weary of the goddess too—when she was called mrs esmond and got out of humour because she had not pinmoney enough and was forced to go about in an old gown eh cousin a goddess in a mobcap that has to make her husband’s gruel ceases to be divine—i am sure of it i should have been sulky and scolded and of all the proud wretches in the world mr esmond is the proudest let me tell him that you never fall into a passion but you never forgive i think had you been a great man you might have been good humoured but being nobody sir you are too great a man for me and i’m afraid of you cousin—there and i won’t worship you and you’ll never be happy except with a woman who will why after i belonged to you and after one of my tantrums you would have put the pillow over my head some night and smothered me as the black man does the woman in the play that you’re so fond of what’s the creature’s name—desdemona you would you little blackeyed othello”  “i think i should beatrix” says the colonel  “and i want no such ending i intend to live to be a hundred and to go to ten thousand routs and balls and to play cards every night of my life till the year eighteen hundred and i like to be the first of my company sir and i like flattery and compliments and you give me none and i like to be made to laugh sir and who’s to laugh at your dismal face i should like to know and i like a coachandsix or a coachandeight and i like diamonds and a new gown every week and people to say—‘that’s the duchess—how well her grace looks—make way for madame l’ambassadrice d’angleterre—call her excellency’s people’—that’s what i like and as for you you want a woman to bring your slippers and cap and to sit at your feet and cry ‘o caro o bravo’ whilst you read your shakespeares and miltons and stuff mamma would have been the wife for you had you been a little older though you look ten years older than she does—you do you glumfaced bluebearded little old man you might have sat like darby and joan and flattered each other and billed and cooed like a pair of old pigeons on a perch i want my wings and to use them sir” and she spread out her beautiful arms as if indeed she could fly off like the pretty “gawrie” whom the man in the story was enamoured of  “and what will your peter wilkins say to your flight” says esmond who never admired this fair creature more than when she rebelled and laughed at him  “a duchess knows her place” says she with a laugh “why i have a son already made for me and thirty years old my lord arran and four daughters how they will scold and what a rage they will be in when i come to take the head of the table but i give them only a month to be angry at the end of that time they shall love me every one and so shall lord arran and so shall all his grace’s scots vassals and followers in the highlands i’m bent on it and when i take a thing in my head ’tis done his grace is the greatest gentleman in europe and i’ll try and make him happy and when the king comes back you may count on my protection cousin esmond—for come back the king will and shall and i’ll bring him back from versailles if he comes under my hoop”  “i hope the world will make you happy beatrix” says esmond with a sigh “you’ll be beatrix till you are my lady duchess—will you not i shall then make your grace my very lowest bow”  “none of these sighs and this satire cousin” she says “i take his grace’s great bounty thankfully—yes thankfully and will wear his honours becomingly i do not say he hath touched my heart but he has my gratitude obedience admiration—i have told him that and no more and with that his noble heart is content i have told him all—even the story of that poor creature that i was engaged to—and that i could not love and i gladly gave his word back to him and jumped for joy to get back my own i am twentyfive years old”  “twentysix my dear” says esmond  “twentyfive sir—i choose to be twentyfive and in eight years no man hath ever touched my heart yes—you did once for a little harry when you came back after lille and engaging with that murderer mohun and saving frank’s life i thought i could like you and mamma begged me hard on her knees and i did—for a day but the old chill came over me henry and the old fear of you and your melancholy and i was glad when you went away and engaged with my lord ashburnham that i might hear no more of you that’s the truth you are too good for me somehow i could not make you happy and should break my heart in trying and not being able to love you but if you had asked me when we gave you the sword you might have had me sir and we both should have been miserable by this time i talked with that silly lord all night just to vex you and mamma and i succeeded didn’t i how frankly we can talk of these things it seems a thousand years ago and though we are here sitting in the same room there’s a great wall between us my dear kind faithful gloomy old cousin i can like you now and admire you too sir and say that you are brave and very kind and very true and a fine gentleman for all—for all your little mishap at your birth” says she wagging her arch head  “and now sir” says she with a curtsy “we must have no more talk except when mamma is by as his grace is with us for he does not half like you cousin and is as jealous as the black man in your favourite play”  though the very kindness of the words stabbed mr esmond with the keenest pang he did not show his sense of the wound by any look of his as beatrix indeed afterwards owned to him but said with a perfect command of himself and an easy smile “the interview must not end yet my dear until i have had my last word stay here comes your mother” indeed she came in here with her sweet anxious face and esmond going up kissed her hand respectfully “my dear lady may hear too the last words which are no secrets and are only a parting benediction accompanying a present for your marriage from an old gentleman your guardian for i feel as if i was the guardian of all the family and an old old fellow that is fit to be the grandfather of you all and in this character let me make my lady duchess her wedding present they are the diamonds my father’s widow left me i had thought beatrix might have had them a year ago but they are good enough for a duchess though not bright enough for the handsomest woman in the world” and he took the case out of his pocket in which the jewels were and presented them to his cousin  she gave a cry of delight for the stones were indeed very handsome and of great value and the next minute the necklace was where belinda’s cross is in mr pope’s admirable poem and glittering on the whitest and most perfectlyshaped neck in all england  the girl’s delight at receiving these trinkets was so great that after rushing to the lookingglass and examining the effect they produced upon that fair neck which they surrounded beatrix was running back with her arms extended and was perhaps for paying her cousin with a price that he would have liked no doubt to receive from those beautiful rosy lips of hers but at this moment the door opened and his grace the bridegroom elect was announced  he looked very black upon mr esmond to whom he made a very low bow indeed and kissed the hand of each lady in his most ceremonious manner he had come in his chair from the palace hard by and wore his two stars of the garter and the thistle  “look my lord duke” says mrs beatrix advancing to him and showing the diamonds on her breast  “diamonds” says his grace “hm they seem pretty”  “they are a present on my marriage” says beatrix  “from her majesty” asks the duke “the queen is very good”  “from my cousin henry—from our cousin henry”—cry both the ladies in a breath  “i have not the honour of knowing the gentleman i thought that my lord castlewood had no brother and that on your ladyship’s side there were no nephews”  “from our cousin colonel henry esmond my lord” says beatrix taking the colonel’s hand very bravely—“who was left guardian to us by our father and who has a hundred times shown his love and friendship for our family”  “the duchess of hamilton receives no diamonds but from her husband madam” says the duke—“may i pray you to restore these to mr esmond”  “beatrix esmond may receive a present from our kinsman and benefactor my lord duke” says lady castlewood with an air of great dignity “she is my daughter yet and if her mother sanctions the gift—no one else hath the right to question it”  “kinsman and benefactor” says the duke “i know of no kinsman and i do not choose that my wife should have for benefactor a——”  “my lord” says colonel esmond  “i am not here to bandy words” says his grace “frankly i tell you that your visits to this house are too frequent and that i choose no presents for the duchess of hamilton from gentlemen that bear a name they have no right to”  “my lord” breaks out lady castlewood “mr esmond hath the best right to that name of any man in the world and ’tis as old and as honourable as your grace’s”  my lord duke smiled and looked as if lady castlewood was mad that was so talking to him  “if i called him benefactor” said my mistress “it is because he has been so to us—yes the noblest the truest the bravest the dearest of benefactors he would have saved my husband’s life from mohun’s sword he did save my boy’s and defended him from that villain are those no benefits”  “i ask colonel esmond’s pardon” says his grace if possible more haughty than before “i would say not a word that should give him offence and thank him for his kindness to your ladyship’s family my lord mohun and i are connected you know by marriage—though neither by blood nor friendship but i must repeat what i said that my wife can receive no presents from colonel esmond”  “my daughter may receive presents from the head of our house my daughter may thankfully take kindness from her father’s her mother’s her brother’s dearest friend and be grateful for one more benefit besides the thousand we owe him” cries lady esmond “what is a string of diamond stones compared to that affection he hath given us—our dearest preserver and benefactor we owe him not only frank’s life but our all—yes our all” says my mistress with a heightened colour and a trembling voice “the title we bear is his if he would claim it ’tis we who have no right to our name not he that’s too great for it he sacrificed his name at my dying lord’s bedside—sacrificed it to my orphan children gave up rank and honour because he loved us so nobly his father was viscount of castlewood and marquis of esmond before him and he is his father’s lawful son and true heir and we are the recipients of his bounty and he the chief of a house that’s as old as your own and if he is content to forgo his name that my child may bear it we love him and honour him and bless him under whatever name he bears”—and here the fond and affectionate creature would have knelt to esmond again but that he prevented her and beatrix running up to her with a pale face and a cry of alarm embraced her and said “mother what is this”  “’tis a family secret my lord duke” says colonel esmond “poor beatrix knew nothing of it nor did my lady till a year ago and i have as good a right to resign my title as your grace’s mother to abdicate hers to you”  “i should have told everything to the duke of hamilton” said my mistress “had his grace applied to me for my daughter’s hand and not to beatrix i should have spoken with you this very day in private my lord had not your words brought about this sudden explanation—and now ’tis fit beatrix should hear it and know as i would have all the world know what we owe to our kinsman and patron”  and then in her touching way and having hold of her daughter’s hand and speaking to her rather than my lord duke lady castlewood told the story which you know already—lauding up to the skies her kinsman’s behaviour on his side mr esmond explained the reasons that seemed quite sufficiently cogent with him why the succession in the family as at present it stood should not be disturbed and he should remain as he was colonel esmond  “and marquis of esmond my lord” says his grace with a low bow “permit me to ask your lordship’s pardon for words that were uttered in ignorance and to beg for the favour of your friendship to be allied to you sir must be an honour under whatever name you are known” so his grace was pleased to say “and in return for the splendid present you make my wife your kinswoman i hope you will please to command any service that james douglas can perform i shall never be easy until i repay you a part of my obligations at least and ere very long and with the mission her majesty hath given me” says the duke “that may perhaps be in my power i shall esteem it as a favour my lord if colonel esmond will give away the bride”  “and if he will take the usual payment in advance he is welcome” says beatrix stepping up to him and as esmond kissed her she whispered “oh why didn’t i know you before”  my lord duke was as hot as a flame at this salute but said never a word beatrix made him a proud curtsy and the two ladies quitted the room together  “when does your excellency go for paris” asks colonel esmond  “as soon after the ceremony as may be” his grace answered “’tis fixed for the first of december it cannot be sooner the equipage will not be ready till then the queen intends the embassy should be very grand—and i have law business to settle that illomened mohun has come or is coming to london again we are in a lawsuit about my late lord gerard’s property and he hath sent to me to meet him”    chapter v mohun appears for the last time in this history   besides my lord duke of hamilton and brandon who for family reasons had kindly promised his protection and patronage to colonel esmond he had other great friends in power now both able and willing to assist him and he might with such allies look forward to as fortunate advancement in civil life at home as he had got rapid promotion abroad his grace was magnanimous enough to offer to take mr esmond as secretary on his paris embassy but no doubt he intended that proposal should be rejected at any rate esmond could not bear the thoughts of attending his mistress farther than the churchdoor after her marriage and so declined that offer which his generous rival made him  other gentlemen in power were liberal at least of compliments and promises to colonel esmond mr harley now become my lord oxford and mortimer and installed knight of the garter on the same day as his grace of hamilton had received the same honour sent to the colonel to say that a seat in parliament should be at his disposal presently and mr st john held out many flattering hopes of advancement to the colonel when he should enter the house esmond’s friends were all successful and the most successful and triumphant of all was his dear old commander general webb who was now appointed lieutenantgeneral of the land forces and received with particular honour by the ministry by the queen and the people out of doors who huzza’d the brave chief when they used to see him in his chariot going to the house or to the drawingroom or hobbling on foot to his coach from st stephen’s upon his glorious old crutch and stick and cheered him as loud as they had ever done marlborough  that great duke was utterly disgraced and honest old webb dated all his grace’s misfortunes from wynendael and vowed that fate served the traitor right duchess sarah had also gone to ruin she had been forced to give up her keys and her places and her pensions—“ah ah” says webb “she would have locked up three millions of french crowns with her keys had i but been knocked on the head but i stopped that convoy at wynendael” our enemy cardonnel was turned out of the house of commons along with mr walpole for malversation of public money cadogan lost his place of lieutenant of the tower marlborough’s daughters resigned their posts of ladies of the bedchamber and so complete was the duke’s disgrace that his soninlaw lord bridgewater was absolutely obliged to give up his lodging at st james’s and had his halfpension as master of the horse taken away but i think the lowest depth of marlborough’s fall was when he humbly sent to ask general webb when he might wait upon him he who had commanded the stout old general who had injured him and sneered at him who had kept him dangling in his antechamber who could not even after his great service condescend to write him a letter in his own hand the nation was as eager for peace as ever it had been hot for war the prince of savoy came amongst us had his audience of the queen and got his famous sword of honour and strove with all his force to form a whig party together to bring over the young prince of hanover—to do anything which might prolong the war and consummate the ruin of the old sovereign whom he hated so implacably but the nation was tired of the struggle so completely wearied of it that not even our defeat at denain could rouse us into any anger though such an action so lost two years before would have set all england in a fury ’twas easy to see that the great marlborough was not with the army eugene was obliged to fall back in a rage and forgo the dazzling revenge of his life ’twas in vain the duke’s side asked “would we suffer our arms to be insulted would we not send back the only champion who could repair our honour” the nation had had its bellyful of fighting nor could taunts or outcries goad up our britons any more  for a statesman that was always prating of liberty and had the grandest philosophic maxims in his mouth it must be owned that mr st john sometimes rather acted like a turkish than a greek philosopher and especially fell foul of one unfortunate set of men the men of letters with a tyranny a little extraordinary in a man who professed to respect their calling so much the literary controversy at this time was very bitter the government side was the winning one the popular one and i think might have been the merciful one ’twas natural that the opposition should be peevish and cry out some men did so from their hearts admiring the duke of marlborough’s prodigious talents and deploring the disgrace of the greatest general the world ever knew ’twas the stomach that caused other patriots to grumble and such men cried out because they were poor and paid to do so against these my lord bolingbroke never showed the slightest mercy whipping a dozen into prison or into the pillory without the least commiseration  from having been a man of arms mr esmond had now come to be a man of letters but on a safer side than that in which the abovecited poor fellows ventured their liberties and ears there was no danger on ours which was the winning side besides mr esmond pleased himself by thinking that he writ like a gentleman if he did not always succeed as a wit  of the famous wits of that age who have rendered queen anne’s reign illustrious and whose works will be in all englishmen’s hands in ages yet to come mr esmond saw many but at public places chiefly never having a great intimacy with any of them except with honest dick steele and mr addison who parted company with esmond however when that gentleman became a declared tory and lived on close terms with the leading persons of that party addison kept himself to a few friends and very rarely opened himself except in their company a man more upright and conscientious than he it was not possible to find in public life and one whose conversation was so various easy and delightful writing now in my mature years i own that i think addison’s politics were the right and were my time to come over again i would be a whig in england and not a tory but with people that take a side in politics ’tis men rather than principles that commonly bind them a kindness or a slight puts a man under one flag or the other and he marches with it to the end of the campaign esmond’s master in war was injured by marlborough and hated him and the lieutenant fought the quarrels of his leader webb coming to london was used as a weapon by marlborough’s enemies and true steel he was that honest chief nor was his aide de camp mr esmond an unfaithful or unworthy partisan ’tis strange here and on a foreign soil and in a land that is independent in all but the name for that the north american colonies shall remain dependants on yonder little island for twenty years more i never can think to remember how the nation at home seemed to give itself up to the domination of one or other aristocratic party and took a hanoverian king or a french one according as either prevailed and while the tories the october club gentlemen the high church parsons that held by the church of england were for having a papist king for whom many of their scottish and english leaders firm churchmen all laid down their lives with admirable loyalty and devotion they were governed by men who had notoriously no religion at all but used it as they would use any opinion for the purpose of forwarding their own ambition the whigs on the other hand who professed attachment to religion and liberty too were compelled to send to holland or hanover for a monarch around whom they could rally a strange series of compromises is that english history compromise of principle compromise of party compromise of worship the lovers of english freedom and independence submitted their religious consciences to an act of parliament could not consolidate their liberty without sending to zell or the hague for a king to live under and could not find amongst the proudest people in the world a man speaking their own language and understanding their laws to govern them the tory and high church patriots were ready to die in defence of a papist family that had sold us to france the great whig nobles the sturdy republican recusants who had cut off charles stuart’s head for treason were fain to accept a king whose title came to him through a royal grandmother whose own royal grandmother’s head had fallen under queen bess’s hatchet and our proud english nobles sent to a petty german town for a monarch to come and reign in london and our prelates kissed the ugly hands of his dutch mistresses and thought it no dishonour in england you can but belong to one party or t’other and you take the house you live in with all its encumbrances its retainers its antique discomforts and ruins even you patch up but you never build up anew will we of the new world submit much longer even nominally to this ancient british superstition there are signs of the times which make me think that ere long we shall care as little about king george here and peers temporal and peers spiritual as we do for king canute or the druids  this chapter began about the wits my grandson may say and hath wandered very far from their company the pleasantest of the wits i knew were the doctors garth and arbuthnot and mr gay the author of trivia the most charming kind soul that ever laughed at a joke or cracked a bottle mr prior i saw and he was the earthen pot swimming with the pots of brass down the stream and always and justly frightened lest he should break in the voyage i met him both at london and paris where he was performing piteous congees to the duke of shrewsbury not having courage to support the dignity which his undeniable genius and talent had won him and writing coaxing letters to secretary st john and thinking about his plate and his place and what on earth should become of him should his party go out the famous mr congreve i saw a dozen of times at button’s a splendid wreck of a man magnificently attired and though gouty and almost blind bearing a brave face against fortune  the great mr pope of whose prodigious genius i have no words to express my admiration was quite a puny lad at this time appearing seldom in public places there were hundreds of men wits and pretty fellows frequenting the theatres and coffeehouses of that day—whom nunc prescribere longum est indeed i think the most brilliant of that sort i ever saw was not till fifteen years afterwards when i paid my last visit in england and met young harry fielding son of the fielding that served in spain and afterwards in flanders with us and who for fun and humour seemed to top them all as for the famous dr swift i can say of him “vidi tantum” he was in london all these years up to the death of the queen and in a hundred public places where i saw him but no more he never missed court of a sunday where once or twice he was pointed out to your grandfather he would have sought me out eagerly enough had i been a great man with a title to my name or a star on my coat at court the doctor had no eyes but for the very greatest lord treasurer and st john used to call him jonathan and they paid him with this cheap coin for the service they took of him he writ their lampoons fought their enemies flogged and bullied in their service and it must be owned with a consummate skill and fierceness ’tis said he hath lost his intellect now and forgotten his wrongs and his rage against mankind i have always thought of him and of marlborough as the two greatest men of that age i have read his books who doth not know them here in our calm woods and imagine a giant to myself as i think of him a lonely fallen prometheus groaning as the vulture tears him prometheus i saw but when first i ever had any words with him the giant stepped out of a sedanchair in the poultry whither he had come with a tipsy irish servant parading before him who announced him bawling out his reverence’s name whilst his master below was as yet haggling with the chairman i disliked this mr swift and heard many a story about him of his conduct to men and his words to women he could flatter the great as much as he could bully the weak and mr esmond being younger and hotter in that day than now was determined should he ever meet this dragon not to run away from his teeth and his fire  men have all sorts of motives which carry them onwards in life and are driven into acts of desperation or it may be of distinction from a hundred different causes there was one comrade of esmond’s an honest little irish lieutenant of handyside’s who owed so much money to a camp sutler that he began to make love to the man’s daughter intending to pay his debt that way and at the battle of malplaquet flying away from the debt and lady too he rushed so desperately on the french lines that he got his company and came a captain out of the action and had to marry the sutler’s daughter after all who brought him his cancelled debt to her father as poor rogers’s fortune to run out of the reach of bill and marriage he ran on the enemy’s pikes and as these did not kill him he was thrown back upon t’other horn of his dilemma our great duke at the same battle was fighting not the french but the tories in england and risking his life and the army’s not for his country but for his pay and places and for fear of his wife at home that only being in life whom he dreaded i have asked about men in my own company new drafts of poor country boys were perpetually coming over to us during the wars and brought from the ploughshare to the sword and found that a half of them under the flags were driven thither on account of a woman one fellow was jilted by his mistress and took the shilling in despair another jilted the girl and fled from her and the parish to the tents where the law could not disturb him why go on particularizing what can the sons of adam and eve expect but to continue in that course of love and trouble their father and mother set out on o my grandson i am drawing nigh to the end of that period of my history when i was acquainted with the great world of england and europe my years are past the hebrew poet’s limit and i say unto thee all my troubles and joys too for that matter have come from a woman as thine will when thy destined course begins ’twas a woman that made a soldier of me that set me intriguing afterwards i believe i would have spun smocks for her had she so bidden me what strength i had in my head i would have given her hath not every man in his degree had his omphale and delilah mine befooled me on the banks of the thames and in dear old england thou mayest find thine own by rappahannoc  to please that woman then i tried to distinguish myself as a soldier and afterwards as a wit and a politician as to please another i would have put on a black cassock and a pair of bands and had done so but that a superior fate intervened to defeat that project and i say i think the world is like captain esmond’s company i spoke of anon and could you see every man’s career in life you would find a woman clogging him or clinging round his march and stopping him or cheering him and goading him or beckoning him out of her chariot so that he goes up to her and leaves the race to be run without him or bringing him the apple and saying “eat” or fetching him the daggers and whispering “kill yonder lies duncan and a crown and an opportunity”  your grandfather fought with more effect as a politician than as a wit and having private animosities and grievances of his own and his general’s against the great duke in command of the army and more information on military matters than most writers who had never seen beyond the fire of a tobaccopipe at wills’s he was enabled to do good service for that cause which he embarked in and for mr st john and his party but he disdained the abuse in which some of the tory writers indulged for instance dr swift who actually chose to doubt the duke of marlborough’s courage and was pleased to hint that his grace’s military capacity was doubtful nor were esmond’s performances worse for the effect they were intended to produce though no doubt they could not injure the duke of marlborough nearly so much in the public eyes as the malignant attacks of swift did which were carefully directed so as to blacken and degrade him because they were writ openly and fairly by mr esmond who made no disguise of them who was now out of the army and who never attacked the prodigious courage and talents only the selfishness and rapacity of the chief  the colonel then having writ a paper for one of the tory journals called the postboy a letter upon bouchain that the town talked about for two whole days when the appearance of an italian singer supplied a fresh subject for conversation and having business at the exchange where mrs beatrix wanted a pair of gloves or a fan very likely esmond went to correct his paper and was sitting at the printer’s when the famous dr swift came in his irish fellow with him that used to walk before his chair and bawled out his master’s name with great dignity  mr esmond was waiting for the printer too whose wife had gone to the tavern to fetch him and was meantime engaged in drawing a picture of a soldier on horseback for a dirty little pretty boy of the printer’s wife whom she had left behind her  “i presume you are the editor of the postboy sir” says the doctor in a grating voice that had an irish twang and he looked at the colonel from under his two bushy eyebrows with a pair of very clear blue eyes his complexion was muddy his figure rather fat his chin double he wore a shabby cassock and a shabby hat over his black wig and he pulled out a great gold watch at which he looks very fierce  “i am but a contributor dr swift” says esmond with the little boy still on his knee he was sitting with his back in the window so that the doctor could not see him  “who told you i was dr swift” says the doctor eyeing the other very haughtily  “your reverence’s valet bawled out your name” says the colonel “i should judge you brought him from ireland”  “and pray sir what right have you to judge whether my servant came from ireland or no i want to speak with your employer mr leach i’ll thank ye go fetch him”  “where’s your papa tommy” asks the colonel of the child a smutty little wretch in a frock  instead of answering the child begins to cry the doctor’s appearance had no doubt frightened the poor little imp  “send that squalling little brat about his business and do what i bid ye sir” says the doctor  “i must finish the picture first for tommy” says the colonel laughing “here tommy will you have your pandour with whiskers or without”  “whisters” says tommy quite intent on the picture  “who the devil are ye sir” cries the doctor “are ye a printer’s man or are ye not” he pronounced it like naught  “your reverence needn’t raise the devil to ask who i am” says colonel esmond “did you ever hear of dr faustus little tommy or friar bacon who invented gunpowder and set the thames on fire”  mr swift turned quite red almost purple “i did not intend any offence sir” says he  “i daresay sir you offended without meaning” says the other drily  “who are ye sir do you know who i am sir you are one of the pack of grubstreet scribblers that my friend mr secretary hath laid by the heels how dare ye sir speak to me in this tone” cries the doctor in a great fume  “i beg your honour’s humble pardon if i have offended your honour” says esmond in a tone of great humility “rather than be sent to the compter or be put in the pillory there’s nothing i wouldn’t do but mrs leach the printer’s lady told me to mind tommy whilst she went for her husband to the tavern and i daren’t leave the child lest he should fall into the fire but if your reverence will hold him——”  “i take the little beast” says the doctor starting back “i am engaged to your betters fellow tell mr leach that when he makes an appointment with dr swift he had best keep it do ye hear and keep a respectful tongue in your head sir when you address a person like me”  “i’m but a poor brokendown soldier” says the colonel “and i’ve seen better days though i am forced now to turn my hand to writing we can’t help our fate sir”  “you’re the person that mr leach hath spoken to me of i presume have the goodness to speak civilly when you are spoken to—and tell leach to call at my lodgings in bury street and bring the papers with him tonight at ten o’clock and the next time you see me you’ll know me and be civil mr kemp”  poor kemp who had been a lieutenant at the beginning of the war and fallen into misfortune was the writer of the postboy and now took honest mr leach’s pay in place of her majesty’s esmond had seen this gentleman and a very ingenious hardworking honest fellow he was toiling to give bread to a great family and watching up many a long winter night to keep the wolf from his door and mr st john who had liberty always on his tongue had just sent a dozen of the opposition writers into prison and one actually into the pillory for what he called libels but libels not half so violent as those writ on our side with regard to this very piece of tyranny esmond had remonstrated strongly with the secretary who laughed and said the rascals were served quite right and told esmond a joke of swift’s regarding the matter nay more this irishman when st john was about to pardon a poor wretch condemned to death for rape absolutely prevented the secretary from exercising this act of good nature and boasted that he had had the man hanged and great as the doctor’s genius might be and splendid his ability esmond for one would affect no love for him and never desired to make his acquaintance the doctor was at court every sunday assiduously enough a place the colonel frequented but rarely though he had a great inducement to go there in the person of a fair maid of honour of her majesty’s and the airs and patronage mr swift gave himself forgetting gentlemen of his country whom he knew perfectly his loud talk at once insolent and servile nay perhaps his very intimacy with lord treasurer and the secretary who indulged all his freaks and called him jonathan you may be sure were remarked by many a person of whom the proud priest himself took no note during that time of his vanity and triumph  ’twas but three days after the 15th of november 1712 esmond minds him well of the date that he went by invitation to dine with his general the foot of whose table he used to take on these festive occasions as he had done at many a board hard and plentiful during the campaign this was a great feast and of the latter sort the honest old gentleman loved to treat his friends splendidly his grace of ormonde before he joined his army as generalissimo my lord viscount bolingbroke one of her majesty’s secretaries of state my lord orkney that had served with us abroad being of the party his grace of hamilton master of the ordnance and in whose honour the feast had been given upon his approaching departure as ambassador to paris had sent an excuse to general webb at two o’clock but an hour before the dinner nothing but the most immediate business his grace said should have prevented him having the pleasure of drinking a parting glass to the health of general webb his absence disappointed esmond’s old chief who suffered much from his wounds besides and though the company was grand it was rather gloomy st john came last and brought a friend with him—“i’m sure” says my general bowing very politely “my table hath always a place for dr swift”  mr esmond went up to the doctor with a bow and a smile—“i gave dr swift’s message” says he “to the printer i hope he brought your pamphlet to your lodgings in time” indeed poor leach had come to his house very soon after the doctor left it being brought away rather tipsy from the tavern by his thrifty wife and he talked of cousin swift in a maudlin way though of course mr esmond did not allude to this relationship the doctor scowled blushed and was much confused and said scarce a word during the whole of dinner a very little stone will sometimes knock down these goliaths of wit and this one was often discomfited when met by a man of any spirit he took his place sulkily put water in his wine that the others drank plentifully and scarce said a word  the talk was about the affairs of the day or rather about persons than affairs my lady marlborough’s fury her daughters in old clothes and mobcaps looking out from their windows and seeing the company pass to the drawingroom the gentlemanusher’s horror when the prince of savoy was introduced to her majesty in a tiewig no man out of a fullbottomed periwig ever having kissed the royal hand before about the mohawks and the damage they were doing rushing through the town killing and murdering some one said the illomened face of mohun had been seen at the theatre the night before and macartney and meredith with him meant to be a feast the meeting in spite of drink and talk was as dismal as a funeral every topic started subsided into gloom his grace of ormonde went away because the conversation got upon denain where we had been defeated in the last campaign esmond’s general was affected at the allusion to this action too for his comrade of wynendael the count of nassauwoudenberg had been slain there mr swift when esmond pledged him said he drank no wine and took his hat from the peg and went away beckoning my lord bolingbroke to follow him but the other bade him take his chariot and save his coachhire he had to speak with colonel esmond and when the rest of the company withdrew to cards these two remained behind in the dark  bolingbroke always spoke freely when he had drunk freely his enemies could get any secret out of him in that condition women were even employed to ply him and take his words down i have heard that my lord stair three years after when the secretary fled to france and became the pretender’s minister got all the information he wanted by putting female spies over st john in his cups he spoke freely now—“jonathan knows nothing of this for certain though he suspects it and by george webb will take an archbishopric and jonathan a—no damme—jonathan will take an archbishopric from james i warrant me gladly enough your duke hath the string of the whole matter in his hand” the secretary went on “we have that which will force marlborough to keep his distance and he goes out of london in a fortnight prior hath his business he left me this morning and mark me harry should fate carry off our august our beloved our most gouty and plethoric queen and defender of the faith la bonne cause triomphera a la santé de la bonne cause everything good comes from france wine comes from france give us another bumper to the bonne cause” we drank it together  “will the bonne cause turn protestant” asked mr esmond  “no hang it” says the other “he’ll defend our faith as in duty bound but he’ll stick by his own the hind and the panther shall run in the same car by jove righteousness and peace shall kiss each other and we’ll have father massillon to walk down the aisle of st paul’s cheek by jowl with dr sacheverel give us more wine here’s a health to the bonne cause kneeling—damme let’s drink it kneeling” he was quite flushed and wild with wine as he was talking  “and suppose” says esmond who always had this gloomy apprehension “the bonne cause should give us up to the french as his father and uncle did before him”  “give us up to the french” starts up bolingbroke “is there any english gentleman that fears that you who have seen blenheim and ramillies afraid of the french your ancestors and mine and brave old webb’s yonder have met them in a hundred fields and our children will be ready to do the like who’s he that wishes for more men from england my cousin westmoreland give us up to the french pshaw”  “his uncle did” says mr esmond  “and what happened to his grandfather” broke out st john filling out another bumper “here’s to the greatest monarch england ever saw here’s to the englishman that made a kingdom of her our great king came from huntingdon not hanover our fathers didn’t look for a dutchman to rule us let him come and we’ll keep him and we’ll show him whitehall if he’s a traitor let us have him here to deal with him and then there are spirits here as great as any that have gone before there are men here that can look at danger in the face and not be frightened at it traitor treason what names are these to scare you and me are all oliver’s men dead or his glorious name forgotten in fifty years are there no men equal to him think you as good—aye as good god save the king and if the monarchy fails us god save the british republic”  he filled another great bumper and tossed it up and drained it wildly just as the noise of rapid carriagewheels approaching was stopped at our door and after a hurried knock and a moment’s interval mr swift came into the hall ran upstairs to the room we were dining in and entered it with a perturbed face st john excited with drink was making some wild quotation out of macbeth but swift stopped him  “drink no more my lord for god’s sake” says he “i come with the most dreadful news”  “is the queen dead” cries out bolingbroke seizing on a waterglass  “no duke hamilton is dead he was murdered an hour ago by mohun and macartney they had a quarrel this morning they gave him not so much time as to write a letter he went for a couple of his friends and he is dead and mohun too the bloody villain who was set on him they fought in hyde park just before sunset the duke killed mohun and macartney came up and stabbed him and the dog is fled i have your chariot below send to every part of the country and apprehend that villain come to the duke’s house and see if any life be left in him”  “o beatrix beatrix” thought esmond “and here ends my poor girl’s ambition”    chapter vi poor beatrix   there had been no need to urge upon esmond the necessity of a separation between him and beatrix fate had done that completely and i think from the very moment poor beatrix had accepted the duke’s offer she began to assume the majestic air of a duchess nay queen elect and to carry herself as one sacred and removed from us common people her mother and kinsman both fell into her ways the latter scornfully perhaps and uttering his usual gibes at her vanity and his own there was a certain charm about this girl of which neither colonel esmond nor his fond mistress could forgo the fascination in spite of her faults and her pride and wilfulness they were forced to love her and indeed might be set down as the two chief flatterers of the brilliant creature’s court  who in the course of his life hath not been so bewitched and worshipped some idol or another years after this passion hath been dead and buried along with a thousand other worldly cares and ambitions he who felt it can recall it out of its grave and admire almost as fondly as he did in his youth that lovely queenly creature i invoke that beautiful spirit from the shades and love her still or rather i should say such a past is always present to a man such a passion once felt forms a part of his whole being and cannot be separated from it it becomes a portion of the man of today just as any great faith or conviction the discovery of poetry the awakening of religion ever afterward influence him just as the wound i had at blenheim and of which i wear the scar hath become part of my frame and influenced my whole body nay spirit subsequently though ’twas got and healed forty years ago parting and forgetting what faithful heart can do these our great thoughts our great affections the truths of our life never leave us surely they cannot separate from our consciousness shall follow it whithersoever that shall go and are of their nature divine and immortal  with the horrible news of this catastrophe which was confirmed by the weeping domestics at the duke’s own door esmond rode homewards as quick as his lazy coach would carry him devising all the time how he should break the intelligence to the person most concerned in it and if a satire upon human vanity could be needed that poor soul afforded it in the altered company and occupations in which esmond found her for days before her chariot had been rolling the street from mercer to toyshop—from goldsmith to laceman her taste was perfect or at least the fond bridegroom had thought so and had given entire authority over all tradesmen and for all the plate furniture and equipages with which his grace the ambassador wished to adorn his splendid mission she must have her picture by kneller a duchess not being complete without a portrait and a noble one he made and actually sketched in on a cushion a coronet which she was about to wear she vowed she would wear it at king james the third’s coronation and never a princess in the land would have become ermine better esmond found the antechamber crowded with milliners and toyshop women obsequious goldsmiths with jewels salvers and tankards and mercer’s men with hangings and velvets and brocades my lady duchess elect was giving audience to one famous silversmith from exeter “change” who brought with him a great chased salver of which he was pointing out the beauties as colonel esmond entered “come” says she “cousin and admire the taste of this pretty thing” i think mars and venus were lying in the golden bower that one gilt cupid carried off the wargod’s casque—another his sword—another his great buckler upon which my lord duke hamilton’s arms with ours were to be engraved—and a fourth was kneeling down to the reclining goddess with the ducal coronet in his hands god help us the next time mr esmond saw that piece of plate the arms were changed the ducal coronet had been replaced by a viscount’s it formed part of the fortune of the thrifty goldsmith’s own daughter when she married my lord viscount squanderfield two years after  “isn’t this a beautiful piece” says beatrix examining it and she pointed out the arch graces of the cupids and the fine carving of the languid prostrate mars esmond sickened as he thought of the warrior dead in his chamber his servants and children weeping around him and of this smiling creature attiring herself as it were for that nuptial deathbed “’tis a pretty piece of vanity” says he looking gloomily at the beautiful creature there were flambeaux in the room lighting up the brilliant mistress of it she lifted up the great gold salver with her fair arms  “vanity” says she haughtily “what is vanity in you sir is propriety in me you ask a jewish price for it mr graves but have it i will if only to spite mr esmond”  “o beatrix lay it down” says mr esmond “herodias you know not what you carry in the charger”  she dropped it with a clang the eager goldsmith running to seize his fallen ware the lady’s face caught the fright from esmond’s pale countenance and her eyes shone out like beacons of alarm—“what is it henry” says she running to him and seizing both his hands “what do you mean by your pale face and gloomy tones”  “come away come away” says esmond leading her she clung frightened to him and he supported her upon his heart bidding the scared goldsmith leave them the man went into the next apartment staring with surprise and hugging his precious charger  “o my beatrix my sister” says esmond still holding in his arms the pallid and affrighted creature “you have the greatest courage of any woman in the world prepare to show it now for you have a dreadful trial to bear”  she sprang away from the friend who would have protected her—“hath he left me” says she “we had words this morning he was very gloomy and i angered him but he dared not he dared not” as she spoke a burning blush flushed over her whole face and bosom esmond saw it reflected in the glass by which she stood with clenched hands pressing her swelling heart  “he has left you” says esmond wondering that rage rather than sorrow was in her looks  “and he is alive” cries beatrix “and you bring me this commission he has left me and you haven’t dared to avenge me you that pretend to be the champion of our house have let me suffer this insult where is castlewood i will go to my brother”  “the duke is not alive beatrix” said esmond  she looked at her cousin wildly and fell back to the wall as though shot in the breast—“and you come here and—and—you killed him”  “no thank heaven” her kinsman said “the blood of that noble heart doth not stain my sword in its last hour it was faithful to thee beatrix esmond vain and cruel woman kneel and thank the awful heaven which awards life and death and chastises pride that the noble hamilton died true to you at least that ’twas not your quarrel or your pride or your wicked vanity that drove him to his fate he died by the bloody sword which already had drank your own father’s blood o woman o sister to that sad field where two corpses are lying—for the murderer died too by the hand of the man he slew—can you bring no mourners but your revenge and your vanity god help and pardon thee beatrix as he brings this awful punishment to your hard and rebellious heart”  esmond had scarce done speaking when his mistress came in the colloquy between him and beatrix had lasted but a few minutes during which time esmond’s servant had carried the disastrous news through the household the army of vanity fair waiting without gathered up all their fripperies and fled aghast tender lady castlewood had been in talk above with dean atterbury the pious creature’s almoner and director and the dean had entered with her as a physician whose place was at a sickbed beatrix’s mother looked at esmond and ran towards her daughter with a pale face and open heart and hands all kindness and pity but beatrix passed her by nor would she have any of the medicaments of the spiritual physician “i am best in my own room and by myself” she said her eyes were quite dry nor did esmond ever see them otherwise save once in respect to that grief she gave him a cold hand as she went out “thank you brother” she said in a low voice and with a simplicity more touching than tears “all you have said is true and kind and i will go away and ask pardon” the three others remained behind and talked over the dreadful story it affected dr atterbury more even than us as it seemed the death of mohun her husband’s murderer was more awful to my mistress than even the duke’s unhappy end esmond gave at length what particulars he knew of their quarrel and the cause of it the two noblemen had long been at war with respect to the lord gerard’s property whose two daughters my lord duke and mohun had married they had met by appointment that day at the lawyer’s in lincoln’s inn fields had words which though they appeared very trifling to those who heard them were not so to men exasperated by long and previous enmity mohun asked my lord duke where he could see his grace’s friends and within an hour had sent two of his own to arrange this deadly duel it was pursued with such fierceness and sprung from so trifling a cause that all men agreed at the time that there was a party of which these three notorious brawlers were but agents who desired to take duke hamilton’s life away they fought three on a side as in that tragic meeting twelve years back which hath been recounted already and in which mohun performed his second murder they rushed in and closed upon each other at once without any feints or crossing of swords even and stabbed one at the other desperately each receiving many wounds and mohun having his deathwound and my lord duke lying by him macartney came up and stabbed his grace as he lay on the ground and gave him the blow of which he died colonel macartney denied this of which the horror and indignation of the whole kingdom would nevertheless have him guilty and fled the country whither he never returned  what was the real cause of the duke hamilton’s death—a paltry quarrel that might easily have been made up and with a ruffian so low base profligate and degraded with former crimes and repeated murders that a man of such a renown and princely rank as my lord duke might have disdained to sully his sword with the blood of such a villain but his spirit was so high that those who wished his death knew that his courage was like his charity and never turned any man away and he died by the hands of mohun and the other two cutthroats that were set on him the queen’s ambassador to paris died the loyal and devoted servant of the house of stuart and a royal prince of scotland himself and carrying the confidence the repentance of queen anne along with his own open devotion and the goodwill of millions in the country more to the queen’s exiled brother and sovereign  that party to which lord mohun belonged had the benefit of his service and now were well rid of such a ruffian he and meredith and macartney were the duke of marlborough’s men and the two colonels had been broke but the year before for drinking perdition to the tories his grace was a whig now and a hanoverian and as eager for war as prince eugene himself i say not that he was privy to duke hamilton’s death i say that his party profited by it and that three desperate and bloody instruments were found to effect that murder  as esmond and the dean walked away from kensington discoursing of this tragedy and how fatal it was to the cause which they both had at heart the streetcriers were already out with their broadsides shouting through the town the full true and horrible account of the death of lord mohun and duke hamilton in a duel a fellow had got to kensington and was crying it in the square there at very early morning when mr esmond happened to pass by he drove the man from under beatrix’s very window whereof the casement had been set open the sun was shining though ’twas november he had seen the marketcarts rolling into london the guard relieved at the palace the labourers trudging to their work in the gardens between kensington and the city—the wandering merchants and hawkers filling the air with their cries the world was going to its business again although dukes lay dead and ladies mourned for them and kings very likely lost their chances so night and day pass away and tomorrow comes and our place knows us not esmond thought of the courier now galloping on the north road to inform him who was earl of arran yesterday that he was duke of hamilton today and of a thousand great schemes hopes ambitions that were alive in the gallant heart beating a few hours since and now in a little dust quiescent    chapter vii i visit castlewood once more   thus for a third time beatrix’s ambitious hopes were circumvented and she might well believe that a special malignant fate watched and pursued her tearing her prize out of her hand just as she seemed to grasp it and leaving her with only rage and grief for her portion whatever her feelings might have been of anger or of sorrow and i fear me that the former emotion was that which most tore her heart she would take no confidant as people of softer natures would have done under such a calamity her mother and her kinsman knew that she would disdain their pity and that to offer it would be but to infuriate the cruel wound which fortune had inflicted we knew that her pride was awfully humbled and punished by this sudden and terrible blow she wanted no teaching of ours to point out the sad moral of her story her fond mother could give but her prayers and her kinsman his faithful friendship and patience to the unhappy stricken creature and it was only by hints and a word or two uttered months afterwards that beatrix showed she understood their silent commiseration and on her part was secretly thankful for their forbearance the people about the court said there was that in her manner which frightened away scoffing and condolence she was above their triumph and their pity and acted her part in that dreadful tragedy greatly and courageously so that those who liked her least were yet forced to admire her we who watched her after her disaster could not but respect the indomitable courage and majestic calm with which she bore it “i would rather see her tears than her pride” her mother said who was accustomed to bear her sorrows in a very different way and to receive them as the stroke of god with an awful submission and meekness but beatrix’s nature was different to that tender parent’s she seemed to accept her grief and to defy it nor would she allow it i believe not even in private and in her own chamber to extort from her the confession of even a tear of humiliation or a cry of pain friends and children of our race who come after me in which way will you bear your trials i know one that prays god will give you love rather than pride and that the eye allseeing shall find you in the humble place not that we should judge proud spirits otherwise than charitably ’tis nature hath fashioned some for ambition and dominion as it hath formed others for obedience and gentle submission the leopard follows his nature as the lamb does and acts after leopard law she can neither help her beauty nor her courage nor her cruelty nor a single spot on her shining coat nor the conquering spirit which impels her nor the shot which brings her down                      during that wellfounded panic the whigs had lest the queen should forsake their hanoverian prince bound by oaths and treaties as she was to him and recall her brother who was allied to her by yet stronger ties of nature and duty the prince of savoy and the boldest of that party of the whigs were for bringing the young duke of cambridge over in spite of the queen and the outcry of her tory servants arguing that the electoral prince a peer and prince of the bloodroyal of this realm too and in the line of succession to the crown had a right to sit in the parliament whereof he was a member and to dwell in the country which he one day was to govern nothing but the strongest ill will expressed by the queen and the people about her and menaces of the royal resentment should this scheme be persisted in prevented it from being carried into effect  the boldest on our side were in like manner for having our prince into the country the undoubted inheritor of the right divine the feelings of more than half the nation of almost all the clergy of the gentry of england and scotland with him entirely innocent of the crime for which his father suffered—brave young handsome unfortunate—who in england would dare to molest the prince should he come among us and fling himself upon british generosity hospitality and honour an invader with an army of frenchmen behind him englishmen of spirit would resist to the death and drive back to the shores whence he came but a prince alone armed with his right only and relying on the loyalty of his people was sure many of his friends argued of welcome at least of safety among us the hand of his sister the queen of the people his subjects never could be raised to do him a wrong but the queen was timid by nature and the successive ministers she had had private causes for their irresolution the bolder and honester men who had at heart the illustrious young exile’s cause had no scheme of interest of their own to prevent them from seeing the right done and provided only he came as an englishman were ready to venture their all to welcome and defend him  st john and harley both had kind words in plenty for the prince’s adherents and gave him endless promises of future support but hints and promises were all they could be got to give and some of his friends were for measures much bolder more efficacious and more open with a party of these some of whom are yet alive and some whose names mr esmond has no right to mention he found himself engaged the year after that miserable death of duke hamilton which deprived the prince of his most courageous ally in this country dean atterbury was one of the friends whom esmond may mention as the brave bishop is now beyond exile and persecution and to him and one or two more the colonel opened himself of a scheme of his own that backed by a little resolution on the prince’s part could not fail of bringing about the accomplishment of their dearest wishes  my young lord viscount castlewood had not come to england to keep his majority and had now been absent from the country for several years the year when his sister was to be married and duke hamilton died my lord was kept at bruxelles by his wife’s lyingin the gentle clotilda could not bear her husband out of her sight perhaps she mistrusted the young scapegrace should he ever get loose from her leadingstrings and she kept him by her side to nurse the baby and administer posset to the gossips many a laugh poor beatrix had had about frank’s uxoriousness his mother would have gone to clotilda when her time was coming but that the motherinlaw was already in possession and the negotiations for poor beatrix’s marriage were begun a few months after the horrid catastrophe in hyde park my mistress and her daughter retired to castlewood where my lord it was expected would soon join them but to say truth their quiet household was little to his taste he could be got to come to walcote but once after his first campaign and then the young rogue spent more than half his time in london not appearing at court or in public under his own name and title but frequenting plays bagnios and the very worst company under the name of captain esmond whereby his innocent kinsman got more than once into trouble and so under various pretexts and in pursuit of all sorts of pleasures until he plunged into the lawful one of marriage frank castlewood had remained away from this country and was unknown save amongst the gentlemen of the army with whom he had served abroad the fond heart of his mother was pained by this long absence ’twas all that henry esmond could do to soothe her natural mortification and find excuses for his kinsman’s levity  in the autumn of the year 1713 lord castlewood thought of returning home his first child had been a daughter clotilda was in the way of gratifying his lordship with a second and the pious youth thought that by bringing his wife to his ancestral home by prayers to st philip of castlewood and what not heaven might be induced to bless him with a son this time for whose coming the expectant mamma was very anxious  the longdebated peace had been proclaimed this year at the end of march and france was open to us just as frank’s poor mother had made all things ready for lord castlewood’s reception and was eagerly expecting her son it was by colonel esmond’s means that the kind lady was disappointed of her longing and obliged to defer once more the darling hope of her heart  esmond took horses to castlewood he had not seen its ancient grey towers and wellremembered woods for nearly fourteen years and since he rode thence with my lord to whom his mistress with her young children by her side waved an adieu what ages seem to have passed since then what years of action and passion of care love hope disaster the children were grown up now and had stories of their own as for esmond he felt to be a hundred years old his dear mistress only seemed unchanged she looked and welcomed him quite as of old there was the fountain in the court babbling its familiar music the old hall and its furniture the carved chair my late lord used the very flagon he drank from esmond’s mistress knew he would like to sleep in the little room he used to occupy ’twas made ready for him and wallflowers and sweet herbs set in the adjoining chamber the chaplain’s room  in tears of not unmanly emotion with prayers of submission to the awful dispenser of death and life of good and evil fortune mr esmond passed a part of that first night at castlewood lying awake for many hours as the clock kept tolling in tones so well remembered looking back as all men will that revisit their home of childhood over the great gulf of time and surveying himself on the distant bank yonder a sad little melancholy boy with his lord still alive—his dear mistress a girl yet her children sporting around her years ago a boy on that very bed when she had blessed him and called him her knight he had made a vow to be faithful and never desert her dear service had he kept that fond boyish promise yes before heaven yes praise be to god his life had been hers his blood his fortune his name his whole heart ever since had been hers and her children’s all night long he was dreaming his boyhood over again and waking fitfully he half fancied he heard father holt calling to him from the next chamber and that he was coming in and out from the mysterious window  esmond rose up before the dawn passed into the next room where the air was heavy with the odour of the wallflowers looked into the brasier where the papers had been burnt into the old presses where holt’s books and papers had been kept and tried the spring and whether the window worked still the spring had not been touched for years but yielded at length and the whole fabric of the window sank down he lifted it and it relapsed into its frame no one had ever passed thence since holt used it sixteen years ago  esmond remembered his poor lord saying on the last day of his life that holt used to come in and out of the house like a ghost and knew that the father liked these mysteries and practised such secret disguises entrances and exits this was the way the ghost came and went his pupil had always conjectured esmond closed the casement up again as the dawn was rising over castlewood village he could hear the clinking at the blacksmith’s forge yonder among the trees across the green and past the river on which a mist still lay sleeping  next esmond opened that long cupboard over the woodwork of the mantelpiece big enough to hold a man and in which mr holt used to keep sundry secret properties of his the two swords he remembered so well as a boy lay actually there still and esmond took them out and wiped them with a strange curiosity of emotion there were a bundle of papers here too which no doubt had been left at holt’s last visit to the place in my lord viscount’s life that very day when the priest had been arrested and taken to hexham castle esmond made free with these papers and found treasonable matter of king william’s reign the names of charnock and perkins sir john fenwick and sir john friend rookwood and lodwick lords montgomery and ailesbury clarendon and yarmouth that had all been engaged in plots against the usurper a letter from the duke of berwick too and one from the king at st germains offering to confer upon his trusty and wellbeloved francis viscount castlewood the titles of earl and marquis of esmond bestowed by patent royal and in the fourth year of his reign upon thomas viscount castlewood and the heirs male of his body in default of which issue the ranks and dignities were to pass to francis aforesaid  this was the paper whereof my lord had spoken which holt showed him the very day he was arrested and for an answer to which he would come back in a week’s time i put these papers hastily into the crypt whence i had taken them being interrupted by a tapping of a light finger at the ring of the chamberdoor ’twas my kind mistress with her face full of love and welcome she too had passed the night wakefully no doubt but neither asked the other how the hours had been spent there are things we divine without speaking and know though they happen out of our sight this fond lady hath told me that she knew both days when i was wounded abroad who shall say how far sympathy reaches and how truly love can prophesy “i looked into your room” was all she said “the bed was vacant the little old bed i knew i should find you here” and tender and blushing faintly with a benediction in her eyes the gentle creature kissed him  they walked out handinhand through the old court and to the terracewalk where the grass was glistening with dew and the birds in the green woods above were singing their delicious choruses under the blushing morning sky how well all things were remembered the ancient towers and gables of the hall darkling against the east the purple shadows on the green slopes the quaint devices and carvings of the dial the forestcrowned heights the fair yellow plain cheerful with crops and corn the shining river rolling through it towards the pearly hills beyond all these were before us along with a thousand beautiful memories of our youth beautiful and sad but as real and vivid in our minds as that fair and alwaysremembered scene our eyes beheld once more we forget nothing the memory sleeps but awakens again i often think how it shall be when after the last sleep of death the réveillé shall arouse us for ever and the past in one flash of selfconsciousness rush back like the soul revivified  the house would not be up for some hours yet it was july and the dawn was only just awake and here esmond opened himself to his mistress of the business he had in hand and what part frank was to play in it he knew he could confide anything to her and that the fond soul would die rather than reveal it and bidding her keep the secret from all he laid it entirely before his mistress always as stanch a little loyalist as any in the kingdom and indeed was quite sure that any plan of his was secure of her applause and sympathy never was such a glorious scheme to her partial mind never such a devoted knight to execute it an hour or two may have passed whilst they were having their colloquy beatrix came out to them just as their talk was over her tall beautiful form robed in sable which she wore without ostentation ever since last year’s catastrophe sweeping over the green terrace and casting its shadows before her across the grass  she made us one of her grand curtsies smiling and called us “the young people” she was older paler and more majestic than in the year before her mother seemed the youngest of the two she never once spoke of her grief lady castlewood told esmond or alluded save by a quiet word or two to the death of her hopes  when beatrix came back to castlewood she took to visiting all the cottages and all the sick she set up a school of children and taught singing to some of them we had a pair of beautiful old organs in castlewood church on which she played admirably so that the music there became to be known in the country for many miles round and no doubt people came to see the fair organist as well as to hear her parson tusher and his wife were established at the vicarage but his wife had brought him no children wherewith tom might meet his enemies at the gate honest tom took care not to have many such his great shovelhat was in his hand for everybody he was profuse of bows and compliments he behaved to esmond as if the colonel had been a commanderinchief he dined at the hall that day being sunday and would not partake of pudding except under extreme pressure he deplored my lord’s perversion but drank his lordship’s health very devoutly and an hour before at church sent the colonel to sleep with a long learned and refreshing sermon  esmond’s visit home was but for two days the business he had in hand calling him away and out of the country ere he went he saw beatrix but once alone and then she summoned him out of the long tapestry room where he and his mistress were sitting quite as in old times into the adjoining chamber that had been viscountess isabel’s sleepingapartment and where esmond perfectly well remembered seeing the old lady sitting up in the bed in her nightrail that morning when the troop of guard came to fetch her the most beautiful woman in england lay in that bed now whereof the great damask hangings were scarce faded since esmond saw them last  here stood beatrix in her black robes holding a box in her hand ’twas that which esmond had given her before her marriage stamped with a coronet which the disappointed girl was never to wear and containing his aunt’s legacy of diamonds  “you had best take these with you harry” says she “i have no need of diamonds any more” there was not the least token of emotion in her quiet low voice she held out the black shagreencase with her fair arm that did not shake in the least esmond saw she wore a black velvet bracelet on it with my lord duke’s picture in enamel he had given it her but three days before he fell  esmond said the stones were his no longer and strove to turn off that proffered restoration with a laugh “of what good” says he “are they to me the diamond loop to his hat did not set off prince eugene and will not make my yellow face look any handsomer”  “you will give them to your wife cousin” says she “my cousin your wife has a lovely complexion and shape”  “beatrix” esmond burst out the old fire flaming out as it would at times “will you wear those trinkets at your marriage you whispered once you did not know me you know me better now how i sought what i have sighed for for ten years what forgone”  “a price for your constancy my lord” says she “such a preux chevalier wants to be paid oh fie cousin”  “again” esmond spoke out “if i do something you have at heart something worthy of me and you something that shall make me a name with which to endow you will you take it there was a chance for me once you said is it impossible to recall it never shake your head but hear me say you will hear me a year hence if i come back to you and bring you fame will that please you if i do what you desire most—what he who is dead desired most—will that soften you”  “what is it henry” says she her face lighting up “what mean you”  “ask no questions” he said “wait and give me but time if i bring back that you long for that i have a thousand times heard you pray for will you have no reward for him who has done you that service put away those trinkets keep them it shall not be at my marriage it shall not be at yours but if man can do it i swear a day shall come when there shall be a feast in your house and you shall be proud to wear them i say no more now put aside these words and lock away yonder box until the day when i shall remind you of both all i pray of you now is to wait and to remember”  “you are going out of the country” says beatrix in some agitation  “yes tomorrow” says esmond  “to lorraine cousin” says beatrix laying her hand on his arm ’twas the hand on which she wore the duke’s bracelet “stay harry” continued she with a tone that had more despondency in it than she was accustomed to show “hear a last word i do love you i do admire you—who would not that has known such love as yours has been for us all but i think i have no heart at least i have never seen the man that could touch it and had i found him i would have followed him in rags had he been a private soldier or to sea like one of those buccaneers you used to read to us about when we were children i would do anything for such a man bear anything for him but i never found one you were ever too much of a slave to win my heart even my lord duke could not command it i had not been happy had i married him i knew that three months after our engagement—and was too vain to break it o harry i cried once or twice not for him but with tears of rage because i could not be sorry for him i was frightened to find i was glad of his death and were i joined to you i should have the same sense of servitude the same longing to escape we should both be unhappy and you the most who are as jealous as the duke was himself i tried to love him i tried indeed i did affected gladness when he came submitted to hear when he was by me and tried the wife’s part i thought i was to play for the rest of my days but half an hour of that complaisance wearied me and what would a lifetime be my thoughts were away when he was speaking and i was thinking oh that this man would drop my hand and rise up from before my feet i knew his great and noble qualities greater and nobler than mine a thousand times as yours are cousin i tell you a million and a million times better but ’twas not for these i took him i took him to have a great place in the world and i lost it i lost it and do not deplore him—and i often thought as i listened to his fond vows and ardent words oh if i yield to this man and meet the other i shall hate him and leave him i am not good harry my mother is gentle and good like an angel i wonder how she should have had such a child she is weak but she would die rather than do a wrong i am stronger than she but i would do it out of defiance i do not care for what the parsons tell me with their droning sermons i used to see them at court as mean and as worthless as the meanest woman there oh i am sick and weary of the world i wait but for one thing and when ’tis done i will take frank’s religion and your poor mother’s and go into a nunnery and end like her shall i wear the diamonds then—they say the nuns wear their best trinkets the day they take the veil i will put them away as you bid me farewell cousin mamma is pacing the next room racking her little head to know what we have been saying she is jealous all women are i sometimes think that is the only womanly quality i have”  “farewell farewell brother” she gave him her cheek as a brotherly privilege the cheek was as cold as marble  esmond’s mistress showed no signs of jealousy when he returned to the room where she was she had schooled herself so as to look quite inscrutably when she had a mind amongst her other feminine qualities she had that of being a perfect dissembler  he rid away from castlewood to attempt the task he was bound on and stand or fall by it in truth his state of mind was such that he was eager for some outward excitement to counteract that gnawing malady which he was inwardly enduring    chapter viii i travel to france and bring home a portrait of rigaud   mr esmond did not think fit to take leave at court or to inform all the world of pall mall and the coffeehouses that he was about to quit england and chose to depart in the most private manner possible he procured a pass as for a frenchman through dr atterbury who did that business for him getting the signature even from lord bolingbroke’s office without any personal application to the secretary lockwood his faithful servant he took with him to castlewood and left behind there giving out ere he left london that he himself was sick and gone to hampshire for country air and so departed as silently as might be upon his business  as frank castlewood’s aid was indispensable for mr esmond’s scheme his first visit was to bruxelles passing by way of antwerp where the duke of marlborough was in exile and in the firstnamed place harry found his dear young benedict the married man who appeared to be rather out of humour with his matrimonial chain and clogged with the obstinate embraces which clotilda kept round his neck colonel esmond was not presented to her but monsieur simon was a gentleman of the royal cravat esmond bethought him of the regiment of his honest irishman whom he had seen that day after malplaquet when he first set eyes on the young king and monsieur simon was introduced to the viscountess castlewood née comptesse wertheim to the numerous counts the lady clotilda’s tall brothers to her father the chamberlain and to the lady his wife frank’s motherinlaw a tall and majestic person of large proportions such as became the mother of such a company of grenadiers as her warlike sons formed the whole race were at free quarters in the little castle nigh to bruxelles which frank had taken rode his horses drank his wine and lived easily at the poor lad’s charges mr esmond had always maintained a perfect fluency in the french which was his mother tongue and if this family that spoke french with the twang which the flemings use discovered any inaccuracy in mr simon’s pronunciation ’twas to be attributed to the latter’s long residence in england where he had married and remained ever since he was taken prisoner at blenheim his story was perfectly pat there were none there to doubt it save honest frank and he was charmed with his kinsman’s scheme when he became acquainted with it and in truth always admired colonel esmond with an affectionate fidelity and thought his cousin the wisest and best of all cousins and men frank entered heart and soul into the plan and liked it the better as it was to take him to paris out of reach of his brothers his father and his motherinlaw whose attentions rather fatigued him  castlewood i have said was born in the same year as the prince of wales had not a little of the prince’s air height and figure and especially since he had seen the chevalier de st george on the occasion before named took no small pride in his resemblance to a person so illustrious which likeness he increased by all the means in his power wearing fair brown periwigs such as the prince wore and ribbons and so forth of the chevalier’s colour this resemblance was in truth the circumstance on which mr esmond’s scheme was founded and having secured frank’s secrecy and enthusiasm he left him to continue his journey and see the other personages on whom its success depended the place whither mr simon next travelled was bar in lorraine where that merchant arrived with a consignment of broadcloths valuable laces from malines and letters for his correspondent there  would you know how a prince heroic from misfortunes and descended from a line of kings whose race seemed to be doomed like the atridae of old—would you know how he was employed when the envoy who came to him through danger and difficulty beheld him for the first time the young king in a flannel jacket was at tennis with the gentlemen of his suite crying out after the balls and swearing like the meanest of his subjects the next time mr esmond saw him ’twas when monsieur simon took a packet of laces to miss oglethorpe the prince’s antechamber in those days at which ignoble door men were forced to knock for admission to his majesty the admission was given the envoy found the king and the mistress together the pair were at cards and his majesty was in liquor he cared more for three honours than three kingdoms and a halfdozen glasses of ratafia made him forget all his woes and his losses his father’s crown and his grandfather’s head  mr esmond did not open himself to the prince then his majesty was scarce in a condition to hear him and he doubted whether a king who drank so much could keep a secret in his fuddled head or whether a hand that shook so was strong enough to grasp at a crown however at last and after taking counsel with the prince’s advisers amongst whom were many gentlemen honest and faithful esmond’s plan was laid before the king and her actual majesty queen oglethorpe in council the prince liked the scheme well enough ’twas easy and daring and suited to his reckless gaiety and lively youthful spirit in the morning after he had slept his wine off he was very gay lively and agreeable his manner had an extreme charm of archness and a kind simplicity and to do her justice her oglethorpean majesty was kind acute resolute and of good counsel she gave the prince much good advice that he was too weak to follow and loved him with a fidelity which he returned with an ingratitude quite royal  having his own forebodings regarding his scheme should it ever be fulfilled and his usual sceptic doubts as to the benefit which might accrue to the country by bringing a tipsy young monarch back to it colonel esmond had his audience of leave and quiet monsieur simon took his departure at any rate the youth at bar was as good as the older pretender at hanover if the worst came to the worst the englishman could be dealt with as easy as the german monsieur simon trotted on that long journey from nancy to paris and saw that famous town stealthily and like a spy as in truth he was and where sure more magnificence and more misery is heaped together more rags and lace more filth and gilding than in any city in this world here he was put in communication with the king’s best friend his halfbrother the famous duke of berwick esmond recognized him as the stranger who had visited castlewood now near twenty years ago his grace opened to him when he found that mr esmond was one of webb’s brave regiment that had once been his grace’s own he was the sword and buckler indeed of the stuart cause there was no stain on his shield except the bar across it which marlborough’s sister left him had berwick been his father’s heir james the third had assuredly sat on the english throne he could dare endure strike speak be silent the fire and genius perhaps he had not that were given to baser men but except these he had some of the best qualities of a leader his grace knew esmond’s father and history and hinted at the latter in such a way as made the colonel to think he was aware of the particulars of that story but esmond did not choose to enter on it nor did the duke press him mr esmond said “no doubt he should come by his name if ever greater people came by theirs”  what confirmed esmond in his notion that the duke of berwick knew of his case was that when the colonel went to pay his duty at st germains her majesty once addressed him by the title of marquis he took the queen the dutiful remembrances of her goddaughter and the lady whom in the days of her prosperity her majesty had befriended the queen remembered rachel esmond perfectly well had heard of my lord castlewood’s conversion and was much edified by that act of heaven in his favour she knew that others of that family had been of the only true church too “your father and your mother monsieur le marquis” her majesty said that was the only time she used the phrase monsieur simon bowed very low and said he had found other parents than his own who had taught him differently but these had only one king on which her majesty was pleased to give him a medal blessed by the pope which had been found very efficacious in cases similar to his own and to promise she would offer up prayers for his conversion and that of the family which no doubt this pious lady did though up to the present moment and after twentyseven years colonel esmond is bound to say that neither the medal nor the prayers have had the slightest known effect upon his religious convictions  as for the splendour of versailles monsieur simon the merchant only beheld them as a humble and distant spectator seeing the old king but once when he went to feed his carps and asking for no presentation at his majesty’s court  by this time my lord viscount castlewood was got to paris where as the london prints presently announced her ladyship was brought to bed of a son and heir for a long while afterwards she was in a delicate state of health and ordered by the physicians not to travel otherwise ’twas well known that the viscount castlewood proposed returning to england and taking up his residence at his own seat  whilst he remained at paris my lord castlewood had his picture done by the famous french painter monsieur rigaud a present for his mother in london and this piece monsieur simon took back with him when he returned to that city which he reached about may in the year 1714 very soon after which time my lady castlewood and her daughter and their kinsman colonel esmond who had been at castlewood all this time likewise returned to london her ladyship occupying her house at kensington mr esmond returning to his lodgings at knightsbridge nearer the town and once more making his appearance at all public places his health greatly improved by his long stay in the country  the portrait of my lord in a handsome gilt frame was hung up in the place of honour in her ladyship’s drawingroom his lordship was represented in his scarlet uniform of captain of the guard with a lightbrown periwig a cuirass under his coat a blue ribbon and a fall of bruxelles lace many of her ladyship’s friends admired the piece beyond measure and flocked to see it bishop atterbury mr lesly good old mr collier and others amongst the clergy were delighted with the performance and many among the first quality examined and praised it only i must own that dr tusher happening to come up to london and seeing the picture it was ordinarily covered by a curtain but on this day miss beatrix happened to be looking at it when the doctor arrived the vicar of castlewood vowed he could not see any resemblance in the piece to his old pupil except perhaps a little about the chin and the periwig but we all of us convinced him that he had not seen frank for five years or more that he knew no more about the fine arts than a ploughboy and that he must be mistaken and we sent him home assured that the piece was an excellent likeness as for my lord bolingbroke who honoured her ladyship with a visit occasionally when colonel esmond showed him the picture he burst out laughing and asked what devilry he was engaged on esmond owned simply that the portrait was not that of viscount castlewood besought the secretary on his honour to keep the secret said that the ladies of the house were enthusiastic jacobites as was well known and confessed that the picture was that of the chevalier st george  the truth is that mr simon waiting upon lord castlewood one day at monsieur rigaud’s whilst his lordship was sitting for his picture affected to be much struck with a piece representing the chevalier whereof the head only was finished and purchased it of the painter for a hundred crowns it had been intended the artist said for miss oglethorpe the prince’s mistress but that young lady quitting paris had left the work on the artist’s hands and taking this piece home when my lord’s portrait arrived colonel esmond alias monsieur simon had copied the uniform and other accessories from my lord’s picture to fill up rigaud’s incomplete canvas the colonel all his life having been a practitioner of painting and especially followed it during his long residence in the cities of flanders among the masterpieces of vandyck and rubens my grandson hath the piece such as it is in virginia now  at the commencement of the month of june miss beatrix esmond and my lady viscountess her mother arrived from castlewood the former to resume her service at court which had been interrupted by the fatal catastrophe of duke hamilton’s death she once more took her place then in her majesty’s suite and at the maids’ table being always a favourite with mrs masham the queen’s chief woman partly perhaps on account of her bitterness against the duchess of marlborough whom miss beatrix loved no better than her rival did the gentlemen about the court my lord bolingbroke amongst others owned that the young lady had come back handsomer than ever and that the serious and tragic air which her face now involuntarily wore became her better than her former smiles and archness  all the old domestics at the little house of kensington square were changed the old steward that had served the family any time these fiveandtwenty years since the birth of the children of the house was dispatched into the kingdom of ireland to see my lord’s estate there the housekeeper who had been my lady’s woman time out of mind and the attendant of the young children was sent away grumbling to walcote to see to the new painting and preparing of that house which my lady dowager intended to occupy for the future giving up castlewood to her daughterinlaw that might be expected daily from france another servant the viscountess had was dismissed too—with a gratuity—on the pretext that her ladyship’s train of domestics must be diminished so finally there was not left in the household a single person who had belonged to it during the time my young lord castlewood was yet at home  for the plan which colonel esmond had in view and the stroke he intended ’twas necessary that the very smallest number of persons should be put in possession of his secret it scarce was known except to three or four out of his family and it was kept to a wonder  on the 10th of june 1714 there came by mr prior’s messenger from paris a letter from my lord viscount castlewood to his mother saying that he had been foolish in regard of money matters that he was ashamed to own he had lost at play and by other extravagances and that instead of having great entertainments as he had hoped at castlewood this year he must live as quiet as he could and make every effort to be saving so far every word of poor frank’s letter was true nor was there a doubt that he and his tall brothersinlaw had spent a great deal more than they ought and engaged the revenues of the castlewood property which the fond mother had husbanded and improved so carefully during the time of her guardianship  his “clotilda” castlewood went on to say “was still delicate and the physicians thought her lyingin had best take place at paris he should come without her ladyship and be at his mother’s house about the 17th or 18th day of june proposing to take horse from paris immediately and bringing but a single servant with him and he requested that the lawyers of gray’s inn might be invited to meet him with their account and the landsteward come from castlewood with his so that he might settle with them speedily raise a sum of money whereof he stood in need and be back to his viscountess by the time of her lyingin” then his lordship gave some of the news of the town sent his remembrance to kinsfolk and so the letter ended ’twas put in the common post and no doubt the french police and the english there had a copy of it to which they were exceeding welcome  two days after another letter was dispatched by the public post of france in the same open way and this after giving news of the fashion at court there ended by the following sentences in which but for those that had the key ’twould be difficult for any man to find any secret lurked at all—       the king will take medicine on thursday his majesty is better     than he hath been of late though incommoded by indigestion from     his too great appetite madame maintenon continues well they have     performed a play of mons racine at st cyr the duke of     shrewsbury and mr prior our envoy and all the english nobility     here were present at it the viscount castlewood’s passports     were refused to him ’twas said his lordship being sued by a     goldsmith for vaisselle plate and a pearl necklace supplied to     mademoiselle meruel of the french comedy ’tis a pity such news     should get abroad and travel to england about our young nobility     here mademoiselle meruel has been sent to the fort l’evesque     they say she has ordered not only plate but furniture and a     chariot and horses under that lord’s name of which extravagance     his unfortunate viscountess knows nothing      his majesty will be eightytwo years of age on his next     birthday the court prepares to celebrate it with a great feast     mr prior is in a sad way about their refusing at home to send him     his plate all here admired my lord viscount’s portrait and said     it was a masterpiece of rigaud have you seen it it is at the     lady castlewood’s house in kensington square i think no english     painter could produce such a piece      our poor friend the abbé hath been at the bastille but is now     transported to the conciergerie where his friends may visit him     they are to ask for a remission of his sentence soon let us hope     the poor rogue will have repented in prison      the lord castlewood has had the affair of the plate made up and     departs for england      is not this a dull letter i have a cursed headache with drinking     with mat and some more overnight and tipsy or sober am      thine ever ——   all this letter save some dozen of words which i have put above between brackets was mere idle talk though the substance of the letter was as important as any letter well could be it told those that had the key that the king will take the viscount castlewood’s passports and travel to england under that lord’s name his majesty will be at the lady castlewood’s house in kensington square where his friends may visit him they are to ask for the lord castlewood this note may have passed under mr prior’s eyes and those of our new allies the french and taught them nothing though it explains sufficiently to persons in london what the event was which was about to happen as ’twill show those who read my memoirs a hundred years hence what was that errand on which colonel esmond of late had been busy silently and swiftly to do that about which others were conspiring and thousands of jacobites all over the country clumsily caballing alone to effect that which the leaders here were only talking about to bring the prince of wales into the country openly in the face of all under bolingbroke’s very eyes the walls placarded with the proclamation signed with the secretary’s name and offering five hundred pounds reward for his apprehension this was a stroke the playing and winning of which might well give any adventurous spirit pleasure the loss of the stake might involve a heavy penalty but all our family were eager to risk that for the glorious chance of winning the game  nor should it be called a game save perhaps with the chief player who was not more or less sceptical than most public men with whom he had acquaintance in that age is there ever a public man in england that altogether believes in his party is there one however doubtful that will not fight for it young frank was ready to fight without much thinking he was a jacobite as his father before him was all the esmonds were royalists give him but the word he would cry “god save king james” before the palace guard or at the maypole in the strand and with respect to the women as is usual with them ’twas not a question of party but of faith their belief was a passion either esmond’s mistress or her daughter would have died for it cheerfully i have laughed often talking of king william’s reign and said i thought lady castlewood was disappointed the king did not persecute the family more and those who know the nature of women may fancy for themselves what needs not here be written down the rapture with which these neophytes received the mystery when made known to them the eagerness with which they looked forward to its completion the reverence which they paid the minister who initiated them into that secret truth now known only to a few but presently to reign over the world sure there is no bound to the trustingness of women look at arria worshipping the drunken clodpate of a husband who beats her look at cornelia treasuring as a jewel in her maternal heart the oaf her son i have known a woman preach jesuit’s bark and afterwards dr berkeley’s tarwater as though to swallow them were a divine decree and to refuse them no better than blasphemy  on his return from france colonel esmond put himself at the head of this little knot of fond conspirators no death or torture he knew would frighten them out of their constancy when he detailed his plan for bringing the king back his elder mistress thought that that restoration was to be attributed under heaven to the castlewood family and to its chief and she worshipped and loved esmond if that could be more than ever she had done she doubted not for one moment of the success of his scheme to mistrust which would have seemed impious in her eyes and as for beatrix when she became acquainted with the plan and joined it as she did with all her heart she gave esmond one of her searching bright looks “ah harry” says she “why were you not the head of our house you are the only one fit to raise it why do you give that silly boy the name and the honour but ’tis so in the world those get the prize that don’t deserve or care for it i wish i could give you your silly prize cousin but i can’t i have tried and i can’t” and she went away shaking her head mournfully but always it seemed to esmond that her liking and respect for him was greatly increased since she knew what capability he had both to act and bear to do and to forgo    chapter ix the original of the portrait comes to england   ’twas announced in the family that my lord castlewood would arrive having a confidential french gentleman in his suite who acted as secretary to his lordship and who being a papist and a foreigner of a good family though now in rather a menial place would have his meals served in his chamber and not with the domestics of the house the viscountess gave up her bedchamber contiguous to her daughter’s and having a large convenient closet attached to it in which a bed was put up ostensibly for monsieur baptiste the frenchman though ’tis needless to say when the doors of the apartments were locked and the two guests retired within it the young viscount became the servant of the illustrious prince whom he entertained and gave up gladly the more convenient and airy chamber and bed to his master madam beatrix also retired to the upper region her chamber being converted into a sittingroom for my lord the better to carry the deceit beatrix affected to grumble before the servants and to be jealous that she was turned out of her chamber to make way for my lord  no small preparations were made you may be sure and no slight tremor of expectation caused the hearts of the gentle ladies of castlewood to flutter before the arrival of the personages who were about to honour their house the chamber was ornamented with flowers the bed covered with the very finest of linen the two ladies insisting on making it themselves and kneeling down at the bedside and kissing the sheets out of respect for the web that was to hold the sacred person of a king the toilet was of silver and crystal there was a copy of eikon basilike laid on the writingtable a portrait of the martyred king hung always over the mantel having a sword of my poor lord castlewood underneath it and a little picture or emblem which the widow loved always to have before her eyes on waking and in which the hair of her lord and her two children was worked together her books of private devotions as they were all of the english church she carried away with her to the upper apartment which she destined for herself the ladies showed mr esmond when they were completed the fond preparations they had made ’twas then beatrix knelt down and kissed the linen sheets as for her mother lady castlewood made a curtsy at the door as she would have done to the altar on entering a church and owned that she considered the chamber in a manner sacred  the company in the servants’ hall never for a moment supposed that these preparations were made for any other person than the young viscount the lord of the house whom his fond mother had been for so many years without seeing both ladies were perfect housewives having the greatest skill in the making of confections scented waters c and keeping a notable superintendence over the kitchen calves enough were killed to feed an army of prodigal sons esmond thought and laughed when he came to wait on the ladies on the day when the guests were to arrive to find two pairs of the finest and roundest arms to be seen in england my lady castlewood was remarkable for this beauty of her person covered with flour up above the elbows and preparing paste and turning rollingpins in the housekeeper’s closet the guest would not arrive till suppertime and my lord would prefer having that meal in his own chamber you may be sure the brightest plate of the house was laid out there and can understand why it was that the ladies insisted that they alone would wait upon the young chief of the family  taking horse colonel esmond rode rapidly to rochester and there awaited the king in that very town where his father had last set his foot on the english shore a room had been provided at an inn there for my lord castlewood and his servant and colonel esmond timed his ride so well that he had scarce been half an hour in the place and was looking over the balcony into the yard of the inn when two travellers rode in at the inngate and the colonel running down the next moment embraced his dear young lord  my lord’s companion acting the part of a domestic dismounted and was for holding the viscount’s stirrup but colonel esmond calling to his own man who was in the court bade him take the horses and settle with the lad who had ridden the post along with the two travellers crying out in a cavalier tone in the french language to my lord’s companion and affecting to grumble that my lord’s fellow was a frenchman and did not know the money or habits of the country—“my man will see to the horses baptiste” says colonel esmond “do you understand english” “very leetle” “so follow my lord and wait upon him at dinner in his own room” the landlord and his people came up presently bearing the dishes ’twas well they made a noise and stir in the gallery or they might have found colonel esmond on his knee before lord castlewood’s servant welcoming his majesty to his kingdom and kissing the hand of the king we told the landlord that the frenchman would wait on his master and esmond’s man was ordered to keep sentry in the gallery without the door the prince dined with a good appetite laughing and talking very gaily and condescendingly bidding his two companions to sit with him at table he was in better spirits than poor frank castlewood who esmond thought might be wobegone on account of parting with his divine clotilda but the prince wishing to take a short siesta after dinner and retiring to an inner chamber where there was a bed the cause of poor frank’s discomfiture came out and bursting into tears with many expressions of fondness friendship and humiliation the faithful lad gave his kinsman to understand that he now knew all the truth and the sacrifices which colonel esmond had made for him  seeing no good in acquainting poor frank with that secret mr esmond had entreated his mistress also not to reveal it to her son the prince had told the poor lad all as they were riding from dover “i had as lief he had shot me cousin” frank said “i knew you were the best and the bravest and the kindest of all men” so the enthusiastic young fellow went on “but i never thought i owed you what i do and can scarce bear the weight of the obligation”  “i stand in the place of your father” says mr esmond kindly “and sure a father may dispossess himself in favour of his son i abdicate the twopenny crown and invest you with the kingdom of brentford don’t be a fool and cry you make a much taller and handsomer viscount than ever i could” but the fond boy with oaths and protestations laughter and incoherent outbreaks of passionate emotion could not be got for some little time to put up with esmond’s raillery wanted to kneel down to him and kissed his hand asked him and implored him to order something to bid castlewood give his own life up or take somebody else’s anything so that he might show his gratitude for the generosity esmond showed him  “the k—— he laughed” frank said pointing to the door where the sleeper was and speaking in a low tone “i don’t think he should have laughed as he told me the story as we rode along from dover talking in french he spoke about you and your coming to him at bar he called you ‘le grand sérieux’ don bellianis of greece and i don’t know what names mimicking your manner” here castlewood laughed himself—“and he did it very well he seems to sneer at everything he is not like a king somehow harry i fancy you are like a king he does not seem to think what a stake we are all playing he would have stopped at canterbury to run after a barmaid there had i not implored him to come on he hath a house at chaillot where he used to go and bury himself for weeks away from the queen and with all sorts of bad company” says frank with a demure look “you may smile but i am not the wild fellow i was no no i have been taught better” says castlewood devoutly making a sign on his breast  “thou art my dear brave boy” says colonel esmond touched at the young fellow’s simplicity “and there will be a noble gentleman at castlewood so long as my frank is there”  the impetuous young lad was for going down on his knees again with another explosion of gratitude but that we heard the voice from the next chamber of the august sleeper just waking calling out—“eh lafleur un verre d’eau” his majesty came out yawning—“a pest” says he “upon your english ale ’tis so strong that ma foi it hath turned my head”  the effect of the ale was like a spur upon our horses and we rode very quickly to london reaching kensington at nightfall mr esmond’s servant was left behind at rochester to take care of the tired horses whilst we had fresh beasts provided along the road and galloping by the prince’s side the colonel explained to the prince of wales what his movements had been who the friends were that knew of the expedition whom as esmond conceived the prince should trust entreating him above all to maintain the very closest secrecy until the time should come when his royal highness should appear the town swarmed with friends of the prince’s cause there were scores of correspondents with st germains jacobites known and secret great in station and humble about the court and the queen in the parliament church and among the merchants in the city the prince had friends numberless in the army in the privy council and the officers of state the great object as it seemed to the small band of persons who had concerted that bold stroke who had brought the queen’s brother into his native country was that his visit should remain unknown till the proper time came when his presence should surprise friends and enemies alike and the latter should be found so unprepared and disunited that they should not find time to attack him we feared more from his friends than from his enemies the lies and tittletattle sent over to st germains by the jacobite agents about london had done an incalculable mischief to his cause and wofully misguided him and it was from these especially that the persons engaged in the present venture were anxious to defend the chief actor in it16  the party reached london by nightfall leaving their horses at the postinghouse over against westminster and being ferried over the water where lady esmond’s coach was already in waiting in another hour we were all landed at kensington and the mistress of the house had that satisfaction which her heart had yearned after for many years once more to embrace her son who on his side with all his waywardness ever retained a most tender affection for his parent  she did not refrain from this expression of her feeling though the domestics were by and my lord castlewood’s attendant stood in the hall esmond had to whisper to him in french to take his hat off monsieur baptiste was constantly neglecting his part with an inconceivable levity more than once on the ride to london little observations of the stranger light remarks and words betokening the greatest ignorance of the country the prince came to govern had hurt the susceptibility of the two gentlemen forming his escort nor could either help owning in his secret mind that they would have had his behaviour otherwise and that the laughter and the lightness not to say licence which characterized his talk scarce befitted such a great prince and such a solemn occasion not but that he could act at proper times with spirit and dignity he had behaved as we all knew in a very courageous manner on the field esmond had seen a copy of the letter the prince writ with his own hand when urged by his friends in england to abjure his religion and admired that manly and magnanimous reply by which he refused to yield to the temptation monsieur baptiste took off his hat blushing at the hint colonel esmond ventured to give him and said—“tenez elle est jolie la petite mère foidechevalier elle est charmante mais l’autre qui est cette nymphe cet astre qui brille cette diane qui descend sur nous” and he started back and pushed forward as beatrix was descending the stair she was in colours for the first time at her own house she wore the diamonds esmond gave her it had been agreed between them that she should wear these brilliants on the day when the king should enter the house and a queen she looked radiant in charms and magnificent and imperial in beauty  castlewood himself was startled by that beauty and splendour he stepped back and gazed at his sister as though he had not been aware before nor was he very likely how perfectly lovely she was and i thought blushed as he embraced her the prince could not keep his eyes off her he quite forgot his menial part though he had been schooled to it and a little light portmanteau prepared expressly that he should carry it he pressed forward before my lord viscount ’twas lucky the servants’ eyes were busy in other directions or they must have seen that this was no servant or at least a very insolent and rude one  again colonel esmond was obliged to cry out “baptiste” in a loud imperious voice “have a care to the valise” at which hint the wilful young man ground his teeth together with something very like a curse between them and then gave a brief look of anything but pleasure to his mentor being reminded however he shouldered the little portmanteau and carried it up the stair esmond preceding him and a servant with lighted tapers he flung down his burden sulkily in the bedchamber—“a prince that will wear a crown must wear a mask” says mr esmond in french  “ah peste i see how it is” says monsieur baptiste continuing the talk in french “the great serious is seriously”—“alarmed for monsieur baptiste” broke in the colonel esmond neither liked the tone with which the prince spoke of the ladies nor the eyes with which he regarded them  the bedchamber and the two rooms adjoining it the closet and the apartment which was to be called my lord’s parlour were already lighted and awaiting their occupier and the collation laid for my lord’s supper lord castlewood and his mother and sister came up the stair a minute afterwards and so soon as the domestics had quitted the apartment castlewood and esmond uncovered and the two ladies went down on their knees before the prince who graciously gave a hand to each he looked his part of prince much more naturally than that of servant which he had just been trying and raised them both with a great deal of nobility as well as kindness in his air “madam” says he “my mother will thank your ladyship for your hospitality to her son for you madam” turning to beatrix “i cannot bear to see so much beauty in such a posture you will betray monsieur baptiste if you kneel to him sure ’tis his place rather to kneel to you”  a light shone out of her eyes a gleam bright enough to kindle passion in any breast there were times when this creature was so handsome that she seemed as it were like venus revealing herself a goddess in a flash of brightness she appeared so now radiant and with eyes bright with a wonderful lustre a pang as of rage and jealousy shot through esmond’s heart as he caught the look she gave the prince and he clenched his hand involuntarily and looked across to castlewood whose eyes answered his alarmsignal and were also on the alert the prince gave his subjects an audience of a few minutes and then the two ladies and colonel esmond quitted the chamber lady castlewood pressed his hand as they descended the stair and the three went down to the lower rooms where they waited awhile till the travellers above should be refreshed and ready for their meal  esmond looked at beatrix blazing with her jewels on her beautiful neck “i have kept my word” says he “and i mine” says beatrix looking down on the diamonds  “were i the mogul emperor” says the colonel “you should have all that were dug out of golconda”  “these are a great deal too good for me” says beatrix dropping her head on her beautiful breast—“so are you all all” and when she looked up again as she did in a moment and after a sigh her eyes as they gazed at her cousin wore that melancholy and inscrutable look which ’twas always impossible to sound  when the time came for the supper of which we were advertised by a knocking overhead colonel esmond and the two ladies went to the upper apartment where the prince already was and by his side the young viscount of exactly the same age shape and with features not dissimilar though frank’s were the handsomer of the two the prince sat down and bade the ladies sit the gentlemen remained standing there was indeed but one more cover laid at the table—“which of you will take it” says he  “the head of our house” says lady castlewood taking her son’s hand and looking towards colonel esmond with a bow and a great tremor of the voice “the marquis of esmond will have the honour of serving the king”  “i shall have the honour of waiting on his royal highness” says colonel esmond filling a cup of wine and as the fashion of that day was he presented it to the king on his knee  “i drink to my hostess and her family” says the prince with no very wellpleased air but the cloud passed immediately off his face and he talked to the ladies in a lively rattling strain quite undisturbed by poor mr esmond’s yellow countenance that i dare say looked very glum  when the time came to take leave esmond marched homewards to his lodgings and met mr addison on the road that night walking to a cottage he had at fulham the moon shining on his handsome serene face—“what cheer brother” says addison laughing “i thought it was a footpad advancing in the dark and behold ’tis an old friend we may shake hands colonel in the dark ’tis better than fighting by daylight why should we quarrel because i am a whig and thou art a tory turn thy steps and walk with me to fulham where there is a nightingale still singing in the garden and a cool bottle in a cave i know of you shall drink to the pretender if you like and i will drink my liquor my own way i have had enough of good liquor—no never there is no such word as enough as a stopper for good wine thou wilt not come come any day come soon you know i remember simois and the sigeia tellus and the praelia mixta mero mixta mero” he repeated with ever so slight a touch of merum in his voice and walked back a little way on the road with esmond bidding the other remember he was always his friend and indebted to him for his aid in the campaign poem and very likely mr under secretary would have stepped in and taken t’other bottle at the colonel’s lodgings had the latter invited him but esmond’s mood was none of the gayest and he bade his friend an inhospitable goodnight at the door  “i have done the deed” thought he sleepless and looking out into the night “he is here and i have brought him he and beatrix are sleeping under the same roof now whom did i mean to serve in bringing him was it the prince was it henry esmond had i not best have joined the manly creed of addison yonder that scouts the old doctrine of right divine that boldly declares that parliament and people consecrate the sovereign not bishops nor genealogies nor oils nor coronations” the eager gaze of the young prince watching every movement of beatrix haunted esmond and pursued him the prince’s figure appeared before him in his feverish dreams many times that night he wished the deed undone for which he had laboured so he was not the first that has regretted his own act or brought about his own undoing undoing should he write that word in his late years no on his knees before heaven rather be thankful for what then he deemed his misfortune and which hath caused the whole subsequent happiness of his life  esmond’s man honest john lockwood had served his master and the family all his life and the colonel knew that he could answer for john’s fidelity as for his own john returned with the horses from rochester betimes the next morning and the colonel gave him to understand that on going to kensington where he was free of the servants’ hall and indeed courting mrs beatrix’s maid he was to ask no questions and betray no surprise but to vouch stoutly that the young gentleman he should see in a red coat there was my lord viscount castlewood and that his attendant in grey was monsieur baptiste the frenchman he was to tell his friends in the kitchen such stories as he remembered of my lord viscount’s youth at castlewood what a wild boy he was how he used to drill jack and cane him before ever he was a soldier everything in fine he knew respecting my lord viscount’s early days jack’s ideas of painting had not been much cultivated during his residence in flanders with his master and before my young lord’s return he had been easily got to believe that the picture brought over from paris and now hanging in lady castlewood’s drawingroom was a perfect likeness of her son the young lord and the domestics having all seen the picture many times and catching but a momentary imperfect glimpse of the two strangers on the night of their arrival never had a reason to doubt the fidelity of the portrait and next day when they saw the original of the piece habited exactly as he was represented in the painting with the same periwig ribbon and uniform of the guard quite naturally addressed the gentleman as my lord castlewood my lady viscountess’s son  the secretary of the night previous was now the viscount the viscount wore the secretary’s grey frock and john lockwood was instructed to hint to the world below stairs that my lord being a papist and very devout in that religion his attendant might be no other than his chaplain from bruxelles hence if he took his meals in my lord’s company there was little reason for surprise frank was further cautioned to speak english with a foreign accent which task he performed indifferently well and this caution was the more necessary because the prince himself scarce spoke our language like a native of the island and john lockwood laughed with the folks below stairs at the manner in which my lord after five years abroad sometimes forgot his own tongue and spoke it like a frenchman “i warrant” says he “that with the english beef and beer his lordship will soon get back the proper use of his mouth” and to do his new lordship justice he took to beer and beef very kindly  the prince drank so much and was so loud and imprudent in his talk after his drink that esmond often trembled for him his meals were served as much as possible in his own chamber though frequently he made his appearance in lady castlewood’s parlour and drawingroom calling beatrix “sister” and her ladyship “mother” or “madam” before the servants and choosing to act entirely up to the part of brother and son the prince sometimes saluted mrs beatrix and lady castlewood with a freedom which his secretary did not like and which for his part set colonel esmond tearing with rage  the guests had not been three days in the house when poor jack lockwood came with a rueful countenance to his master and said “my lord that is—the gentleman has been tampering with mrs lucy” jack’s sweetheart “and given her guineas and a kiss” i fear that colonel esmond’s mind was rather relieved than otherwise when he found that the ancillary beauty was the one whom the prince had selected his royal tastes were known to lie that way and continued so in afterlife the heir of one of the greatest names of the greatest kingdoms and of the greatest misfortunes in europe was often content to lay the dignity of his birth and grief at the wooden shoes of a french chambermaid and to repent afterwards for he was very devout in ashes taken from the dustpan ’tis for mortals such as these that nations suffer that parties struggle that warriors fight and bleed a year afterwards gallant heads were falling and nithsdale in escape and derwentwater on the scaffold whilst the heedless ingrate for whom they risked and lost all was tippling with his seraglio of mistresses in his petite maison of chaillot  blushing to be forced to bear such an errand esmond had to go to the prince and warn him that the girl whom his highness was bribing was john lockwood’s sweetheart an honest resolute man who had served in six campaigns and feared nothing and who knew that the person calling himself lord castlewood was not his young master and the colonel besought the prince to consider what the effect of a single man’s jealousy might be and to think of other designs he had in hand more important than the seduction of a waitingmaid and the humiliation of a brave man ten times perhaps in the course of as many days mr esmond had to warn the royal young adventurer of some imprudence or some freedom he received these remonstrances very testily save perhaps in this affair of poor lockwood’s when he deigned to burst out alaughing and said “what the soubrette has peached to the amoureux and crispin is angry and crispin has served and crispin has been a corporal has he tell him we will reward his valour with a pair of colours and recompense his fidelity”  colonel esmond ventured to utter some other words of entreaty but the prince stamping imperiously cried out “assez milord je m’ennuye à la prêche i am not come to london to go to the sermon” and he complained afterwards to castlewood that “le petit jaune le noir colonel le marquis misanthrope” by which facetious names his royal highness was pleased to designate colonel esmond “fatigued him with his grand airs and virtuous homilies”  the bishop of rochester and other gentlemen engaged in the transaction which had brought the prince over waited upon his royal highness constantly asking for my lord castlewood on their arrival at kensington and being openly conducted to his royal highness in that character who received them either in my lady’s drawingroom below or above in his own apartment and all implored him to quit the house as little as possible and to wait there till the signal should be given for him to appear the ladies entertained him at cards over which amusement he spent many hours in each day and night he passed many hours more in drinking during which time he would rattle and talk very agreeably and especially if the colonel was absent whose presence always seemed to frighten him and the poor “colonel noir” took that hint as a command accordingly and seldom intruded his black face upon the convivial hours of this august young prisoner except for those few persons of whom the porter had the list lord castlewood was denied to all friends of the house who waited on his lordship the wound he had received had broke out again from his journey on horseback so the world and the domestics were informed and doctor a——17 his physician i shall not mention his name but he was physician to the queen of the scots nation and a man remarkable for his benevolence as well as his wit gave orders that he should be kept perfectly quiet until the wound should heal with this gentleman who was one of the most active and influential of our party and the others before spoken of the whole secret lay and it was kept with so much faithfulness and the story we told so simple and natural that there was no likelihood of a discovery except from the imprudence of the prince himself and an adventurous levity that we had the greatest difficulty to control as for lady castlewood although she scarce spoke a word ’twas easy to gather from her demeanour and one or two hints she dropped how deep her mortification was at finding the hero whom she had chosen to worship all her life and whose restoration had formed almost the most sacred part of her prayers no more than a man and not a good one she thought misfortune might have chastened him but that instructress had rather rendered him callous than humble his devotion which was quite real kept him from no sin he had a mind to his talk showed goodhumour gaiety even wit enough but there was a levity in his acts and words that he had brought from among those libertine devotees with whom he had been bred and that shocked the simplicity and purity of the english lady whose guest he was esmond spoke his mind to beatrix pretty freely about the prince getting her brother to put in a word of warning beatrix was entirely of their opinion she thought he was very light very light and reckless she could not even see the good looks colonel esmond had spoken of the prince had bad teeth and a decided squint how could we say he did not squint his eyes were fine but there was certainly a cast in them she rallied him at table with wonderful wit she spoke of him invariably as of a mere boy she was more fond of esmond than ever praised him to her brother praised him to the prince when his royal highness was pleased to sneer at the colonel and warmly espoused his cause “and if your majesty does not give him the garter his father had when the marquis of esmond comes to your majesty’s court i will hang myself in my own garters or will cry my eyes out” “rather than lose those” says the prince “he shall be made archbishop and colonel of the guard” it was frank castlewood who told me of this conversation over their supper  “yes” cries she with one of her laughs—i fancy i hear it now thirty years afterwards i hear that delightful music—“yes he shall be archbishop of esmond and marquis of canterbury”  “and what will your ladyship be” says the prince “you have but to choose your place”  “i” says beatrix “will be mother of the maids to the queen of his majesty king james the third—vive le roy” and she made him a great curtsy and drank a part of a glass of wine in his honour  “the prince seized hold of the glass and drank the last drop of it” castlewood said “and my mother looking very anxious rose up and asked leave to retire but that ’trix is my mother’s daughter harry” frank continued “i don’t know what a horrid fear i should have of her i wish—i wish this business were over you are older than i am and wiser and better and i owe you everything and would die for you—before george i would but i wish the end of this were come”  neither of us very likely passed a tranquil night horrible doubts and torments racked esmond’s soul ’twas a scheme of personal ambition a daring stroke for a selfish end—he knew it what cared he in his heart who was king were not his very sympathies and secret convictions on the other side—on the side of people parliament freedom and here was he engaged for a prince that had scarce heard the word “liberty” that priests and women tyrants by nature both made a tool of the misanthrope was in no better humour after hearing that story and his grim face more black and yellow than ever    chapter x we entertain a very distinguished guest at kensington   should any clue be found to the dark intrigues at the latter end of queen anne’s time or any historian be inclined to follow it ’twill be discovered i have little doubt that not one of the great personages about the queen had a defined scheme of policy independent of that private and selfish interest which each was bent on pursuing st john was for st john and harley for oxford and marlborough for john churchill always and according as they could get help from st germains or hanover they sent over proffers of allegiance to the princes there or betrayed one to the other one cause or one sovereign was as good as another to them so that they could hold the best place under him and like lockit and peachem the newgate chiefs in the rogues’ opera mr gay wrote afterwards had each in his hand documents and proofs of treason which would hang the other only he did not dare to use the weapon for fear of that one which his neighbour also carried in his pocket think of the great marlborough the greatest subject in all the world a conqueror of princes that had marched victorious over germany flanders and france that had given the law to sovereigns abroad and been worshipped as a divinity at home forced to sneak out of england—his credit honours places all taken from him his friends in the army broke and ruined and flying before harley as abject and powerless as a poor debtor before a bailiff with a writ a paper of which harley got possession and showing beyond doubt that the duke was engaged with the stuart family was the weapon with which the treasurer drove marlborough out of the kingdom he fled to antwerp and began intriguing instantly on the other side and came back to england as all know a whig and a hanoverian  though the treasurer turned out of the army and office every man military or civil known to be the duke’s friend and gave the vacant posts among the tory party he too was playing the double game between hanover and st germains awaiting the expected catastrophe of the queen’s death to be master of the state and offer it to either family that should bribe him best or that the nation should declare for whichever the king was harley’s object was to reign over him and to this end he supplanted the former famous favourite decried the actions of the war which had made marlborough’s name illustrious and disdained no more than the great fallen competitor of his the meanest arts flatteries intimidations that would secure his power if the greatest satirist the world ever hath seen had writ against harley and not for him what a history had he left behind of the last years of queen anne’s reign but swift that scorned all mankind and himself not the least of all had this merit of a faithful partisan that he loved those chiefs who treated him well and stuck by harley bravely in his fall as he gallantly had supported him in his better fortune  incomparably more brilliant more splendid eloquent accomplished than his rival the great st john could be as selfish as oxford was and could act the double part as skilfully as ambidextrous churchill he whose talk was always of liberty no more shrunk from using persecution and the pillory against his opponents than if he had been at lisbon and grand inquisitor this lofty patriot was on his knees at hanover and st germains too notoriously of no religion he toasted church and queen as boldly as the stupid sacheverel whom he used and laughed at and to serve his turn and to overthrow his enemy he could intrigue coax bully wheedle fawn on the court favourite and creep up the backstair as silently as oxford who supplanted marlborough and whom he himself supplanted the crash of my lord oxford happened at this very time whereat my history is now arrived he was come to the very last days of his power and the agent whom he employed to overthrow the conqueror of blenheim was now engaged to upset the conqueror’s conqueror and hand over the staff of government to bolingbroke who had been panting to hold it  in expectation of the stroke that was now preparing the irish regiments in the french service were all brought round about boulogne in picardy to pass over if need were with the duke of berwick the soldiers of france no longer but subjects of james the third of england and ireland king the fidelity of the great mass of the scots though a most active resolute and gallant whig party admirably and energetically ordered and disciplined was known to be in scotland too was notoriously unshaken in their king a very great body of tory clergy nobility and gentry were public partisans of the exiled prince and the indifferents might be counted on to cry king george or king james according as either should prevail the queen especially in her latter days inclined towards her own family the prince was lying actually in london within a stone’scast of his sister’s palace the first minister toppling to his fall and so tottering that the weakest push of a woman’s finger would send him down and as for bolingbroke his successor we know on whose side his power and his splendid eloquence would be on the day when the queen should appear openly before her council and say—“this my lords is my brother here is my father’s heir and mine after me”  during the whole of the previous year the queen had had many and repeated fits of sickness fever and lethargy and her death had been constantly looked for by all her attendants the elector of hanover had wished to send his son the duke of cambridge—to pay his court to his cousin the queen the elector said—in truth to be on the spot when death should close her career frightened perhaps to have such a memento mori under her royal eyes her majesty had angrily forbidden the young prince’s coming into england either she desired to keep the chances for her brother open yet or the people about her did not wish to close with the whig candidate till they could make terms with him the quarrels of her ministers before her face at the council board the pricks of conscience very likely the importunities of her ministers and constant turmoil and agitation round about her had weakened and irritated the princess extremely her strength was giving way under these continual trials of her temper and from day to day it was expected she must come to a speedy end of them just before viscount castlewood and his companion came from france her majesty was taken ill the st anthony’s fire broke out on the royal legs there was no hurry for the presentation of the young lord at court or that person who should appear under his name and my lord viscount’s wound breaking out opportunely he was kept conveniently in his chamber until such time as his physician should allow him to bend his knee before the queen at the commencement of july that influential lady with whom it has been mentioned that our party had relations came frequently to visit her young friend the maid of honour at kensington and my lord viscount the real or supposititious who was an invalid at lady castlewood’s house  on the 27th day of july the lady in question who held the most intimate post about the queen came in her chair from the palace hard by bringing to the little party in kensington square intelligence of the very highest importance the final blow had been struck and my lord of oxford and mortimer was no longer treasurer the staff was as yet given to no successor though my lord bolingbroke would undoubtedly be the man and now the time was come the queen’s abigail said and now my lord castlewood ought to be presented to the sovereign  after that scene which lord castlewood witnessed and described to his cousin who passed such a miserable night of mortification and jealousy as he thought over the transaction no doubt the three persons who were set by nature as protectors over beatrix came to the same conclusion that she must be removed from the presence of a man whose desires towards her were expressed only too clearly and who was no more scrupulous in seeking to gratify them than his father had been before him i suppose esmond’s mistress her son and the colonel himself had been all secretly debating this matter in their minds for when frank broke out in his blunt way with—“i think beatrix had best be anywhere but here”—lady castlewood said—“i thank you frank i have thought so too” and mr esmond though he only remarked that it was not for him to speak showed plainly by the delight on his countenance how very agreeable that proposal was to him  “one sees that you think with us henry” says the viscountess with ever so little of sarcasm in her tone “beatrix is best out of this house whilst we have our guest in it and as soon as this morning’s business is done she ought to quit london”  “what morning’s business” asked colonel esmond not knowing what had been arranged though in fact the stroke next in importance to that of bringing the prince and of having him acknowledged by the queen was now being performed at the very moment we three were conversing together  the courtlady with whom our plan was concerted and who was a chief agent in it the courtphysician and the bishop of rochester who were the other two most active participators in our plan had held many councils in our house at kensington and elsewhere as to the means best to be adopted for presenting our young adventurer to his sister the queen the simple and easy plan proposed by colonel esmond had been agreed to by all parties which was that on some rather private day when there were not many persons about the court the prince should appear there as my lord castlewood should be greeted by his sisterinwaiting and led by that other lady into the closet of the queen and according to her majesty’s health or humour and the circumstances that might arise during the interview it was to be left to the discretion of those present at it and to the prince himself whether he should declare that it was the queen’s own brother or the brother of beatrix esmond who kissed her royal hand and this plan being determined on we were all waiting in very much anxiety for the day and signal of execution  two mornings after that supper it being the 27th day of july the bishop of rochester breakfasting with lady castlewood and her family and the meal scarce over dr a——’s coach drove up to our house at kensington and the doctor appeared amongst the party there enlivening a rather gloomy company for the mother and daughter had had words in the morning in respect to the transactions of that supper and other adventures perhaps and on the day succeeding beatrix’s haughty spirit brooked remonstrances from no superior much less from her mother the gentlest of creatures whom the girl commanded rather than obeyed and feeling she was wrong and that by a thousand coquetries which she could no more help exercising on every man that came near her than the sun can help shining on great and small she had provoked the prince’s dangerous admiration and allured him to the expression of it she was only the more wilful and imperious the more she felt her error  to this party the prince being served with chocolate in his bedchamber where he lay late sleeping away the fumes of his wine the doctor came and by the urgent and startling nature of his news dissipated instantly that private and minor unpleasantry under which the family of castlewood was labouring  he asked for the guest the guest was above in his own apartment he bade monsieur baptiste go up to his master instantly and requested that my lord viscount castlewood would straightway put his uniform on and come away in the doctor’s coach now at the door  he then informed madam beatrix what her part of the comedy was to be—“in half an hour” says he “her majesty and her favourite lady will take the air in the cedarwalk behind the new banquetinghouse her majesty will be drawn in a gardenchair madam beatrix esmond and her brother my lord viscount castlewood will be walking in the private garden here is lady masham’s key and will come unawares upon the royal party the man that draws the chair will retire and leave the queen the favourite and the maid of honour and her brother together mrs beatrix will present her brother and then—and then my lord bishop will pray for the result of the interview and his scots clerk will say amen quick put on your hood madam beatrix why doth not his majesty come down such another chance may not present itself for months again”  the prince was late and lazy and indeed had all but lost that chance through his indolence the queen was actually about to leave the garden just when the party reached it the doctor the bishop the maid of honour and her brother went off together in the physician’s coach and had been gone half an hour when colonel esmond came to kensington square  the news of this errand on which beatrix was gone of course for a moment put all thoughts of private jealousy out of colonel esmond’s head in half an hour more the coach returned the bishop descended from it first and gave his arm to beatrix who now came out his lordship went back into the carriage again and the maid of honour entered the house alone we were all gazing at her from the upper window trying to read from her countenance the result of the interview from which she had just come  she came into the drawingroom in a great tremor and very pale she asked for a glass of water as her mother went to meet her and after drinking that and putting off her hood she began to speak—“we may all hope for the best” says she “it has cost the queen a fit her majesty was in her chair in the cedarwalk accompanied only by lady —— when we entered by the private wicket from the west side of the garden and turned towards her the doctor following us they waited in a sidewalk hidden by the shrubs as we advanced towards the chair my heart throbbed so i scarce could speak but my prince whispered ‘courage beatrix’ and marched on with a steady step his face was a little flushed but he was not afraid of the danger he who fought so bravely at malplaquet fears nothing” esmond and castlewood looked at each other at this compliment neither liking the sound of it  “the prince uncovered” beatrix continued “and i saw the queen turning round to lady masham as if asking who these two were her majesty looked very pale and ill and then flushed up the favourite made us a signal to advance and i went up leading my prince by the hand quite close to the chair ‘your majesty will give my lord viscount your hand to kiss’ says her lady and the queen put out her hand which the prince kissed kneeling on his knee he who should kneel to no mortal man or woman  “ ‘you have been long from england my lord’ says the queen ‘why were you not here to give a home to your mother and sister’  “ ‘i am come madam to stay now if the queen desires me’ says the prince with another low bow  “ ‘you have taken a foreign wife my lord and a foreign religion was not that of england good enough for you’  “ ‘in returning to my father’s church’ says the prince ‘i do not love my mother the less nor am i the less faithful servant of your majesty’  “here” says beatrix “the favourite gave me a little signal with her hand to fall back which i did though i died to hear what should pass and whispered something to the queen which made her majesty start and utter one or two words in a hurried manner looking towards the prince and catching hold with her hand of the arm of her chair he advanced still nearer towards it he began to speak very rapidly i caught the words ‘father blessing forgiveness’—and then presently the prince fell on his knees took from his breast a paper he had there handed it to the queen who as soon as she saw it flung up both her arms with a scream and took away that hand nearest the prince and which he endeavoured to kiss he went on speaking with great animation of gesture now clasping his hands together on his heart now opening them as though to say ‘i am here your brother in your power’ lady masham ran round on the other side of the chair kneeling too and speaking with great energy she clasped the queen’s hand on her side and picked up the paper her majesty had let fall the prince rose and made a further speech as though he would go the favourite on the other hand urging her mistress and then running back to the prince brought him back once more close to the chair again he knelt down and took the queen’s hand which she did not withdraw kissing it a hundred times my lady all the time with sobs and supplications speaking over the chair this while the queen sat with a stupefied look crumpling the paper with one hand as my prince embraced the other then of a sudden she uttered several piercing shrieks and burst into a great fit of hysteric tears and laughter ‘enough enough sir for this time’ i heard lady masham say and the chairman who had withdrawn round the banquetingroom came back alarmed by the cries ‘quick’ says lady masham ‘get some help’ and i ran towards the doctor who with the bishop of rochester came up instantly lady masham whispered the prince he might hope for the very best and to be ready tomorrow and he hath gone away to the bishop of rochester’s house to meet several of his friends there and so the great stroke is struck” says beatrix going down on her knees and clasping her hands “god save the king god save the king”  beatrix’s tale told and the young lady herself calmed somewhat of her agitation we asked with regard to the prince who was absent with bishop atterbury and were informed that ’twas likely he might remain abroad the whole day beatrix’s three kinsfolk looked at one another at this intelligence ’twas clear the same thought was passing through the minds of all  but who should begin to break the news monsieur baptiste that is frank castlewood turned very red and looked towards esmond the colonel bit his lips and fairly beat a retreat into the window it was lady castlewood that opened upon beatrix with the news which we knew would do anything but please her  “we are glad” says she taking her daughter’s hand and speaking in a gentle voice “that the guest is away”  beatrix drew back in an instant looking round her at us three and as if divining a danger “why glad” says she her breast beginning to heave “are you so soon tired of him”  “we think one of us is devilishly too fond of him” cries out frank castlewood  “and which is it—you my lord or is it mamma who is jealous because he drinks my health or is it the head of the family” here she turned with an imperious look towards colonel esmond “who has taken of late to preach the king sermons”  “we do not say you are too free with his majesty”  “i thank you madam” says beatrix with a toss of the head and a curtsy  but her mother continued with very great calmness and dignity—“at least we have not said so though we might were it possible for a mother to say such words to her own daughter your father’s daughter”  “eh mon père” breaks out beatrix “was no better than other persons’ fathers” and again she looked towards the colonel  we all felt a shock as she uttered those two or three french words her manner was exactly imitated from that of our foreign guest  “you had not learned to speak french a month ago beatrix” says her mother sadly “nor to speak ill of your father”  beatrix no doubt saw that slip she had made in her flurry for she blushed crimson “i have learnt to honour the king” says she drawing up “and ’twere as well that others suspected neither his majesty nor me”  “if you respected your mother a little more” frank said “’trix you would do yourself no hurt”  “i am no child” says she turning round on him “we have lived very well these five years without the benefit of your advice or example and i intend to take neither now why does not the head of the house speak” she went on “he rules everything here when his chaplain has done singing the psalms will his lordship deliver the sermon i am tired of the psalms” the prince had used almost the very same words in regard to colonel esmond that the imprudent girl repeated in her wrath  “you show yourself a very apt scholar madam” says the colonel and turning to his mistress “did your guest use these words in your ladyship’s hearing or was it to beatrix in private that he was pleased to impart his opinion regarding my tiresome sermon”  “have you seen him alone” cries my lord starting up with an oath “by god have you seen him alone”  “were he here you wouldn’t dare so to insult me no you would not dare” cries frank’s sister “keep your oaths my lord for your wife we are not used here to such language ’till you came there used to be kindness between me and mamma and i cared for her when you never did when you were away for years with your horses and your mistress and your popish wife”  “by ——” says my lord rapping out another oath “clotilda is an angel how dare you say a word against clotilda”  colonel esmond could not refrain from a smile to see how easy frank’s attack was drawn off by that feint—“i fancy clotilda is not the subject in hand” says mr esmond rather scornfully “her ladyship is at paris a hundred leagues off preparing babylinen it is about my lord castlewood’s sister and not his wife the question is”  “he is not my lord castlewood” says beatrix “and he knows he is not he is colonel francis esmond’s son and no more and he wears a false title and he lives on another man’s land and he knows it” here was another desperate sally of the poor beleaguered garrison and an alerte in another quarter “again i beg your pardon” says esmond “if there are no proofs of my claim i have no claim if my father acknowledged no heir yours was his lawful successor and my lord castlewood hath as good a right to his rank and small estate as any man in england but that again is not the question as you know very well let us bring our talk back to it as you will have me meddle in it and i will give you frankly my opinion that a house where a prince lies all day who respects no woman is no house for a young unmarried lady that you were better in the country than here that he is here on a great end from which no folly should divert him and that having nobly done your part of this morning beatrix you should retire off the scene awhile and leave it to the other actors of the play”  as the colonel spoke with a perfect calmness and politeness such as ’tis to be hoped he hath always shown to women18 his mistress stood by him on one side of the table and frank castlewood on the other hemming in poor beatrix that was behind it and as it were surrounding her with our approaches  having twice sallied out and been beaten back she now as i expected tried the ultima ratio of women and had recourse to tears her beautiful eyes filled with them i never could bear in her nor in any woman that expression of pain—“i am alone” sobbed she “you are three against me—my brother my mother and you what have i done that you should speak and look so unkindly at me is it my fault that the prince should as you say admire me did i bring him here did i do aught but what you bade me in making him welcome did you not tell me that our duty was to die for him did you not teach me mother night and morning to pray for the king before even ourselves what would you have of me cousin for you are the chief of the conspiracy against me i know you are sir and that my mother and brother are acting but as you bid them whither would you have me go”  “i would but remove from the prince” says esmond gravely “a dangerous temptation heaven forbid i should say you would yield i would only have him free of it your honour needs no guardian please god but his imprudence doth he is so far removed from all women by his rank that his pursuit of them cannot but be unlawful we would remove the dearest and fairest of our family from the chance of that insult and that is why we would have you go dear beatrix”  “harry speaks like a book” says frank with one of his oaths “and by —— every word he saith is true you can’t help being handsome ’trix no more can the prince help following you my council is that you go out of harm’s way for by the lord were the prince to play any tricks with you king as he is or is to be harry esmond and i would have justice of him”  “are not two such champions enough to guard me” says beatrix something sorrowfully “sure with you two watching no evil could happen to me”  “in faith i think not beatrix” says colonel esmond “nor if the prince knew us would he try”  “but does he know you” interposed lady esmond very quiet “he comes of a country where the pursuit of kings is thought no dishonour to a woman let us go dearest beatrix shall we go to walcote or to castlewood we are best away from the city and when the prince is acknowledged and our champions have restored him and he hath his own house at st james’s or windsor we can come back to ours here do you not think so harry and frank”  frank and harry thought with her you may be sure  “we will go then” says beatrix turning a little pale “lady masham is to give me warning tonight how her majesty is and tomorrow——”  “i think we had best go today my dear” says my lady castlewood “we might have the coach and sleep at hounslow and reach home tomorrow ’tis twelve o’clock bid the coach cousin be ready at one”  “for shame” burst out beatrix in a passion of tears and mortification “you disgrace me by your cruel precautions my own mother is the first to suspect me and would take me away as my gaoler i will not go with you mother i will go as no one’s prisoner if i wanted to deceive do you think i could find no means of evading you my family suspects me as those mistrust me that ought to love me most let me leave them i will go but i will go alone to castlewood be it i have been unhappy there and lonely enough let me go back but spare me at least the humiliation of setting a watch over my misery which is a trial i can’t bear let me go when you will but alone or not at all you three can stay and triumph over my unhappiness and i will bear it as i have borne it before let my gaolerinchief go order the coach that is to take me away i thank you henry esmond for your share in the conspiracy all my life long i’ll thank you and remember you and you brother and you mother how shall i show my gratitude to you for your careful defence of my honour”  she swept out of the room with the air of an empress flinging glances of defiance at us all and leaving us conquerors of the field but scared and almost ashamed of our victory it did indeed seem hard and cruel that we three should have conspired the banishment and humiliation of that fair creature we looked at each other in silence ’twas not the first stroke by many of our actions in that unlucky time which being done we wished undone we agreed it was best she should go alone speaking stealthily to one another and under our breaths like persons engaged in an act they felt ashamed in doing  in a halfhour it might be after our talk she came back her countenance wearing the same defiant air which it had borne when she left us she held a shagreencase in her hand esmond knew it as containing his diamonds which he had given to her for her marriage with duke hamilton and which she had worn so splendidly on the inauspicious night of the prince’s arrival “i have brought back” says she “to the marquis of esmond the present he deigned to make me in days when he trusted me better than now i will never accept a benefit or a kindness from henry esmond more and i give back these family diamonds which belonged to one king’s mistress to the gentleman that suspected i would be another have you been upon your message of coachcaller my lord marquis will you send your valet to see that i do not run away” we were right yet by her manner she had put us all in the wrong we were conquerors yet the honours of the day seemed to be with the poor oppressed girl  that luckless box containing the stones had first been ornamented with a baron’s coronet when beatrix was engaged to the young gentleman from whom she parted and afterwards the gilt crown of a duchess figured on the cover which also poor beatrix was destined never to wear lady castlewood opened the case mechanically and scarce thinking what she did and behold besides the diamonds esmond’s present there lay in the box the enamelled miniature of the late duke which beatrix had laid aside with her mourning when the king came into the house and which the poor heedless thing very likely had forgotten  “do you leave this too beatrix” says her mother taking the miniature out and with a cruelty she did not very often show but there are some moments when the tenderest women are cruel and some triumphs which angels can’t forgo19  having delivered this stab lady esmond was frightened at the effect of her blow it went to poor beatrix’s heart she flushed up and passed a handkerchief across her eyes and kissed the miniature and put it into her bosom—“i had forgot it” says she “my injury made me forget my grief my mother has recalled both to me farewell mother i think i never can forgive you something hath broke between us that no tears nor years can repair i always said i was alone you never loved me never—and were jealous of me from the time i sat on my father’s knee let me go away the sooner the better i can bear to be with you no more”  “go child” says her mother still very stern “go and bend your proud knees and ask forgiveness go pray in solitude for humility and repentance ’tis not your reproaches that make me unhappy ’tis your hard heart my poor beatrix may god soften it and teach you one day to feel for your mother”  if my mistress was cruel at least she never could be got to own as much her haughtiness quite overtopped beatrix’s and if the girl had a proud spirit i very much fear it came to her by inheritance    chapter xi our guest quits us as not being hospitable enough   beatrix’s departure took place within an hour her maid going with her in the postchaise and a man armed on the coachbox to prevent any danger of the road esmond and frank thought of escorting the carriage but she indignantly refused their company and another man was sent to follow the coach and not to leave it till it had passed over hounslow heath on the next day and these two forming the whole of lady castle wood’s male domestics mr esmond’s faithful john lockwood came to wait on his mistress during their absence though he would have preferred to escort mrs lucy his sweetheart on her journey into the country  we had a gloomy and silent meal it seemed as if a darkness was over the house since the bright face of beatrix had been withdrawn from it in the afternoon came a message from the favourite to relieve us somewhat from this despondency “the queen hath been much shaken” the note said “she is better now and all things will go well let my lord castlewood be ready against we send for him”  at night there came a second billet “there hath been a great battle in council lord treasurer hath broke his staff and hath fallen never to rise again no successor is appointed lord b—— receives a great whig company tonight at golden square if he is trimming others are true the queen hath no more fits but is abed now and more quiet be ready against morning when i still hope all will be well”  the prince came home shortly after the messenger who bore this billet had left the house his royal highness was so much the better for the bishop’s liquor that to talk affairs to him now was of little service he was helped to the royal bed he called castlewood familiarly by his own name he quite forgot the part upon the acting of which his crown his safety depended ’twas lucky that my lady castlewood’s servants were out of the way and only those heard him who would not betray him he inquired after the adorable beatrix with a royal hiccup in his voice he was easily got to bed and in a minute or two plunged in that deep slumber and forgetfulness with which bacchus rewards the votaries of that god we wished beatrix had been there to see him in his cups we regretted perhaps that she was gone  one of the party at kensington square was fool enough to ride to hounslow that night coram latronibus and to the inn which the family used ordinarily in their journeys out of london esmond desired my landlord not to acquaint madam beatrix with his coming and had the grim satisfaction of passing by the door of the chamber where she lay with her maid and of watching her chariot set forth in the early morning he saw her smile and slip money into the man’s hand who was ordered to ride behind the coach as far as bagshot the road being open and the other servant armed it appeared she dispensed with the escort of a second domestic and this fellow bidding his young mistress adieu with many bows went and took a pot of ale in the kitchen and returned in company with his brother servant john coachman and his horses back to london  they were not a mile out of hounslow when the two worthies stopped for more drink and here they were scared by seeing colonel esmond gallop by them the man said in reply to colonel esmond’s stern question that his young mistress had sent her duty only that no other message she had had a very good night and would reach castlewood by nightfall the colonel had no time for further colloquy and galloped on swiftly to london having business of great importance there as my reader very well knoweth the thought of beatrix riding away from the danger soothed his mind not a little his horse was at kensington square honest dapple knew the way thither well enough before the tipsy guest of last night was awake and sober  the account of the previous evening was known all over the town early next day a violent altercation had taken place before the queen in the councilchamber and all the coffeehouses had their version of the quarrel the news brought my lord bishop early to kensington square where he awaited the waking of his royal master above stairs and spoke confidently of having him proclaimed as prince of wales and heir to the throne before that day was over the bishop had entertained on the previous afternoon certain of the most influential gentlemen of the true british party his royal highness had charmed all both scots and english papists and churchmen “even quakers” says he “were at our meeting and if the stranger took a little too much british punch and ale he will soon grow more accustomed to those liquors and my lord castlewood” says the bishop with a laugh “must bear the cruel charge of having been for once in his life a little tipsy he toasted your lovely sister a dozen times at which we all laughed” says the bishop “admiring so much fraternal affection—where is that charming nymph and why doth she not adorn your ladyship’s teatable with her bright eyes” her ladyship said drily that beatrix was not at home that morning my lord bishop was too busy with great affairs to trouble himself much about the presence or absence of any lady however beautiful  we were yet at table when dr a—— came from the palace with a look of great alarm the shocks the queen had had the day before had acted on her severely he had been sent for and had ordered her to be blooded the surgeon of long acre had come to cup the queen and her majesty was now more easy and breathed more freely what made us start at the name of mr aymé “il faut être aimable pour être aimé” says the merry doctor esmond pulled his sleeve and bade him hush it was to aymé’s house after his fatal duel that my dear lord castlewood frank’s father had been carried to die  no second visit could be paid to the queen on that day at any rate and when our guest above gave his signal that he was awake the doctor the bishop and colonel esmond waited upon the prince’s levee and brought him their news cheerful or dubious the doctor had to go away presently but promised to keep the prince constantly acquainted with what was taking place at the palace hard by his counsel was and the bishop’s that as soon as ever the queen’s malady took a favourable turn the prince should be introduced to her bedside the council summoned the guard at kensington and st james’s of which two regiments were to be entirely relied on and one known not to be hostile would declare for the prince as the queen would before the lords of her council designating him as the heir to her throne  with locked doors and colonel esmond acting as secretary the prince and his lordship of rochester passed many hours of this day composing proclamations and addresses to the country to the scots to the clergy to the people of london and england announcing the arrival of the exile descendant of three sovereigns and his acknowledgement by his sister as heir to the throne every safeguard for their liberties the church and people could ask was promised to them the bishop could answer for the adhesion of very many prelates who besought of their flocks and brother ecclesiastics to recognize the sacred right of the future sovereign and to purge the country of the sin of rebellion  during the composition of these papers more messengers than one came from the palace regarding the state of the august patient there lying at midday she was somewhat better at evening the torpor again seized her and she wandered in her mind at night dr a—— was with us again with a report rather more favourable no instant danger at any rate was apprehended in the course of the last two years her majesty had had many attacks similar but more severe  by this time we had finished a halfdozen of proclamations the wording of them so as to offend no parties and not to give umbrage to whigs or dissenters required very great caution and the young prince who had indeed shown during a long day’s labour both alacrity at seizing the information given him and ingenuity and skill in turning the phrases which were to go out signed by his name here exhibited a good humour and thoughtfulness that ought to be set down to his credit  “were these papers to be mislaid” says he “or our scheme to come to mishap my lord esmond’s writing would bring him to a place where i heartily hope never to see him and so by your leave i will copy the papers myself though i am not very strong in spelling and if they are found they will implicate none but the person they most concern” and so having carefully copied the proclamations out the prince burned those in colonel esmond’s handwriting “and now and now gentlemen” says he “let us go to supper and drink a glass with the ladies my lord esmond you will sup with us tonight you have given us of late too little of your company”  the prince’s meals were commonly served in the chamber which had been beatrix’s bedroom adjoining that in which he slept and the dutiful practice of his entertainers was to wait until their royal guest bade them take their places at table before they sat down to partake of the meal on this night as you may suppose only frank castlewood and his mother were in waiting when the supper was announced to receive the prince who had passed the whole of the day in his own apartment with the bishop as his minister of state and colonel esmond officiating as secretary of his council  the prince’s countenance wore an expression by no means pleasant when looking towards the little company assembled and waiting for him he did not see beatrix’s bright face there as usual to greet him he asked lady esmond for his fair introducer of yesterday her ladyship only cast her eyes down and said quietly beatrix could not be of the supper that night nor did she show the least sign of confusion whereas castlewood turned red and esmond was no less embarrassed i think women have an instinct of dissimulation they know by nature how to disguise their emotions far better than the most consummate male courtiers can do is not the better part of the life of many of them spent in hiding their feelings in cajoling their tyrants in masking over with fond smiles and artful gaiety their doubt or their grief or their terror  our guest swallowed his supper very sulky it was not till the second bottle his highness began to rally when lady castlewood asked leave to depart he sent a message to beatrix hoping she would be present at the next day’s dinner and applied himself to drink and to talk afterwards for which there was subject in plenty  the next day we heard from our informer at kensington that the queen was somewhat better and had been up for an hour though she was not well enough yet to receive any visitor  at dinner a single cover was laid for his royal highness and the two gentlemen alone waited on him we had had a consultation in the morning with lady castlewood in which it had been determined that should his highness ask further questions about beatrix he should be answered by the gentlemen of the house  he was evidently disturbed and uneasy looking towards the door constantly as if expecting some one there came however nobody except honest john lockwood when he knocked with a dish which those within took from him so the meals were always arranged and i believe the council in the kitchen were of opinion that my young lord had brought over a priest who had converted us all into papists and that papists were like jews eating together and not choosing to take their meals in the sight of christians  the prince tried to cover his displeasure he was but a clumsy dissembler at that time and when out of humour could with difficulty keep a serene countenance and having made some foolish attempts at trivial talk he came to his point presently and in as easy a manner as he could saying to lord castlewood he hoped he requested his lordship’s mother and sister would be of the supper that night as the time hung heavy on him and he must not go abroad would not miss beatrix hold him company at a game of cards  at this looking up at esmond and taking the signal from him lord castlewood informed his royal highness20 that his sister beatrix was not at kensington and that her family had thought it best she should quit the town  “not at kensington” says he “is she ill she was well yesterday wherefore should she quit the town is it at your orders my lord or colonel esmond’s who seems the master of this house”  “not of this sir” says frank very nobly “only of our house in the country which he hath given to us this is my mother’s house and walcote is my father’s and the marquis of esmond knows he hath but to give his word and i return his to him”  “the marquis of esmond—the marquis of esmond” says the prince tossing off a glass “meddles too much with my affairs and presumes on the service he hath done me if you want to carry your suit with beatrix my lord by blocking her up in gaol let me tell you that is not the way to win a woman”  “i was not aware sir that i had spoken of my suit to madam beatrix to your royal highness”  “bah bah monsieur we need not be a conjurer to see that it makes itself seen at all moments you are jealous my lord and the maid of honour cannot look at another face without yours beginning to scowl that which you do is unworthy monsieur is inhospitable—is is lâche yes lâche” he spoke rapidly in french his rage carrying him away with each phrase “i come to your house i risk my life i pass it in ennui i repose myself on your fidelity i have no company but your lordship’s sermons or the conversations of that adorable young lady and you take her from me and you you rest merci monsieur i shall thank you when i have the means i shall know to recompense a devotion a little importunate my lord—a little importunate for a month past your airs of protector have annoyed me beyond measure you deign to offer me the crown and bid me take it on my knees like king john—eh i know my history monsieur and mock myself of frowning barons i admire your mistress and you send her to a bastile of the province i enter your house and you mistrust me i will leave it monsieur from tonight i will leave it i have other friends whose loyalty will not be so ready to question mine if i have garters to give away ’tis to noblemen who are not so ready to think evil bring me a coach and let me quit this place or let the fair beatrix return to it i will not have your hospitality at the expense of the freedom of that fair creature”  this harangue was uttered with rapid gesticulations such as the french use and in the language of that nation the prince striding up and down the room his face flushed and his hands trembling with anger he was very thin and frail from repeated illness and a life of pleasure either castlewood or esmond could have broke him across their knee and in half a minute’s struggle put an end to him and here he was insulting us both and scarce deigning to hide from the two whose honour it most concerned the passion he felt for the young lady of our family my lord castlewood replied to the prince’s tirade very nobly and simply  “sir” says he “your royal highness is pleased to forget that others risk their lives and for your cause very few englishmen please god would dare to lay hands on your sacred person though none would ever think of respecting ours our family’s lives are at your service and everything we have except our honour”  “honour bah sir who ever thought of hurting your honour” says the prince with a peevish air  “we implore your royal highness never to think of hurting it” says lord castlewood with a low bow the night being warm the windows were open both towards the gardens and the square colonel esmond heard through the closed door the voice of the watchman calling the hour in the square on the other side he opened the door communicating with the prince’s room martin the servant that had rode with beatrix to hounslow was just going out of the chamber as esmond entered it and when the fellow was gone and the watchman again sang his cry of “past ten o’clock and a starlight night” esmond spoke to the prince in a low voice and said—“your royal highness hears that man”  “après monsieur” says the prince  “i have but to beckon him from the window and send him fifty yards and he returns with a guard of men and i deliver up to him the body of the person calling himself james the third for whose capture parliament hath offered a reward of 5000l as your royal highness saw on our ride from rochester i have but to say the word and by the heaven that made me i would say it if i thought the prince for his honour’s sake would not desist from insulting ours but the first gentleman of england knows his duty too well to forget himself with the humblest or peril his crown for a deed that were shameful if it were done”  “has your lordship anything to say” says the prince turning to frank castlewood and quite pale with anger “any threat or any insult with which you would like to end this agreeable night’s entertainment”  “i follow the head of our house” says castlewood bowing gravely “at what time shall it please the prince that we should wait upon him in the morning”  “you will wait on the bishop of rochester early you will bid him bring his coach hither and prepare an apartment for me in his own house or in a place of safety the king will reward you handsomely never fear for all you have done in his behalf i wish you a good night and shall go to bed unless it pleases the marquis of esmond to call his colleague the watchman and that i should pass the night with the kensington guard fare you well be sure i will remember you my lord castlewood i can go to bed tonight without need of a chamberlain” and the prince dismissed us with a grim bow locking one door as he spoke that into the suppingroom and the other through which we passed after us it led into the small chamber which frank castlewood or monsieur baptiste occupied and by which martin entered when colonel esmond but now saw him in the chamber  at an early hour next morning the bishop arrived and was closeted for some time with his master in his own apartment where the prince laid open to his counsellor the wrongs which according to his version he had received from the gentlemen of the esmond family the worthy prelate came out from the conference with an air of great satisfaction he was a man full of resources and of a most assured fidelity and possessed of genius and a hundred good qualities but captious and of a most jealous temper that could not help exulting at the downfall of any favourite and he was pleased in spite of himself to hear that the esmond ministry was at an end  “i have soothed your guest” says he coming out to the two gentlemen and the widow who had been made acquainted with somewhat of the dispute of the night before by the version we gave her the prince was only made to exhibit anger because we doubted of his intentions in respect to beatrix and to leave us because we questioned his honour “but i think all things considered ’tis as well he should leave this house and then my lady castlewood” says the bishop “my pretty beatrix may come back to it”  “she is quite as well at home at castlewood” esmond’s mistress said “till everything is over”  “you shall have your title esmond that i promise you” says the good bishop assuming the airs of a prime minister “the prince hath expressed himself most nobly in regard of the little difference of last night and i promise you he hath listened to my sermon as well as to that of other folks” says the doctor archly “he hath every great and generous quality with perhaps a weakness for the sex which belongs to his family and hath been known in scores of popular sovereigns from king david downwards”  “my lord my lord” breaks out lady esmond “the levity with which you speak of such conduct towards our sex shocks me and what you call weakness i call deplorable sin”  “sin it is my dear creature” says the bishop with a shrug taking snuff “but consider what a sinner king solomon was and in spite of a thousand of wives too”  “enough of this my lord” says lady castlewood with a fine blush and walked out of the room very stately  the prince entered it presently with a smile on his face and if he felt any offence against us on the previous night at present exhibited none he offered a hand to each gentleman with great courtesy “if all your bishops preach so well as dr atterbury” says he “i don’t know gentlemen what may happen to me i spoke very hastily my lords last night and ask pardon of both of you but i must not stay any longer” says he “giving umbrage to good friends or keeping pretty girls away from their homes my lord bishop hath found a safe place for me hard by at a curate’s house whom the bishop can trust and whose wife is so ugly as to be beyond all danger we will decamp into those new quarters and i leave you thanking you for a hundred kindnesses here where is my hostess that i may bid her farewell to welcome her in a house of my own soon i trust where my friends shall have no cause to quarrel with me”  lady castlewood arrived presently blushing with great grace and tears filling her eyes as the prince graciously saluted her she looked so charming and young that the doctor in his bantering way could not help speaking of her beauty to the prince whose compliment made her blush and look more charming still    chapter xii a great scheme and who balked it   as characters written with a secret ink come out with the application of fire and disappear again and leave the paper white so soon as it is cool a hundred names of men high in repute and favouring the prince’s cause that were writ in our private lists would have been visible enough on the great roll of the conspiracy had it ever been laid open under the sun what crowds would have pressed forward and subscribed their names and protested their loyalty when the danger was over what a number of whigs now high in place and creatures of the allpowerful minister scorned mr walpole then if ever a match was gained by the manliness and decision of a few at a moment of danger if ever one was lost by the treachery and imbecility of those that had the cards in their hands and might have played them it was in that momentous game which was enacted in the next three days and of which the noblest crown in the world was the stake  from the conduct of my lord bolingbroke those who were interested in the scheme we had in hand saw pretty well that he was not to be trusted should the prince prevail it was his lordship’s gracious intention to declare for him should the hanoverian party bring in their sovereign who more ready to go on his knee and cry “god save king george” and he betrayed the one prince and the other but exactly at the wrong time when he should have struck for king james he faltered and coquetted with the whigs and having committed himself by the most monstrous professions of devotion which the elector rightly scorned he proved the justness of their contempt for him by flying and taking renegado service with st germains just when he should have kept aloof and that court despised him as the manly and resolute men who established the elector in england had before done he signed his own name to every accusation of insincerity his enemies made against him and the king and the pretender alike could show proofs of st john’s treachery under his own hand and seal  our friends kept a pretty close watch upon his motions as on those of the brave and hearty whig party that made little concealment of theirs they would have in the elector and used every means in their power to effect their end my lord marlborough was now with them his expulsion from power by the tories had thrown that great captain at once on the whig side we heard he was coming from antwerp and in fact on the day of the queen’s death he once more landed on english shore a great part of the army was always with their illustrious leader even the tories in it were indignant at the injustice of the persecution which the whig officers were made to undergo the chiefs of these were in london and at the head of them one of the most intrepid men in the world the scots duke of argyle whose conduct on the second day after that to which i have now brought down my history ended as such honesty and bravery deserved to end by establishing the present royal race on the english throne  meanwhile there was no slight difference of opinion amongst the councillors surrounding the prince as to the plan his highness should pursue his female minister at court fancying she saw some amelioration in the queen was for waiting a few days or hours it might be until he could be brought to her bedside and acknowledged as her heir mr esmond was for having him march thither escorted by a couple of troops of horse guards and openly presenting himself to the council during the whole of the night of the 29th30th july the colonel was engaged with gentlemen of the military profession whom ’tis needless here to name suffice it to say that several of them had exceeding high rank in the army and one of them in especial was a general who when he heard the duke of marlborough was coming on the other side waved his crutch over his head with a huzzah at the idea that he should march out and engage him of the three secretaries of state we knew that one was devoted to us the governor of the tower was ours the two companies on duty at kensington barrack were safe and we had intelligence very speedy and accurate of all that took place at the palace within  at noon on the 30th of july a message came to the prince’s friends that the committee of council was sitting at kensington palace their graces of ormonde and shrewsbury the archbishop of canterbury and the three secretaries of state being there assembled in an hour afterwards hurried news was brought that the two great whig dukes argyle and somerset had broke into the councilchamber without a summons and taken their seat at table after holding a debate there the whole party proceeded to the chamber of the queen who was lying in great weakness but still sensible and the lords recommended his grace of shrewsbury as the fittest person to take the vacant place of lord treasurer her majesty gave him the staff as all know “and now” writ my messenger from court “now or never is the time”  now or never was the time indeed in spite of the whig dukes our side had still the majority in the council and esmond to whom the message had been brought the personage at court not being aware that the prince had quitted his lodging in kensington square and esmond’s gallant young aide de camp frank castlewood putting on sword and uniform took a brief leave of their dear lady who embraced and blessed them both and went to her chamber to pray for the issue of the great event which was then pending  castlewood sped to the barrack to give warning to the captain of the guard there and then went to the “king’s arms” tavern at kensington where our friends were assembled having come by parties of twos and threes riding or in coaches and were got together in the upper chamber fiftythree of them their servants who had been instructed to bring arms likewise being below in the garden of the tavern where they were served with drink out of this garden is a little door that leads into the road of the palace and through this it was arranged that masters and servants were to march when that signal was given and that personage appeared for whom all were waiting there was in our company the famous officer next in command to the captaingeneral of the forces his grace the duke of ormonde who was within at the council there were with him two more lieutenantgenerals nine majorgenerals and brigadiers seven colonels eleven peers of parliament and twentyone members of the house of commons the guard was with us within and without the palace the queen was with us the council save the two whig dukes that must have succumbed the day was our own and with a beating heart esmond walked rapidly to the mall of kensington where he had parted with the prince on the night before for three nights the colonel had not been to bed the last had been passed summoning the prince’s friends together of whom the great majority had no sort of inkling of the transaction pending until they were told that he was actually on the spot and were summoned to strike the blow the night before and after the altercation with the prince my gentleman having suspicions of his royal highness and fearing lest he should be minded to give us the slip and fly off after his fugitive beauty had spent if the truth must be told at the “greyhound” tavern over against my lady esmond’s house in kensington square with an eye on the door lest the prince should escape from it the night before that he had passed in his boots at the “crown” at hounslow where he must watch forsooth all night in order to get one moment’s glimpse of beatrix in the morning and fate had decreed that he was to have a fourth night’s ride and wakefulness before his business was ended  he ran to the curate’s house in kensington mall and asked for mr bates the name the prince went by the curate’s wife said mr bates had gone abroad very early in the morning in his boots saying he was going to the bishop of rochester’s house at chelsea but the bishop had been at kensington himself two hours ago to seek for mr bates and had returned in his coach to his own house when he heard that the gentleman was gone thither to seek him  this absence was most unpropitious for an hour’s delay might cost a kingdom esmond had nothing for it but to hasten to the “king’s arms” and tell the gentlemen there assembled that mr george as we called the prince there was not at home but that esmond would go fetch him and taking a general’s coach that happened to be there esmond drove across the country to chelsea to the bishop’s house there  the porter said two gentlemen were with his lordship and esmond ran past this sentry up to the locked door of the bishop’s study at which he rattled and was admitted presently of the bishop’s guests one was a brother prelate and the other the abbé g——  “where is mr george” says mr esmond “now is the time” the bishop looked scared “i went to his lodging” he said “and they told me he was come hither i returned as quick as coach would carry me and he hath not been here”  the colonel burst out with an oath that was all he could say to their reverences ran down the stairs again and bidding the coachman an old friend and fellowcampaigner drive as if he was charging the french with his master at wynendael—they were back at kensington in half an hour  again esmond went to the curate’s house mr george had not returned the colonel had to go with this blank errand to the gentlemen at the “king’s arms” that were grown very impatient by this time  out of the window of the tavern and looking over the gardenwall you can see the green before kensington palace the palace gate round which the ministers’ coaches were standing and the barrack building as we were looking out from this window in gloomy discourse we heard presently trumpets blowing and some of us ran to the window of the front room looking into the high street of kensington and saw a regiment of horse coming  “it’s ormonde’s guards” says one  “no by god it’s argyle’s old regiment” says my general clapping down his crutch  it was indeed argyle’s regiment that was brought from westminster and that took the place of the regiment at kensington on which we could rely  “oh harry” says one of the generals there present “you were born under an unlucky star i begin to think that there’s no mr george nor mr dragon either ’tis not the peerage i care for for our name is so ancient and famous that merely to be called lord lydiard would do me no good but ’tis the chance you promised me of fighting marlborough”  as we were talking castlewood entered the room with a disturbed air  “what news frank” says the colonel “is mr george coming at last”  “damn him look here” says castlewood holding out a paper “i found it in the book—the what you call it eikum basilikum—that villain martin put it there—he said his young mistress bade him it was directed to me but it was meant for him i know and i broke the seal and read it”  the whole assembly of officers seemed to swim away before esmond’s eyes as he read the paper all that was written on it was—“beatrix esmond is sent away to prison to castlewood where she will pray for happier days”  “can you guess where he is” says castlewood  “yes” says colonel esmond he knew full well frank knew full well our instinct told whither that traitor had fled  he had courage to turn to the company and say “gentlemen i fear very much that mr george will not be here today something hath happened—and—and—i very much fear some accident may befall him which must keep him out of the way having had your noon’s draught you had best pay the reckoning and go home there can be no game where there is no one to play it”  some of the gentlemen went away without a word others called to pay their duty to her majesty and ask for her health the little army disappeared into the darkness out of which it had been called there had been no writings no paper to implicate any man some few officers and members of parliament had been invited overnight to breakfast at the “king’s arms” at kensington and they had called for their bill and gone home    chapter xiii august 1st 1714   “does my mistress know of this” esmond asked of frank as they walked along  “my mother found the letter in the book on the toilettable she had writ it ere she had left home” frank said “mother met her on the stairs with her hand upon the door trying to enter and never left her after that till she went away he did not think of looking at it there nor had martin the chance of telling him i believe the poor devil meant no harm though i half killed him he thought ’twas to beatrix’s brother he was bringing the letter”  frank never said a word of reproach to me for having brought the villain amongst us as we knocked at the door i said “when will the horses be ready” frank pointed with his cane they were turning the street that moment  we went up and bade adieu to our mistress she was in a dreadful state of agitation by this time and that bishop was with her whose company she was so fond of  “did you tell him my lord” says esmond “that beatrix was at castlewood” the bishop blushed and stammered  “well” says he “i——”  “you served the villain right” broke out mr esmond “and he has lost a crown by what you told him”  my mistress turned quite white “henry henry” says she “do not kill him”  “it may not be too late” says esmond “he may not have gone to castlewood pray god it is not too late” the bishop was breaking out with some banales phrases about loyalty and the sacredness of the sovereign’s person but esmond sternly bade him hold his tongue burn all papers and take care of lady castlewood and in five minutes he and frank were in the saddle john lockwood behind them riding towards castlewood at a rapid pace  we were just got to alton when who should meet us but old lockwood the porter from castlewood john’s father walking by the side of the hexham flyingcoach who slept the night at alton lockwood said his young mistress had arrived at home on wednesday night and this morning friday had dispatched him with a packet for my lady at kensington saying the letter was of great importance  we took the freedom to break it while lockwood stared with wonder and cried out his “lord bless me’s” and “who’d a thought it’s” at the sight of his young lord whom he had not seen these seven years  the packet from beatrix contained no news of importance at all it was written in a jocular strain affecting to make light of her captivity she asked whether she might have leave to visit mrs tusher or to walk beyond the court and the gardenwall she gave news of the peacocks and a fawn she had there she bade her mother send her certain gowns and smocks by old lockwood she sent her duty to a certain person if certain other persons permitted her to take such a freedom how that as she was not able to play cards with him she hoped he would read good books such as dr atterbury’s sermons and eikon basilike she was going to read good books she thought her pretty mamma would like to know she was not crying her eyes out  “who is in the house besides you lockwood” says the colonel  “there be the laundrymaid and the kitchenmaid madam beatrix’s maid the man from london and that be all and he sleepeth in my lodge away from the maids” says old lockwood  esmond scribbled a line with a pencil on the note giving it to the old man and bidding him go on to his lady we knew why beatrix had been so dutiful on a sudden and why she spoke of eikon basilike she writ this letter to put the prince on the scent and the porter out of the way  “we have a fine moonlight night for riding on” says esmond “frank we may reach castlewood in time yet” all the way along they made inquiries at the posthouses when a tall young gentleman in a grey suit with a lightbrown periwig just the colour of my lord’s had been seen to pass he had set off at six that morning and we at three in the afternoon he rode almost as quickly as we had done he was seven hours ahead of us still when we reached the last stage  we rode over castlewood downs before the breaking of dawn we passed the very spot where the car was upset fourteen years since and mohun lay the village was not up yet nor the forge lighted as we rode through it passing by the elms where the rooks were still roosting and by the church and over the bridge we got off our horses at the bridge and walked up to the gate  “if she is safe” says frank trembling and his honest eyes filling with tears “a silver statue to our lady” he was going to rattle at the great iron knocker on the oak gate but esmond stopped his kinsman’s hand he had his own fears his own hopes his own despairs and griefs too but he spoke not a word of these to his companion or showed any signs of emotion  he went and tapped at the little window at the porter’s lodge gently but repeatedly until the man came to the bars  “who’s there” says he looking out it was the servant from kensington  “my lord castlewood and colonel esmond” we said from below “open the gate and let us in without any noise”  “my lord castlewood” says the other “my lord’s here and in bed”  “open d—n you” says castlewood with a curse  “i shall open to no one” says the man shutting the glass window as frank drew a pistol he would have fired at the porter but esmond again held his hand  “there are more ways than one” says he “of entering such a great house as this” frank grumbled that the west gate was half a mile round “but i know of a way that’s not a hundred yards off” says mr esmond and leading his kinsman close along the wall and by the shrubs which had now grown thick on what had been an old moat about the house they came to the buttress at the side of which the little window was which was father holt’s private door esmond climbed up to this easily broke a pane that had been mended and touched the spring inside and the two gentlemen passed in that way treading as lightly as they could and so going through the passage into the court over which the dawn was now reddening and where the fountain plashed in the silence  they sped instantly to the porter’s lodge where the fellow had not fastened his door that led into the court and pistol in hand came upon the terrified wretch and bade him be silent then they asked him esmond’s head reeled and he almost fell as he spoke when lord castlewood had arrived he said on the previous evening about eight of the clock—“and what then”—his lordship supped with his sister—“did the man wait” yes he and my lady’s maid both waited the other servants made the supper and there was no wine and they could give his lordship but milk at which he grumbled and—and madam beatrix kept miss lucy always in the room with her and there being a bed across the court in the chaplain’s room she had arranged my lord was to sleep there madam beatrix had come downstairs laughing with the maids and had locked herself in and my lord had stood for a while talking to her through the door and she laughing at him and then he paced the court awhile and she came again to the upper window and my lord implored her to come down and walk in the room but she would not and laughed at him again and shut the window and so my lord uttering what seemed curses but in a foreign language went to the chaplain’s room to bed  “was this all”—“all” the man swore upon his honour “all as he hoped to be saved—stop there was one thing more my lord on arriving and once or twice during supper did kiss his sister as was natural and she kissed him” at this esmond ground his teeth with rage and wellnigh throttled the amazed miscreant who was speaking whereas castlewood seizing hold of his cousin’s hand burst into a great fit of laughter  “if it amuses thee” says esmond in french “that your sister should be exchanging of kisses with a stranger i fear poor beatrix will give thee plenty of sport”—esmond darkly thought how hamilton ashburnham had before been masters of those roses that the young prince’s lips were now feeding on he sickened at that notion her cheek was desecrated her beauty tarnished shame and honour stood between it and him the love was dead within him had she a crown to bring him with her love he felt that both would degrade him  but this wrath against beatrix did not lessen the angry feelings of the colonel against the man who had been the occasion if not the cause of the evil frank sat down on a stone bench in the courtyard and fairly fell asleep while esmond paced up and down the court debating what should ensue what mattered how much or how little had passed between the prince and the poor faithless girl they were arrived in time perhaps to rescue her person but not her mind had she not instigated the young prince to come to her suborned servants dismissed others so that she might communicate with him the treacherous heart within her had surrendered though the place was safe and it was to win this that he had given a life’s struggle and devotion this that she was ready to give away for the bribe of a coronet or a wink of the prince’s eye  when he had thought his thoughts out he shook up poor frank from his sleep who rose yawning and said he had been dreaming of clotilda “you must back me” says esmond “in what i am going to do i have been thinking that yonder scoundrel may have been instructed to tell that story and that the whole of it may be a lie if it be we shall find it out from the gentleman who is asleep yonder see if the door leading to my lady’s rooms” so we called the rooms at the northwest angle of the house “see if the door is barred as he saith” we tried it was indeed as the lackey had said closed within  “it may have been open and shut afterwards” says poor esmond “the foundress of our family let our ancestor in that way”  “what will you do harry if—if what that fellow saith should turn out untrue” the young man looked scared and frightened into his kinsman’s face i dare say it wore no very pleasant expression  “let us first go see whether the two stories agree” says esmond and went in at the passage and opened the door into what had been his own chamber now for wellnigh fiveandtwenty years a candle was still burning and the prince asleep dressed on the bed—esmond did not care for making a noise the prince started up in his bed seeing two men in his chamber “qui est là” says he and took a pistol from under his pillow  “it is the marquis of esmond” says the colonel “come to welcome his majesty to his house of castlewood and to report of what hath happened in london pursuant to the king’s orders i passed the night before last after leaving his majesty in waiting upon the friends of the king it is a pity that his majesty’s desire to see the country and to visit our poor house should have caused the king to quit london without notice yesterday when the opportunity happened which in all human probability may not occur again and had the king not chosen to ride to castlewood the prince of wales might have slept at st james’s”  “’sdeath gentlemen” says the prince starting off his bed whereon he was lying in his clothes “the doctor was with me yesterday morning and after watching by my sister all night told me i might not hope to see the queen”  “it would have been otherwise” says esmond with another bow “as by this time the queen may be dead in spite of the doctor the council was met a new treasurer was appointed the troops were devoted to the king’s cause and fifty loyal gentlemen of the greatest names of this kingdom were assembled to accompany the prince of wales who might have been the acknowledged heir of the throne or the possessor of it by this time had your majesty not chosen to take the air we were ready there was only one person that failed us your majesty’s gracious——”  “morbleu monsieur you give me too much majesty” said the prince who had now risen up and seemed to be looking to one of us to help him to his coat but neither stirred  “we shall take care” says esmond “not much oftener to offend in that particular”  “what mean you my lord” says the prince and muttered something about a guetàpens which esmond caught up  “the snare sir” said he “was not of our laying it is not we that invited you we came to avenge and not to compass the dishonour of our family”  “dishonour morbleu there has been no dishonour” says the prince turning scarlet “only a little harmless playing”  “that was meant to end seriously”  “i swear” the prince broke out impetuously “upon the honour of a gentleman my lords——”  “that we arrived in time no wrong hath been done frank” says colonel esmond turning round to young castlewood who stood at the door as the talk was going on “see here is a paper whereon his majesty hath deigned to commence some verses in honour or dishonour of beatrix here is madame and flamme cruelle and rebelle and amour and jour in the royal writing and spelling had the gracious lover been happy he had not passed his time in sighing” in fact and actually as he was speaking esmond cast his eyes down towards the table and saw a paper on which my young prince had been scrawling a madrigal that was to finish his charmer on the morrow  “sir” says the prince burning with rage he had assumed his royal coat unassisted by this time “did i come here to receive insults”  “to confer them may it please your majesty” says the colonel with a very low bow “and the gentlemen of our family are come to thank you”  “malédiction” says the young man tears starting into his eyes with helpless rage and mortification “what will you with me gentlemen”  “if your majesty will please to enter the next apartment” says esmond preserving his grave tone “i have some papers there which i would gladly submit to you and by your permission i will lead the way” and taking the taper up and backing before the prince with very great ceremony mr esmond passed into the little chaplain’s room through which we had just entered into the house—“please to set a chair for his majesty frank” says the colonel to his companion who wondered almost as much at this scene and was as much puzzled by it as the other actor in it then going to the crypt over the mantelpiece the colonel opened it and drew thence the papers which so long had lain there  “here may it please your majesty” says he “is the patent of marquis sent over by your royal father at st germains to viscount castlewood my father here is the witnessed certificate of my father’s marriage to my mother and of my birth and christening i was christened of that religion of which your sainted sire gave all through life so shining example these are my titles dear frank and this what i do with them here go baptism and marriage and here the marquisate and the august signmanual with which your predecessor was pleased to honour our race” and as esmond spoke he set the papers burning in the brasier “you will please sir to remember” he continued “that our family hath ruined itself by fidelity to yours that my grandfather spent his estate and gave his blood and his son to die for your service that my dear lord’s grandfather for lord you are now frank by right and title too died for the same cause that my poor kinswoman my father’s second wife after giving away her honour to your wicked perjured race sent all her wealth to the king and got in return that precious title that lies in ashes and this inestimable yard of blue ribbon i lay this at your feet and stamp upon it i draw this sword and break it and deny you and had you completed the wrong you designed us by heaven i would have driven it through your heart and no more pardoned you than your father pardoned monmouth frank will do the same won’t you cousin”  frank who had been looking on with a stupid air at the papers as they flamed in the old brasier took out his sword and broke it holding his head down—“i go with my cousin” says he giving esmond a grasp of the hand “marquis or not by —— i stand by him any day i beg your majesty’s pardon for swearing that is—that is—i’m for the elector of hanover it’s all your majesty’s own fault the queen’s dead most likely by this time and you might have been king if you hadn’t come dangling after ’trix”  “thus to lose a crown” says the young prince starting up and speaking french in his eager way “to lose the loveliest woman in the world to lose the loyalty of such hearts as yours is not this my lords enough of humiliation—marquis if i go on my knees will you pardon me—no i can’t do that but i can offer you reparation that of honour that of gentlemen favour me by crossing the sword with mine yours is broke—see yonder in the armoire are two” and the prince took them out as eager as a boy and held them towards esmond—“ah you will merci monsieur merci”  extremely touched by this immense mark of condescension and repentance for wrong done colonel esmond bowed down so low as almost to kiss the gracious young hand that conferred on him such an honour and took his guard in silence the swords were no sooner met than castlewood knocked up esmond’s with the blade of his own which he had broke off short at the shell and the colonel falling back a step dropped his point with another very low bow and declared himself perfectly satisfied  “eh bien vicomte” says the young prince who was a boy and a french boy “il ne nous reste qu’une chose à faire” he placed his sword upon the table and the fingers of his two hands upon his breast—“we have one more thing to do” says he “you do not divine it” he stretched out his arms—“embrassons nous”  the talk was scarce over when beatrix entered the room—what came she to seek there she started and turned pale at the sight of her brother and kinsman drawn swords broken swordblades and papers yet smouldering in the brasier  “charming beatrix” says the prince with a blush which became him very well “these lords have come ahorseback from london where my sister lies in a despaired state and where her successor makes himself desired pardon me for my escapade of last evening i had been so long a prisoner that i seized the occasion of a promenade on horseback and my horse naturally bore me towards you i found you a queen in your little court where you deigned to entertain me present my homages to your maids of honour i sighed as you slept under the window of your chamber and then retired to seek rest in my own it was there that these gentlemen agreeably roused me yes milords for that is a happy day that makes a prince acquainted at whatever cost to his vanity with such a noble heart as that of the marquis of esmond mademoiselle may we take your coach to town i saw it in the hangar and this poor marquis must be dropping with sleep”  “will it please the king to breakfast before he goes” was all beatrix could say the roses had shuddered out of her cheeks her eyes were glaring she looked quite old she came up to esmond and hissed out a word or two—“if i did not love you before cousin” says she “think how i love you now” if words could stab no doubt she would have killed esmond she looked at him as if she could  but her keen words gave no wound to mr esmond his heart was too hard as he looked at her he wondered that he could ever have loved her his love of ten years was over it fell down dead on the spot at the kensington tavern where frank brought him the note out of eikon  basilike the prince blushed and bowed low as she gazed at him and quitted the chamber i have never seen her from that day  horses were fetched and put to the chariot presently my lord rode outside and as for esmond he was so tired that he was no sooner in the carriage than he fell asleep and never woke till night as the coach came into alton  as we drove to the “bell inn” comes a mitred coach with our old friend lockwood beside the coachman my lady castlewood and the bishop were inside she gave a little scream when she saw us the two coaches entered the inn almost together the landlord and people coming out with lights to welcome the visitors  we in our coach sprang out of it as soon as ever we saw the dear lady and above all the doctor in his cassock what was the news was there yet time was the queen alive these questions were put hurriedly as boniface stood waiting before his noble guests to bow them up the stair  “is she safe” was what lady castlewood whispered in a flutter to esmond  “all’s well thank god” says he as the fond lady took his hand and kissed it and called him her preserver and her dear she wasn’t thinking of queens and crowns  the bishop’s news was reassuring at least all was not lost the queen yet breathed or was alive when they left london six hours since “it was lady castlewood who insisted on coming” the doctor said argyle had marched up regiments from portsmouth and sent abroad for more the whigs were on the alert a pest on them i am not sure but the bishop swore as he spoke and so too were our people and all might be saved if only the prince could be at london in time we called for horses instantly to return to london we never went up poor crestfallen boniface’s stairs but into our coaches again the prince and his prime minister in one esmond in the other with only his dear mistress as a companion  castlewood galloped forwards on horseback to gather the prince’s friends and warn them of his coming we travelled through the night esmond discoursing to his mistress of the events of the last twentyfour hours of castlewood’s ride and his of the prince’s generous behaviour and their reconciliation the night seemed short enough and the starlit hours passed away serenely in that fond company  so we came along the road the bishop’s coach heading ours and with some delays in procuring horses we got to hammersmith about four o’clock on sunday morning the first of august and half an hour after it being then bright day we rode by my lady warwick’s house and so down the street of kensington  early as the hour was there was a bustle in the street and many people moving to and fro round the gate leading to the palace where the guard is there was especially a great crowd and the coach ahead of us stopped and the bishop’s man got down to know what the concourse meant  there presently came from out of the gate horse guards with their trumpets and a company of heralds with their tabards the trumpets blew and the heraldatarms came forward and proclaimed george by the grace of god of great britain france and ireland king defender of the faith and the people shouted “god save the king”  among the crowd shouting and waving their hats i caught sight of one sad face which i had known all my life and seen under many disguises it was no other than poor mr holt’s who had slipped over to england to witness the triumph of the good cause and now beheld its enemies victorious amidst the acclamations of the english people the poor fellow had forgot to huzzah or to take his hat off until his neighbours in the crowd remarked his want of loyalty and cursed him for a jesuit in disguise when he ruefully uncovered and began to cheer sure he was the most unlucky of men he never played a game but he lost it or engaged in a conspiracy but ’twas certain to end in defeat i saw him in flanders after this whence he went to rome to the head quarters of his order and actually reappeared among us in america very old and busy and hopeful i am not sure that he did not assume the hatchet and moccasins there and attired in a blanket and warpaint skulk about a missionary amongst the indians he lies buried in our neighbouring province of maryland now with a cross over him and a mound of earth above him under which that unquiet spirit is for ever at peace                      with the sound of king george’s trumpets all the vain hopes of the weak and foolish young pretender were blown away and with that music too i may say the drama of my own life was ended that happiness which hath subsequently crowned it cannot be written in words ’tis of its nature sacred and secret and not to be spoken of though the heart be ever so full of thankfulness save to heaven and the one ear alone—to one fond being the truest and tenderest and purest wife ever man was blessed with as i think of the immense happiness which was in store for me and of the depth and intensity of that love which for so many years hath blessed me i own to a transport of wonder and gratitude for such a boon—nay am thankful to have been endowed with a heart capable of feeling and knowing the immense beauty and value of the gift which god hath bestowed upon me sure love vincit omnia is immeasurably above all ambition more precious than wealth more noble than name he knows not life who knows not that he hath not felt the highest faculty of the soul who hath not enjoyed it in the name of my wife i write the completion of hope and the summit of happiness to have such a love is the one blessing in comparison of which all earthly joy is of no value and to think of her is to praise god  it was at bruxelles whither we retreated after the failure of our plot—our whig friends advising us to keep out of the way—that the great joy of my life was bestowed upon me and that my dear mistress became my wife we had been so accustomed to an extreme intimacy and confidence and had lived so long and tenderly together that we might have gone on to the end without thinking of a closer tie but circumstances brought about that event which so prodigiously multiplied my happiness and hers for which i humbly thank heaven although a calamity befell us which i blush to think hath occurred more than once in our house i know not what infatuation of ambition urged the beautiful and wayward woman whose name hath occupied so many of these pages and who was served by me with ten years of such a constant fidelity and passion but ever after that day at castlewood when we rescued her she persisted in holding all her family as her enemies and left us and escaped to france to what a fate i disdain to tell nor was her son’s house a home for my dear mistress my poor frank was weak as perhaps all our race hath been and led by women those around him were imperious and in a terror of his mother’s influence over him lest he should recant and deny the creed which he had adopted by their persuasion the difference of their religion separated the son and the mother my dearest mistress felt that she was severed from her children and alone in the world—alone but for one constant servant on whose fidelity praised be heaven she could count ’twas after a scene of ignoble quarrel on the part of frank’s wife and mother for the poor lad had been made to marry the whole of that german family with whom he had connected himself that i found my mistress one day in tears and then besought her to confide herself to the care and devotion of one who by god’s help would never forsake her and then the tender matron as beautiful in her autumn and as pure as virgins in their spring with blushes of love and “eyes of meek surrender” yielded to my respectful importunity and consented to share my home let the last words i write thank her and bless her who hath blessed it  by the kindness of mr addison all danger of prosecution and every obstacle against our return to england was removed and my son frank’s gallantry in scotland made his peace with the king’s government but we two cared no longer to live in england and frank formally and joyfully yielded over to us the possession of that estate which we now occupy far away from europe and its troubles on the beautiful banks of the potomac where we have built a new castlewood and think with grateful hearts of our old home in our transatlantic country we have a season the calmest and most delightful of the year which we call the indian summer i often say the autumn of our life resembles that happy and serene weather and am thankful for its rest and its sweet sunshine heaven hath blessed us with a child which each parent loves for her resemblance to the other our diamonds are turned into ploughs and axes for our plantations and into negroes the happiest and merriest i think in all this country and the only jewel by which my wife sets any store and from which she hath never parted is that gold button she took from my arm on the day when she visited me in prison and which she wore ever after as she told me on the tenderest heart in the world     appendix   book i

books that i ask permission to speak to you and in doing so you are aware that i cannot hope to entertain you with a merely humorous or facetious story harlequin without his mask is known to present a very sober countenance and was himself the story goes the melancholy patient whom the doctor advised to go and see harlequin21—a man full of cares and perplexities like the rest of us whose self must always be serious to him under whatever mask or disguise or uniform he presents it to the public and as all of you here must needs be grave when you think of your own past and present you will not look to find in the histories of those whose lives and feelings i am going to try and describe to you a story that is otherwise than serious and often very sad if humour only meant laughter you would scarcely feel more interest about humorous writers than about the private life of poor harlequin just mentioned who possesses in common with these the power of making you laugh but the men regarding whose lives and stories your kind presence here shows that you have curiosity and sympathy appeal to a great number of our other faculties besides our mere sense of ridicule the humorous writer professes to awaken and direct your love your pity your kindness—your scorn for untruth pretension imposture—your tenderness for the weak the poor the oppressed the unhappy to the best of his means and ability he comments on all the ordinary actions and passions of life almost he takes upon himself to be the weekday preacher so to speak accordingly as he finds and speaks and feels the truth best we regard him esteem him—sometimes love him and as his business is to mark other people’s lives and peculiarities we moralize upon his life when he is gone—and yesterday’s preacher becomes the text for today’s sermon  of english parents and of a good english family of clergymen22 swift was born in dublin in 1667 seven months after the death of his father who had come to practise there as a lawyer the boy went to school at kilkenny and afterwards to trinity college dublin where he got a degree with difficulty and was wild and witty and poor in 1688 by the recommendation of his mother swift was received into the family of sir william temple who had known mrs swift in ireland he left his patron in 1693 and the next year took orders in dublin but he threw up the small irish preferment which he got and returned to temple in whose family he remained until sir william’s death in 1699 his hopes of advancement in england failing swift returned to ireland and took the living of laracor hither he invited hester johnson23 temple’s natural daughter with whom he had contracted a tender friendship while they were both dependants of temple’s and with an occasional visit to england swift now passed nine years at home  in 1709 he came to england and with a brief visit to ireland during which he took possession of his deanery of st patrick he now passed five years in england taking the most distinguished part in the political transactions which terminated with the death of queen anne after her death his party disgraced and his hopes of ambition over swift returned to dublin where he remained twelve years in this time he wrote the famous drapier’s letters and gulliver’s travels he married hester johnson stella and buried esther vanhomrigh vanessa who had followed him to ireland from london where she had contracted a violent passion for him in 1726 and 1727 swift was in england which he quitted for the last time on hearing of his wife’s illness stella died in january 1728 and swift not until 1745 having passed the last five of the seventyeight years of his life with an impaired intellect and keepers to watch him24  you know of course that swift has had many biographers his life has been told by the kindest and most goodnatured of men scott who admires but can’t bring himself to love him and by stout old johnson25 who forced to admit him into the company of poets receives the famous irishman and takes off his hat to him with a bow of surly recognition scans him from head to foot and passes over to the other side of the street dr wilde of dublin26 who has written a most interesting volume on the closing years of swift’s life calls johnson “the most malignant of his biographers” it is not easy for an english critic to please irishmen—perhaps to try and please them and yet johnson truly admires swift johnson does not quarrel with swift’s change of politics or doubt his sincerity of religion about the famous stella and vanessa controversy the doctor does not bear very hardly on swift but he could not give the dean that honest hand of his the stout old man puts it into his breast and moves off from him27  would we have liked to live with him that is a question which in dealing with these people’s works and thinking of their lives and peculiarities every reader of biographies must put to himself would you have liked to be a friend of the great dean i should like to have been shakespeare’s shoeblack—just to have lived in his house just to have worshipped him—to have run on his errands and seen that sweet serene face i should like as a young man to have lived on fielding’s staircase in the temple and after helping him up to bed perhaps and opening his door with his latchkey to have shaken hands with him in the morning and heard him talk and crack jokes over his breakfast and his mug of small beer who would not give something to pass a night at the club with johnson and goldsmith and james boswell esq of auchinleck the charm of addison’s companionship and conversation has passed to us by fond tradition—but swift if you had been his inferior in parts and that with a great respect for all persons present i fear is only very likely his equal in mere social station he would have bullied scorned and insulted you if undeterred by his great reputation you had met him like a man he would have quailed before you28 and not had the pluck to reply and gone home and years after written a foul epigram about you—watched for you in a sewer and come out to assail you with a coward’s blow and a dirty bludgeon if you had been a lord with a blue ribbon who flattered his vanity or could help his ambition he would have been the most delightful company in the world he would have been so manly so sarcastic so bright odd and original that you might think he had no object in view but the indulgence of his humour and that he was the most reckless simple creature in the world how he would have torn your enemies to pieces for you and made fun of the opposition his servility was so boisterous that it looked like independence29 he would have done your errands but with the air of patronizing you and after fighting your battles masked in the street or the press would have kept on his hat before your wife and daughters in the drawingroom content to take that sort of pay for his tremendous services as a bravo30  he says as much himself in one of his letters to bolingbroke—“all my endeavours to distinguish myself were only for want of a great title and fortune that i might be used like a lord by those who have an opinion of my parts whether right or wrong is no great matter and so the reputation of wit and great learning does the office of a blue ribbon or a coachandsix”31  could there be a greater candour it is an outlaw who says “these are my brains with these i’ll win titles and compete with fortune these are my bullets these i’ll turn into gold” and he hears the sound of coachesandsix takes the road like macheath and makes society stand and deliver they are all on their knees before him down go my lord bishop’s apron and his grace’s blue ribbon and my lady’s brocade petticoat in the mud he eases the one of a living the other of a patent place the third of a little snug post about the court and gives them over to followers of his own the great prize has not come yet the coach with the mitre and crosier in it which he intends to have for his share has been delayed on the way from st james’s and he waits and waits until nightfall when his runners come and tell him that the coach has taken a different road and escaped him so he fires his pistols into the air with a curse and rides away into his own country32  swift’s seems to me to be as good a name to point a moral or adorn a tale of ambition as any hero’s that ever lived and failed but we must remember that the morality was lax—that other gentlemen besides himself took the road in his day—that public society was in a strange disordered condition and the state was ravaged by other condottieri the boyne was being fought and won and lost—the bells rung in william’s victory in the very same tone with which they would have pealed for james’s men were loose upon politics and had to shift for themselves they as well as old beliefs and institutions had lost their moorings and gone adrift in the storm as in the south sea bubble almost everybody gambled as in the railway mania—not many centuries ago—almost every one took his unlucky share a man of that time of the vast talents and ambition of swift could scarce do otherwise than grasp at his prize and make his spring at his opportunity his bitterness his scorn his rage his subsequent misanthropy are ascribed by some panegyrists to a deliberate conviction of mankind’s unworthiness and a desire to amend them by castigating his youth was bitter as that of a great genius bound down by ignoble ties and powerless in a mean dependence his age was bitter33 like that of a great genius that had fought the battle and nearly won it and lost it and thought of it afterwards writhing in a lonely exile a man may attribute to the gods if he likes what is caused by his own fury or disappointment or selfwill what public man—what statesman projecting a coup—what king determined on an invasion of his neighbour—what satirist meditating an onslaught on society or an individual can’t give a pretext for his move there was a french general the other day who proposed to march into this country and put it to sack and pillage in revenge for humanity outraged by our conduct at copenhagen—there is always some excuse for men of the aggressive turn they are of their nature warlike predatory eager for fight plunder dominion34  as fierce a beak and talon as ever struck—as strong a wing as ever beat belonged to swift i am glad for one that fate wrested the prey out of his claws and cut his wings and chained him one can gaze and not without awe and pity at the lonely eagle chained behind the bars  that swift was born at no 7 hoey’s court dublin on the 30th november 1667 is a certain fact of which nobody will deny the sister island the honour and glory but it seems to me he was no more an irishman than a man born of english parents at calcutta is a hindoo35 goldsmith was an irishman and always an irishman steele was an irishman and always an irishman swift’s heart was english and in england his habits english his logic eminently english his statement is elaborately simple he shuns tropes and metaphors and uses his ideas and words with a wise thrift and economy as he used his money with which he could be generous and splendid upon great occasions but which he husbanded when there was no need to spend it he never indulges in needless extravagance of rhetoric lavish epithets profuse imagery he lays his opinion before you with a grave simplicity and a perfect neatness36 dreading ridicule too as a man of his humour—above all an englishman of his humour—certainly would he is afraid to use the poetical power which he really possessed one often fancies in reading him that he dares not be eloquent when he might that he does not speak above his voice as if were and the tone of society  his initiation into politics his knowledge of business his knowledge of polite life his acquaintance with literature even which he could not have pursued very sedulously during that reckless career at dublin swift got under the roof of sir william temple he was fond of telling in afterlife what quantities of books he devoured there and how king william taught him to cut asparagus in the dutch fashion it was at shene and at moor park with a salary of twenty pounds and a dinner at the upper servants’ table that this great and lonely swift passed a ten years’ apprenticeship—wore a cassock that was only not a livery—bent down a knee as proud as lucifer’s to supplicate my lady’s good graces or run on his honour’s errands37 it was here as he was writing at temple’s table or following his patron’s walk that he saw and heard the men who had governed the great world—measured himself with them looking up from his silent corner gauged their brains weighed their wits turned them and tried them and marked them ah what platitudes he must have heard what feeble jokes what pompous commonplaces what small men they must have seemed under those enormous periwigs to the swarthy uncouth silent irish secretary i wonder whether it ever struck temple that that irishman was his master i suppose that dismal conviction did not present itself under the ambrosial wig or temple could never have lived with swift swift sickened rebelled left the service—ate humble pie and came back again and so for ten years went on gathering learning swallowing scorn and submitting with a stealthy rage to his fortune  temple’s style is the perfection of practised and easy goodbreeding if he does not penetrate very deeply into a subject he professes a very gentlemanly acquaintance with it if he makes rather a parade of latin it was the custom of his day as it was the custom for a gentleman to envelop his head in a periwig and his hands in lace ruffles if he wears buckles and squaretoed shoes he steps in them with a consummate grace and you never hear their creak or find them treading upon any lady’s train or any rival’s heels in the court crowd when that grows too hot or too agitated for him he politely leaves it he retires to his retreat of shene or moor park and lets the king’s party and the prince of orange’s party battle it out among themselves he reveres the sovereign and no man perhaps ever testified to his loyalty by so elegant a bow he admires the prince of orange but there is one person whose ease and comfort he loves more than all the princes in christendom and that valuable member of society is himself gulielmus temple baronettus one sees him in his retreat between his studychair and his tulipbeds38 clipping his apricots and pruning his essays—the statesman the ambassador no more but the philosopher the epicurean the fine gentleman and courtier at st james’s as at shene where in place of kings and fair ladies he pays his court to the ciceronian majesty or walks a minuet with the epic muse or dallies by the south wall with the ruddy nymph of gardens  temple seems to have received and exacted a prodigious deal of veneration from his household and to have been coaxed and warmed and cuddled by the people round about him as delicately as any of the plants which he loved when he fell ill in 1693 the household was aghast at his indisposition mild dorothea his wife the best companion of the best of men—       mild dorothea peaceful wise and great     trembling beheld the doubtful hand of fate   as for dorinda his sister—       those who would grief describe might come and trace     its watery footsteps in dorinda’s face     to see her weep joy every face forsook     and grief flung sables on each menial look     the humble tribe mourned for the quickening soul     that furnished life and spirit through the whole   isn’t that line in which grief is described as putting the menials into a mourning livery a fine image one of the menials wrote it who did not like that temple livery nor those twentypound wages cannot one fancy the uncouth young servitor with downcast eyes books and papers in hand following at his honour’s heels in the garden walk or taking his honour’s orders as he stands by the great chair where sir william has the gout and his feet all blistered with moxa when sir william has the gout or scolds it must be hard work at the second table39 the irish secretary owned as much afterwards and when he came to dinner how he must have lashed and growled and torn the household with his gibes and scorn what would the steward say about the pride of them irish schollards—and this one had got no great credit even at his irish college if the truth were known—and what a contempt his excellency’s own gentleman must have had for parson teague from dublin the valets and chaplains were always at war it is hard to say which swift thought the more contemptible and what must have been the sadness the sadness and terror of the housekeeper’s little daughter with the curling black ringlets and the sweet smiling face when the secretary who teaches her to read and write and whom she loves and reverences above all things—above mother above mild dorothea above that tremendous sir william in his squaretoes and periwig—when mr swift comes down from his master with rage in his heart and has not a kind word even for little hester johnson  perhaps for the irish secretary his excellency’s condescension was even more cruel than his frowns sir william would perpetually quote latin and the ancient classics à propos of his gardens and his dutch statues and platesbandes and talk about epicurus and diogenes laertius julius caesar semiramis and the gardens of the hesperides maecenas strabo describing jericho and the assyrian kings a propos of beans he would mention pythagoras’s precept to abstain from beans and that this precept probably meant that wise men should abstain from public affairs he is a placid epicurean he is a pythagorean philosopher he is a wise man—that is the deduction does not swift think so one can imagine the downcast eyes lifted up for a moment and the flash of scorn which they emit swift’s eyes were as azure as the heavens pope says nobly as everything pope said and thought of his friend was good and noble “his eyes are as azure as the heavens and have a charming archness in them” and one person in that household that pompous stately kindly moor park saw heaven nowhere else  but the temple amenities and solemnities did not agree with swift he was halfkilled with a surfeit of shene pippins and in a gardenseat which he devised for himself at moor park and where he devoured greedily the stock of books within his reach he caught a vertigo and deafness which punished and tormented him through life he could not bear the place or the servitude even in that poem of courtly condolence from which we have quoted a few lines of mock melancholy he breaks out of the funereal procession with a mad shriek as it were and rushes away crying his own grief cursing his own fate foreboding madness and forsaken by fortune and even hope  i don’t know anything more melancholy than the letter to temple in which after having broke from his bondage the poor wretch crouches piteously towards his cage again and deprecates his master’s anger he asks for testimonials for orders “the particulars required of me are what relate to morals and learning—and the reasons of quitting your honour’s family—that is whether the last was occasioned by any ill action they are left entirely to your honour’s mercy though in the first i think i cannot reproach myself for anything further than for infirmities this is all i dare at present beg from your honour under circumstances of life not worth your regard what is left me to wish next to the health and prosperity of your honour and family is that heaven would one day allow me the opportunity of leaving my acknowledgements at your feet i beg my most humble duty and service be presented to my ladies your honour’s lady and sister”—can prostration fall deeper could a slave bow lower40  twenty years afterwards bishop kennet describing the same man says “dr swift came into the coffeehouse and had a bow from everybody but me when i came to the antechamber at court to wait before prayers dr swift was the principal man of talk and business he was soliciting the earl of arran to speak to his brother the duke of ormond to get a place for a clergyman he was promising mr thorold to undertake with my lord treasurer that he should obtain a salary of 200l per annum as member of the english church at rotterdam he stopped f gwynne esq going in to the queen with the red bag and told him aloud he had something to say to him from my lord treasurer he took out his gold watch and telling the time of day complained that it was very late a gentleman said he was too fast ‘how can i help it’ says the doctor ‘if the courtiers give me a watch that won’t go right’ then he instructed a young nobleman that the best poet in england was mr pope a papist who had begun a translation of homer into english for which he would have them all subscribe ‘for’ says he ‘he shall not begin to print till i have a thousand guineas for him’41 lord treasurer after leaving the queen came through the room beckoning dr swift to follow him—both went off just before prayers” there’s a little malice in the bishop’s “just before prayers”  this picture of the great dean seems a true one and is harsh though not altogether unpleasant he was doing good and to deserving men too in the midst of these intrigues and triumphs his journals and a thousand anecdotes of him relate his kind acts and rough manners his hand was constantly stretched out to relieve an honest man—he was cautious about his money but ready—if you were in a strait would you like such a benefactor i think i would rather have had a potato and a friendly word from goldsmith than have been beholden to the dean for a guinea and a dinner42 he insulted a man as he served him made women cry guests look foolish bullied unlucky friends and flung his benefactions into poor men’s faces no the dean was no irishman—no irishman ever gave but with a kind word and a kind heart  it is told as if it were to swift’s credit that the dean of st patrick’s performed his family devotions every morning regularly but with such secrecy that the guests in his house were never in the least aware of the ceremony there was no need surely why a church dignitary should assemble his family privily in a crypt and as if he was afraid of heathen persecution but i think the world was right and the bishops who advised queen anne when they counselled her not to appoint the author of the tale of a tub to a bishopric gave perfectly good advice the man who wrote the arguments and illustrations in that wild book could not but be aware what must be the sequel of the propositions which he laid down the boon companion of pope and bolingbroke who chose these as the friends of his life and the recipients of his confidence and affection must have heard many an argument and joined in many a conversation over pope’s port or st john’s burgundy which would not bear to be repeated at other men’s boards  i know of few things more conclusive as to the sincerity of swift’s religion than his advice to poor john gay to turn clergyman and look out for a seat on the bench gay the author of the beggar’s opera—gay the wildest of the wits about town—it was this man that jonathan swift advised to take orders—to invest in a cassock and bands—just as he advised him to husband his shillings and put his thousand pounds out at interest43 the queen and the bishops and the world were right in mistrusting the religion of that man  i am not here of course to speak of any man’s religious views except in so far as they influence his literary character his life his humour the most notorious sinners of all those fellow mortals whom it is our business to discuss—harry fielding and dick steele were especially loud and i believe really fervent in their expressions of belief they belaboured freethinkers and stoned imaginary atheists on all sorts of occasions going out of their way to bawl their own creed and persecute their neighbour’s and if they sinned and stumbled as they constantly did with debt with drink with all sorts of bad behaviour they got up on their knees and cried “peccavi” with a most sonorous orthodoxy yes poor harry fielding and poor dick steele were trusty and undoubting church of england men they abhorred popery atheism and wooden shoes and idolatries in general and hiccupped “church and state” with fervour  but swift his mind had had a different schooling and possessed a very different logical power he was not bred up in a tipsy guardroom and did not learn to reason in a covent garden tavern he could conduct an argument from beginning to end he could see forward with a fatal clearness in his old age looking at the tale of a tub when he said “good god what a genius i had when i wrote that book” i think he was admiring not the genius but the consequences to which the genius had brought him—a vast genius a magnificent genius a genius wonderfully bright and dazzling and strong—to seize to know to see to flash upon falsehood and scorch it into perdition to penetrate into the hidden motives and expose the black thoughts of men—an awful an evil spirit  ah man you educated in epicurean temple’s library you whose friends were pope and st john—what made you to swear to fatal vows and bind yourself to a lifelong hypocrisy before the heaven which you adored with such real wonder humility and reverence for swift was a reverent was a pious spirit—for swift could love and could pray through the storms and tempests of his furious mind the stars of religion and love break out in the blue shining serenely though hidden by the driving clouds and the maddened hurricane of his life  it is my belief that he suffered frightfully from the consciousness of his own scepticism and that he had bent his pride so far down as to put his apostasy out to hire44 the paper left behind him called thoughts on religion is merely a set of excuses for not professing disbelief he says of his sermons that he preached pamphlets they have scarce a christian characteristic they might be preached from the steps of a synagogue or the floor of a mosque or the box of a coffeehouse almost there is little or no cant—he is too great and too proud for that and in so far as the badness of his sermons goes he is honest but having put that cassock on it poisoned him he was strangled in his bands he goes through life tearing like a man possessed with a devil like abudah in the arabian story he is always looking out for the fury and knows that the night will come and the inevitable hag with it what a night my god it was what a lonely rage and long agony—what a vulture that tore the heart of that giant45 it is awful to think of the great sufferings of this great man through life he always seems alone somehow goethe was so i can’t fancy shakespeare otherwise the giants must live apart the kings can have no company but this man suffered so and deserved so to suffer one hardly reads anywhere of such a pain  the “saeva indignatio” of which he spoke as lacerating his heart and which he dares to inscribe on his tombstone—as if the wretch who lay under that stone waiting god’s judgement had a right to be angry—breaks out from him in a thousand pages of his writing and tears and rends him against men in office he having been overthrown against men in england he having lost his chance of preferment there the furious exile never fails to rage and curse is it fair to call the famous drapier’s letters patriotism they are masterpieces of dreadful humour and invective they are reasoned logically enough too but the proposition is as monstrous and fabulous as the lilliputian island it is not that the grievance is so great but there is his enemy—the assault is wonderful for its activity and terrible rage it is samson with a bone in his hand rushing on his enemies and felling them one admires not the cause so much as the strength the anger the fury of the champion as is the case with madmen certain subjects provoke him and awaken his fits of wrath marriage is one of these in a hundred passages in his writings he rages against it rages against children an object of constant satire even more contemptible in his eyes than a lord’s chaplain is a poor curate with a large family the idea of this luckless paternity never fails to bring down from him gibes and foul language could dick steele or goldsmith or fielding in his most reckless moment of satire have written anything like the dean’s famous “modest proposal” for eating children not one of these but melts at the thoughts of childhood fondles and caresses it mr dean has no such softness and enters the nursery with the tread and gaiety of an ogre46 “i have been assured” says he in the modest proposal “by a very knowing american of my acquaintance in london that a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food whether stewed roasted baked or boiled and i make no doubt it will equally serve in a ragoût” and taking up this pretty joke as his way is he argues it with perfect gravity and logic he turns and twists this subject in a score of different ways he hashes it and he serves it up cold and he garnishes it and relishes it always he describes the little animal as “dropped from its dam’” advising that the mother should let it suck plentifully in the last month so as to render it plump and fat for a good table “a child” says his reverence “will make two dishes at an entertainment for friends and when the family dines alone the fore or hind quarter will make a reasonable dish” and so on and the subject being so delightful that he can’t leave it—he proceeds to recommend in place of venison for squires’ tables “the bodies of young lads and maidens not exceeding fourteen or under twelve” amiable humourist laughing castigator of morals there was a process well known and practised in the dean’s gay days when a lout entered the coffeehouse the wags proceeded to what they called “roasting” him this is roasting a subject with a vengeance the dean had a native genius for it as the almanach des gourmands says on nait rôtisseur  and it was not merely by the sarcastic method that swift exposed the unreasonableness of loving and having children in gulliver the folly of love and marriage is urged by graver arguments and advice in the famous lilliputian kingdom swift speaks with approval of the practice of instantly removing children from their parents and educating them by the state and amongst his favourite horses a pair of foals are stated to be the very utmost a wellregulated equine couple would permit themselves in fact our great satirist was of opinion that conjugal love was unadvisable and illustrated the theory by his own practice and example—god help him—which made him about the most wretched being in god’s world47  the grave and logical conduct of an absurd proposition as exemplified in the cannibal proposal just mentioned is our author’s constant method through all his works of humour given a country of people six inches or sixty feet high and by the mere process of the logic a thousand wonderful absurdities are evolved at so many stages of the calculation turning to the first minister who waited behind him with a white staff near as tall as the mainmast of the royal sovereign the king of brobdingnag observes how contemptible a thing human grandeur is as represented by such a contemptible little creature as gulliver “the emperor of lilliput’s features are strong and masculine” what a surprising humour there is in this description—“the emperor’s features” gulliver says “are strong and masculine with an austrian lip an arched nose his complexion olive his countenance erect his body and limbs wellproportioned and his deportment majestic he is taller by the breadth of my nail than any of his court which alone is enough to strike an awe into beholders”  what a surprising humour there is in these descriptions how noble the satire is here how just and honest how perfect the image mr macaulay has quoted the charming lines of the poet where the king of the pygmies is measured by the same standard we have all read in milton of the spear that was like “the mast of some tall admiral” but these images are surely likely to come to the comic poet originally the subject is before him he is turning it in a thousand ways he is full of it the figure suggests itself naturally to him and comes out of his subject as in that wonderful passage when gulliver’s box having been dropped by the eagle into the sea and gulliver having been received into the ship’s cabin he calls upon the crew to bring the box into the cabin and put it on the table the cabin being only a quarter the size of the box it is the veracity of the blunder which is so admirable had a man come from such a country as brobdingnag he would have blundered so  but the best stroke of humour if there be a best in that abounding book is that where gulliver in the unpronounceable country describes his parting from his master the horse48 “i took” he says “a second leave of my master but as i was going to prostrate myself to kiss his hoof he did me the honour to raise it gently to my mouth i am not ignorant how much i have been censured for mentioning this last particular detractors are pleased to think it improbable that so illustrious a person should descend to give so great a mark of distinction to a creature so inferior as i neither am i ignorant how apt some travellers are to boast of extraordinary favours they have received but if these censurers were better acquainted with the noble and courteous disposition of the houyhnhnms they would soon change their opinion”  the surprise here the audacity of circumstantial evidence the astounding gravity of the speaker who is not ignorant how much he has been censured the nature of the favour conferred and the respectful exultation at the receipt of it are surely complete it is truth topsyturvy entirely logical and absurd  as for the humour and conduct of this famous fable i suppose there is no person who reads but must admire as for the moral i think it horrible shameful unmanly blasphemous and giant and great as this dean is i say we should hoot him some of this audience mayn’t have read the last part of gulliver and to such i would recall the advice of the venerable mr punch to persons about to marry and say “don’t” when gulliver first lands among the yahoos the naked howling wretches clamber up trees and assault him and he describes himself as “almost stifled with the filth which fell about him” the reader of the fourth part of gulliver’s travels is like the hero himself in this instance it is yahoo language a monster gibbering shrieks and gnashing imprecations against mankind—tearing down all shreds of modesty past all sense of manliness and shame filthy in word filthy in thought furious raging obscene  and dreadful it is to think that swift knew the tendency of his creed—the fatal rocks towards which his logic desperately drifted that last part of gulliver is only a consequence of what has gone before and the worthlessness of all mankind the pettiness cruelty pride imbecility the general vanity the foolish pretension the mock greatness the pompous dullness the mean aims the base successes—all these were present to him it was with the din of these curses of the world blasphemies against heaven shrieking in his ears that he began to write his dreadful allegory—of which the meaning is that man is utterly wicked desperate and imbecile and his passions are so monstrous and his boasted powers so mean that he is and deserves to be the slave of brutes and ignorance is better than his vaunted reason what had this man done what secret remorse was rankling at his heart what fever was boiling in him that he should see all the world bloodshot we view the world with our own eyes each of us and we make from within us the world we see a weary heart gets no gladness out of sunshine a selfish man is sceptical about friendship as a man with no ear doesn’t care for music a frightful selfconsciousness it must have been which looked on mankind so darkly through those keen eyes of swift  a remarkable story is told by scott of delany who interrupted archbishop king and swift in a conversation which left the prelate in tears and from which swift rushed away with marks of strong terror and agitation in his countenance upon which the archbishop said to delany “you have just met the most unhappy man on earth but on the subject of his wretchedness you must never ask a question”  the most unhappy man on earth—miserrimus—what a character of him and at this time all the great wits of england had been at his feet all ireland had shouted after him and worshipped as a liberator a saviour the greatest irish patriot and citizen dean drapier bickerstaff gulliver—the most famous statesmen and the greatest poets of his day had applauded him and done him homage and at this time writing over to bolingbroke from ireland he says “it is time for me to have done with the world and so i would if i could get into a better before i was called into the best and not to die here in a rage like a poisoned rat in a hole”  we have spoken about the men and swift’s behaviour to them and now it behoves us not to forget that there are certain other persons in the creation who had rather intimate relations with the great dean49 two women whom he loved and injured are known by every reader of books so familiarly that if we had seen them or if they had been relatives of our own we scarcely could have known them better who hasn’t in his mind an image of stella who does not love her fair and tender creature pure and affectionate heart boots it to you now that you have been at rest for a hundred and twenty years not divided in death from the cold heart which caused yours whilst it beat such faithful pangs of love and grief—boots it to you now that the whole world loves and deplores you scarce any man i believe ever thought of that grave that did not cast a flower of pity on it and write over it a sweet epitaph gentle lady so lovely so loving so unhappy you have had countless champions millions of manly hearts mourning for you from generation to generation we take up the fond tradition of your beauty we watch and follow your tragedy your bright morning love and purity your constancy your grief your sweet martyrdom we know your legend by heart you are one of the saints of english story  and if stella’s love and innocence are charming to contemplate i will say that in spite of illusage in spite of drawbacks in spite of mysterious separation and union of hope delayed and sickened heart—in the teeth of vanessa and that little episodical aberration which plunged swift into such woful pitfalls and quagmires of amorous perplexity—in spite of the verdicts of most women i believe who as far as my experience and conversation go generally take vanessa’s part in the controversy—in spite of the tears which swift caused stella to shed and the rocks and barriers which fate and temper interposed and which prevented the pure course of that true love from running smoothly—the brightest part of swift’s story the pure star in that dark and tempestuous life of swift’s is his love for hester johnson it has been my business professionally of course to go through a deal of sentimental reading in my time and to acquaint myself with lovemaking as it has been described in various languages and at various ages of the world and i know of nothing more manly more tender more exquisitely touching than some of these brief notes written in what swift calls “his little language” in his journal to stella50 he writes to her night and morning often he never sends away a letter to her but he begins a new one on the same day he can’t bear to let go her kind little hand as it were he knows that she is thinking of him and longing for him far away in dublin yonder he takes her letters from under his pillow and talks to them familiarly paternally with fond epithets and pretty caresses—as he would to the sweet and artless creature who loved him “stay” he writes one morning—it is the 14th of december 1710—“stay i will answer some of your letter this morning in bed—let me see come and appear little letter here i am says he and what say you to stella this morning fresh and fasting and can stella read this writing without hurting her dear eyes” he goes on after more kind prattle and fond whispering the dear eyes shine clearly upon him then—the good angel of his life is with him and blessing him ah it was a hard fate that wrung from them so many tears and stabbed pitilessly that pure and tender bosom a hard fate but would she have changed it i have heard a woman say that she would have taken swift’s cruelty to have had his tenderness he had a sort of worship for her whilst he wounded her he speaks of her after she is gone of her wit of her kindness of her grace of her beauty with a simple love and reverence that are indescribably touching in contemplation of her goodness his hard heart melts into pathos his cold rhyme kindles and glows into poetry and he falls down on his knees so to speak before the angel whose life he had embittered confesses his own wretchedness and unworthiness and adores her with cries of remorse and love—       when on my sickly couch i lay     impatient both of night and day     and groaning in unmanly strains     called every power to ease my pains     then stella ran to my relief     with cheerful face and inward grief     and though by heaven’s severe decree     she suffers hourly more than me     no cruel master could require     from slaves employed for daily hire     what stella by her friendship warmed     with vigour and delight performed     now with a soft and silent tread     unheard she moves about my bed     my sinking spirits now supplies     with cordials in her hands and eyes     best patron of true friends beware     you pay too dearly for your care     if while your tenderness secures     my life it must endanger yours     for such a fool was never found     who pulled a palace to the ground     only to have the ruins made     materials for a house decayed   one little triumph stella had in her life—one dear little piece of injustice was performed in her favour for which i confess for my part i can’t help thanking fate and the dean that other person was sacrificed to her—that—that young woman who lived five doors from dr swift’s lodgings in bury street and who flattered him and made love to him in such an outrageous manner—vanessa was thrown over  swift did not keep stella’s letters to him in reply to those he wrote to her51 he kept bolingbroke’s and pope’s and harley’s and peterborough’s but stella “very carefully” the lives say kept swift’s of course that is the way of the world and so we cannot tell what her style was or of what sort were the little letters which the doctor placed there at night and bade to appear from under his pillow of a morning but in letter iv of that famous collection he describes his lodging in bury street where he has the first floor a diningroom and bedchamber at eight shillings a week and in letter vi he says “he has visited a lady just come to town” whose name somehow is not mentioned and in letter viii he enters a query of stella’s—“what do you mean ‘that boards near me that i dine with now and then’ what the deuce you know whom i have dined with every day since i left you better than i do” of course she does of course swift has not the slightest idea of what she means but in a few letters more it turns out that the doctor has been to dine “gravely” with a mrs vanhomrigh then that he has been to “his neighbour” then that he has been unwell and means to dine for the whole week with his neighbour stella was quite right in her previsions she saw from the very first hint what was going to happen and scented vanessa in the air52 the rival is at the dean’s feet the pupil and teacher are reading together and drinking tea together and going to prayers together and learning latin together and conjugating amo amas amavi together the “little language” is over for poor stella by the rule of grammar and the course of conjugation doesn’t amavi come after amo and amas  the loves of cadenus and vanessa53 you may peruse in cadenus’s own poem on the subject and in poor vanessa’s vehement expostulatory verses and letters to him she adores him implores him admires him thinks him something godlike and only prays to be admitted to lie at his feet54 as they are bringing him home from church those divine feet of dr swift’s are found pretty often in vannessa’s parlour he likes to be admired and adored he finds miss vanhomrigh to be a woman of great taste and spirit and beauty and wit and a fortune too he sees her every day he does not tell stella about the business until the impetuous vanessa becomes too fond of him until the doctor is quite frightened by the young woman’s ardour and confounded by her warmth he wanted to marry neither of them—that i believe was the truth but if he had not married stella vanessa would have had him in spite of himself when he went back to ireland his ariadne not content to remain in her isle pursued the fugitive dean in vain he protested he vowed he soothed and bullied the news of the dean’s marriage with stella at last came to her and it killed her—she died of that passion55  and when she died and stella heard that swift had written beautifully regarding her “that doesn’t surprise me” said mrs stella “for we all know the dean could write beautifully about a broomstick” a woman—a true woman would you have had one of them forgive the other  in a note in his biography scott says that his friend dr tuke of dublin has a lock of stella’s hair enclosed in a paper by swift on which are written in the dean’s hand the words “only a woman’s hair” an instance says scott of the dean’s desire to veil his feelings under the mask of cynical indifference  see the various notions of critics do those words indicate indifference or an attempt to hide feeling did you ever hear or read four words more pathetic only a woman’s hair only love only fidelity only purity innocence beauty only the tenderest heart in the world stricken and wounded and passed away now out of reach of pangs of hope deferred love insulted and pitiless desertion—only that lock of hair left and memory and remorse for the guilty lonely wretch shuddering over the grave of his victim  and yet to have had so much love he must have given some treasures of wit and wisdom and tenderness too must that man have had locked up in the caverns of his gloomy heart and shown fitfully to one or two whom he took in there but it was not good to visit that place people did not remain there long and suffered for having been there56 he shrank away from all affections sooner or later stella and vanessa both died near him and away from him he had not heart enough to see them die he broke from his fastest friend sheridan he slunk away from his fondest admirer pope his laugh jars on one’s ear after sevenscore years he was always alone—alone and gnashing in the darkness except when stella’s sweet smile came and shone upon him when that went silence and utter night closed over him an immense genius an awful downfall and ruin so great a man he seems to me that thinking of him is like thinking of an empire falling we have other great names to mention—none i think however so great or so gloomy     lecture the second congreve and addison   a great number of years ago before the passing of the reform bill there existed at cambridge a certain debating club called the “union” and i remember that there was a tradition amongst the undergraduates who frequented that renowned school of oratory that the great leaders of the opposition and government had their eyes upon the university debating club and that if a man distinguished himself there he ran some chance of being returned to parliament as a great nobleman’s nominee so jones of john’s or thomson of trinity would rise in their might and draping themselves in their gowns rally round the monarchy or hurl defiance at priests and kings with the majesty of pitt or the fire of mirabeau fancying all the while that the great nobleman’s emissary was listening to the debate from the back benches where he was sitting with the family seat in his pocket indeed the legend said that one or two young cambridge men orators of the union were actually caught up thence and carried down to cornwall or old sarum and so into parliament and many a young fellow deserted the jogtrot university curriculum to hang on in the dust behind the fervid wheels of the parliamentary chariot  where i have often wondered were the sons of peers and members of parliament in anne’s and george’s time were they all in the army or hunting in the country or boxing the watch how was it that the young gentlemen from the university got such a prodigious number of places a lad composed a neat copy of verses at christchurch or trinity in which the death of a great personage was bemoaned the french king assailed the dutch or prince eugene complimented or the reverse and the party in power was presently to provide for the young poet and a commissionership or a post in the stamps or the secretaryship of an embassy or a clerkship in the treasury came into the bard’s possession a wonderful fruitbearing rod was that of busby’s what have men of letters got in our time think not only of swift a king fit to rule in any time or empire—but addison steele prior tickell congreve john gay john dennis and many others who got public employment and pretty little pickings out of the public purse57 the wits of whose names we shall treat in this lecture and two following all save one touched the king’s coin and had at some period of their lives a happy quarterday coming round for them  they all began at school or college in the regular way producing panegyrics upon public characters what were called odes upon public events battles sieges court marriages and deaths in which the gods of olympus and the tragic muse were fatigued with invocations according to the fashion of the time in france and in england “aid us mars bacchus apollo” cried addison or congreve singing of william or marlborough “accourez chastes nymphes de parnasse” says boileau celebrating the grand monarch “des sons que ma lyre enfante marquezen bien la cadence et vous vents faites silence je vais parler de  louis” schoolboys’ themes and foundation exercises are the only relics left now of this scholastic fashion the olympians are left quite undisturbed in their mountain what man of note what contributor to the poetry of a country newspaper would now think of writing a congratulatory ode on the birth of the heir to a dukedom or the marriage of a nobleman in the past century the young gentlemen of the universities all exercised themselves at these queer compositions and some got fame and some gained patrons and places for life and many more took nothing by these efforts of what they were pleased to call their muses  william congreve’s58 pindaric odes are still to be found in johnson’s poets that now unfrequented poets’ corner in which so many forgotten bigwigs have a niche—but though he was also voted to be one of the greatest tragic poets of any day it was congreve’s wit and humour which first recommended him to courtly fortune and it is recorded that his first play the old bachelor brought our author to the notice of that great patron of english muses charles montague lord halifax who being desirous to place so eminent a wit in a state of ease and tranquillity instantly made him one of the commissioners for licensing hackneycoaches bestowed on him soon after a place in the pipeoffice and likewise a post in the customhouse of the value of 600l  a commissionership of hackneycoaches—a post in the customhouse—a place in the pipeoffice and all for writing a comedy doesn’t it sound like a fable that place in the pipeoffice59 ah l’heureux temps que celui de ces fables men of letters there still be but i doubt whether any pipeoffices are left the public has smoked them long ago  words like men pass current for a while with the public and being known everywhere abroad at length take their places in society so even the most secluded and refined ladies here present will have heard the phrase from their sons or brothers at school and will permit me to call william congreve esquire the most eminent literary “swell” of his age in my copy of johnson’s lives congreve’s wig is the tallest and put on with the jauntiest air of all the laurelled worthies “i am the great mr congreve” he seems to say looking out from his voluminous curls people called him the great mr congreve60 from the beginning of his career until the end everybody admired him having got his education in ireland at the same school and college with swift he came to live in the middle temple london where he luckily bestowed no attention to the law but splendidly frequented the coffeehouses and theatres and appeared in the sidebox the tavern the piazza and the mall brilliant beautiful and victorious from the first everybody acknowledged the young chieftain the great mr dryden61 declared that he was equal to shakespeare and bequeathed to him his own undisputed poetical crown and writes of him “mr congreve has done me the favour to review the aeneis and compare my version with the original i shall never be ashamed to own that this excellent young man has showed me many faults which i have endeavoured to correct”  the “excellent young man” was but three or fourandtwenty when the great dryden thus spoke of him the greatest literary chief in england the veteran fieldmarshal of letters himself the marked man of all europe and the centre of a school of wits who daily gathered round his chair and tobaccopipe at will’s pope dedicated his iliad to him62 swift addison steele all acknowledge congreve’s rank and lavish compliments upon him voltaire went to wait upon him as on one of the representatives of literature—and the man who scarce praises any other living person who flung abuse at pope and swift and steele and addison—the grub street timon old john dennis63 was hat in hand to mr congreve and said that when he retired from the stage comedy went with him  nor was he less victorious elsewhere he was admired in the drawingrooms as well as the coffeehouses as much beloved in the sidebox as on the stage he loved and conquered and jilted the beautiful bracegirdle64 the heroine of all his plays the favourite of all the town of her day—and the duchess of marlborough marlborough’s daughter had such an admiration of him that when he died she had an ivory figure made to imitate him65 and a large wax doll with gouty feet to be dressed just as the great congreve’s gouty feet were dressed in his great lifetime he saved some money by his pipeoffice and his customhouse office and his hackneycoach office and nobly left it not to bracegirdle who wanted it66 but to the duchess of marlborough who didn’t67  how can i introduce to you that merry and shameless comic muse who won him such a reputation nell gwynn’s servant fought the other footman for having called his mistress a bad name and in like manner and with pretty like epithets jeremy collier attacked that godless reckless jezebel the english comedy of his time and called her what nell gwynn’s man’s fellowservants called nell gwynn’s man’s mistress the servants of the theatre dryden congreve68 and others defended themselves with the same success and for the same cause which set nell’s lackey fighting she was a disreputable daring laughing painted french baggage that comic muse she came over from the continent with charles who chose many more of his female friends there at the restoration—a wild dishevelled laïs with eyes bright with wit and wine—a saucy courtfavourite that sat at the king’s knees and laughed in his face and when she showed her bold cheeks at her chariotwindow had some of the noblest and most famous people of the land bowing round her wheel she was kind and popular enough that daring comedy that audacious poor nell—she was gay and generous kind frank as such people can afford to be and the men who lived with her and laughed with her took her pay and drank her wine turned out when the puritans hooted her to fight and defend her but the jade was indefensible and it is pretty certain her servants knew it  there is life and death going on in everything truth and lies always at battle pleasure is always warring against selfrestraint doubt is always crying psha and sneering a man in life a humourist in writing about life sways over to one principle or the other and laughs with the reverence for right and the love of truth in his heart or laughs at these from the other side didn’t i tell you that dancing was a serious business to harlequin i have read two or three of congreve’s plays over before speaking of him and my feelings were rather like those which i daresay most of us here have had at pompeii looking at sallust’s house and the relics of an orgy a dried winejar or two a charred suppertable the breast of a dancing girl pressed against the ashes the laughing skull of a jester a perfect stillness round about as the cicerone twangs his moral and the blue sky shines calmly over the ruin the congreve muse is dead and her song choked in time’s ashes we gaze at the skeleton and wonder at the life which once revelled in its mad veins we take the skull up and muse over the frolic and daring the wit scorn passion hope desire with which that empty bowl once fermented we think of the glances that allured the tears that melted of the bright eyes that shone in those vacant sockets and of lips whispering love and cheeks dimpling with smiles that once covered yon ghastly yellow framework they used to call those teeth pearls once see there’s the cup she drank from the gold chain she wore on her neck the vase which held the rouge for her cheeks her lookingglass and the harp she used to dance to instead of a feast we find a gravestone and in place of a mistress a few bones  reading in these plays now is like shutting your ears and looking at people dancing what does it mean the measures the grimaces the bowing shuffling and retreating the cavalier seul advancing upon those ladies—those ladies and men twirling round at the end in a mad galop after which everybody bows and the quaint rite is celebrated without the music we can’t understand that comic dance of the last century—its strange gravity and gaiety its decorum or its indecorum it has a jargon of its own quite unlike life a sort of moral of its own quite unlike life too i’m afraid it’s a heathen mystery symbolizing a pagan doctrine protesting as the pompeians very likely were assembled at their theatre and laughing at their games—as sallust and his friends and their mistresses protested—crowned with flowers with cups in their hands against the new hard ascetic pleasurehating doctrine whose gaunt disciples lately passed over from the asian shores of the mediterranean were for breaking the fair images of venus and flinging the altars of bacchus down  i fancy poor congreve’s theatre is a temple of pagan delights and mysteries not permitted except among heathens i fear the theatre carries down that ancient tradition and worship as masons have carried their secret signs and rites from temple to temple when the libertine hero carries off the beauty in the play and the dotard is laughed to scorn for having the young wife in the ballad when the poet bid his mistress to gather roses while she may and warns her that old time is still aflying in the ballet when honest corydon courts phillis under the treillage of the pasteboard cottage and leers at her over the head of grandpapa in red stockings who is opportunely asleep and when seduced by the invitations of the rosy youth she comes forward to the footlights and they perform on each other’s tiptoes that pas which you all know and which is only interrupted by old grandpapa awaking from his doze at the pasteboard chalet whither he returns to take another nap in case the young people get an encore when harlequin splendid in youth strength and agility arrayed in gold and a thousand colours springs over the heads of countless perils leaps down the throat of bewildered giants and dauntless and splendid dances danger down when mr punch that godless old rebel breaks every law and laughs at it with odious triumph outwits his lawyer bullies the beadle knocks his wife about the head and hangs the hangman—don’t you see in the comedy in the song in the dance in the ragged little punch’s puppetshow—the pagan protest doesn’t it seem as if life puts in its plea and sings its comment look how the lovers walk and hold each other’s hands and whisper sings the chorus—“there is nothing like love there is nothing like youth there is nothing like beauty of your springtime look how old age tries to meddle with merry sport beat him with his own crutch the wrinkled old dotard there is nothing like youth there is nothing like beauty there is nothing like strength strength and valour win beauty and youth be brave and conquer be young and happy enjoy enjoy enjoy would you know the segreto per esser felice here it is in a smiling mistress and a cup of falernian” as the boy tosses the cup and sings his song—hark what is that chaunt coming nearer and nearer what is that dirge which will disturb us the lights of the festival burn dim—the cheeks turn pale—the voice quavers—and the cup drops on the floor who’s there death and fate are at the gate and they will come in  congreve’s comic feast flares with lights and round the table emptying their flaming bowls of drink and exchanging the wildest jests and ribaldry sit men and women waited on by rascally valets and attendants as dissolute as their mistresses—perhaps the very worst company in the world there doesn’t seem to be a pretence of morals at the head of the table sits mirabel or belmour dressed in the french fashion and waited on by english imitators of scapin and frontin their calling is to be irresistible and to conquer everywhere like the heroes of the chivalry story whose longwinded loves and combats they were sending out of fashion they are always splendid and triumphant—overcome all dangers vanquish all enemies and win the beauty at the end fathers husbands usurers are the foes these champions contend with they are merciless in old age invariably and an old man plays the part in the dramas which the wicked enchanter or the great blundering giant performs in the chivalry tales who threatens and grumbles and resists—a huge stupid obstacle always overcome by the knight it is an old man with a moneybox sir belmour his son or nephew spends his money and laughs at him it is an old man with a young wife whom he locks up sir mirabel robs him of his wife trips up his gouty old heels and leaves the old hunx—the old fool what business has he to hoard his money or to lock up blushing eighteen money is for youth love is for youth away with the old people when millamant is sixty having of course divorced the first lady millamant and married his friend doricourt’s granddaughter out of the nursery—it will be his turn and young belmour will make a fool of him all this pretty morality you have in the comedies of william congreve esq they are full of wit such manners as he observes he observes with great humour but ah it’s a weary feast that banquet of wit where no love is it palls very soon sad indigestions follow it and lonely blank headaches in the morning  i can’t pretend to quote scenes from the splendid congreve’s plays69—which are undeniably bright witty and daring—any more than i could ask you to hear the dialogue of a witty bargeman and a brilliant fishwoman exchanging compliments at billingsgate but some of his verses—they were amongst the most famous lyrics of the time and pronounced equal to horace by his contemporaries—may give an idea of his power of his grace of his daring manner his magnificence in compliment and his polished sarcasm he writes as if he was so accustomed to conquer that he has a poor opinion of his victims nothing’s new except their faces says he “every woman is the same” he says this in his first comedy which he wrote languidly70 in illness when he was an “excellent young man” richelieu at eighty could have hardly said a more excellent thing  when he advances to make one of his conquests it is with a splendid gallantry in full uniform and with the fiddles playing like grammont’s french dandies attacking the breach of lerida  “cease cease to ask her name” he writes of a young lady at the wells at tunbridge whom he salutes with a magnificent compliment—       cease cease to ask her name     the crowned muse’s noblest theme     whose glory by immortal fame         shall only sounded be     but if you long to know     then look round yonder dazzling row     who most does like an angel show         you may be sure ’tis she   here are lines about another beauty who perhaps was not so well pleased at the poet’s manner of celebrating her—       when lesbia first i saw so heavenly fair     with eyes so bright and with that awful air     i thought my heart would durst so high aspire     as bold as his who snatched celestial fire     but soon as e’er the beauteous idiot spoke     forth from her coral lips such folly broke     like balm the trickling nonsense heal’d my wound     and what her eyes enthralled her tongue unbound   amoret is a cleverer woman than the lovely lesbia but the poet does not seem to respect one much more than the other and describes both with exquisite satirical humour—       fair amoret is gone astray       pursue and seek her every lover     i’ll tell the signs by which you may       the wandering shepherdess discover      coquet and coy at once her air       both studied though both seem neglected     careless she is with artful care       affecting to be unaffected      with skill her eyes dart every glance       yet change so soon you’d ne’er suspect them     for she’d persuade they wound by chance       though certain aim and art direct them      she likes herself yet others hates       for that which in herself she prizes     and while she laughs at them forgets       she is the thing which she despises   what could amoret have done to bring down such shafts of ridicule upon her could she have resisted the irresistible mr congreve could anybody could sabina when she woke and heard such a bard singing under her window see he writes—       see see she wakes—sabina wakes       and now the sun begins to rise     less glorious is the morn that breaks       from his bright beams than her fair eyes     with light united day they give       but different fates ere night fulfil     how many by his warmth will live       how many will her coldness kill   are you melted don’t you think him a divine man if not touched by the brilliant sabina hear the devout selinda—       pious selinda goes to prayers       if i but ask her favour     and yet the silly fool’s in tears       if she believes i’ll leave her     would i were free from this restraint       or else had hopes to win her     would she could make of me a saint       or i of her a sinner   what a conquering air there is about these what an irresistible mr congreve it is sinner of course he will be a sinner the delightful rascal win her of course he will win her the victorious rogue he knows he will he must—with such a grace with such a fashion with such a splendid embroidered suit—you see him with redheeled shoes deliciously turned out passing a fair jewelled hand through his dishevelled periwig and delivering a killing ogle along with his scented billet and sabina what a comparison that is between the nymph and the sun the sun gives sabina the pas and does not venture to rise before her ladyship the morn’s bright beams are less glorious than her fair eyes but before night everybody will be frozen by her glances everybody but one lucky rogue who shall be nameless louis quatorze in all his glory is hardly more splendid than our phoebus apollo of the mall and spring garden71  when voltaire came to visit the great congreve the latter rather affected to despise his literary reputation and in this perhaps the great congreve was not far wrong72 a touch of steele’s tenderness is worth all his finery—a flash of swift’s lightning—a beam of addison’s pure sunshine and his tawdry playhouse taper is invisible but the ladies loved him and he was undoubtedly a pretty fellow73  we have seen in swift a humorous philosopher whose truth frightens one and whose laughter makes one melancholy we have had in congreve a humorous observer of another school to whom the world seems to have no moral at all and whose ghastly doctrine seems to be that we should eat drink and be merry when we can and go to the deuce if there be a deuce when the time comes we come now to a humour that flows from quite a different heart and spirit—a wit that makes us laugh and leaves us good and happy to one of the kindest benefactors that society has ever had and i believe you have divined already that i am about to mention addison’s honoured name  from reading over his writings and the biographies which we have of him amongst which the famous article in the edinburgh review74 may be cited as a magnificent statue of the great writer and moralist of the last age raised by the love and the marvellous skill and genius of one of the most illustrious artists of our own looking at that calm fair face and clear countenance—those chiselled features pure and cold i can’t but fancy that this great man in this respect like him of whom we spoke in the last lecture was also one of the lonely ones of the world such men have very few equals and they don’t herd with those it is in the nature of such lords of intellect to be solitary—they are in the world but not of it and our minor struggles brawls successes pass under them  kind just serene impartial his fortitude not tried beyond easy endurance his affections not much used for his books were his family and his society was in public admirably wiser wittier calmer and more instructed than almost every man with whom he met how could addison suffer desire admire feel much i may expect a child to admire me for being taller or writing more cleverly than she but how can i ask my superior to say that i am a wonder when he knows better than i in addison’s days you could scarcely show him a literary performance a sermon or a poem or a piece of literary criticism but he felt he could do better his justice must have made him indifferent he didn’t praise because he measured his compeers by a higher standard than common people have75 how was he who was so tall to look up to any but the loftiest genius he must have stooped to put himself on a level with most men by that profusion of graciousness and smiles with which goethe or scott for instance greeted almost every literary beginner every small literary adventurer who came to his court and went away charmed from the great king’s audience and cuddling to his heart the compliment which his literary majesty had paid him—each of the two goodnatured potentates of letters brought their star and ribbon into discredit everybody had his majesty’s orders everybody had his majesty’s cheap portrait on a box surrounded with diamonds worth twopence apiece a very great and just and wise man ought not to praise indiscriminately but give his idea of the truth addison praises the ingenious mr pinkethman addison praises the ingenious mr doggett the actor whose benefit is coming off that night addison praises don saltero addison praises milton with all his heart bends his knee and frankly pays homage to that imperial genius76 but between those degrees of his men his praise is very scanty i don’t think the great mr addison liked young mr pope the papist much i don’t think he abused him but when mr addison’s men abused mr pope i don’t think addison took his pipe out of his mouth to contradict them77  addison’s father was a clergyman of good repute in wiltshire and rose in the church78 his famous son never lost his clerical training and scholastic gravity and was called “a parson in a tyewig”79 in london afterwards at a time when tyewigs were only worn by the laity and the fathers of theology did not think it decent to appear except in a full bottom having been at school at salisbury and the charterhouse in 1687 when he was fifteen years old he went to queen’s college oxford where he speedily began to distinguish himself by the making of latin verses the beautiful and fanciful poem of the pigmies and the cranes is still read by lovers of that sort of exercise and verses are extant in honour of king william by which it appears that it was the loyal youth’s custom to toast that sovereign in bumpers of purple lyaeus and many more works are in the collection including one on the peace of ryswick in 1697 which was so good that montague got him a pension of 300l a year on which addison set out on his travels  during his ten years at oxford addison had deeply imbued himself with the latin poetical literature and had these poets at his fingers’ ends when he travelled in italy80 his patron went out of office and his pension was unpaid and hearing that this great scholar now eminent and known to the literati of europe the great boileau81 upon perusal of mr addison’s elegant hexameters was first made aware that england was not altogether a barbarous nation—hearing that the celebrated mr addison of oxford proposed to travel as governor to a young gentleman on the grand tour the great duke of somerset proposed to mr addison to accompany his son lord hartford  mr addison was delighted to be of use to his grace and his lordship his grace’s son and expressed himself ready to set forth  his grace the duke of somerset now announced to one of the most famous scholars of oxford and europe that it was his gracious intention to allow my lord hartford’s tutor one hundred guineas per annum mr addison wrote back that his services were his grace’s but he by no means found his account in the recompense for them the negotiation was broken off they parted with a profusion of congees on one side and the other  addison remained abroad for some time living in the best society of europe how could he do otherwise he must have been one of the finest gentlemen the world ever saw at all moments of life serene and courteous cheerful and calm82 he could scarcely ever have had a degrading thought he might have omitted a virtue or two or many but could not have had many faults committed for which he need blush or turn pale when warmed into confidence his conversation appears to have been so delightful that the greatest wits sat wrapt and charmed to listen to him no man bore poverty and narrow fortune with a more lofty cheerfulness his letters to his friends at this period of his life when he had lost his government pension and given up his college chances are full of courage and a gay confidence and philosophy and they are none the worse in my eyes and i hope not in those of his last and greatest biographer though mr macaulay is bound to own and lament a certain weakness for wine which the great and good joseph addison notoriously possessed in common with countless gentlemen of his time because some of the letters are written when his honest hand was shaking a little in the morning after libations to purple lyaeus overnight he was fond of drinking the healths of his friends he writes to wyche83 of hamburgh gratefully remembering wyche’s “hoc” “i have been drinking your health today with sir richard shirley” he writes to bathurst “i have lately had the honour to meet my lord effingham at amsterdam where we have drunk mr wood’s health a hundred times in excellent champagne” he writes again swift84 describes him over his cups when joseph yielded to a temptation which jonathan resisted joseph was of a cold nature and needed perhaps the fire of wine to warm his blood if he was a parson he wore a tyewig recollect a better and more christian man scarcely ever breathed than joseph addison if he had not that little weakness for wine—why we could scarcely have found a fault with him and could not have liked him as we do85  at thirtythree years of age this most distinguished wit scholar and gentleman was without a profession and an income his book of travels had failed his dialogues on medals had had no particular success his latin verses even though reported the best since virgil or statius at any rate had not brought him a government place and addison was living up two shabby pair of stairs in the haymarket in a poverty over which old samuel johnson rather chuckles when in these shabby rooms an emissary from government and fortune came and found him86  a poem was wanted about the duke of marlborough’s victory of blenheim would mr addison write one mr boyle afterwards lord carleton took back the reply to the lord treasurer godolphin that mr addison would when the poem had reached a certain stage it was carried to godolphin and the last lines which he read were these       but o my muse what numbers wilt thou find     to sing the furious troops in battle join’d     methinks i hear the drum’s tumultuous sound     the victors’ shouts and dying groans confound     the dreadful burst of cannon rend the skies     and all the thunders of the battle rise     ’twas then great marlborough’s mighty soul was proved     that in the shock of charging hosts unmoved     amidst confusion horror and despair     examined all the dreadful scenes of war     in peaceful thought the field of death surveyed     to fainting squadrons lent the timely aid     inspired repulsed battalions to engage     and taught the doubtful battle where to rage     so when an angel by divine command     with rising tempests shakes a guilty land     such as of late o’er pale britannia passed     calm and serene he drives the furious blast     and pleased the almighty’s orders to perform     rides on the whirlwind and directs the storm   addison left off at a good moment that simile was pronounced to be of the greatest ever produced in poetry that angel that good angel flew off with mr addison and landed him in the place of commissioner of appeals—vice mr locke providentially promoted in the following year mr addison went to hanover with lord halifax and the year after was made undersecretary of state o angel visits you come “few and far between” to literary gentlemen’s lodgings your wings seldom quiver at secondfloor windows now  you laugh you think it is in the power of few writers nowadays to call up such an angel well perhaps not but permit us to comfort ourselves by pointing out that there are in the poem of the campaign some as bad lines as heart can desire and to hint that mr addison did very wisely in not going further with my lord godolphin than that angelical simile do allow me just for a little harmless mischief to read you some of the lines which follow here is the interview between the duke and the king of the romans after the battle—       austria’s young monarch whose imperial sway     sceptres and thrones are destined to obey     whose boasted ancestry so high extends     that in the pagan gods his lineage ends     comes from afar in gratitude to own     the great supporter of his father’s throne     what tides of glory to his bosom ran     clasped in th’ embraces of the godlike man     how were his eyes with pleasing wonder fixt     to see such fire with so much sweetness mixt     such easy greatness such a graceful port     so learned and finished for the camp or court   how many fourthform boys at mr addison’s school of charterhouse could write as well as that now the campaign has blunders triumphant as it was and weak points like all campaigns87  in the year 1718 cato came out swift has left a description of the first night of the performance all the laurels of europe were scarcely sufficient for the author of this prodigious poem88 laudations of whig and tory chiefs popular ovations complimentary garlands from literary men translations in all languages delight and homage from all—save from john dennis in a minority of one—mr addison was called the “great mr addison” after this the coffeehouse senate saluted him divus it was heresy to question that decree  meanwhile he was writing political papers and advancing in the political profession he went secretary to ireland he was appointed secretary of state in 1717 and letters of his are extant bearing date some year or two before and written to young lord warwick in which he addresses him as “my dearest lord” and asks affectionately about his studies and writes very prettily about nightingales and birds’nests which he has found at fulham for his lordship those nightingales were intended to warble in the ear of lord warwick’s mamma addison married her ladyship in 1716 and died at holland house three years after that splendid but dismal union89  but it is not for his reputation as the great author of cato and the campaign or for his merits as secretary of state or for his rank and high distinction as my lady warwick’s husband or for his eminence as an examiner of political questions on the whig side or a guardian of british liberties that we admire joseph addison it is as a tatler of small talk and a spectator of mankind that we cherish and love him and owe as much pleasure to him as to any human being that ever wrote he came in that artificial age and began to speak with his noble natural voice he came the gentle satirist who hit no unfair blow the kind judge who castigated only in smiling while swift went about hanging and ruthless—a literary jeffries—in addison’s kind court only minor cases were tried only peccadilloes and small sins against society only a dangerous libertinism in tuckers and hoops90 or a nuisance in the abuse of beaux’ canes and snuffboxes it may be a lady is tried for breaking the peace of our sovereign lady queen anne and ogling too dangerously from the sidebox or a templar for beating the watch or breaking priscian’s head or a citizen’s wife for caring too much for the puppetshow and too little for her husband and children every one of the little sinners brought before him is amusing and he dismisses each with the pleasantest penalties and the most charming words of admonition  addison wrote his papers as gaily as if he was going out for a holiday when steele’s tatler first began his prattle addison then in ireland caught at his friend’s notion poured in paper after paper and contributed the stores of his mind the sweet fruits of his reading the delightful gleanings of his daily observation with a wonderful profusion and as it seemed an almost endless fecundity he was sixandthirty years old full and ripe he had not worked crop after crop from his brain manuring hastily subsoiling indifferently cutting and sowing and cutting again like other luckless cultivators of letters he had not done much as yet a few latin poems—graceful prolusions a polite book of travels a dissertation on medals not very deep four acts of a tragedy a great classical exercise and the campaign a large prize poem that won an enormous prize but with his friend’s discovery of the tatler addison’s calling was found and the most delightful talker in the world began to speak he does not go very deep let gentlemen of a profound genius critics accustomed to the plunge of the bathos console themselves by thinking that he couldn’t go very deep there are no traces of suffering in his writing he was so good so honest so healthy so cheerfully selfish if i must use the word there is no deep sentiment i doubt until after his marriage perhaps whether he ever lost his night’s rest or his day’s tranquillity about any woman in his life91 whereas poor dick steele had capacity enough to melt and to languish and to sigh and to cry his honest old eyes out for a dozen his writings do not show insight into or reverence for the love of women which i take to be one the consequence of the other he walks about the world watching their pretty humours fashions follies flirtations rivalries and noting them with the most charming archness he sees them in public in the theatre or the assembly or the puppetshow or at the toyshop higgling for gloves and lace or at the auction battling together over a blue porcelain dragon or a darling monster in japan or at church eyeing the width of their rivals’ hoops or the breadth of their laces as they sweep down the aisles or he looks out of his window at the “garter” in st james’s street at ardelia’s coach as she blazes to the drawingroom with her coronet and six footmen and remembering that her father was a turkey merchant in the city calculates how many sponges went to purchase her earring and how many drums of figs to build her coachbox or he demurely watches behind a tree in spring garden as saccharissa whom he knows under her mask trips out of her chair to the alley where sir fopling is waiting he sees only the public life of women addison was one of the most resolute clubmen of his day he passed many hours daily in those haunts besides drinking which alas is past praying for you must know it he owned too ladies that he indulged in that odious practice of smoking poor fellow he was a man’s man remember the only woman he did know he didn’t write about i take it there would not have been much humour in that story  he likes to go and sit in the smokingroom at the grecian or the devil to pace “change and the mall”92—to mingle in that great club of the world—sitting alone in it somehow having goodwill and kindness for every single man and woman in it—having need of some habit and custom binding him to some few never doing any man a wrong unless it be a wrong to hint a little doubt about a man’s parts and to damn him with faint praise and so he looks on the world and plays with the ceaseless humours of all of us—laughs the kindest laugh—points our neighbour’s foible or eccentricity out to us with the most goodnatured smiling confidence and then turning over his shoulder whispers our foibles to our neighbour what would sir roger de coverley be without his follies and his charming little braincracks93 if the good knight did not call out to the people sleeping in church and say “amen” with such a delightful pomposity if he did not make a speech in the assizecourt à propos de bottes and merely to show his dignity to mr spectator94 if he did not mistake madam doll tearsheet for a lady of quality in temple garden if he were wiser than he is if he had not his humour to salt his life and were but a mere english gentleman and gamepreserver—of what worth were he to us we love him for his vanities as much as his virtues what is ridiculous is delightful in him we are so fond of him because we laugh at him so and out of that laughter and out of that sweet weakness and out of those harmless eccentricities and follies and out of that touched brain and out of that honest manhood and simplicity—we get a result of happiness goodness tenderness pity piety such as if my audience will think their reading and hearing over doctors and divines but seldom have the fortune to inspire and why not is the glory of heaven to be sung only by gentlemen in black coats must the truth be only expounded in gown and surplice and out of those two vestments can nobody preach it commend me to this dear preacher without orders—this parson in the tyewig when this man looks from the world whose weaknesses he describes so benevolently up to the heaven which shines over us all i can hardly fancy a human face lighted up with a more serene rapture a human intellect thrilling with a purer love and adoration than joseph addison’s listen to him from your childhood you have known the verses but who can hear their sacred music without love and awe       soon as the evening shades prevail     the moon takes up the wondrous tale     and nightly to the listening earth     repeats the story of her birth     and all the stars that round her burn     and all the planets in their turn     confirm the tidings as they roll     and spread the truth from pole to pole     what though in solemn silence all     move round this dark terrestrial ball     what though no real voice nor sound     among their radiant orbs be found     in reason’s ear they all rejoice     and utter forth a glorious voice     for ever singing as they shine     the hand that made us is divine   it seems to me those verses shine like the stars they shine out of a great deep calm when he turns to heaven a sabbath comes over that man’s mind and his face lights up from it with a glory of thanks and prayer his sense of religion stirs through his whole being in the fields in the town looking at the birds in the trees at the children in the streets in the morning or in the moonlight over his books in his own room in a happy party at a country merrymaking or a town assembly goodwill and peace to god’s creatures and love and awe of him who made them fill his pure heart and shine from his kind face if swift’s life was the most wretched i think addison’s was one of the most enviable a life prosperous and beautiful—a calm death—an immense fame and affection afterwards for his happy and spotless name95     lecture the third steele   what do we look for in studying the history of a past age is it to learn the political transactions and characters of the leading public men is it to make ourselves acquainted with the life and being of the time if we set out with the former grave purpose where is the truth and who believes that he has it entire what character of what great man is known to you you can but make guesses as to character more or less happy in common life don’t you often judge and misjudge a man’s whole conduct setting out from a wrong impression the tone of a voice a word said in joke or a trifle in behaviour—the cut of his hair or the tie of his neckcloth may disfigure him in your eyes or poison your good opinion or at the end of years of intimacy it may be your closest friend says something reveals something which had previously been a secret which alters all your views about him and shows that he has been acting on quite a different motive to that which you fancied you knew and if it is so with those you know how much more with those you don’t know say for example that i want to understand the character of the duke of marlborough i read swift’s history of the times in which he took a part the shrewdest of observers and initiated one would think into the politics of the age—he hints to me that marlborough was a coward and even of doubtful military capacity he speaks of walpole as a contemptible boor and scarcely mentions except to flout it the great intrigue of the queen’s latter days which was to have ended in bringing back the pretender again i read marlborough’s life by a copious archdeacon who has the command of immense papers of sonorous language of what is called the best information and i get little or no insight into this secret motive which i believe influenced the whole of marlborough’s career which caused his turnings and windings his opportune fidelity and treason stopped his army almost at paris gate and landed him finally on the hanoverian side—the winning side i get i say no truth or only a portion of it in the narrative of either writer and believe that coxe’s portrait or swift’s portrait is quite unlike the real churchill i take this as a single instance prepared to be as sceptical about any other and say to the muse of history “o venerable daughter of mnemosyne i doubt every single statement you ever made since your ladyship was a muse for all your grave airs and high pretensions you are not a whit more trustworthy than some of your lighter sisters on whom your partisans look down you bid me listen to a general’s oration to his soldiers nonsense he no more made it than turpin made his dying speech at newgate you pronounce a panegyric of a hero i doubt it and say you flatter outrageously you utter the condemnation of a loose character i doubt it and think you are prejudiced and take the side of the dons you offer me an autobiography i doubt all autobiographies i ever read except those perhaps of mr robinson crusoe mariner and writers of his class these have no object in setting themselves right with the public or their own consciences these have no motive for concealment or halftruths these call for no more confidence than i can cheerfully give and do not force me to tax my credulity or to fortify it by evidence i take up a volume of dr smollett or a volume of the spectator and say the fiction carries a greater amount of truth in solution than the volume which purports to be all true out of the fictitious book i get the expression of the life of the time of the manners of the movement the dress the pleasures the laughter the ridicules of society—the old times live again and i travel in the old country of england can the heaviest historian do more for me”  as we read in these delightful volumes of the tatler and spectator the past age returns the england of our ancestors is revivified the maypole rises in the strand again in london the churches are thronged with daily worshippers the beaux are gathering in the coffeehouses the gentry are going to the drawingroom the ladies are thronging to the toyshops the chairmen are jostling in the streets the footmen are running with links before the chariots or fighting round the theatre doors in the country i see the young squire riding to eton with his servants behind him and will wimble the friend of the family to see him safe to make that journey from the squire’s and back will is a week on horseback the coach takes five days between london and bath the judges and the bar ride the circuit if my lady comes to town in her postchariot her people carry pistols to fire a salute on captain macheath if he should appear and her couriers ride ahead to prepare apartments for her at the great caravanserais on the road boniface receives her under the creaking sign of the “bell” or the “ram” and he and his chamberlains bow her up the great stair to the stateapartments whilst her carriage rumbles into the courtyard where the exeter “fly” is housed that performs the journey in eight days god willing having achieved its daily flight of twenty miles and landed its passengers for supper and sleep the curate is taking his pipe in the kitchen where the captain’s man—having hung up his master’s halfpike—is at his bacon and eggs bragging of ramillies and malplaquet to the townsfolk who have their club in the chimneycorner the captain is ogling the chambermaid in the wooden gallery or bribing her to know who is the pretty young mistress that has come in the coach the packhorses are in the great stable and the drivers and ostlers carousing in the tap and in mrs landlady’s bar over a glass of strong waters sits a gentleman of military appearance who travels with pistols as all the rest of the world does and has a rattling grey mare in the stables which will be saddled and away with its owner half an hour before the “fly” sets out on its last day’s flight and some five miles on the road as the exeter “fly” comes jingling and creaking onwards it will suddenly be brought to a halt by a gentleman on a grey mare with a black vizard on his face who thrusts a long pistol into the coach window and bids the company to hand out their purses it must have been no small pleasure even to sit in the great kitchen in those days and see the tide of humankind pass by we arrive at places now but we travel no more addison talks jocularly of a difference of manner and costume being quite perceivable at staines where there passed a young fellow “with a very tolerable periwig” though to be sure his hat was out of fashion and had a ramillies cock i would have liked to travel in those days being of that class of travellers who are proverbially pretty easy coram latronibus and have seen my friend with the grey mare and the black vizard alas there always came a day in the life of that warrior when it was the fashion to accompany him as he passed—without his black mask and with a nosegay in his hand accompanied by halberdiers and attended by the sheriff—in a carriage without springs and a clergyman jolting beside him to a spot close by cumberland gate and the marble arch where a stone still records that here tyburn turnpike stood what a change in a century in a few years within a few yards of that gate the fields began the fields of his exploits behind the hedges of which he lurked and robbed a great and wealthy city has grown over those meadows were a man brought to die there now the windows would be closed and the inhabitants keep their houses in sickening horror a hundred years back people crowded to see that last act of a highwayman’s life and make jokes on it swift laughed at him grimly advising him to provide a holland shirt and white cap crowned with a crimson or black ribbon for his exit to mount the cart cheerfully—shake hands with the hangman and so—farewell gay wrote the most delightful ballads and made merry over the same hero contrast these with the writings of our present humourists compare those morals and ours—those manners and ours  we can’t tell—you would not bear to be told the whole truth regarding those men and manners you could no more suffer in a british drawingroom under the reign of queen victoria a fine gentleman or fine lady of queen anne’s time or hear what they heard and said than you would receive an ancient briton it is as one reads about savages that one contemplates the wild ways the barbarous feasts the terrific pastimes of the men of pleasure of that age we have our fine gentlemen and our “fast men” permit me to give you an idea of one particularly fast nobleman of queen anne’s days whose biography has been preserved to us by the law reporters  in 1691 when steele was a boy at school my lord mohun was tried by his peers for the murder of william mountford comedian in howell’s state trials the reader will find not only an edifying account of this exceedingly fast nobleman but of the times and manners of those days my lord’s friend a captain hill smitten with the charms of the beautiful mrs bracegirdle and anxious to marry her at all hazards determined to carry her off and for this purpose hired a hackneycoach with six horses and a halfdozen of soldiers to aid him in the storm the coach with a pair of horses the four leaders being in waiting elsewhere took its station opposite my lord craven’s house in drury lane by which door mrs bracegirdle was to pass on her way from the theatre as she passed in company of her mamma and a friend mr page the captain seized her by the hand the soldiers hustled mr page and attacked him sword in hand and captain hill and his noble friend endeavoured to force madam bracegirdle into the coach mr page called for help the population of drury lane rose it was impossible to effect the capture and bidding the soldiers go about their business and the coach to drive off hill let go of his prey sulkily and he waited for other opportunities of revenge the man of whom he was most jealous was will mountford the comedian will removed he thought mrs bracegirdle might be his and accordingly the captain and his lordship lay that night in wait for will and as he was coming out of a house in norfolk street while mohun engaged him in talk hill in the words of the attorneygeneral made a pass and run him clean through the body  sixtyone of my lord’s peers finding him not guilty of murder while but fourteen found him guilty this very fast nobleman was discharged and made his appearance seven years after in another trial for murder—when he my lord warwick and three gentlemen of the military profession were concerned in the fight which ended in the death of captain coote  this jolly company were drinking together at lockit’s in charing cross when angry words arose between captain coote and captain french whom my lord mohun and my lord the earl of warwick96 and holland endeavoured to pacify my lord warwick was a dear friend of captain coote lent him a hundred pounds to buy his commission in the guards once when the captain was arrested for 13l by his tailor my lord lent him five guineas often paid his reckoning for him and showed him other offices of friendship on this evening the disputants french and coote being separated whilst they were upstairs unluckily stopped to drink ale again at the bar of lockit’s the row began afresh—coote lunged at french over the bar and at last all six called for chairs and went to leicester fields where they fell to their lordships engaged on the side of captain coote my lord of warwick was severely wounded in the hand mr french also was stabbed but honest captain coote got a couple of wounds—one especially “a wound in the left side just under the short ribs and piercing through the diaphragma” which did for captain coote hence the trials of my lords warwick and mohun hence the assemblage of peers the report of the transaction in which these defunct fast men still live for the observation of the curious my lord of warwick is brought to the bar by the deputy governor of the tower of london having the axe carried before him by the gentleman gaoler who stood with it at the bar at the right hand of the prisoner turning the edge from him the prisoner at his approach making three bows one to his grace the lord high steward the other to the peers on each hand and his grace and the peers return the salute and besides these great personages august in periwigs and nodding to the right and left a host of the small come up out of the past and pass before us—the jolly captains brawling in the tavern and laughing and cursing over their cups—the drawer that serves the bargirl that waits the bailiff on the prowl the chairmen trudging through the black lampless streets and smoking their pipes by the railings whilst swords are clashing in the garden within “help there a gentleman is hurt” the chairmen put up their pipes and help the gentleman over the railings and carry him ghastly and bleeding to the bagnio in long acre where they knock up the surgeon—a pretty tall gentleman—but that wound under the short ribs has done for him surgeon lords captains bailiffs chairmen and gentleman gaoler with your axe where be you now the gentleman axeman’s head is off his own shoulders the lords and judges can wag theirs no longer the bailiff’s writs have ceased to run the honest chairmen’s pipes are put out and with their brawny calves they have walked away into hades—all as irrecoverably done for as will mountford or captain coote the subject of our night’s lecture saw all these people—rode in captain coote’s company of the guards very probably—wrote and sighed for bracegirdle went home tipsy in many a chair after many a bottle in many a tavern—fled from many a bailiff  in 1709 when the publication of the tatler began our greatgreatgrandfathers must have seized upon that new and delightful paper with much such eagerness as lovers of light literature in a later day exhibited when the waverley novels appeared upon which the public rushed forsaking that feeble entertainment of which the miss porters the anne of swanseas and worthy mrs radcliffe herself with her dreary castles and exploded old ghosts had had pretty much the monopoly i have looked over many of the comic books with which our ancestors amused themselves from the novels of swift’s coadjutrix mrs manley the delectable author of the new atlantis to the facetious productions of tom durfey and tom brown and ned ward writer of the london spy and several other volumes of ribaldry the slang of the taverns and ordinaries the wit of the bagnios form the strongest part of the farrago of which these libels are composed in the excellent newspaper collection at the british museum you may see besides the craftsman and post boy specimens and queer specimens they are of the higher literature of queen anne’s time here is an abstract from a notable journal bearing date wednesday october 13th 1708 and entitled the british apollo or curious amusements for the ingenious by a society of gentlemen the british apollo invited and professed to answer questions upon all subjects of wit morality science and even religion and two out of its four pages are filled with queries and replies much like some of the oracular penny prints of the present time  one of the first querists referring to the passage that a bishop should be the husband of one wife argues that polygamy is justifiable in the laity the society of gentlemen conducting the british apollo are posed by this casuist and promise to give him an answer celinda then wishes to know from “the gentlemen” concerning the souls of the dead whether they shall have the satisfaction to know those whom they most valued in this transitory life the gentlemen of the apollo give but cold comfort to poor celinda they are inclined to think not for say they since every inhabitant of those regions will be infinitely dearer than here are our nearest relatives—what have we to do with a partial friendship in that happy place poor celinda it may have been a child or a lover whom she had lost and was pining after when the oracle of british apollo gave her this dismal answer she has solved the question for herself by this time and knows quite as well as the society of gentlemen  from theology we come to physics and q asks “why does hot water freeze sooner than cold” apollo replies “hot water cannot be said to freeze sooner than cold but water once heated and cold may be subject to freeze by the evaporation of the spirituous parts of the water which renders it less able to withstand the power of frosty weather”  the next query is rather a delicate one “you mr apollo who are said to be the god of wisdom pray give us the reason why kissing is so much in fashion what benefit one receives by it and who was the inventor and you will oblige corinna” to this queer demand the lips of phoebus smiling answer “pretty innocent corinna apollo owns that he was a little surprised by your kissing question particularly at that part of it where you desire to know the benefit you receive by it ah madam had you a lover you would not come to apollo for a solution since there is no dispute but the kisses of mutual lovers give infinite satisfaction as to its invention ’tis certain nature was its author and it began with the first courtship”  after a column more of questions follow nearly two pages of poems signed by philander armenia and the like and chiefly on the tender passion and the paper wound up with a letter from leghorn an account of the duke of marlborough and prince eugene before lille and proposals for publishing two sheets on the present state of aethiopia by mr hill all of which is printed for the authors by j mayo at the printing press against water lane in fleet street what a change it must have been—how apollo’s oracles must have been struck dumb when the tatler appeared and scholars gentlemen men of the world men of genius began to speak  shortly before the boyne was fought and young swift had begun to make acquaintance with english court manners and english servitude in sir william temple’s family another irish youth was brought to learn his humanities at the old school of charterhouse near smithfield to which foundation he had been appointed by james duke of ormond a governor of the house and a patron of the lad’s family the boy was an orphan and described twenty years after with a sweet pathos and simplicity some of the earliest recollections of a life which was destined to be chequered by a strange variety of good and evil fortune  i am afraid no good report could be given by his masters and ushers of that thickset squarefaced blackeyed softhearted little irish boy he was very idle he was whipped deservedly a great number of times though he had very good parts of his own he got other boys to do his lessons for him and only took just as much trouble as should enable him to scuffle through his exercises and by good fortune escape the flogging block one hundred and fifty years after i have myself inspected but only as an amateur that instrument of righteous torture still existing and in occasional use in a secluded private apartment of the old charterhouse school and have no doubt it is the very counterpart if not the ancient and interesting machine itself at which poor dick steele submitted himself to the tormentors  besides being very kind lazy and goodnatured this boy went invariably into debt with the tartwoman ran out of bounds and entered into pecuniary or rather promissory engagements with the neighbouring lollipopvendors and piemen—exhibited an early fondness and capacity for drinking mum and sack and borrowed from all his comrades who had money to lend i have no sort of authority for the statements here made of steele’s early life but if the child is father of the man the father of young steele of merton who left oxford without taking a degree and entered the life guards—the father of captain steele of lucas’s fusiliers who got his company through the patronage of my lord cutts—the father of mr steele the commissioner of stamps the editor of the gazette the tatler and spectator the expelled member of parliament and the author of the tender husband and the conscious lovers if man and boy resembled each other dick steele the schoolboy must have been one of the most generous goodfornothing amiable little creatures that ever conjugated the verb tupto i beat tuptomai i am whipped in any school in great britain  almost every gentleman who does me the honour to hear me will remember that the very greatest character which he has seen in the course of his life and the person to whom he has looked up with the greatest wonder and reverence was the head boy at his school the schoolmaster himself hardly inspires such an awe the head boy construes as well as the schoolmaster himself when he begins to speak the hall is hushed and every little boy listens he writes off copies of latin verses as melodiously as virgil he is goodnatured and his own masterpieces achieved pours out other copies of verses for other boys with an astonishing ease and fluency the idle ones only trembling lest they should be discovered on giving in their exercises and whipped because their poems were too good i have seen great men in my time but never such a great one as that head boy of my childhood we all thought he must be prime minister and i was disappointed on meeting him in afterlife to find he was no more than six feet high  dick steele the charterhouse gownboy contracted such an admiration in the years of his childhood and retained it faithfully through his life through the school and through the world whithersoever his strange fortune led this erring wayward affectionate creature joseph addison was always his head boy addison wrote his exercises addison did his best themes he ran on addison’s messages fagged for him and blacked his shoes to be in joe’s company was dick’s greatest pleasure and he took a sermon or a caning from his monitor with the most boundless reverence acquiescence and affection97  steele found addison a stately college don at oxford and himself did not make much figure at this place he wrote a comedy which by the advice of a friend the humble fellow burned there and some verses which i dare say are as sublime as other gentlemen’s composition at that age but being smitten with a sudden love for military glory he threw up the cap and gown for the saddle and bridle and rode privately in the horse guards in the duke of ormond’s troop—the second—and probably with the rest of the gentlemen of his troop “all mounted on black horses with white feathers in their hats and scarlet coats richly laced” marched by king william in hyde park in november 1699 and a great show of the nobility besides twenty thousand people and above a thousand coaches “the guards had just got their new clothes” the london post said “they are extraordinary grand and thought to be the finest body of horse in the world” but steele could hardly have seen any actual service he who wrote about himself his mother his wife his loves his debts his friends and the wine he drank would have told us of his battles if he had seen any his old patron ormond probably got him his cornetcy in the guards from which he was promoted to be a captain in lucas’s fusiliers getting his company through the patronage of lord cutts whose secretary he was and to whom he dedicated his work called the christian hero as for dick whilst writing this ardent devotional work he was deep in debt in drink and in all the follies of the town it is related that all the officers of lucas’s and the gentlemen of the guards laughed at dick98 and in truth a theologian in liquor is not a respectable object and a hermit though he may be out at elbows must not be in debt to the tailor steele says of himself that he was always sinning and repenting he beat his breast and cried most piteously when he did repent but as soon as crying had made him thirsty he fell to sinning again in that charming paper in the tatler in which he records his father’s death his mother’s griefs his own most solemn and tender emotions he says he is interrupted by the arrival of a hamper of wine “the same as is to be sold at garraway’s next week” upon the receipt of which he sends for three friends and they fall to instantly “drinking two bottles apiece with great benefit to themselves and not separating till two o’clock in the morning”  his life was so jack the drawer was always interrupting it bringing him a bottle from the “rose” or inviting him over to a bout there with sir plume and mr diver and dick wiped his eyes which were whimpering over his papers took down his laced hat put on his sword and wig kissed his wife and children told them a lie about pressing business and went off to the “rose” to the jolly fellows  while mr addison was abroad and after he came home in rather a dismal way to wait upon providence in his shabby lodging in the haymarket young captain steele was cutting a much smarter figure than that of his classical friend of charterhouse cloister and maudlin walk could not some painter give an interview between the gallant captain of lucas’s with his hat cocked and his lace and his face too a trifle tarnished with drink and that poet that philosopher pale proud and poor his friend and monitor of schooldays of all days how dick must have bragged about his chances and his hopes and the fine company he kept and the charms of the reigning toasts and popular actresses and the number of bottles that he and my lord and some other pretty fellows had cracked overnight at the “devil” or the “garter” cannot one fancy joseph addison’s calm smile and cold grey eyes following dick for an instant as he struts down the mall to dine with the guard at st james’s before he turns with his sober pace and threadbare suit to walk back to his lodgings up the two pair of stairs steele’s name was down for promotion dick always said himself in the glorious pious and immortal william’s last tablebook jonathan swift’s name had been written there by the same hand too  our worthy friend the author of the christian hero continued to make no small figure about town by the use of his wits99 he was appointed gazetteer he wrote in 1703 the tender husband his second play in which there is some delightful farcical writing and of which he fondly owned in afterlife and when addison was no more that there were “many applauded strokes” from addison’s beloved hand100 is it not a pleasant partnership to remember can’t one fancy steele full of spirits and youth leaving his gay company to go to addison’s lodging where his friend sits in the shabby sittingroom quite serene and cheerful and poor in 1704 steele came on the town with another comedy and behold it was so moral and religious as poor dick insisted so dull the town thought that the lying lover was damned  addison’s hour of success now came and he was able to help our friend the christian hero in such a way that if there had been any chance of keeping that poor tipsy champion upon his legs his fortune was safe and his competence assured steele procured the place of commissioner of stamps he wrote so richly so gracefully often so kindly always with such a pleasant wit and easy frankness with such a gush of good spirits and good humour that his early papers may be compared to addison’s own and are to be read by a male reader at least with quite an equal pleasure101  after the tatler in 1711 the famous spectator made its appearance and this was followed at various intervals by many periodicals under the same editor—the guardian—the englishman—the lover whose love was rather insipid—the reader of whom the public saw no more after his second appearance—the theatre under the pseudonym of sir john edgar which steele wrote while governor of the royal company of comedians to which post and to that of surveyor of the royal stables at hampton court and to the commission of the peace for middlesex and to the honour of knighthood steele had been preferred soon after the accession of george i whose cause honest dick had nobly fought through disgrace and danger against the most formidable enemies against traitors and bullies against bolingbroke and swift in the last reign with the arrival of the king that splendid conspiracy broke up and a golden opportunity came to dick steele whose hand alas was too careless to grip it  steele married twice and outlived his places his schemes his wife his income his health and almost everything but his kind heart that ceased to trouble him in 1729 when he died worn out and almost forgotten by his contemporaries in wales where he had the remnant of a property  posterity has been kinder to this amiable creature all women especially are bound to be grateful to steele as he was the first of our writers who really seemed to admire and respect them congreve the great who alludes to the low estimation in which women were held in elizabeth’s time as a reason why the women of shakespeare make so small a figure in the poet’s dialogues though he can himself pay splendid compliments to women yet looks on them as mere instruments of gallantry and destined like the most consummate fortifications to fall after a certain time before the arts and bravery of the besieger man there is a letter of swift’s entitled “advice to a very young married lady” which shows the dean’s opinion of the female society of his day and that if he despised man he utterly scorned women too no lady of our time could be treated by any man were he ever so much a wit or dean in such a tone of insolent patronage and vulgar protection in this performance swift hardly takes pains to hide his opinion that a woman is a fool tells her to read books as if reading was a novel accomplishment and informs her that “not one gentleman’s daughter in a thousand has been brought to read or understand her own natural tongue” addison laughs at women equally but with the gentleness and politeness of his nature smiles at them and watches them as if they were harmless halfwitted amusing pretty creatures only made to be men’s playthings it was steele who first began to pay a manly homage to their goodness and understanding as well as to their tenderness and beauty102 in his comedies the heroes do not rant and rave about the divine beauties of gloriana or statira as the characters were made to do in the chivalry romances and the highflown dramas just going out of vogue but steele admires women’s virtue acknowledges their sense and adores their purity and beauty with an ardour and strength which should win the goodwill of all women to their hearty and respectful champion it is this ardour this respect this manliness which makes his comedies so pleasant and their heroes such fine gentlemen he paid the finest compliment to a woman that perhaps ever was offered of one woman whom congreve had also admired and celebrated steele says that “to have loved her was a liberal education” “how often” he says dedicating a volume to his wife “how often has your tenderness removed pain from my sick head how often anguish from my afflicted heart if there are such beings as guardian angels they are thus employed i cannot believe one of them to be more good in inclination or more charming in form than my wife” his breast seems to warm and his eyes to kindle when he meets with a good and beautiful woman and it is with his heart as well as with his hat that he salutes her about children and all that relates to home he is not less tender and more than once speaks in apology of what he calls his softness he would have been nothing without that delightful weakness it is that which gives his works their worth and his style its charm it like his life is full of faults and careless blunders and redeemed like that by his sweet and compassionate nature  we possess of poor steele’s wild and chequered life some of the most curious memoranda that ever were left of a man’s biography103 most men’s letters from cicero down to walpole or down to the great men of our own time if you will are doctored compositions and written with an eye suspicious towards posterity that dedication of steele’s to his wife is an artificial performance possibly at least it is written with that degree of artifice which an orator uses in arranging a statement for the house or a poet employs in preparing a sentiment in verse or for the stage but there are some 400 letters of dick steele’e to his wife which that thrifty woman preserved accurately and which could have been written but for her and her alone they contain details of the business pleasures quarrels reconciliations of the pair they have all the genuineness of conversation they are as artless as a child’s prattle and as confidential as a curtainlecture some are written from the printingoffice where he is waiting for the proofsheets of his gazette or his tatler some are written from the tavern whence he promises to come to his wife “within a pint of wine” and where he has given a rendezvous to a friend or a moneylender some are composed in a high state of vinous excitement when his head is flustered with burgundy and his heart abounds with amorous warmth for his darling prue some are under the influence of the dismal headache and repentance next morning some alas are from the lockup house where the lawyers have impounded him and where he is waiting for bail you trace many years of the poor fellow’s career in these letters in september 1707 from which day she began to save the letters he married the beautiful mistress scurlock you have his passionate protestations to the lady his respectful proposals to her mamma his private prayer to heaven when the union so ardently desired was completed his fond professions of contrition and promises of amendment when immediately after his marriage there began to be just cause for the one and need for the other  captain steele took a house for his lady upon their marriage “the third door from germain street left hand of berry street” and the next year he presented his wife with a country house at hampton it appears she had a chariot and pair and sometimes four horses he himself enjoyed a little horse for his own riding he paid or promised to pay his barber fifty pounds a year and always went abroad in a laced coat and a large blackbuckled periwig that must have cost somebody fifty guineas he was rather a welltodo gentleman captain steele with the proceeds of his estates in barbadoes left to him by his first wife his income as a writer of the gazette and his office of gentleman waiter to his royal highness prince george his second wife brought him a fortune too but it is melancholy to relate that with these houses and chariots and horses and income the captain was constantly in want of money for which his beloved bride was asking as constantly in the course of a few pages we begin to find the shoemaker calling for money and some directions from the captain who has not thirty pounds to spare he sends his wife “the beautifullest object in the world” as he calls her and evidently in reply to applications of her own which have gone the way of all waste paper and lighted dick’s pipes which were smoked a hundred and forty years ago—he sends his wife now a guinea then a halfguinea then a couple of guineas then half a pound of tea and again no money and no tea at all but a promise that his darling prue shall have some in a day or two or a request perhaps that she will send over his nightgown and shavingplate to the temporary lodging where the nomadic captain is lying hidden from the bailiffs oh that a christian hero and late captain in lucas’s should be afraid of a dirty sheriff’s officer that the pink and pride of chivalry should turn pale before a writ it stands to record in poor dick’s own handwriting the queer collection is preserved at the british museum to this present day that the rent of the nuptial house in jermyn street sacred to unutterable tenderness and prue and three doors from bury street was not paid until after the landlord had put in an execution on captain steele’s furniture addison sold the house and furniture at hampton and after deducting the sum in which his incorrigible friend was indebted to him handed over the residue of the proceeds of the sale to poor dick who wasn’t in the least angry at addison’s summary proceeding and i dare say was very glad of any sale or execution the result of which was to give him a little ready money having a small house in jermyn street for which he couldn’t pay and a country house at hampton on which he had borrowed money nothing must content captain dick but the taking in 1712 a much finer larger and grander house in bloomsbury square where his unhappy landlord got no better satisfaction than his friend in st james’s and where it is recorded that dick giving a grand entertainment had a halfdozen queerlooking fellows in livery to wait upon his noble guests and confessed that his servants were bailiffs to a man “i fared like a distressed prince” the kindly prodigal writes generously complimenting addison for his assistance in the tatler—“i fared like a distressed prince who calls in a powerful neighbour to his aid i was undone by my auxiliary when i had once called him in i could not subsist without dependence on him” poor needy prince of bloomsbury think of him in his palace with his allies from chancery lane ominously guarding him  all sorts of stories are told indicative of his recklessness and his good humour one narrated by dr hoadly is exceedingly characteristic it shows the life of the time and our poor friend very weak but very kind both in and out of his cups  “my father” says dr john hoadly the bishop’s son—“when bishop of bangor was by invitation present at one of the whig meetings held at the ‘trumpet’ in shire lane when sir richard in his zeal rather exposed himself having the double duty of the day upon him as well to celebrate the immortal memory of king william it being the 4th of november as to drink his friend addison up to conversation pitch whose phlegmatic constitution was hardly warmed for society by that time steele was not fit for it two remarkable circumstances happened john sly the hatter of facetious memory was in the house and john pretty mellow took it into his head to come into the company on his knees with a tankard of ale in his hand to drink off to the immortal memory and to return in the same manner steele sitting next my father whispered him—‘do laugh it is humanity to laugh’ sir richard in the evening being too much in the same condition was put into a chair and sent home nothing would serve him but being carried to the bishop of bangor’s late as it was however the chairmen carried him home and got him upstairs when his great complaisance would wait on them downstairs which he did and then was got quietly to bed”104  there is another amusing story which i believe that renowned collector mr joseph miller or his successors have incorporated into their work sir richard steele at a time when he was much occupied with theatrical affairs built himself a pretty private theatre and before it was opened to his friends and guests was anxious to try whether the hall was well adapted for hearing accordingly he placed himself in the most remote part of the gallery and begged the carpenter who had built the house to speak up from the stage the man at first said that he was unaccustomed to public speaking and did not know what to say to his honour but the goodnatured knight called out to him to say whatever was uppermost and after a moment the carpenter began in a voice perfectly audible “sir richard steele” he said “for three months past me and my men has been aworking in this theatre and we’ve never seen the colour of your honour’s money we will be very much obliged if you’ll pay it directly for until you do we won’t drive in another nail” sir richard said that his friend’s elocution was perfect but that he didn’t like his subject much  the great charm of steele’s writing is its naturalness he wrote so quickly and carelessly that he was forced to make the reader his confidant and had not the time to deceive him he had a small share of booklearning but a vast acquaintance with the world he had known men and taverns he had lived with gownsmen with troopers with gentleman ushers of the court with men and women of fashion with authors and wits with the inmates of the spunginghouses and with the frequenters of all the clubs and coffeehouses in the town he was liked in all company because he liked it and you like to see his enjoyment as you like to see the glee of a box full of children at the pantomime he was not of those lonely ones of the earth whose greatness obliged them to be solitary on the contrary he admired i think more than any man who ever wrote and full of hearty applause and sympathy wins upon you by calling you to share his delight and good humour his laugh rings through the whole house he must have been invaluable at a tragedy and have cried as much as the most tender young lady in the boxes he has a relish for beauty and goodness wherever he meets it he admired shakespeare affectionately and more than any man of his time and according to his generous expansive nature called upon all his company to like what he liked himself he did not damn with faint praise he was in the world and of it and his enjoyment of life presents the strangest contrast to swift’s savage indignation and addison’s lonely serenity105 permit me to read to you a passage from each writer curiously indicative of his peculiar humour the subject is the same and the mood the very gravest we have said that upon all the actions of man the most trifling and the most solemn the humourist takes upon himself to comment all readers of our old masters know the terrible lines of swift in which he hints at his philosophy and describes the end of mankind—106       amazed confused its fate unknown     the world stood trembling at jove’s throne     while each pale sinner hung his head     jove nodding shook the heavens and said       ’offending race of human kind     by nature reason learning blind     you who through frailty stepped aside     and you who never err’d through pride     you who in different sects were shamm’d     and come to see each other damn’d     so some folk told you but they knew     no more of jove’s designs than you     the world’s mad business now is o’er     and i resent your freaks no more     i to such blockheads set my wit     i damn such fools—go go you’re bit’   addison speaking on the very same theme but with how different a voice says in his famous paper on westminster abbey spectator no 26—“for my own part though i am always serious i do not know what it is to be melancholy and can therefore take a view of nature in her deep and solemn scenes with the same pleasure as in her most gay and delightful ones when i look upon the tombs of the great every emotion of envy dies within me when i read the epitaphs of the beautiful every inordinate desire goes out when i meet with the grief of parents on a tombstone my heart melts with compassion when i see the tomb of the parents themselves i consider the vanity of grieving for those we must quickly follow” i have owned that i do not think addison’s heart melted very much or that he indulged very inordinately in the “vanity of grieving” “when” he goes on “when i see kings lying by those who deposed them when i consider rival wits placed side by side or the holy men that divided the world with their contests and disputes—i reflect with sorrow and astonishment on the little competitions factions and debates of mankind and when i read the several dates on the tombs of some that died yesterday and some 600 years ago i consider that great day when we shall all of us be contemporaries and make our appearance together”  our third humourist comes to speak upon the same subject you will have observed in the previous extracts the characteristic humour of each writer—the subject and the contrast—the fact of death and the play of individual thought by which each comments on it and now hear the third writer—death sorrow and the grave being for the moment also his theme “the first sense of sorrow i ever knew” steele says in the tatler “was upon the death of my father at which time i was not quite five years of age but was rather amazed at what all the house meant than possessed of a real understanding why nobody would play with us i remember i went into the room where his body lay and my mother sat weeping alone by it i had my battledore in my hand and fell abeating the coffin and calling papa for i know not how i had some idea that he was locked up there my mother caught me in her arms and transported beyond all patience of the silent grief she was before in she almost smothered me in her embraces and told me in a flood of tears ‘papa could not hear me and would play with me no more for they were going to put him under ground whence he would never come to us again’ she was a very beautiful woman of a noble spirit and there was a dignity in her grief amidst all the wildness of her transport which methought struck me with an instinct of sorrow that before i was sensible what it was to grieve seized my very soul and has made pity the weakness of my heart ever since”  can there be three more characteristic moods of minds and men “fools do you know anything of this mystery” says swift stamping on a grave and carrying his scorn for mankind actually beyond it “miserable purblind wretches how dare you to pretend to comprehend the inscrutable and how can your dim eyes pierce the unfathomable depths of yonder boundless heaven” addison in a much kinder language and gentler voice utters much the same sentiment and speaks of the rivalry of wits and the contests of holy men with the same sceptic placidity “look what a little vain dust we are” he says smiling over the tombstones and catching as is his wont quite a divine effulgence as he looks heavenward he speaks in words of inspiration almost of “the great day when we shall all of us be contemporaries and make our appearance together”  the third whose theme is death too and who will speak his word of moral as heaven teaches him leads you up to his father’s coffin and shows you his beautiful mother weeping and himself an unconscious little boy wondering at her side his own natural tears flow as he takes your hand and confidingly asks your sympathy “see how good and innocent and beautiful women are” he says “how tender little children let us love these and one another brother—god knows we have need of love and pardon” so it is each man looks with his own eyes speaks with his own voice and prays his own prayer  when steele asks your sympathy for the actors in that charming scene of love and grief and death who can refuse it one yields to it as to the frank advance of a child or to the appeal of a woman a man is seldom more manly than when he is what you call unmanned—the source of his emotion is championship pity and courage the instinctive desire to cherish those who are innocent and unhappy and defend those who are tender and weak if steele is not our friend he is nothing he is by no means the most brilliant of wits nor the deepest of thinkers but he is our friend we love him as children love their love with an a because he is amiable who likes a man best because he is the cleverest or the wisest of mankind or a woman because she is the most virtuous or talks french or plays the piano better than the rest of her sex i own to liking dick steele the man and dick steele the author much better than much better men and much better authors  the misfortune regarding steele is that most part of the company here present must take his amiability upon hearsay and certainly can’t make his intimate acquaintance not that steele was worse than his time on the contrary a far better truer and higherhearted man than most who lived in it but things were done in that society and names were named which would make you shudder now what would be the sensation of a polite youth of the present day if at a ball he saw the young object of his affections taking a box out of her pocket and a pinch of snuff or if at dinner by the charmer’s side she deliberately put her knife into her mouth if she cut her mother’s throat with it mamma would scarcely be more shocked i allude to these peculiarities of bygone times as an excuse for my favourite steele who was not worse and often much more delicate than his neighbours  there exists a curious document descriptive of the manners of the last age which describes most minutely the amusements and occupations of persons of fashion in london at the time of which we are speaking the time of swift and addison and steele  when lord sparkish tom neverout and colonel alwit the immortal personages of swift’s polite conversation came to breakfast with my lady smart at eleven o’clock in the morning my lord smart was absent at the levée his lordship was at home to dinner at three o’clock to receive his guests and we may sit down to this meal like the barmecide’s and see the fops of the last century before us seven of them sat down at dinner and were joined by a country baronet who told them they kept court hours these persons of fashion began their dinner with a sirloin of beef fish a shoulder of veal and a tongue my lady smart carved the sirloin my lady answerwell helped the fish and the gallant colonel cut the shoulder of veal all made a considerable inroad on the sirloin and the shoulder of veal with the exception of sir john who had no appetite having already partaken of a beefsteak and two mugs of ale besides a tankard of march beer as soon as he got out of bed they drank claret which the master of the house said should always be drunk after fish and my lord smart particularly recommended some excellent cider to my lord sparkish which occasioned some brilliant remarks from that nobleman when the host called for wine he nodded to one or other of his guests and said “tom neverout my service to you”  after the first course came almond pudding fritters which the colonel took with his hands out of the dish in order to help the brilliant miss notable chickens black puddings and soup and lady smart the elegant mistress of the mansion finding a skewer in a dish placed it in her plate with directions that it should be carried down to the cook and dressed for the cook’s own dinner wine and small beer were drunk during this second course and when the colonel called for beer he called the butler friend and asked whether the beer was good various jocular remarks passed from the gentlefolks to the servants at breakfast several persons had a word and a joke for mrs betty my lady’s maid who warmed the cream and had charge of the canister the tea cost thirty shillings a pound in those days when my lady sparkish sent her footman out to my lady match to come at six o’clock and play at quadrille her ladyship warned the man to follow his nose and if he fell by the way not to stay to get up again and when the gentlemen asked the hallporter if his lady was at home that functionary replied with manly waggishness “she was at home just now but she’s not gone out yet”  after the puddings sweet and black the fritters and soup came the third course of which the chief dish was a hot venison pasty which was put before lord smart and carved by that nobleman besides the pasty there was a hare a rabbit some pigeons partridges a goose and a ham beer and wine were freely imbibed during this course the gentlemen always pledging somebody with every glass which they drank and by this time the conversation between tom neverout and miss notable had grown so brisk and lively that the derbyshire baronet began to think the young gentlewoman was tom’s sweetheart on which miss remarked that she loved tom “like pie” after the goose some of the gentlemen took a dram of brandy “which was very good for the wholesomes” sir john said and now having had a tolerably substantial dinner honest lord smart bade the butler bring up the great tankard full of october to sir john the great tankard was passed from hand to hand and mouth to mouth but when pressed by the noble host upon the gallant tom neverout he said “no faith my lord i like your wine and won’t put a churl upon a gentleman your honour’s claret is good enough for me” and so the dinner over the host said “hang saving bring us up a ha’porth of cheese”  the cloth was now taken away and a bottle of burgundy was set down of which the ladies were invited to partake before they went to their tea when they withdrew the gentlemen promised to join them in an hour fresh bottles were brought the “dead men” meaning the empty bottles removed and “d’you hear john bring clean glasses” my lord smart said on which the gallant colonel alwit said “i’ll keep my glass for wine is the best liquor to wash glasses in”  after an hour the gentlemen joined the ladies and then they all sat and played quadrille until three o’clock in the morning when the chairs and the flambeaux came and this noble company went to bed  such were manners six or seven score years ago i draw no inference from this queer picture—let all moralists here present deduce their own fancy the moral condition of that society in which a lady of fashion joked with a footman and carved a great shoulder of veal and provided besides a sirloin a goose hare rabbit chickens partridges blackpuddings and a ham for a dinner for eight christians what—what could have been the condition of that polite world in which people openly ate goose after almond pudding and took their soup in the middle of dinner fancy a colonel in the guards putting his hand into a dish of beignets d’abricot and helping his neighbour a young lady du monde fancy a noble lord calling out to the servants before the ladies at his table “hang expense bring us a ha’porth of cheese” such were the ladies of st james’s—such were the frequenters of white’s chocolatehouse when swift used to visit it and steele described it as the centre of pleasure gallantry and entertainment a hundred and forty years ago  dennis who ran amuck at the literary society of his day falls foul of poor steele and thus depicts him—“sir john edgar of the county of —— in ireland is of a middle stature broad shoulders thick legs a shape like the picture of somebody over a farmer’s chimney—a short chin a short nose a short forehead a broad flat face and a dusky countenance yet with such a face and such a shape he discovered at sixty that he took himself for a beauty and appeared to be more mortified at being told that he was ugly than he was by any reflection made upon his honour or understanding  “he is a gentleman born witness himself of very honourable family certainly of a very ancient one for his ancestors flourished in tipperary long before the english ever set foot in ireland he has testimony of this more authentic than the heralds’ office or any human testimony for god has marked him more abundantly than he did cain and stamped his native country on his face his understanding his writings his actions his passions and above all his vanity the hibernian brogue is still upon all these though long habit and length of days have worn it off his tongue”107  although this portrait is the work of a man who was neither the friend of steele nor of any other man alive yet there is a dreadful resemblance to the original in the savage and exaggerated traits of the caricature and everybody who knows him must recognize dick steele dick set about almost all the undertakings of his life with inadequate means and as he took and furnished a house with the most generous intentions towards his friends the most tender gallantry towards his wife and with this only drawback that he had not wherewithal to pay the rent when quarterday came—so in his life he proposed to himself the most magnificent schemes of virtue forbearance public and private good and the advancement of his own and the national religion but when he had to pay for these articles—so difficult to purchase and so costly to maintain—poor dick’s money was not forthcoming and when virtue called with her little bill dick made a shuffling excuse that he could not see her that morning having a headache from being tipsy overnight or when stern duty rapped at the door with his account dick was absent and not ready to pay he was shirking at the tavern or had some particular business of somebody’s else at the ordinary or he was in hiding or worse than in hiding in the lockup house what a situation for a man—for a philanthropist—for a lover of right and truth—for a magnificent designer and schemer not to dare to look in the face the religion which he adored and which he had offended to have to shirk down back lanes and alleys so as to avoid the friend whom he loved and who had trusted him—to have the house which he had intended for his wife whom he loved passionately and for her ladyship’s company which he wished to entertain splendidly in the possession of a bailiff’s man with a crowd of little creditors—grocers butchers and smallcoal men lingering round the door with their bills and jeering at him alas for poor dick steele for nobody else of course there is no man or woman in our time who makes fine projects and gives them up from idleness or want of means when duty calls upon us we no doubt are always at home and ready to pay that grim taxgatherer when we are stricken with remorse and promise reform we keep our promise and are never angry or idle or extravagant any more there are no chambers in our hearts destined for family friends and affections and now occupied by some sin’s emissary and bailiff in possession there are no little sins shabby peccadilloes importunate remembrances or disappointed holders of our promises to reform hovering at our steps or knocking at our door of course not we are living in the nineteenth century and poor dick steele stumbled and got up again and got into jail and out again and sinned and repented and loved and suffered and lived and died scores of years ago peace be with him let us think gently of one who was so gentle let us speak kindly of one whose own breast exuberated with human kindness     lecture the fourth prior gay and pope   matthew prior was one of those famous and lucky wits of the auspicious reign of queen anne whose name it behoves us not to pass over mat was a worldphilosopher of no small genius good nature and acumen108 he loved he drank he sang he describes himself in one of his lyrics “in a little dutch chaise on a saturday night on his left hand his horace and a friend on his right” going out of town from the hague to pass that evening and the ensuing sunday boozing at a spielhaus with his companions perhaps bobbing for perch in a dutch canal and noting down in a strain and with a grace not unworthy of his epicurean master the charms of his idleness his retreat and his batavian chloe a vintner’s son in whitehall and a distinguished pupil of busby of the rod prior attracted some notice by writing verses at st john’s college cambridge and coming up to town aided montague109 in an attack on the noble old english lion john dryden in ridicule of whose work the hind and the panther he brought out that remarkable and famous burlesque the town and country mouse aren’t you all acquainted with it have you not all got it by heart what have you never heard of it see what fame is made of the wonderful part of the satire was that as a natural consequence of the town and country mouse matthew prior was made secretary of embassy at the hague i believe it is dancing rather than singing which distinguishes the young english diplomatists of the present day and have seen them in various parts perform that part of their duty very finely in prior’s time it appears a different accomplishment led to preferment could you write a copy of alcaics that was the question could you turn out a neat epigram or two could you compose the town and country mouse it is manifest that by the possession of this faculty the most difficult treaties the laws of foreign nations and the interests of our own are easily understood prior rose in the diplomatic service and said good things that proved his sense and his spirit when the apartments at versailles were shown to him with the victories of louis xiv painted on the walls and prior was asked whether the palace of the king of england had any such decorations “the monuments of my master’s actions” mat said of william whom he cordially revered “are to be seen everywhere except in his own house” bravo mat prior rose to be full ambassador at paris110 where he somehow was cheated out of his ambassadorial plate and in a heroic poem addressed by him to her late lamented majesty queen anne mat makes some magnificent allusions to these dishes and spoons of which fate had deprived him all that he wants he says is her majesty’s picture without that he can’t be happy       thee gracious anne thee present i adore     thee queen of peace if time and fate have power     higher to raise the glories of thy reign     in words sublimer and a nobler strain     may future bards the mighty theme rehearse     here stator jove and phoebus king of verse     the votive tablet i suspend   with that word the poem stops abruptly the votive tablet is suspended for ever like mahomet’s coffin news came that the queen was dead stator jove and phoebus king of verse were left there hovering to this day over the votive tablet the picture was never got any more than the spoons and dishes—the inspiration ceased—the verses were not wanted—the ambassador wasn’t wanted poor mat was recalled from his embassy suffered disgrace along with his patrons lived under a sort of cloud ever after and disappeared in essex when deprived of all his pensions and emoluments the hearty and generous oxford pensioned him they played for gallant stakes—the bold men of those days—and lived and gave splendidly  johnson quotes from spence a legend that prior after spending an evening with harley st john pope and swift would go off and smoke a pipe with a couple of friends of his a soldier and his wife in long acre those who have not read his late excellency’s poems should be warned that they smack not a little of the conversation of his long acre friends johnson speaks slightingly of his lyrics but with due deference to the great samuel prior’s seem to me amongst the easiest the richest the most charmingly humorous of english lyrical poems111 horace is always in his mind and his song and his philosophy his good sense his happy easy turns and melody his loves and his epicureanism bear a great resemblance to that most delightful and accomplished master in reading his works one is struck with their modern air as well as by their happy similarity to the songs of the charming owner of the sabine farm in his verses addressed to halifax he says writing of that endless theme to poets the vanity of human wishes—       so when in fevered dreams we sink       and waking taste what we desire       the real draught but feeds the fire     the dream is better than the drink      our hopes like towering falcons aim       at objects in an airy height       to stand aloof and view the flight     is all the pleasure of the game   would not you fancy that a poet of our own days was singing and in the verses of chloe weeping and reproaching him for his inconstancy where he says—       the god of us versemen you know child the sun       how after his journey he sets up his rest     if at morning o’er earth ’tis his fancy to run       at night he declines on his thetis’s breast      so when i am wearied with wandering all day       to thee my delight in the evening i come     no matter what beauties i saw in my way       they were but my visits but thou art my home      then finish dear chloe this pastoral war       and let us like horace and lydia agree     for thou art a girl as much brighter than her       as he was a poet sublimer than me   if prior read horace did not thomas moore study prior love and pleasure find singers in all days roses are always blowing and fading—today as in that pretty time when prior sang of them and of chloe lamenting their decay—       she sighed she smiled and to the flowers       pointing the lovely moralist said     see friend in some few leisure hours       see yonder what a change is made      ah me the blooming pride of may       and that of beauty are but one     at morn both flourisht bright and gay       both fade at evening pale and gone      at dawn poor stella danced and sung       the amorous youth around her bowed     at night her fatal knell was rung       i saw and kissed her in her shroud      such as she is who died today       such i alas may be tomorrow     go damon bid the muse display       the justice of thy chloe’s sorrow   damon’s knell was rung in 1721 may his turf lie lightly on him deus sit propitius huic potatori as walter de mapes sang112 perhaps samuel johnson who spoke slightingly of prior’s verses enjoyed them more than he was willing to own the old moralist had studied them as well as mr thomas moore and defended them and showed that he remembered them very well too on an occasion when their morality was called in question by that noted puritan james boswell esq of auchinleck113  in the great society of the wits john gay deserved to be a favourite and to have a good place114 in his set all were fond of him his success offended nobody he missed a fortune once or twice he was talked of for court favour and hoped to win it but the court favour jilted him craggs gave him some southsea stock and at one time gay had very nearly made his fortune but fortune shook her swift wings and jilted him too and so his friends instead of being angry with him and jealous of him were kind and fond of honest gay in the portraits of the literary worthies of the early part of the last century gay’s face is the pleasantest perhaps of all it appears adorned with neither periwig nor nightcap the full dress and negligée of learning without which the painters of those days scarcely ever portrayed wits and he laughs at you over his shoulder with an honest boyish glee—an artless sweet humour he was so kind so gentle so jocular so delightfully brisk at times so dismally woebegone at others such a natural good creature that the giants loved him the great swift was gentle and sportive with him115 as the enormous brobdingnag maids of honour were with little gulliver he could frisk and fondle round pope116 and sport and bark and caper without offending the most thinskinned of poets and men and when he was jilted in that little court affair of which we have spoken his warmhearted patrons the duke and duchess of queensberry117 the “kitty beautiful and young” of prior pleaded his cause with indignation and quitted the court in a huff carrying off with them into their retirement their kind gentle protégé with these kind lordly folks a real duke and duchess as delightful as those who harboured don quixote and loved that dear old sancho gay lived and was lapped in cotton and had his plate of chicken and his saucer of cream and frisked and barked and wheezed and grew fat and so ended118 he became very melancholy and lazy sadly plethoric and only occasionally diverting in his latter days but everybody loved him and the remembrance of his pretty little tricks and the raging old dean of st patrick’s chafing in his banishment was afraid to open the letter which pope wrote him announcing the sad news of the death of gay119  swift’s letters to him are beautiful and having no purpose but kindness in writing to him no party aim to advocate or slight or anger to wreak every word the dean says to his favourite is natural trustworthy and kindly his admiration for gay’s parts and honesty and his laughter at his weaknesses were alike just and genuine he paints his character in wonderful pleasant traits of jocular satire “i writ lately to mr pope” swift says writing to gay “i wish you had a little villakin in his neighbourhood but you are yet too volatile and any lady with a coach and six horses would carry you to japan” “if your ramble” says swift in another letter “was on horseback i am glad of it on account of your health but i know your arts of patching up a journey between stagecoaches and friends” coaches—for you are as arrant a cockney as any hosier in cheapside i have often had it in my head to put it into yours that you ought to have some great work in scheme which may take up seven years to finish besides two or three underones that may add another thousand pounds to your stock and then i shall be in less pain about you i know you can find dinners but you love twelvepenny coaches too well without considering that the interest of a whole thousand pounds brings you but half a crown a day’ and then swift goes off from gay to pay some grand compliments to her grace the duchess of queensberry in whose sunshine mr gay was basking and in whose radiance the dean would have liked to warm himself too  but we have gay here before us in these letters—lazy kindly uncommonly idle rather slovenly i’m afraid for ever eating and saying good things a little round french abbé of a man sleek softhanded and softhearted  our object in these lectures is rather to describe the men than their works or to deal with the latter only in as far as they seem to illustrate the character of their writers mr gay’s fables which were written to benefit that amiable prince the duke of cumberland the warrior of dettingen and culloden i have not i own been able to peruse since a period of very early youth and it must be confessed that they did not effect much benefit upon the illustrious young prince whose manners they were intended to mollify and whose natural ferocity our gentlehearted satirist perhaps proposed to restrain but the six pastorals called the shepherd’s week and the burlesque poem of trivia any man fond of lazy literature will find delightful at the present day and must read from beginning to end with pleasure they are to poetry what charming little dresden china figures are to sculpture graceful minikin fantastic with a certain beauty always accompanying them the pretty little personages of the pastoral with gold clocks to their stockings and fresh satin ribbons to their crooks and waistcoats and bodices dance their loves to a minuettune played on a birdorgan approach the charmer or rush from the false one daintily on their redheeled tiptoes and die of despair or rapture with the most pathetic little grins and ogles or repose simpering at each other under an arbour of peagreen crockery or piping to pretty flocks that have just been washed with the best naples in a stream of bergamot gay’s gay plan seems to me far pleasanter than that of philips—his rival and pope’s—a serious and dreary idyllic cockney not that gay’s “bumkinets and hobnelias” are a whit more natural than the wouldbe serious characters of the other posturemaster but the quality of this true humourist was to laugh and make laugh though always with a secret kindness and tenderness to perform the drollest little antics and capers but always with a certain grace and to sweet music—as you may have seen a savoyard boy abroad with a hurdygurdy and a monkey turning over head and heels or clattering and piroueting in a pair of wooden shoes yet always with a look of love and appeal in his bright eyes and a smile that asks and wins affection and protection happy they who have that sweet gift of nature it was this which made the great folks and court ladies free and friendly with john gay—which made pope and arbuthnot love him—which melted the savage heart of swift when he thought of him—and drove away for a moment or two the dark frenzies which obscured the lonely tyrant’s brain as he heard gay’s voice with its simple melody and artless ringing laughter  what used to be said about rubini qu’il avait des larmes dans la voix may be said of gay120 and of one other humourist of whom we shall have to speak in almost every ballad of his however slight121 in the beggar’s  opera122 and in its wearisome continuation where the verses are to the full as pretty as in the first piece however there is a peculiar hinted pathetic sweetness and melody it charms and melts you it’s indefinable but it exists and is the property of john gay’s and oliver goldsmith’s best verse as fragrance is of a violet or freshness of a rose  let me read a piece from one of his letters which is so famous that most people here are no doubt familiar with it but so delightful that it is always pleasant to hear—       “i have just passed part of this summer at an old romantic seat of     my lord harcourt’s which he lent me it overlooks a common     hayfield where under the shade of a haycock sat two lovers—as     constant as ever were found in romance—beneath a spreading bush     the name of the one let it sound as it will was john hewet of     the other sarah drew john was a wellset man about     fiveandtwenty sarah a brave woman of eighteen john had for     several months borne the labour of the day in the same field with     sarah when she milked it was his morning and evening charge to     bring the cows to her pails their love was the talk but not the     scandal of the whole neighbourhood for all they aimed at was the     blameless possession of each other in marriage it was but this     very morning that he had obtained her parents’ consent and it was     but till the next week that they were to wait to be happy perhaps     this very day in the intervals of their work they were talking     of their wedding clothes and john was now matching several kinds     of poppies and fieldflowers to make her a present of knots for     the day while they were thus employed it was on the last of     july a terrible storm of thunder and lightning arose that drove     the labourers to what shelter the trees or hedges afforded sarah     frightened and out of breath sunk on a haycock and john who     never separated from her sat by her side having raked two or     three heaps together to secure her immediately there was heard     so loud a crash as if heaven had burst asunder the labourers     all solicitous for each other’s safety called to one another     those that were nearest our lovers hearing no answer stepped to     the place where they lay they first saw a little smoke and     after this faithful pair—john with one arm about his sarah’s     neck and the other held over her face as if to screen her from     the lightning they were struck dead and already grown stiff and     cold in this tender posture there was no mark or discolouring on     their bodies—only that sarah’s eyebrow was a little singed and a     small spot between her breasts they were buried the next day in     one grave”   and the proof that this description is delightful and beautiful is that the great mr pope admired it so much that he thought proper to steal it and to send it off to a certain lady and wit with whom he pretended to be in love in those days—my lord duke of kingston’s daughter and married to mr wortley montagu then his majesty’s ambassador at constantinople  we are now come to the greatest name on our list—the highest among the poets the highest among the english wits and humourists with whom we have to rank him if the author of the dunciad be not a humourist if the poet of the rape of the lock be not a wit who deserves to be called so besides that brilliant genius and immense fame for both of which we should respect him men of letters should admire him as being the greatest literary artist that england has seen he polished he refined he thought he took thoughts from other works to adorn and complete his own borrowing an idea or a cadence from another poet as he would a figure or a simile from a flower river stream or any object which struck him in his walk or contemplation of nature he began to imitate at an early age123 and taught himself to write by copying printed books then he passed into the hands of the priests and from his first clerical master who came to him when he was eight years old he went to a school at twyford and another school at hyde park at which places he unlearned all that he had got from his first instructor at twelve years old he went with his father into windsor forest and there learned for a few months under a fourth priest “and this was all the teaching i ever had” he said “and god knows it extended a very little way”  when he had done with his priests he took to reading by himself for which he had a very great eagerness and enthusiasm especially for poetry he learned versification from dryden he said in his youthful poem of alcander he imitated every poet cowley milton spenser statius homer virgil in a few years he had dipped into a great number of the english french italian latin and greek poets “this i did” he says “without any design except to amuse myself and got the languages by hunting after the stories in the several poets i read rather than read the books to get the languages i followed everywhere as my fancy led me and was like a boy gathering flowers in the fields and woods just as they fell in his way these five or six years i looked upon as the happiest in my life” is not here a beautiful holiday picture the forest and the fairy storybook—the boy spelling ariosto or virgil under the trees battling with the cid for the love of chimène or dreaming of armida’s garden—peace and sunshine round about—the kindest love and tenderness waiting for him at his quiet home yonder—and genius throbbing in his young heart and whispering to him “you shall be great you shall be famous you too shall love and sing you will sing her so nobly that some kind heart shall forget you are weak and illformed every poet had a love fate must give one to you too”—and day by day he walks the forest very likely looking out for that charmer “they were the happiest days of his life” he says when he was only dreaming of his fame when he had gained that mistress she was no consoler  that charmer made her appearance it would seem about the year 1705 when pope was seventeen letters of his are extant addressed to a certain lady m—— whom the youth courted and to whom he expressed his ardour in language to say no worse of it that is entirely pert odious and affected he imitated love compositions as he had been imitating love poems just before—it was a sham mistress he courted and a sham passion expressed as became it these unlucky letters found their way into print years afterwards and were sold to the congenial mr curll if any of my hearers as i hope they may should take a fancy to look at pope’s correspondence let them pass over that first part of it over perhaps almost all pope’s letters to women in which there is a tone of not pleasant gallantry and amidst a profusion of compliments and politenesses a something which makes one distrust the little pert prurient bard there is very little indeed to say about his loves and that little not edifying he wrote flames and raptures and elaborate verse and prose for lady mary wortley montagu but that passion probably came to a climax in an impertinence and was extinguished by a box on the ear or some such rebuff and he began on a sudden to hate her with a fervour much more genuine than that of his love had been it was a feeble puny grimace of love and paltering with passion after mr pope had sent off one of his fine compositions to lady mary he made a second draft from the rough copy and favoured some other friend with it he was so charmed with the letter of gay’s that i have just quoted that he had copied that and amended it and sent it to lady mary as his own a gentleman who writes letters à deux fins and after having poured out his heart to the beloved serves up the same dish rechauffé to a friend is not very much in earnest about his loves however much he may be in his piques and vanities when his impertinence gets its due  but save that unlucky part of the pope correspondence i do not know in the range of our literature volumes more delightful124 you live in them in the finest company in the world a little stately perhaps a little apprêté and conscious that they are speaking to whole generations who are listening but in the tone of their voices—pitched as no doubt they are beyond the mere conversation key—in the expression of their thoughts their various views and natures there is something generous and cheering and ennobling you are in the society of men who have filled the greatest parts in the world’s story—you are with st john the statesman peterborough the conqueror swift the greatest wit of all times gay the kindliest laugher—it is a privilege to sit in that company delightful and generous banquet with a little faith and a little fancy any one of us here may enjoy it and conjure up those great figures out of the past and listen to their wit and wisdom mind that there is always a certain cachet about great men—they may be as mean on many points as you or i but they carry their great air—they speak of common life more largely and generously than common men do—they regard the world with a manlier countenance and see its real features more fairly than the timid shufflers who only dare to look up at life through blinkers or to have an opinion when there is a crowd to back it he who reads these noble records of a past age salutes and reverences the great spirits who adorn it you may go home now and talk with st john you may take a volume from your library and listen to swift and pope  might i give counsel to any young hearer i would say to him try to frequent the company of your betters in books and life that is the most wholesome society learn to admire rightly the great pleasure of life is that note what the great men admired they admired great things narrow spirits admire basely and worship meanly i know nothing in any story more gallant and cheering than the love and friendship which this company of famous men bore towards one another there never has been a society of men more friendly as there never was one more illustrious who dares quarrel with mr pope great and famous himself for liking the society of men great and famous and for liking them for the qualities which made them so a mere pretty fellow from white’s could not have written the patriot king and would very likely have despised little mr pope the decrepit papist whom the great st john held to be one of the best and greatest of men a mere nobleman of the court could no more have won barcelona than he could have written peterborough’s letters to pope125 which are as witty as congreve a mere irish dean could not have written gulliver and all these men loved pope and pope loved all these men to name his friends is to name the best men of his time addison had a senate pope reverenced his equals he spoke of swift with respect and admiration always his admiration for bolingbroke was so great that when some one said of his friend “there is something in that great man which looks as if he was placed here by mistake” “yes” pope answered “and when the comet appeared to us a month or two ago i had sometimes an imagination that it might possibly be come to carry him home as a coach comes to one’s door for visitors” so these great spirits spoke of one another show me six of the dullest middleaged gentlemen that ever dawdled round a clubtable so faithful and so friendly  we have said before that the chief wits of this time with the exception of congreve were what we should now call men’s men they spent many hours of the fourandtwenty a fourth part of each day nearly in clubs and coffeehouses where they dined drank and smoked wit and news went by word of mouth a journal of 1710 contained the very smallest portion of one or the other the chiefs spoke the faithful habitués sat round strangers came to wonder and listen old dryden had his head quarters at will’s in russell street at the corner of bow street at which place pope saw him when he was twelve years old the company used to assemble on the first floor—what was called the diningroom floor in those days—and sat at various tables smoking their pipes it is recorded that the beaux of the day thought it a great honour to be allowed to take a pinch out of dryden’s snuffbox when addison began to reign he with a certain crafty propriety—a policy let us call it—which belonged to his nature set up his court and appointed the officers of his royal house his palace was button’s opposite will’s126 a quiet opposition a silent assertion of empire distinguished this great man addison’s ministers were budgell tickell philips carey his master of the horse honest dick steele who was what duroc was to napoleon or hardy to nelson the man who performed his master’s bidding and would have cheerfully died in his quarrel addison lived with these people for seven or eight hours every day the male society passed over their punchbowls and tobaccopipes about as much time as ladies of that age spent over spadille and manille  for a brief space upon coming up to town pope formed part of king joseph’s court and was his rather too eager and obsequious humble servant127 dick steele the editor of the tatler mr addison’s man and his own man too—a person of no little figure in the world of letters patronized the young poet and set him a task or two young mr pope did the tasks very quickly and smartly he had been at the feet quite as a boy of wycherley’s decrepit reputation and propped up for a year that doting old wit he was anxious to be well with the men of letters to get a footing and a recognition he thought it an honour to be admitted into their company to have the confidence of mr addison’s friend captain steele his eminent parts obtained for him the honour of heralding addison’s triumph of cato with his admirable prologue and heading the victorious procession as it were not content with this act of homage and admiration he wanted to distinguish himself by assaulting addison’s enemies and attacked john dennis with a prose lampoon which highly offended his lofty patron mr steele was instructed to write to mr dennis and inform him that mr pope’s pamphlet against him was written quite without mr addison’s approval128 indeed the narrative of dr robert norris on the phrenzy of j d is a vulgar and mean satire and such a blow as the magnificent addison could never desire to see any partisan of his strike in any literary quarrel pope was closely allied with swift when he wrote this pamphlet it is so dirty that it has been printed in swift’s works too it bears the foul marks of the master hand swift admired and enjoyed with all his heart the prodigious genius of the young papist lad out of windsor forest who had never seen a university in his life and came and conquered the dons and the doctors with his wit he applauded and loved him too and protected him and taught him mischief i wish addison could have loved him better the best satire that ever has been penned would never have been written then and one of the best characters the world ever knew would have been without a flaw but he who had so few equals could not bear one and pope was more than that when pope trying for himself and soaring on his immortal young wings found that his too was a genius which no opinion of that age could follow he rose and left addison’s company settling on his own eminence and singing his own song  it was not possible that pope should remain a retainer of mr addison nor likely that after escaping from his vassalage and assuming an independent crown the sovereign whose allegiance he quitted should view him amicably129 they did not do wrong to mislike each other they but followed the impulse of nature and the consequence of position when bernadotte became heir to a throne the prince royal of sweden was naturally napoleon’s enemy “there are many passions and tempers of mankind” says mr addison in the spectator speaking a couple of years before their little differences between him and mr pope took place “which naturally dispose us to depress and vilify the merit of one rising in the esteem of mankind all those who made their entrance into the world with the same advantages and were once looked on as his equals are apt to think the fame of his merits a reflection on their own deserts those who were once his equals envy and defame him because they now see him the superior and those who were once his superiors because they look upon him as their equal” did mr addison justly perhaps thinking that as young mr pope had not had the benefit of a university education he couldn’t know greek therefore he couldn’t translate homer encourage his young friend mr tickell of queen’s to translate that poet and aid him with his own known scholarship and skill130 it was natural that mr addison should doubt of the learning of an amateur grecian should have a high opinion of mr tickell of queen’s and should help that ingenious young man it was natural on the other hand that mr pope and mr pope’s friends should believe that this countertranslation suddenly advertised and so long written though tickell’s college friends had never heard of it—though when pope first wrote to addison regarding his scheme mr addison knew nothing of the similar project of tickell of queen’s—it was natural that mr pope and his friends having interests passions and prejudices of their own should believe that tickell’s translation was but an act of opposition against pope and that they should call mr tickell’s emulation mr addison’s envy—if envy it were             and were there one whose fires     true genius kindles and fair fame inspires     blest with each talent and each art to please     and born to write converse and live with ease     should such a man too fond to rule alone     bear like the turk no brother near the throne     view him with scornful yet with jealous eyes     and hate for arts that caused himself to rise     damn with faint praise assent with civil leer     and without sneering teach the rest to sneer     willing to wound and yet afraid to strike     just hint a fault and hesitate dislike     alike reserved to blame as to commend     a timorous foe and a suspicious friend     dreading even fools by flatterers besieged     and so obliging that he ne’er obliged     like cato give his little senate laws     and sit attentive to his own applause     while wits and templars every sentence raise     and wonder with a foolish face of praise     who but must laugh if such a man there be     who would not weep if atticus were he   “i sent the verses to mr addison” said pope “and he used me very civilly ever after” no wonder he did it was shame very likely more than fear that silenced him johnson recounts an interview between pope and addison after their quarrel in which pope was angry and addison tried to be contemptuous and calm such a weapon as pope’s must have pierced any scorn it flashes for ever and quivers in addison’s memory his great figure looks out on us from the past—stainless but for that—pale calm and beautiful it bleeds from that black wound he should be drawn like st sebastian with that arrow in his side as he sent to gay and asked his pardon as he bade his stepson come and see his death be sure he had forgiven pope when he made ready to show how a christian could die  pope then formed part of the addisonian court for a short time and describes himself in his letters as sitting with that coterie until two o’clock in the morning over punch and burgundy amidst the fumes of tobacco to use an expression of the present day the “pace” of those viveurs of the former age was awful peterborough lived into the very jaws of death godolphin laboured all day and gambled at night bolingbroke131 writing to swift from dawley in his retirement dating his letter at six o’clock in the morning and rising as he says refreshed serene and calm calls to mind the time of his london life when about that hour he used to be going to bed surfeited with pleasure and jaded with business his head often full of schemes and his heart as often full of anxiety it was too hard too coarse a life for the sensitive sickly pope he was the only wit of the day a friend writes to me who wasn’t fat132 swift was fat addison was fat steele was fat gay and thomson were preposterously fat—all that fuddling and punchdrinking that club and coffeehouse boozing shortened the lives and enlarged the waistcoats of the men of that age pope withdrew in a great measure from this boisterous london company and being put into an independence by the gallant exertions of swift133 and his private friends and by the enthusiastic national admiration which justly rewarded his great achievement of the iliad purchased that famous villa of twickenham which his song and life celebrated duteously bringing his old parents to live and die there entertaining his friends there and making occasional visits to london in his little chariot in which atterbury compared him to “homer in a nutshell”  “mr dryden was not a genteel man” pope quaintly said to spence speaking of the manner and habits of the famous old patriarch of will’s with regard to pope’s own manners we have the best contemporary authority that they were singularly refined and polished with his extraordinary sensibility with his known tastes with his delicate frame with his power and dread of ridicule pope could have been no other than what we call a highlybred person his closest friends with the exception of swift were among the delights and ornaments of the polished society of their age garth134 the accomplished and benevolent whom steele has described so charmingly of whom codrington said that his character was “all beauty” and whom pope himself called the best of christians without knowing it arbuthnot135 one of the wisest wittiest most accomplished gentlest of mankind bolingbroke the alcibiades of his age the generous oxford the magnificent the witty the famous and chivalrous peterborough these were the fast and faithful friends of pope the most brilliant company of friends let us repeat that the world has ever seen the favourite recreation of his leisure hours was the society of painters whose art he practised in his correspondence are letters between him and jervas whose pupil he loved to be—richardson a celebrated artist of his time and who painted for him a portrait of his old mother and for whose picture he asked and thanked richardson in one of the most delightful letters that ever was penned136—and the wonderful kneller who bragged more spelt worse and painted better than any artist of his day137  it is affecting to note through pope’s correspondence the marked way in which his friends the greatest the most famous and wittiest men of the time—generals and statesmen philosophers and divines—all have a kind word and a kind thought for the good simple old mother whom pope tended so affectionately those men would have scarcely valued her but that they knew how much he loved her and that they pleased him by thinking of her if his early letters to women are affected and insincere whenever he speaks about this one it is with a childish tenderness and an almost sacred simplicity in 1713 when young mr pope had by a series of the most astonishing victories and dazzling achievements seized the crown of poetry and the town was in an uproar of admiration or hostility for the young chief when pope was issuing his famous decrees for the translation of the iliad when dennis and the lower critics were hooting and assailing him when addison and the gentlemen of his court were sneering with sickening hearts at the prodigious triumphs of the young conqueror when pope in a fever of victory and genius and hope and anger was struggling through the crowd of shouting friends and furious detractors to his temple of fame his old mother writes from the country “my deare” says she “my deare there’s mr blount of mapel durom dead the same day that mr inglefield died your sister is well but your brother is sick my service to mrs blount and all that ask of me i hope to hear from you and that you are well which is my daily prayer and this with my blessing” the triumph marches by and the car of the young conqueror the hero of a hundred brilliant victories—the fond mother sits in the quiet cottage at home and says “i send you my daily prayers and i bless you my deare”  in our estimate of pope’s character let us always take into account that constant tenderness and fidelity of affection which pervaded and sanctified his life and never forget that maternal benediction138 it accompanied him always his life seems purified by those artless and heartfelt prayers and he seems to have received and deserved the fond attachment of the other members of his family it is not a little touching to read in spence of the enthusiastic admiration with which his halfsister regarded him and the simple anecdote by which she illustrates her love “i think no man was ever so little fond of money” mrs rackett says about her brother “i think my brother when he was young read more books than any man in the world” and she falls to telling stories of his schooldays and the manner in which his master at twyford illused him “i don’t think my brother knew what fear was” she continues and the accounts of pope’s friends bear out this character for courage when he had exasperated the dunces and threats of violence and personal assault were brought to him the dauntless little champion never for one instant allowed fear to disturb him or condescended to take any guard in his daily walks except occasionally his faithful dog to bear him company “i had rather die at once” said the gallant little cripple “than live in fear of those rascals”  as for his death it was what the noble arbuthnot asked and enjoyed for himself—a euthanasia—a beautiful end a perfect benevolence affection serenity hallowed the departure of that high soul even in the very hallucinations of his brain and weaknesses of his delirium there was something almost sacred spence describes him in his last days looking up and with a rapt gaze as if something had suddenly passed before him he said to me “what’s that” pointing into the air with a very steady regard and then looked down and said with a smile of the greatest softness “’twas a vision” he laughed scarcely ever but his companions describe his countenance as often illuminated by a peculiar sweet smile  “when” said spence139 the kind anecdotist whom johnson despised “when i was telling lord bolingbroke that mr pope on every catching and recovery of his mind was always saying something kindly of his present or absent friends and that this was so surprising as it seemed to me as if humanity had outlasted understanding lord bolingbroke said ‘it has so’ and then added ‘i never in my life knew a man who had so tender a heart for his particular friends or a more general friendship for mankind i have known him these thirty years and value myself more for that man’s love than——’ here” spence says “st john sunk his head and lost his voice in tears” the sob which finishes the epitaph is finer than words it is the cloak thrown over the father’s face in the famous greek picture which hides the grief and heightens it  in johnson’s life of pope you will find described with rather a malicious minuteness some of the personal habits and infirmities of the great little pope his body was crooked he was so short that it was necessary to raise his chair in order to place him on a level with other people at table140 he was sewed up in a buckram suit every morning and required a nurse like a child his contemporaries reviled these misfortunes with a strange acrimony and made his poor deformed person the butt for many a bolt of heavy wit the facetious mr dennis in speaking of him says “if you take the first letter of mr alexander pope’s christian name and the first and last letters of his surname you have a p e” pope catalogues at the end of the dunciad with a rueful precision other pretty names besides ape which dennis called him that great critic pronounced mr pope was a little ass a fool a coward a papist and therefore a hater of scripture and so forth it must be remembered that the pillory was a flourishing and popular institution in those days authors stood in it in the body sometimes and dragged their enemies thither morally hooted them with foul abuse and assailed them with garbage of the gutter poor pope’s figure was an easy one for those clumsy caricaturists to draw any stupid hand could draw a hunchback and write pope underneath they did a libel was published against pope with such a frontispiece this kind of rude jesting was an evidence not only of an ill nature but a dull one when a child makes a pun or a lout breaks out into a laugh it is some very obvious combination of words or discrepancy of objects which provokes the infantine satirist or tickles the boorish wag and many of pope’s revilers laughed not so much because they were wicked as because they knew no better  without the utmost sensibility pope could not have been the poet he was and through his life however much he protested that he disregarded their abuse the coarse ridicule of his opponents stung and tore him one of cibber’s pamphlets coming into pope’s hands whilst richardson the painter was with him pope turned round and said “these things are my diversions” and richardson sitting by whilst pope perused the libel said he saw his features “writhing with anguish” how little human nature changes can’t one see that little figure can’t one fancy one is reading horace can’t one fancy one is speaking of today  the tastes and sensibilities of pope which led him to cultivate the society of persons of fine manners or wit or taste or beauty caused him to shrink equally from that shabby and boisterous crew which formed the rank and file of literature in his time and he was as unjust to these men as they to him the delicate little creature sickened at habits and company which were quite tolerable to robuster men and in the famous feud between pope and the dunces and without attributing any peculiar wrong to either one can quite understand how the two parties should so hate each other as i fancy it was a sort of necessity that when pope’s triumph passed mr addison and his men should look rather contemptuously down on it from their balcony so it was natural for dennis and tibbald and welsted and cibber and the worn and hungry pressmen in the crowd below to howl at him and assail him and pope was more savage to grub street than grub street was to pope the thong with which he lashed them was dreadful he fired upon that howling crew such shafts of flame and poison he slew and wounded so fiercely that in reading the dunciad and the prose lampoons of pope one feels disposed to side against the ruthless little tyrant at least to pity those wretched folks upon whom he was so unmerciful it was pope and swift to aid him who established among us the grub street tradition he revels in base descriptions of poor men’s want he gloats over poor dennis’s garret and flannel nightcap and red stockings he gives instructions how to find curll’s authors the historian at the tallowchandler’s under the blind arch in petty france the two translators in bed together the poet in the cockloft in budge row whose landlady keeps the ladder it was pope i fear who contributed more than any man who ever lived to depreciate the literary calling it was not an unprosperous one before that time as we have seen at least there were great prizes in the profession which had made addison a minister and prior an ambassador and steele a commissioner and swift all but a bishop the profession of letters was ruined by that libel of the dunciad if authors were wretched and poor before if some of them lived in haylofts of which their landladies kept the ladders at least nobody came to disturb them in their straw if three of them had but one coat between them the two remained invisible in the garret the third at any rate appeared decently at the coffeehouse and paid his twopence like a gentleman it was pope that dragged into light all this poverty and meanness and held up those wretched shifts and rags to public ridicule it was pope that has made generations of the reading world delighted with the mischief as who would not be that reads it believe that author and wretch author and rags author and dirt author and drink gin cowheel tripe poverty duns bailiffs squalling children and clamorous landladies were always associated together the condition of authorship began to fall from the days of the dunciad and i believe in my heart that much of that obloquy which has since pursued our calling was occasioned by pope’s libels and wicked wit everybody read those everybody was familiarized with the idea of the poor devil the author the manner is so captivating that young authors practise it and begin their career with satire it is so easy to write and so pleasant to read to fire a shot that makes a giant wince perhaps and fancy one’s self his conqueror it is easy to shoot—but not as pope did—the shafts of his satire rise sublimely no poet’s verse ever mounted higher than that wonderful flight with which the dunciad concludes141—       she comes she comes the sable throne behold     of night primaeval and of chaos old     before her fancy’s gilded clouds decay     and all its varying rainbows die away     wit shoots in vain its momentary fires     the meteor drops and in a flash expires     as one by one at dread medea’s strain     the sick’ning stars fade off the ethereal plain     as argus’ eyes by hermes’ wand oppress’d     closed one by one to everlasting rest—     thus at her fell approach and secret might     art after art goes out and all is night     see skulking faith to her old cavern fled     mountains of casuistry heaped o’er her head     philosophy that leaned on heaven before     shrinks to her second cause and is no more     religion blushing veils her sacred fires     and unawares morality expires     nor public flame nor private dares to shine     nor human spark is left nor glimpse divine     lo thy dread empire chaos is restored     light dies before thy uncreating word     thy hand great anarch lets the curtain fall     and universal darkness buries all142   in these astonishing lines pope reaches i think to the very greatest height which his sublime art has attained and shows himself the equal of all poets of all times it is the brightest ardour the loftiest assertion of truth the most generous wisdom illustrated by the noblest poetic figure and spoken in words the aptest grandest and most harmonious it is heroic courage speaking a splendid declaration of righteous wrath and war it is the gage flung down and the silver trumpet ringing defiance to falsehood and tyranny deceit dullness superstition it is truth the champion shining and intrepid and fronting the great worldtyrant with armies of slaves at his back it is a wonderful and victorious single combat in that great battle which has always been waging since society began  in speaking of a work of consummate art one does not try to show what it actually is for that were vain but what it is like and what are the sensations produced in the mind of him who views it and in considering pope’s admirable career i am forced into similitudes drawn from other courage and greatness and into comparing him with those who achieved triumphs in actual war i think of the works of young pope as i do of the actions of young bonaparte or young nelson in their common life you will find frailties and meannesses as great as the vices and follies of the meanest men but in the presence of the great occasion the great soul flashes out and conquers transcendent in thinking of the splendour of pope’s young victories of his merit unequalled as his renown i hail and salute the achieving genius and do homage to the pen of a hero     lecture the fifth hogarth smollett and fielding   i suppose as long as novels last and authors aim at interesting their public there must always be in the story a virtuous and gallant hero a wicked monster his opposite and a pretty girl who finds a champion bravery and virtue conquer beauty and vice after seeming to triumph through a certain number of pages is sure to be discomfited in the last volume when justice overtakes him and honest folks come by their own there never was perhaps a greatly popular story but this simple plot was carried through it mere satiric wit is addressed to a class of readers and thinkers quite different to those simple souls who laugh and weep over the novel i fancy very few ladies indeed for instance could be brought to like gulliver heartily and putting the coarseness and difference of manners out of the question to relish the wonderful satire of jonathan wild in that strange apologue the author takes for a hero the greatest rascal coward traitor tyrant hypocrite that his wit and experience both large in this matter could enable him to devise or depict he accompanies this villain through all the actions of his life with a grinning deference and a wonderful mock respect and doesn’t leave him till he is dangling at the gallows when the satirist makes him a low bow and wishes the scoundrel good day  it was not by satire of this sort or by scorn and contempt that hogarth achieved his vast popularity and acquired his reputation143 his art is quite simple144 he speaks popular parables to interest simple hearts and to inspire them with pleasure or pity or warning and terror not one of his tales but is as easy as goody two shoes it is the moral of tommy was a naughty boy and the master flogged him and jacky was a good boy and had plum cake which pervades the whole works of the homely and famous english moralist and if the moral is written in rather too large letters after the fable we must remember how simple the scholars and schoolmaster both were and like neither the less because they are so artless and honest “it was a maxim of dr harrison’s” fielding says in amelia speaking of the benevolent divine and philosopher who represents the good principle in that novel—“that no man can descend below himself in doing any act which may contribute to protect an innocent person or to bring a rogue to the gallows” the moralists of that age had no compunction you see they had not begun to be sceptical about the theory of punishment and thought that the hanging of a thief was a spectacle for edification masters sent their apprentices fathers took their children to see jack sheppard or jonathan wild hanged and it was as undoubting subscribers to this moral law that fielding wrote and hogarth painted except in one instance where in the madhouse scene in the rake’s progress the girl whom he has ruined is represented as still tending and weeping over him in his insanity a glimpse of pity for his rogues never seems to enter honest hogarth’s mind there’s not the slightest doubt in the breast of the jolly draco  the famous set of pictures called “marriage à la mode” and which are exhibited at marlborough house 1853 in london contains the most important and highly wrought of the hogarth comedies the care and method with which the moral grounds of these pictures are laid is as remarkable as the wit and skill of the observing and dexterous artist he has to describe the negotiations for a marriage pending between the daughter of a rich citizen alderman and young lord viscount squanderfield the dissipated son of a gouty old earl pride and pomposity appear in every accessory surrounding the earl he sits in gold lace and velvet—as how should such an earl wear anything but velvet and gold lace his coronet is everywhere on his footstool on which reposes one gouty toe turned out on the sconces and lookingglasses on the dogs on his lordship’s very crutches on his great chair of state and the great baldaquin behind him under which he sits pointing majestically to his pedigree which shows that his race is sprung from the loins of william the conqueror and confronting the old alderman from the city who has mounted his sword for the occasion and wears his alderman’s chain and has brought a bag full of money mortgagedeeds and thousandpound notes for the arrangement of the transaction pending between them whilst the steward a methodist therefore a hypocrite and cheat for hogarth scorned a papist and a dissenter is negotiating between the old couple their children sit together united but apart my lord is admiring his countenance in the glass while his bride is twiddling her marriage ring on her pockethandkerchief and listening with rueful countenance to counsellor silvertongue who has been drawing the settlements the girl is pretty but the painter with a curious watchfulness has taken care to give her a likeness to her father as in the young viscount’s face you see a resemblance to the earl his noble sire the sense of the coronet pervades the picture as it is supposed to do the mind of its wearer the pictures round the room are sly hints indicating the situation of the parties about to marry a martyr is led to the fire andromeda is offered to sacrifice judith is going to slay holofernes there is the ancestor of the house in the picture it is the earl himself as a young man with a comet over his head indicating that the career of the family is to be brilliant and brief in the second picture the old lord must be dead for madam has now the countess’s coronet over her bed and toiletglass and sits listening to that dangerous counsellor silvertongue whose portrait now actually hangs up in her room whilst the counsellor takes his ease on the sofa by her side evidently the familiar of the house and the confidant of the mistress my lord takes his pleasure elsewhere than at home whither he returns jaded and tipsy from the “rose” to find his wife yawning in her drawingroom her whistparty over and the daylight streaming in or he amuses himself with the very worst company abroad whilst his wife sits at home listening to foreign singers or wastes her money at auctions or worse still seeks amusement at masquerades the dismal end is known my lord draws upon the counsellor who kills him and is apprehended whilst endeavouring to escape my lady goes back perforce to the alderman in the city and faints upon reading counsellor silvertongue’s dying speech at tyburn where the counsellor has been executed for sending his lordship out of the world moral—don’t listen to evil silvertongued counsellors don’t marry a man for his rank or a woman for her money don’t frequent foolish auctions and masquerade balls unknown to your husband don’t have wicked companions abroad and neglect your wife otherwise you will be run through the body and ruin will ensue and disgrace and tyburn the people are all naughty and bogey carries them all off  in the rake’s progress a loose life is ended by a similar sad catastrophe it is the spendthrift coming into possession of the wealth of the paternal miser the prodigal surrounded by flatterers and wasting his substance on the very worst company the bailiffs the gamblinghouse and bedlam for an end in the famous story of industry and idleness the moral is pointed in a manner similarly clear fairhaired frank goodchild smiles at his work whilst naughty tom idle snores over his loom frank reads the edifying ballads of whittington and the london ’prentice whilst that reprobate tom idle prefers moll flanders and drinks hugely of beer frank goes to church of a sunday and warbles hymns from the gallery while tom lies on a tombstone outside playing at halfpennyunderthehat with street blackguards and is deservedly caned by the beadle frank is made overseer of the business whilst tom is sent to sea frank is taken into partnership and marries his master’s daughter sends out broken victuals to the poor and listens in his nightcap and gown with the lovely mrs goodchild by his side to the nuptial music of the city bands and the marrowbones and cleavers whilst idle tom returned from sea shudders in a garret lest the officers are coming to take him for picking pockets the worshipful francis goodchild esq becomes sheriff of london and partakes of the most splendid dinners which money can purchase or alderman devour whilst poor tom is taken up in a nightcellar with that oneeyed and disreputable accomplice who first taught him to play chuckfarthing on a sunday what happens next tom is brought up before the justice of his country in the person of mr alderman goodchild who weeps as he recognizes his old brother ’prentice as tom’s oneeyed friend peaches on him and the clerk makes out the poor rogue’s ticket for newgate then the end comes tom goes to tyburn in a cart with a coffin in it whilst the right honourable francis goodchild lord mayor of london proceeds to his mansion house in his gilt coach with four footmen and a swordbearer whilst the companies of london march in the august procession whilst the trainbands of the city fire their pieces and get drunk in his honour and o crowning delight and glory of all whilst his majesty the king looks out from his royal balcony with his ribbon on his breast and his queen and his star by his side at the corner house of st paul’s churchyard where the toyshop is now  how the times have changed the new post office now not disadvantageously occupies that spot where the scaffolding is in the picture where the tipsy trainbandman is lurching against the post with his wig over one eye and the ’prenticeboy is trying to kiss the pretty girl in the gallery passed away ’prenticeboy and pretty girl passed away tipsy trainbandman with wig and bandolier on the spot where tom idle for whom i have an unaffected pity made his exit from this wicked world and where you see the hangman smoking his pipe as he reclines on the gibbet and views the hills of harrow or hampstead beyond—a splendid marble arch a vast and modern city—clean airy painted drab populous with nurserymaids and children the abodes of wealth and comfort—the elegant the prosperous the polite tyburnia rises the most respectable district in the habitable globe  in that last plate of the london apprentices in which the apotheosis of the right honourable francis goodchild is drawn a ragged fellow is represented in the corner of the simple kindly piece offering for sale a broadside purporting to contain an account of the appearance of the ghost of tom idle executed at tyburn could tom’s ghost have made its appearance in 1847 and not in 1747 what changes would have been remarked by that astonished escaped criminal over that road which the hangman used to travel constantly and the oxford stage twice a week go ten thousand carriages every day over yonder road by which dick turpin fled to windsor and squire western journeyed into town when he came to take up his quarters at the hercules pillars on the outskirts of london what a rush of civilization and order flows now what armies of gentlemen with umbrellas march to banks and chambers and countinghouses what regiments of nurserymaids and pretty infantry what peaceful processions of policemen what light broughams and what gay carriages what swarms of busy apprentices and artificers riding on omnibusroofs pass daily and hourly tom idle’s times are quite changed many of the institutions gone into disuse which were admired in his day there’s more pity and kindness and a better chance for poor tom’s successors now than at that simpler period when fielding hanged him and hogarth drew him  to the student of history these admirable works must be invaluable as they give us the most complete and truthful picture of the manners and even the thoughts of the past century we look and see pass before us the england of a hundred years ago—the peer in his drawingroom the lady of fashion in her apartment foreign singers surrounding her and the chamber filled with gewgaws in the mode of that day the church with its quaint florid architecture and singing congregation the parson with his great wig and the beadle with his cane all these are represented before us and we are sure of the truth of the portrait we see how the lord mayor dines in state how the prodigal drinks and sports at the bagnio how the poor girl beats hemp in bridewell how the thief divides his booty and drinks his punch at the nightcellar and how he finishes his career at the gibbet we may depend upon the perfect accuracy of these strange and varied portraits of the bygone generation we see one of walpole’s members of parliament chaired after his election and the lieges celebrating the event and drinking confusion to the pretender we see the grenadiers and trainbands of the city marching out to meet the enemy and have before us with sword and firelock and white hanoverian horse embroidered on the cap the very figures of the men who ran away with johnny cope and who conquered at culloden  posterity has not quite confirmed honest hogarth’s opinion about his talents for the sublime although swift could not see the difference between tweedledee and tweedledum posterity has not shared the dean’s contempt for handel the world has discovered a difference between tweedledee and tweedledum and given a hearty applause and admiration to hogarth too but not exactly as a painter of scriptural subjects or as a rival of correggio it does not take away from one’s liking for the man or from the moral of his story or the humour of it—from one’s admiration for the prodigious merit of his performances to remember that he persisted to the last in believing that the world was in a conspiracy against him with respect to his talents as an historical painter and that a set of miscreants as he called them were employed to run his genius down they say it was liston’s firm belief that he was a great and neglected tragic actor they say that every one of us believes in his heart or would like to have others believe that he is something which he is not one of the most notorious of the “miscreants” hogarth says was wilkes who assailed him in the north briton the other was churchill who put the north briton attack into heroic verse and published his epistle to hogarth hogarth replied by that caricature of wilkes in which the patriot still figures before us with his satanic grin and squint and by a caricature of churchill in which he is represented as a bear with a staff on which “lie the first” “lie the second” “lie the tenth” are engraved in unmistakable letters there is very little mistake about honest hogarth’s satire if he has to paint a man with his throat cut he draws him with his head almost off and he tried to do the same for his enemies in this little controversy “having an old plate by me” says he “with some parts ready such as the background and a dog i began to consider how i could turn so much work laid aside to some account and so patched up a print of master churchill in the character of a bear the pleasure and pecuniary advantage which i derived from these two engravings together with occasionally riding on horseback restored me to as much health as i can expect at my time of life”  and so he concludes his queer little book of anecdotes “i have gone through the circumstances of a life which till lately passed pretty much to my own satisfaction and i hope in no respect injurious to any other man this i may safely assert that i have done my best to make those about me tolerably happy and my greatest enemy cannot say i ever did an intentional injury what may follow god knows”  a queer account still exists of a holiday jaunt taken by hogarth and four friends of his who set out like the redoubted mr pickwick and his companions but just a hundred years before those heroes and made an excursion to gravesend rochester sheerness and adjacent places145 one of the gentlemen noted down the proceedings of the journey for which hogarth and a brother artist made drawings the book is chiefly curious at this moment from showing the citizen life of those days and the rough jolly style of merriment not of the five companions merely but of thousands of jolly fellows of their time hogarth and his friends quitting the “bedford arms” covent garden with a song took water to billingsgate exchanging compliments with the bargemen as they went down the river at billingsgate hogarth made a “caracatura” of a facetious porter called the duke of puddledock who agreeably entertained the party with the humours of the place hence they took a gravesend boat for themselves had straw to lie upon and a tilt over their heads they say and went down the river at night sleeping and singing jolly choruses  they arrived at gravesend at six when they washed their faces and hands and had their wigs powdered then they sallied forth for rochester on foot and drank by the way three pots of ale at one o’clock they went to dinner with excellent port and a quantity more beer and afterwards hogarth and scott played at hopscotch in the town hall it would appear that they slept most of them in one room and the chronicler of the party describes them all as waking at seven o’clock and telling each other their dreams you have rough sketches by hogarth of the incidents of this holiday excursion the sturdy little painter is seen sprawling over a plank to a boat at gravesend the whole company are represented in one design in a fisherman’s room where they had all passed the night one gentleman in a nightcap is shaving himself another is being shaved by the fisherman a third with a handkerchief over his bald pate is taking his breakfast and hogarth is sketching the whole scene  they describe at night how they returned to their quarters drank to their friends as usual emptied several cans of good flip all singing merrily  it is a jolly party of tradesmen engaged at highjinks these were the manners and pleasures of hogarth of his time very likely of men not very refined but honest and merry it is a brave london citizen with john bull habits prejudices and pleasures146  of smollett’s associates and manner of life the author of the admirable humphry clinker has given us an interesting account in that most amusing of novels147  i have no doubt that the above picture is as faithful a one as any from the pencil of his kindred humourist hogarth  we have before us and painted by his own hand tobias smollett the manly kindly honest and irascible worn and battered but still brave and full of heart after a long struggle against a hard fortune his brain had been busied with a hundred different schemes he had been reviewer and historian critic medical writer poet pamphleteer he had fought endless literary battles and braved and wielded for years the cudgels of controversy it was a hard and savage fight in those days and a niggard pay he was oppressed by illness age narrow fortune but his spirit was still resolute and his courage steady the battle over he could do justice to the enemy with whom he had been so fiercely engaged and give a not unfriendly grasp to the hand that had mauled him he is like one of those scotch cadets of whom history gives us so many examples and whom with a national fidelity the great scotch novelist has painted so charmingly of gentle birth148 and narrow means going out from his northern home to win his fortune in the world and to fight his way armed with courage hunger and keen wits his crest is a shattered oaktree with green leaves yet springing from it on his ancient coatofarms there is a lion and a horn this shield of his was battered and dinted in a hundred fights and brawls149 through which the stout scotchman bore it courageously you see somehow that he is a gentleman through all his battling and struggling his poverty his hardfought successes and his defeats his novels are recollections of his own adventures his characters drawn as i should think from personages with whom he became acquainted in his own career of life strange companions he must have had queer acquaintances he made in the glasgow college—in the country apothecary’s shop in the gunroom of the manofwar where he served as surgeon and in the hard life on shore where the sturdy adventurer struggled for fortune he did not invent much as i fancy but had the keenest perceptive faculty and described what he saw with wonderful relish and delightful broad humour i think uncle bowling in roderick random is as good a character as squire western himself and mr morgan the welsh apothecary is as pleasant as dr caius what man who has made his inestimable acquaintance—what novelreader who loves don quixote and major dalgetty—will refuse his most cordial acknowledgements to the admirable lieutenant lismahago the novel of humphry clinker is i do think the most laughable story that has ever been written since the goodly art of novelwriting began winifred jenkins and tabitha bramble must keep englishmen on the grin for ages yet to come and in their letters and the story of their loves there is a perpetual fount of sparkling laughter as inexhaustible as bladud’s well                      fielding too has described though with a greater hand the characters and scenes which he knew and saw he had more than ordinary opportunities for becoming acquainted with life his family and education first—his fortunes and misfortunes afterwards brought him into the society of every rank and condition of man he is himself the hero of his books he is wild tom jones he is wild captain booth less wild i am glad to think than his predecessor at least heartily conscious of demerit and anxious to amend  when fielding first came upon the town in 1727 the recollection of the great wits was still fresh in the coffeehouses and assemblies and the judges there declared that young harry fielding had more spirits and wit than congreve or any of his brilliant successors his figure was tall and stalwart his face handsome manly and noblelooking to the very last days of his life he retained a grandeur of air and although worn down by disease his aspect and presence imposed respect upon the people round about him  a dispute took place between mr fielding and the captain150 of the ship in which he was making his last voyage and fielding relates how the man finally went down on his knees and begged his passenger’s pardon he was living up to the last days of his life and his spirit never gave in his vital power must have been immensely strong lady mary wortley montagu151 prettily characterizes fielding and this capacity for happiness which he possessed in a little notice of his death when she compares him to steele who was as improvident and as happy as he was and says that both should have gone on living for ever one can fancy the eagerness and gusto with which a man of fielding’s frame with his vast health and robust appetite his ardent spirits his joyful humour and his keen and hearty relish for life must have seized and drunk that cup of pleasure which the town offered to him can any of my hearers remember the youthful feats of a college breakfast—the meats devoured and the cups quaffed in that homeric feast i can call to mind some of the heroes of those youthful banquets and fancy young fielding from leyden rushing upon the feast with his great laugh and immense healthy young appetite eager and vigorous to enjoy the young man’s wit and manners made him friends everywhere he lived with the grand man’s society of those days he was courted by peers and men of wealth and fashion as he had a paternal allowance from his father general fielding which to use henry’s own phrase any man might pay who would as he liked good wine good clothes and good company which are all expensive articles to purchase harry fielding began to run into debt and borrow money in that easy manner in which captain booth borrows money in the novel was in nowise particular in accepting a few pieces from the purses of his rich friends and bore down upon more than one of them as walpole tells us only too truly for a dinner or a guinea to supply himself with the latter he began to write theatrical pieces having already no doubt a considerable acquaintance amongst the oldfields and bracegirdles behind the scenes he laughed at these pieces and scorned them when the audience upon one occasion began to hiss a scene which he was too lazy to correct and regarding which when garrick remonstrated with him he said that the public was too stupid to find out the badness of his work—when the audience began to hiss fielding said with characteristic coolness—“they have found it out have they” he did not prepare his novels in this way and with a very different care and interest laid the foundations and built up the edifices of his future fame  time and shower have very little damaged those the fashion and ornaments are perhaps of the architecture of that age but the buildings remain strong and lofty and of admirable proportions—masterpieces of genius and monuments of workmanlike skill  i cannot offer or hope to make a hero of harry fielding why hide his faults why conceal his weaknesses in a cloud of periphrases why not show him like him as he is not robed in a marble toga and draped and polished in a heroic attitude but with inked ruffles and claret stains on his tarnished laced coat and on his manly face the marks of good fellowship of illness of kindness of care and wine stained as you see him and worn by care and dissipation that man retains some of the most precious and splendid human qualities and endowments he has an admirable natural love of truth the keenest instinctive antipathy to hypocrisy the happiest satirical gift of laughing it to scorn his wit is wonderfully wise and detective it flashes upon a rogue and lightens up a rascal like a policeman’s lantern he is one of the manliest and kindliest of human beings in the midst of all his imperfections he respects female innocence and infantine tenderness as you would suppose such a greathearted courageous soul would respect and care for them he could not be so brave generous truthtelling as he is were he not infinitely merciful pitiful and tender he will give any man his purse—he can’t help kindness and profusion he may have low tastes but not a mean mind he admires with all his heart good and virtuous men stoops to no flattery bears no rancour disdains all disloyal arts does his public duty uprightly is fondly loved by his family and dies at his work152  if that theory be—and i have no doubt it is—the right and safe one that human nature is always pleased with the spectacle of innocence rescued by fidelity purity and courage i suppose that of the heroes of fielding’s three novels we should like honest joseph andrews the best and captain booth the second and tom jones the third153  joseph andrews though he wears lady booby’s castoff livery is i think to the full as polite as tom jones in his fustian suit or captain booth in regimentals he has like those heroes large calves broad shoulders a high courage and a handsome face the accounts of joseph’s bravery and good qualities his voice too musical to halloo to the dogs his bravery in riding races for the gentlemen of the county and his constancy in refusing bribes and temptation have something affecting in their naiveté and freshness and prepossess one in favour of that handsome young hero the rustic bloom of fanny and the delightful simplicity of parson adams are described with a friendliness which wins the reader of their story we part with them with more regret than from booth and jones  fielding no doubt began to write this novel in ridicule of pamela for which work one can understand the hearty contempt and antipathy which such an athletic and boisterous genius as fielding’s must have entertained he couldn’t do otherwise than laugh at the puny cockney bookseller pouring out endless volumes of sentimental twaddle and hold him up to scorn as a mollcoddle and a milksop his genius had been nursed on sackposset and not on dishes of tea his muse had sung the loudest in tavern choruses had seen the daylight streaming in over thousands of emptied bowls and reeled home to chambers on the shoulders of the watchman richardson’s goddess was attended by old maids and dowagers and fed on muffins and bohea “milksop” roars harry fielding clattering at the timid shopshutters “wretch monster mohock” shrieks the sentimental author of pamela154 and all the ladies of his court cackle out an affrighted chorus fielding proposes to write a book in ridicule of the author whom he disliked and utterly scorned and laughed at but he is himself of so generous jovial and kindly a turn that he begins to like the characters which he invents can’t help making them manly and pleasant as well as ridiculous and before he has done with them all loves them heartily every one  richardson’s sickening antipathy for harry fielding is quite as natural as the other’s laughter and contempt at the sentimentalist i have not learned that these likings and dislikings have ceased in the present day and every author must lay his account not only to misrepresentation but to honest enmity among critics and to being hated and abused for good as well as for bad reasons richardson disliked fielding’s works quite honestly walpole quite honestly spoke of them as vulgar and stupid their squeamish stomachs sickened at the rough fare and the rough guests assembled at fielding’s jolly revel indeed the cloth might have been cleaner and the dinner and the company were scarce such as suited a dandy the kind and wise old johnson would not sit down with him155 but a greater scholar than johnson could afford to admire that astonishing genius of harry fielding and we all know the lofty panegyric which gibbon wrote of him and which remains a towering monument to the great novelist’s memory “our immortal fielding” gibbon writes “was of the younger branch of the earls of denbigh who drew their origin from the counts of hapsburgh the successors of charles v may disdain their brethren of england but the romance of tom jones that exquisite picture of human manners will outlive the palace of the escurial and the imperial eagle of austria”  there can be no gainsaying the sentence of this great judge to have your name mentioned by gibbon is like having it written on the dome of st peter’s pilgrims from all the world admire and behold it  as a picture of manners the novel of tom jones is indeed exquisite as a work of construction quite a wonder the byplay of wisdom the power of observation the multiplied felicitous turns and thoughts the varied character of the great comic epic keep the reader in a perpetual admiration and curiosity156 but against mr thomas jones himself we have a right to put in a protest and quarrel with the esteem the author evidently has for that character charles lamb says finely of jones that a single hearty laugh from him “clears the air”—but then it is in a certain state of the atmosphere it might clear the air when such personages as blifil or lady bellaston poison it but i fear very much that except until the very last scene of the story when mr jones enters sophia’s drawingroom the pure air there is rather tainted with the young gentleman’s tobaccopipe and punch i can’t say that i think mr jones a virtuous character i can’t say but that i think fielding’s evident liking and admiration for mr jones shows that the great humourist’s moral sense was blunted by his life and that here in art and ethics there is a great error if it is right to have a hero whom we may admire let us at least take care that he is admirable if as is the plan of some authors a plan decidedly against their interests be it said it is propounded that there exists in life no such being and therefore that in novels the picture of life there should appear no such character then mr thomas jones becomes an admissible person and we examine his defects and good qualities as we do those of parson thwackum or miss seagrim but a hero with a flawed reputation a hero spunging for a guinea a hero who can’t pay his landlady and is obliged to let his honour out to hire is absurd and his claim to heroic rank untenable i protest against mr thomas jones holding such rank at all i protest even against his being considered a more than ordinary young fellow ruddycheeked broadshouldered and fond of wine and pleasure he would not rob a church but that is all and a pretty long argument may be debated as to which of these old types the spendthrift the hypocrite jones and blifil charles and joseph surface—is the worst member of society and the most deserving of censure the prodigal captain booth is a better man than his predecessor mr jones in so far as he thinks much more humbly of himself than jones did goes down on his knees and owns his weaknesses and cries out “not for my sake but for the sake of my pure and sweet and beautiful wife amelia i pray you o critical reader to forgive me” that stern moralist regards him from the bench the judge’s practice out of court is not here the question and says “captain booth it is perfectly true that your life has been disreputable and that on many occasions you have shown yourself to be no better than a scamp—you have been tippling at the tavern when the kindest and sweetest lady in the world has cooked your little supper of boiled mutton and awaited you all the night you have spoilt the little dish of boiled mutton thereby and caused pangs and pains to amelia’s tender heart157 you have got into debt without the means of paying it you have gambled the money with which you ought to have paid your rent you have spent in drink or in worse amusements the sums which your poor wife has raised upon her little home treasures her own ornaments and the toys of her children but you rascal you own humbly that you are no better than you should be you never for one moment pretend that you are anything but a miserable weakminded rogue you do in your heart adore that angelic woman your wife and for her sake sirrah you shall have your discharge lucky for you and for others like you that in spite of your failings and imperfections pure hearts pity and love you for your wife’s sake you are permitted to go hence without a remand and i beg you by the way to carry to that angelical lady the expression of the cordial respect and admiration of this court” amelia pleads for her husband will booth amelia pleads for her reckless kindly old father harry fielding to have invented that character is not only a triumph of art but it is a good action they say it was in his own home that fielding knew her and loved her and from his own wife that he drew the most charming character in english fiction—fiction why fiction why not history i know amelia just as well as lady mary wortley montagu i believe in colonel bath almost as much as in colonel gardiner or the duke of cumberland i admire the author of amelia and thank the kind master who introduced me to that sweet and delightful companion and friend amelia perhaps is not a better story than tom jones but it has the better ethics the prodigal repents at least before forgiveness—whereas that odious broadbacked mr jones carries off his beauty with scarce an interval of remorse for his manifold errors and shortcomings and is not half punished enough before the great prize of fortune and love falls to his share i am angry with jones too much of the plumcake and rewards of life fall to that boisterous swaggering young scapegrace sophia actually surrenders without a proper sense of decorum the fond foolish palpitating little creature—“indeed mr jones” she says—“it rests with you to appoint the day” i suppose sophia is drawn from life as well as amelia and many a young fellow no better than mr thomas jones has carried by a coup de main the heart of many a kind girl who was a great deal too good for him  what a wonderful art what an admirable gift of nature was it by which the author of these tales was endowed and which enabled him to fix our interest to waken our sympathy to seize upon our credulity so that we believe in his people—speculate gravely upon their faults or their excellences prefer this one or that deplore jones’s fondness for drink and play booth’s fondness for play and drink and the unfortunate position of the wives of both gentlemen—love and admire those ladies with all our hearts and talk about them as faithfully as if we had breakfasted with them this morning in their actual drawingrooms or should meet them this afternoon in the park what a genius what a vigour what a brighteyed intelligence and observation what a wholesome hatred for meanness and knavery what a vast sympathy what a cheerfulness what a manly relish of life what a love of human kind what a poet is here—watching meditating brooding creating what multitudes of truths has that man left behind him what generations he has taught to laugh wisely and fairly what scholars he has formed and accustomed to the exercise of thoughtful humour and the manly play of wit what a courage he had158 what a dauntless and constant cheerfulness of intellect that burned bright and steady through all the storms of his life and never deserted its last wreck it is wonderful to think of the pains and misery which the man suffered the pressure of want illness remorse which he endured and that the writer was neither malignant nor melancholy his view of truth never warped and his generous human kindness never surrendered159  in the quarrel mentioned before which happened on fielding’s last voyage to lisbon and when the stout captain of the ship fell down on his knees and asked the sick man’s pardon—“i did not suffer” fielding says in his hearty manly way his eyes lighting up as it were with their old fire—“i did not suffer a brave man and an old man to remain a moment in that posture but immediately forgave him” indeed i think with his noble spirit and unconquerable generosity fielding reminds one of those brave men of whom one reads in stories of english shipwrecks and disasters—of the officer on the african shore when disease has destroyed the crew and he himself is seized by fever who throws the lead with a deathstricken hand takes the soundings carries the ship out of the river or off the dangerous coast and dies in the manly endeavour—of the wounded captain when the vessel founders who never loses his heart who eyes the danger steadily and has a cheery word for all until the inevitable fate overwhelms him and the gallant ship goes down such a brave and gentle heart such an intrepid and courageous spirit i love to recognize in the manly the english harry fielding     lecture the sixth sterne and goldsmith   roger sterne sterne’s father was the second son of a numerous race descendants of richard sterne archbishop of york in the reign of james ii and children of simon sterne and mary jaques his wife heiress of elvington near york160 roger was a lieutenant in handyside’s regiment and engaged in flanders in queen anne’s wars he married the daughter of a noted sutler—“nb he was in debt to him” his son writes pursuing the paternal biography—and marched through the world with this companion following the regiment and bringing many children to poor roger sterne the captain was an irascible but kind and simple little man sterne says and informs us that his sire was run through the body at gibraltar by a brother officer in a duel which arose out of a dispute about a goose roger never entirely recovered from the effects of this rencontre but died presently at jamaica whither he had followed the drum  laurence his second child was born at clonmel in ireland in 1713 and travelled for the first ten years of his life on his father’s march from barrack to transport from ireland to england161  one relative of his mother’s took her and her family under shelter for ten months at mullingar another collateral descendant of the archbishop’s housed them for a year at his castle near carrickfergus larry sterne was put to school at halifax in england finally was adopted by his kinsman of elvington and parted company with his father the captain who marched on his path of life till he met the fatal goose which closed his career the most picturesque and delightful parts of laurence sterne’s writings we owe to his recollections of the military life trim’s montero cap and le fevre’s sword and dear uncle toby’s roquelaure are doubtless reminiscences of the boy who had lived with the followers of william and marlborough and had beat time with his little feet to the fifes of ramillies in dublin barrackyard or played with the torn flags and halberds of malplaquet on the paradeground at clonmel  laurence remained at halifax school till he was eighteen years old his wit and cleverness appear to have acquired the respect of his master here for when the usher whipped laurence for writing his name on the newly whitewashed schoolroom ceiling the pedagogue in chief rebuked the understrapper and said that the name should never be effaced for sterne was a boy of genius and would come to preferment  his cousin the squire of elvington sent sterne to jesus college cambridge where he remained five years and taking orders got through his uncle’s interest the living of sutton and the prebendary of york through his wife’s connexions he got the living of stillington he married her in 1741 having ardently courted the young lady for some years previously it was not until the young lady fancied herself dying that she made sterne acquainted with the extent of her liking for him one evening when he was sitting with her with an almost broken heart to see her so ill the rev mr sterne’s heart was a good deal broken in the course of his life she said—“my dear laurey i never can be yours for i verily believe i have not long to live but i have left you every shilling of my fortune” a generosity which overpowered sterne she recovered and so they were married and grew heartily tired of each other before many years were over “nescio quid est materia cum me” sterne writes to one of his friends in doglatin and very sad doglatin too “sed sum fatigatus et aegrotus de mea uxore plus quam unquam” which means i am sorry to say “i don’t know what is the matter with me but i am more tired and sick of my wife than ever”162  this to be sure was fiveandtwenty years after laurey had been overcome by her generosity and she by laurey’s love then he wrote to her of the delights of marriage saying—“we will be as merry and as innocent as our first parents in paradise before the archfiend entered that indescribable scene the kindest affections will have room to expand in our retirement—let the human tempest and hurricane rage at a distance the desolation is beyond the horizon of peace my l has seen a polyanthus blow in december—some friendly wall has sheltered it from the biting wind—no planetary influence shall reach us but that which presides and cherishes the sweetest flowers the gloomy family of care and distrust shall be banished from our dwelling guarded by thy kind and tutelar deity—we will sing our choral songs of gratitude and rejoice to the end of our pilgrimage adieu my l return to one who languishes for thy society—as i take up my pen my poor pulse quickens my pale face glows and tears are trickling down on my paper as i trace the word l”  and it is about this woman with whom he finds no fault but that she bores him that our philanthropist writes “sum fatigatus et aegrotus”—sum mortaliter in amore with somebody else that fine flower of love that polyanthus over which sterne snivelled so many tears could not last for a quarter of a century  or rather it could not be expected that a gentleman with such a fountain at command should keep it to arroser one homely old lady when a score of younger and prettier people might be refreshed from the same gushing source163  it was in december 1767 that the rev laurence sterne the famous shandean the charming yorick the delight of the fashionable world the delicious divine for whose sermons the whole polite world was subscribing164 the occupier of rabelais’s easy chair only fresh stuffed and more elegant than when in possession of the cynical old curate of meudon165—the more than rival of the dean of st patrick’s wrote the abovequoted respectable letter to his friend in london and it was in april of the same year that he was pouring out his fond heart to mrs elizabeth draper wife of “daniel draper esq counsellor of bombay and in 1775 chief of the factory of surat—a gentleman very much respected in that quarter of the globe”  “i got thy letter last night eliza” sterne writes “on my return from lord bathurst’s where i dined” the letter has this merit in it that it contains a pleasant reminiscence of better men than sterne and introduces us to a portrait of a kind old gentleman—“i got thy letter last night eliza on my return from lord bathurst’s and where i was heard—as i talked of thee an hour without intermission—with so much pleasure and attention that the good old lord toasted your health three different times and now he is in his 85th year says he hopes to live long enough to be introduced as a friend to my fair indian disciple and to see her eclipse all other nabobesses as much in wealth as she does already in exterior and what is far better” for sterne is nothing without his morality—“and what is far better in interior merit this nobleman is an old friend of mine you know he was always the protector of men of wit and genius and has had those of the last century addison steele pope swift prior c always at his table the manner in which his notice began of me was as singular as it was polite he came up to me one day as i was at the princess of wales’s court and said ‘i want to know you mr sterne but it is fit you also should know who it is that wishes this pleasure you have heard of an old lord bathurst of whom your popes and swifts have sung and spoken so much i have lived my life with geniuses of that cast but have survived them and despairing ever to find their equals it is some years since i have shut up my books and closed my accounts but you have kindled a desire in me of opening them once more before i die which i now do so go home and dine with me’ this nobleman i say is a prodigy for he has all the wit and promptness of a man of thirty a disposition to be pleased and a power to please others beyond whatever i knew added to which a man of learning courtesy and feeling”  “he heard me talk of thee eliza with uncommon satisfaction—for there was only a third person and of sensibility with us and a most sentimental afternoon till nine o’clock have we passed166 but thou eliza wert the star that conducted and enlivened the discourse and when i talked not of thee still didst thou fill my mind and warm every thought i uttered for i am not ashamed to acknowledge i greatly miss thee best of all good girls—the sufferings i have sustained all night in consequence of thine eliza are beyond the power of words and so thou hast fixed thy bramin’s portrait over thy writing desk and will consult it in all doubts and difficulties—grateful and good girl yorick smiles contentedly over all thou dost his picture does not do justice to his own complacency i am glad your shipmates are friendly beings” eliza was at deal going back to the counsellor at bombay and indeed it was high time she should be off “you could least dispense with what is contrary to your own nature which is soft and gentle eliza it would civilize savages—though pity were it thou shouldst be tainted with the office write to me my child thy delicious letters let them speak the easy carelessness of a heart that opens itself anyhow every how such eliza i write to thee” the artless rogue of course he did “and so i should ever love thee most artlessly most affectionately if providence permitted thy residence in the same section of the globe for i am all that honour and affection can make me ‘thy bramin’”  the bramin continues addressing mrs draper until the departure of the earl of chatham indiaman from deal on the 2nd of april 1767 he is amiably anxious about the fresh paint for eliza’s cabin he is uncommonly solicitous about her companions on board “i fear the best of your shipmates are only genteel by comparison with the contrasted crew with which thou beholdest them so was—you know who—from the same fallacy which was put upon your judgement when—but i will not mortify you”  “you know who” was of course daniel draper esq of bombay—a gentleman very much respected in that quarter of the globe and about whose probable health our worthy bramin writes with delightful candour  “i honour you eliza for keeping secret some things which if explained had been a panegyric on yourself there is a dignity in venerable affliction which will not allow it to appeal to the world for pity or redress well have you supported that character my amiable my philosophic friend and indeed i begin to think you have as many virtues as my uncle toby’s widow talking of widows—pray eliza if ever you are such do not think of giving yourself to some wealthy nabob because i design to marry you myself my wife cannot live long and i know not the woman i should like so well for her substitute as yourself ’tis true i am ninetyfive in constitution and you but twentyfive but what i want in youth i will make up in wit and good humour not swift so loved his stella scarron his maintenon or waller his saccharissa tell me in answer to this that you approve and honour the proposal”  approve and honour the proposal the coward was writing gay letters to his friends this while with sneering allusions to this poor foolish bramine her ship was not out of the downs and the charming sterne was at the “mount” coffeehouse with a sheet of giltedged paper before him offering that precious treasure his heart to lady p—— asking whether it gave her pleasure to see him unhappy whether it added to her triumph that her eyes and lips had turned a man into a fool—quoting the lord’s prayer with a horrible baseness of blasphemy as a proof that he had desired not to be led into temptation and swearing himself the most tender and sincere fool in the world it was from his home at coxwould that he wrote the latin letter which i suppose he was ashamed to put into english i find in my copy of the letters that there is a note of i can’t call it admiration at letter 112 which seems to announce that there was a no 3 to whom the wretched wornout old scamp was paying his addresses167 and the year after having come back to his lodgings in bond street with his sentimental journey to launch upon the town eager as ever for praise and pleasure as vain as wicked as witty as false as he had ever been death at length seized the feeble wretch and on the 18th of march 1768 that “bale of cadaverous goods” as he calls his body was consigned to pluto168 in his last letter there is one sign of grace—the real affection with which he entreats a friend to be a guardian to his daughter lydia169 all his letters to her are artless kind affectionate and not sentimental as a hundred pages in his writings are beautiful and full not of surprising humour merely but of genuine love and kindness a perilous trade indeed is that of a man who has to bring his tears and laughter his recollections his personal griefs and joys his private thoughts and feelings to market to write them on paper and sell them for money does he exaggerate his grief so as to get his reader’s pity for a false sensibility feign indignation so as to establish a character for virtue elaborate repartees so that he may pass for a wit steal from other authors and put down the theft to the credit side of his own reputation for ingenuity and learning feign originality affect benevolence or misanthropy appeal to the gallery gods with claptraps and vulgar baits to catch applause  how much of the paint and emphasis is necessary for the fair business of the stage and how much of the rant and rouge is put on for the vanity of the actor his audience trusts him can he trust himself how much was deliberate calculation and imposture—how much was false sensibility—and how much true feeling where did the lie begin and did he know where and where did the truth end in the art and scheme of this man of genius this actor this quack some time since i was in the company of a french actor who began after dinner and at his own request to sing french songs of the sort called des chansons grivoises and which he performed admirably and to the dissatisfaction of most persons present having finished these he commenced a sentimental ballad—it was so charmingly sung that it touched all persons present and especially the singer himself whose voice trembled whose eyes filled with emotion and who was snivelling and weeping quite genuine tears by the time his own ditty was over i suppose sterne had this artistical sensibility he used to blubber perpetually in his study and finding his tears infectious and that they brought him a great popularity he exercised the lucrative gift of weeping he utilized it and cried on every occasion i own that i don’t value or respect much the cheap dribble of those fountains he fatigues me with his perpetual disquiet and his uneasy appeals to my risible or sentimental faculties he is always looking in my face watching his effect uncertain whether i think him an impostor or not posturemaking coaxing and imploring me “see what sensibility i have—own now that i’m very clever—do cry now you can’t resist this” the humour of swift and rabelais whom he pretended to succeed poured from them as naturally as song does from a bird they lose no manly dignity with it but laugh their hearty great laugh out of their broad chests as nature bade them but this man—who can make you laugh who can make you cry too—never lets his reader alone or will permit his audience repose when you are quiet he fancies he must rouse you and turns over head and heels or sidles up and whispers a nasty story the man is a great jester not a great humourist he goes to work systematically and of cold blood paints his face puts on his ruff and motley clothes and lays down his carpet and tumbles on it  for instance take the sentimental journey and see in the writer the deliberate propensity to make points and seek applause he gets to dessein’s hotel he wants a carriage to travel to paris he goes to the innyard and begins what the actors call “business” at once there is that little carriage the désobligeant “four months had elapsed since it had finished its career of europe in the corner of monsieur dessein’s courtyard and having sallied out thence but a vampedup business at first though it had been twice taken to pieces on mount sennis it had not profited much by its adventures but by none so little as the standing so many months unpitied in the corner of monsieur dessein’s coachyard much indeed was not to be said for it—but something might—and when a few words will rescue misery out of her distress i hate the man who can be a churl of them”  le tour est fait paillasse has tumbled paillasse has jumped over the désobligeant cleared it hood and all and bows to the noble company does anybody believe that this is a real sentiment that this luxury of generosity this gallant rescue of misery—out of an old cab is genuine feeling it is as genuine as the virtuous oratory of joseph surface when he begins “the man who” c c and wishes to pass off for a saint with his credulous goodhumoured dupes  our friend purchases the carriage—after turning that notorious old monk to good account and effecting like a soft and goodnatured paillasse as he was and very free with his money when he had it an exchange of snuffboxes with the old franciscan jogs out of calais sets down in immense figures on the credit side of his account the sous he gives away to the montreuil beggars and at nampont gets out of the chaise and whimpers over that famous dead donkey for which any sentimentalist may cry who will it is agreeably and skilfully done—that dead jackass like m de soubise’s cook on the campaign sterne dresses it and serves it up quite tender and with a very piquante sauce but tears and fine feelings and a white pockethandkerchief and a funeral sermon and horses and feathers and a procession of mutes and a hearse with a dead donkey inside psha mountebank i’ll not give thee one penny more for that trick donkey and all  this donkey had appeared once before with signal effect in 1765 three years before the publication of the sentimental journey the seventh and eighth volumes of tristram shandy were given to the world and the famous lyons donkey makes his entry in those volumes pp 315 316—  “’twas by a poor ass with a couple of large panniers at his back who had just turned in to collect eleemosynary turniptops and cabbageleaves and stood dubious with his two forefeet at the inside of the threshold and with his two hinder feet towards the street as not

carriage which pleads so mightily for him that it always disarms me and to that degree that i do not like to speak unkindly to him on the contrary meet him where i will whether in town or country in cart or under panniers whether in liberty or bondage i have ever something civil to say to him on my part and as one word begets another if he has as little to do as i i generally fall into

‘well’ replied i ‘we’ll wait a minute for thy driver’  “he turned his head thoughtful about and looked wistfully the opposite way  “ ‘i understand thee perfectly’ answered i ‘if thou takest a wrong step in this affair he will cudgel thee to death well a minute is but a minute and if it saves a fellow creature a drubbing it shall not be set down as ill spent’  “he was eating the stem of an artichoke as this discourse went on and in the little peevish contentions between hunger and unsavouriness had dropped it out of his mouth half a dozen times and had picked it up again ‘god help thee

if one knew the truth of it is as bitter i dare say as soot’ for he had cast aside the stem ‘and thou hast not a friend perhaps in all this world that will give thee a macaroon’ in saying this i pulled out a paper of ’em which i had just bought and gave him one—and at this moment that i am telling it my heart smites me that there was more of pleasantry in the conceit of seeing how an ass would eat a macaroon than of benevolence in giving him one which presided in the act  “when the ass had eaten his macaroon i pressed him to come in the poor beast was heavy loaded—his legs seemed to tremble under him—he hung rather backward and as i pulled at his halter it broke in my hand he looked up pensive in my face ‘don’t thrash me with it but if you will you may’ ‘if i do’ said i ‘i’ll be

to a description not less beautiful—a landscape and figures deliciously painted by one who had the keenest enjoyment and the most tremulous sensibility—  “’twas in the road between nismes and lunel where is the best muscatto wine in all france the sun was set they had done their work the nymphs had tied up their hair afresh and the swains were preparing for a carousal my mule made a dead point ‘’tis the pipe and tambourine’ said i—‘i never will argue a point with one of your family as long as i live’ so leaping off his back and kicking off one boot into this ditch and t’other into that ‘i’ll take a dance’ said i ‘so stay you here’  “a sunburnt daughter of labour rose up from the group to meet me as i advanced towards them her hair which was of a dark chestnut approaching to a black

could not have done without you’ said she letting go one hand with selftaught politeness and leading me up with the other  “a lame youth whom apollo had recompensed with a pipe and to which he had added a tambourine of his own accord ran sweetly over the prelude as he sat upon the bank ‘tie me up this tress instantly’ said nannette putting a piece of string into my hand it taught me to forget i

her voice from heaven—sang alternately with her brother ’twas a gascoigne roundelay ‘viva la joia fidon la tristessa’—the nymphs joined in unison and their swains an octave below them  “viva la joia

sorrows’ cried i ‘why could not a man sit down in the lap of content here and dance and sing and say his prayers and go to heaven with this nutbrown maid’ capriciously did she bend her head on one side and dance up insidious ‘then ’tis time to dance off’ quoth i”  and with this pretty dance and chorus the volume artfully concludes even here one can’t give the whole description there is not a page in sterne’s writing but has something that were better away a latent corruption—a hint as of an impure presence170  some of that dreary double entendre may be attributed to freer times and manners than ours but not all the foul satyr’s eyes leer out of the leaves constantly the last words the famous author wrote were bad and wicked—the last lines the poor stricken wretch penned were for pity and pardon i think of these past writers and of one who lives amongst us now and am grateful for the innocent laughter and the sweet and unsullied page which the author of david copperfield gives

may fancy described the career the sufferings the genius the gentle nature of goldsmith and the esteem in which we hold him who of the millions whom he has amused doesn’t love him to be the most beloved of english writers what a title that is for a man171 a wild youth wayward but full of tenderness and affection quits the country village where his boyhood has been passed in happy musing in idle shelter in fond longing to see the great world out of doors and achieve name and fortune—and after years of dire struggle and neglect and poverty his heart turning back as fondly to his native place as it had longed eagerly for change when sheltered there he writes a book and a poem full of the recollections and feelings of home—he paints the friends and scenes of his youth and peoples auburn and wakefield with remembrances of lissoy wander he must but he carries away a homerelic with him and dies with it on his breast his nature is truant in repose it longs for change as on the journey it looks back for friends and quiet he passes today in building an aircastle for tomorrow or in writing yesterday’s elegy and he would fly away this hour but that a cage and necessity keep him what is the charm of his verse of his style and humour his sweet regrets his delicate compassion his soft smile his tremulous sympathy the weakness which he owns your love for him is half pity you come hot and tired from the day’s battle and this sweet minstrel sings to you who could harm the kind vagrant harper whom did he ever hurt he carries no weapon—save the harp on which he plays to you and with which he delights great and humble young and old the captains in the tents or the soldiers round the fire or the women and children in the villages at whose porches he stops and sings his simple songs of love and beauty with that sweet story of the vicar of wakefield172 he has found entry into every castle and every hamlet in europe not one of us however busy or hard but once or twice in our lives has passed an evening with him and undergone the charm of his delightful music  goldsmith’s father was no doubt the good doctor primrose whom we all of us know173 swift was yet alive when the little oliver was born at pallas or pallasmore in the county of longford in ireland in 1730 two years after the child’s birth charles goldsmith removed his family to lissoy in the county westmeath that sweet “auburn” which every person who hears me has seen in fancy here the kind parson174 brought up his eight children and loving all the world as his son says fancied all the world loved him he had a crowd of poor dependants besides those hungry children he kept an open table round which sat flatterers and poor friends who laughed at the honest rector’s many jokes and ate the produce of his seventy acres of farm those who have seen an irish house in the present day can fancy that one of lissoy the old beggar still has his allotted corner by the kitchen turf the maimed old soldier still gets his potatoes and buttermilk the poor cottier still asks his honour’s charity and prays god bless his reverence for the sixpence the ragged pensioner still takes his place by right and sufferance there’s still a crowd in the kitchen and a crowd round the parlourtable profusion confusion kindness poverty if an irishman comes to london to make his fortune he has a halfdozen of irish dependants who take a percentage of his earnings the good charles goldsmith175 left but little provision for his hungry race when death summoned him and one of his daughters being engaged to a squire of rather superior dignity charles goldsmith impoverished the rest of his family to provide the girl with a dowry  the smallpox which scourged all europe at that time and ravaged the roses off the cheeks of half the world fell foul of poor little oliver’s face when the child was eight years old and left him scarred and disfigured for his life an old woman in his father’s village taught him his letters and pronounced him a dunce paddy byrne the hedgeschoolmaster took him in hand and from paddy byrne he was transmitted to a clergyman at elphin when a child was sent to school in those days the classic phrase was that he was placed under mr soandso’s ferule poor little ancestors it is hard to think how ruthlessly you were birched and how much of needless whipping and tears our small forefathers had to undergo a relative—kind uncle contarine took the main charge of little noll who went through his schooldays righteously doing as little work as he could robbing orchards playing at ball and making his pocketmoney fly about whenever fortune sent it to him everybody knows the story of that famous “mistake of a night” when the young schoolboy provided with a guinea and a nag rode up to the “best house” in ardagh called for the landlord’s company over a bottle of wine at supper and for a hot cake for breakfast in the morning and found when he asked for the bill that the best house was squire featherstone’s and not the inn for which he mistook it who does not know every story about goldsmith that is a delightful and fantastic picture of the child dancing and capering about in the kitchen at home when the old fiddler gibed at him for his ugliness—and called him aesop and little noll made his repartee of “heralds proclaim aloud this saying—see aesop dancing and his monkey playing” one can fancy a queer pitiful look of humour and appeal upon that little scarred face—the funny little dancing figure the funny little brogue in his life and his writings which are the honest expression of it he is constantly bewailing that homely face and person anon he surveys them in the glass ruefully and presently assumes the most comical dignity he likes to deck out his little person in splendour and fine colours he presented himself to be examined for ordination in a pair of scarlet breeches and said honestly that he did not like to go into the church because he was fond of coloured clothes when he tried to practise as a doctor he got by hook or by crook a black velvet suit and looked as big and grand as he could and kept his hat over a patch on the old coat in better days he bloomed out in plumcolour in blue silk and in new velvet for some of those splendours the heirs and assignees of mr filby the tailor have never been paid to this day perhaps the kind tailor and his creditor have met and settled the little account in hades176  they showed until lately a window at trinity college dublin on which the name of o goldsmith was engraved with a diamond whose diamond was it not the young sizar’s who made but a poor figure in that place of learning he was idle penniless and fond of pleasure177 he learned his way early to the pawnbroker’s shop he wrote ballads they say for the streetsingers who paid him a crown for a poem and his pleasure was to steal out at night and hear his verses sung he was chastised by his tutor for giving a dance in his rooms and took the box on the ear so much to heart that he packed up his all pawned his books and little property and disappeared from college and family he said he intended to go to america but when his money was spent the young prodigal came home ruefully and the good folks there killed their calf—it was but a lean one—and welcomed him back  after college he hung about his mother’s house and lived for some years the life of a buckeen—passed a month with this relation and that a year with one patron a great deal of time at the publichouse178 tired of this life it was resolved that he should go to london and study at the temple but he got no farther on the road to london and the woolsack than dublin where he gambled away the fifty pounds given to him for his outfit and whence he returned to the indefatigable forgiveness of home then he determined to be a doctor and uncle contarine helped him to a couple of years at edinburgh then from edinburgh he felt that he ought to hear the famous professors of leyden and paris and wrote most amusing pompous letters to his uncle about the great farheim du petit and duhamel du monceau whose lectures he proposed to follow if uncle contarine believed those letters—if oliver’s mother believed that story which the youth related of his going to cork with the purpose of embarking for america of his having paid his passagemoney and having sent his kit on board of the anonymous captain sailing away with oliver’s valuable luggage in a nameless ship never to return if uncle contarine and the mother at ballymahon believed his stories they must have been a very simple pair as it was a very simple rogue indeed who cheated them when the lad after failing in his clerical examination after failing in his plan for studying the law took leave of these projects and of his parents and set out for edinburgh he saw mother and uncle and lazy ballymahon and green native turf and sparkling river for the last time he was never to look on old ireland more and only in fancy revisit her       but me not destined such delights to share     my prime of life in wandering spent and care     impelled with step unceasing to pursue     some fleeting good that mocks me with the view      that like the circle bounding earth and skies     allures from far yet as i follow flies     my fortune leads to traverse realms unknown     and find no spot of all the world my own   i spoke in a former lecture of that high courage which enabled fielding in spite of disease remorse and poverty always to retain a cheerful spirit and to keep his manly benevolence and love of truth intact as if these treasures had been confided to him for the public benefit and he was accountable to posterity for their honourable employ and a constancy equally happy and admirable i think was shown by goldsmith whose sweet and friendly nature bloomed kindly always in the midst of a life’s storm and rain and bitter weather179 the poor fellow was never so friendless but he could befriend some one never so pinched and wretched but he could give of his crust and speak his word of compassion if he had but his flute left he could give that and make the children happy in the dreary london court he could give the coals in that queer coalscuttle we read of to his poor neighbour he could give away his blankets in college to the poor widow and warm himself as he best might in the feathers he could pawn his coat to save his landlord from gaol when he was a schoolusher he spent his earnings in treats for the boys and the goodnatured schoolmaster’s wife said justly that she ought to keep mr goldsmith’s money as well as the young gentlemen’s when he met his pupils in later life nothing would satisfy the doctor but he must treat them still “have you seen the print of me after sir joshua reynolds” he asked of one of his old pupils “not seen it not bought it sure jack if your picture had been published i’d not have been without it half an hour” his purse and his heart were everybody’s and his friends’ as much as his own when he was at the height of his reputation and the earl of northumberland going as lord lieutenant to ireland asked if he could be of any service to dr goldsmith goldsmith recommended his brother and not himself to the great man “my patrons” he gallantly said “are the booksellers and i want no others”180 hard patrons they were and hard work he did but he did not complain much if in his early writings some bitter words escaped him some allusions to neglect and poverty he withdrew these expressions when his works were republished and better days seemed to open for him and he did not care to complain that printer or publisher had overlooked his merit or left him poor the court face was turned from honest oliver the court patronized beattie the fashion did not shine on him—fashion adored sterne181  fashion pronounced kelly to be the great writer of comedy of his day a little—not ill humour but plaintiveness—a little betrayal of wounded pride which he showed render him not the less amiable the author of the vicar of wakefield had a right to protest when newbery kept back the ms for two years had a right to be a little peevish with sterne a little angry when colman’s actors declined their parts in his delightful comedy when the manager refused to have a scene painted for it and pronounced its damnation before hearing he had not the great public with him but he had the noble johnson and the admirable reynolds and the great gibbon and the great burke and the great fox—friends and admirers illustrious indeed as famous as those who fifty years before sat round pope’s table  nobody knows and i dare say goldsmith’s buoyant temper kept no account of all the pains which he endured during the early period of his literary career should any man of letters in our day have to bear up against such heaven grant he may come out of the period of misfortune with such a pure kind heart as that which goldsmith obstinately bore in his breast the insults to which he had to submit are shocking to read of—slander contumely vulgar satire brutal malignity perverting his commonest motives and actions he had his share of these and one’s anger is roused at reading of them as it is at seeing a woman insulted or a child assaulted at the notion that a creature so very gentle and weak and full of love should have had to suffer so and he had worse than insult to undergo—to own to fault and deprecate the anger of ruffians there is a letter of his extant to one griffiths a bookseller in which poor goldsmith is forced to confess that certain books sent by griffiths are in the hands of a friend from whom goldsmith had been forced to borrow money “he was wild sir” johnson said speaking of goldsmith to boswell with his great wise benevolence and noble mercifulness of heart “dr goldsmith was wild sir but he is so no more” ah if we pity the good and weak man who suffers undeservedly let us deal very gently with him from whom misery extorts not only tears but shame let us think humbly and charitably of the human nature that suffers so sadly and falls so low whose turn may it be tomorrow what weak heart confident before trial may not succumb under temptation invincible cover the good man who has been vanquished—cover his face and pass on  for the last halfdozen years of his life goldsmith was far removed from the pressure of any ignoble necessity and in the receipt indeed of a pretty large income from the booksellers his patrons had he lived but a few years more his public fame would have been as great as his private reputation and he might have enjoyed alive a part of that esteem which his country has ever since paid to the vivid and versatile genius who has touched on almost every subject of literature and touched nothing that he did not adorn except in rare instances a man is known in our profession and esteemed as a skilful workman years before the lucky hit which trebles his usual gains and stamps him a popular author in the strength of his age and the dawn of his reputation having for backers and friends the most illustrious literary men of his time182 fame and prosperity might have been in store for goldsmith had fate so willed it and at fortysix had not sudden disease carried him off i say prosperity rather than competence for it is probable that no sum could have put order into his affairs or sufficed for his irreclaimable habits of dissipation it must be remembered that he owed 2000l when he died “was ever poet” johnson asked “so trusted before” as has been the case with many another good fellow of his nation his life was tracked and his substance wasted by crowds of hungry beggars and lazy dependants if they came at a lucky time and be sure they knew his affairs better than he did himself and watched his payday he gave them of his money if they begged on emptypurse days he gave them his promissory bills or he treated them to a tavern where he had credit or he obliged them with an order upon honest mr filby for coats for which he paid as long as he could earn and until the shears of filby were to cut for him no more staggering under a load of debt and labour tracked by bailiffs and reproachful creditors running from a hundred poor dependants whose appealing looks were perhaps the hardest of all pains for him to bear devising fevered plans for the morrow new histories new comedies all sorts of new literary schemes flying from all these into seclusion and out of seclusion into pleasure—at last at fiveandforty death seized him and closed his career183 i have been many a time in the chambers in the temple which were his and passed up the staircase which johnson and burke and reynolds trod to see their friend their poet their kind goldsmith—the stair on which the poor women sat weeping bitterly when they heard that the greatest and most generous of all men was dead within the black oak door184 ah it was a different lot from that for which the poor fellow sighed when he wrote with heart yearning for home those most charming of all fond verses in which he fancies he revisits auburn—       here as i take my solitary rounds     amidst thy tangled walks and ruined grounds     and many a year elapsed return to view     where once the cottage stood the hawthorn grew     remembrance wakes with all her busy train     swells at my heart and turns the past to pain      in all my wanderings round this world of care     in all my griefs—and god has given my share     i still had hopes my latest hours to crown     amidst these humble bowers to lay me down     to husband out life’s taper at the close     and keep the flame from wasting by repose     i still had hopes—for pride attends us still—     amidst the swains to show my booklearned skill     around my fire an evening group to draw     and tell of all i felt and all i saw     and as a hare whom hounds and horns pursue     pants to the place from whence at first she flew—     i still had hopes—my long vexations past     here to return and die at home at last      o blest retirement friend to life’s decline     retreats from care that never must be mine—     how blest is he who crowns in shades like these     a youth of labour with an age of ease     who quits a world where strong temptations try     and since ’tis hard to combat learns to fly     for him no wretches born to work and weep     explore the mine or tempt the dangerous deep     no surly porter stands in guilty state     to spurn imploring famine from his gate     but on he moves to meet his latter end     angels around befriending virtue’s friend     sinks to the grave with unperceived decay     whilst resignation gently slopes the way     and all his prospects brightening at the last     his heaven commences ere the world be past   in these verses i need not say with what melody with what touching truth with what exquisite beauty of comparison—as indeed in hundreds more pages of the writings of this honest soul—the whole character of the man is told—his humble confession of faults and weakness his pleasant little vanity and desire that his village should admire him his simple scheme of good in which everybody was to be happy—no beggar was to be refused his dinner—nobody in fact was to work much and he to be the harmless chief of the utopia and the monarch of the irish yvetôt he would have told again and without fear of their failing those famous jokes185 which had hung fire in london he would have talked of his great friends of the club—of my lord clare and my lord bishop my lord nugent—sure he knew them intimately and was hand and glove with some of the best men in town—and he would have spoken of johnson and of burke from cork and of sir joshua who had painted him—and he would have told wonderful sly stories of ranelagh and the pantheon and the masquerades at madame cornelys’ and he would have toasted with a sigh the jessamy bride—the lovely mary horneck  the figure of that charming young lady forms one of the prettiest recollections of goldsmith’s life she and her beautiful sister who married bunbury the graceful and humorous amateur artist of those days when gilray had but just begun to try his powers were among the kindest and dearest of goldsmith’s many friends cheered and pitied him travelled abroad with him made him welcome at their home and gave him many a pleasant holiday he bought his finest clothes to figure at their country house at barton—he wrote them droll verses they loved him laughed at him played him tricks and made him happy he asked for a loan from garrick and garrick kindly supplied him to enable him to go to barton—but there were to be no more holidays and only one brief struggle more for poor goldsmith—a lock of his hair was taken from the coffin and given to the jessamy bride she lived quite into our time hazlitt saw her an old lady but beautiful still in northcote’s paintingroom who told the eager critic how proud she always was that goldsmith had admired her the younger colman has left a touching reminiscence of him vol i 63 64  “i was only five years old” he says “when goldsmith took me on his knee one evening whilst he was drinking coffee with my father and began to play with me which amiable act i returned with the ingratitude of a peevish brat by giving him a very smart slap on the face it must have been a tingler for it left the marks of my spiteful paw on his cheek this infantile outrage was followed by summary justice and i was locked up by my indignant father in an adjoining room to undergo solitary imprisonment in the dark here i began to howl and scream most abominably which was no bad step towards my liberation since those who were not inclined to pity me might be likely to set me free for the purpose of abating a nuisance  “at length a generous friend appeared to extricate me from jeopardy and that generous friend was no other than the man i had so wantonly molested by assault and battery—it was the tenderhearted doctor himself with a lighted candle in his hand and a smile upon his countenance which was still partially red from the effects of my petulance i sulked and sobbed as he fondled and soothed till i began to brighten goldsmith seized the propitious moment of returning good humour when he put down the candle and began to conjure he placed three hats which happened to be in the room and a shilling under each the shillings he told me were england france and spain ‘hey presto cockalorum’ cried the doctor and lo on uncovering the shillings which had been dispersed each beneath a separate hat they were all found congregated under one i was no politician at five years old and therefore might not have wondered at the sudden revolution which brought england france and spain all under one crown but as also i was no conjurer it amazed me beyond measure from that time whenever the doctor came to visit my father ‘i plucked his gown to share the good man’s smile’ a game at romps constantly ensued and we were always cordial friends and merry playfellows our unequal companionship varied somewhat as to sports as i grew older but it did not last long my senior playmate died in his fortyfifth year when i had attained my eleventh in all the numerous accounts of his virtues and foibles his genius and absurdities his knowledge of nature and ignorance of the world his ‘compassion for another’s woe’ was always predominant and my trivial story of his humouring a froward child weighs but as a feather in the recorded scale of his benevolence”  think of him reckless thriftless vain if you like—but merciful gentle generous full of love and pity he passes out of our life and goes to render his account beyond it think of the poor pensioners weeping at his grave think of the noble spirits that admired and deplored him think of the righteous pen that wrote his epitaph—and of the wonderful and unanimous response of affection with which the world has paid back the love he gave it his humour delighting us still his song fresh and beautiful as when first he charmed with it his words in all our mouths his very weaknesses beloved and familiar—his benevolent spirit seems still to smile upon us to do gentle kindnesses to succour with sweet charity to soothe caress and forgive to plead with the fortunate for the unhappy and the poor  his name is the last in the list of those men of humour who have formed the themes of the discourses which you have heard so kindly                      long before i had ever hoped for such an audience or dreamed of the possibility of the good fortune which has brought me so many friends i was at issue with some of my literary brethren upon a point—which they held from tradition i think rather than experience—that our profession was neglected in this country and that men of letters were illreceived and held in slight esteem it would hardly be grateful of me now to alter my old opinion that we do meet with goodwill and kindness with generous helping hands in the time of our necessity with cordial and friendly recognition what claim had any one of these of whom i have been speaking but genius what return of gratitude fame affection did it not bring to all  what punishment befell those who were unfortunate among them but that which follows reckless habits and careless lives for these faults a wit must suffer like the dullest prodigal that ever ran in debt he must pay the tailor if he wears the coat his children must go in rags if he spends his money at the tavern he can’t come to london and be made lord chancellor if he stops on the road and gambles away his last shilling at dublin and he must pay the social penalty of these follies too and expect that the world will shun the man of bad habits that women will avoid the man of loose life that prudent folks will close their doors as a precaution and before a demand should be made on their pockets by the needy prodigal with what difficulty had any one of these men to contend save that eternal and mechanical one of want of means and lack of capital and of which thousands of young lawyers young doctors young soldiers and sailors of inventors manufacturers shopkeepers have to complain hearts as brave and resolute as ever beat in the breast of any wit or poet sicken and break daily in the vain endeavour and unavailing struggle against life’s difficulty don’t we see daily ruined inventors greyhaired midshipmen balked heroes blighted curates barristers pining a hungry life out in chambers the attorneys never mounting to their garrets whilst scores of them are rapping at the door of the successful quack below if these suffer who is the author that he should be exempt let us bear our ills with the same constancy with which others endure them accept our manly part in life hold our own and ask no more i can conceive of no kings or laws causing or curing goldsmith’s improvidence or fielding’s fatal love of pleasure or dick steele’s mania for running races with the constable you never can outrun that surefooted officer—not by any swiftness or by dodges devised by any genius however great and he carries off the tatler to the spunginghouse or taps the citizen of the world on the shoulder as he would any other mortal  does society look down on a man because he is an author i suppose if people want a buffoon they tolerate him only in so far as he is amusing it can hardly be expected that they should respect him as an equal is there to be a guard of honour provided for the author of the last new novel or poem how long is he to reign and keep other potentates out of possession he retires grumbles and prints a lamentation that literature is despised if captain a is left out of lady b’s parties he does not state that the army is despised if lord c no longer asks counsellor d to dinner counsellor d does not announce that the bar is insulted he is not fair to society if he enters it with this suspicion hankering about him if he is doubtful about his reception how hold up his head honestly and look frankly in the face that world about which he is full of suspicion is he placehunting and thinking in his mind that he ought to be made an ambassador like prior or a secretary of state like addison his pretence of equality falls to the ground at once he is scheming for a patron not shaking the hand of a friend when he meets the world treat such a man as he deserves laugh at his buffoonery and give him a dinner and a bon jour laugh at his selfsufficiency and absurd assumptions of superiority and his equally ludicrous airs of martyrdom laugh at his flattery and his scheming and buy it if it’s worth the having let the wag have his dinner and the hireling his pay if you want him and make a profound bow to the grand homme incompris and the boisterous martyr and show him the door the great world the great aggregate experience has its good sense as it has its good humour it detects a pretender as it trusts a loyal heart it is kind in the main how should it be otherwise than kind when it is so wise and clearheaded to any literary man who says “it despises my profession” i say with all my might—no no no it may pass over your individual case—how many a brave fellow has failed in the race and perished unknown in the struggle—but it treats you as you merit in the main if you serve it it is not unthankful if you please it it is pleased if you cringe to it it detects you and scorns you if you are mean it returns your cheerfulness with its good humour it deals not ungenerously with your weaknesses it recognizes most kindly your merits it gives you a fair place and fair play to any one of those men of whom we have spoken was it in the main ungrateful a king might refuse goldsmith a pension as a publisher might keep his masterpiece and the delight of all the world in his desk for two years but it was mistake and not ill will noble and illustrious names of swift and pope and addison dear and honoured memories of goldsmith and fielding kind friends teachers benefactors who shall say that our country which continues to bring you such an unceasing tribute of applause admiration love sympathy does not do honour to the literary calling in the honour which it bestows upon you      the georges     the poems   punch october 11 1845  as the statues of these

walpole who had been patted on the head by george i this lady had knocked at johnson’s door had been intimate with fox the beautiful georgina of devonshire and that brilliant whig society of the reign of george iii had known the duchess of queensberry the patroness of gay and prior the admired young beauty of the court of queen anne i often thought as i took my kind old friend’s hand how with it i held on to the old society of wits and men of the world i could travel back for sevenscore years of time—have glimpses of brummell selwyn chesterfield and the men of pleasure of walpole and conway of johnson reynolds goldsmith of north chatham newcastle of the fair maids of honour of george ii’s court of the german retainers of george i’s where addison was secretary of state where dick steele held a place whither the great marlborough came with his fiery spouse when pope and swift and bolingbroke yet lived and wrote of a society so vast busy brilliant it is impossible in four brief chapters to give a complete notion but we may peep here and there into that bygone world of the georges see what they and their courts were like glance at the people round about them look at past manners fashions pleasures and contrast them with our own i have to say thus much by way of preface because the subject of these lectures has been misunderstood and i have been taken to task for not having given grave historical treatises which it never was my intention to attempt not about battles about politics about statesmen and measures of state did i ever think to lecture you but to sketch the manners and life of the old world to amuse for a few hours with talk about the old society and with the result of many a day’s and night’s pleasant reading to try and wile away a few winter evenings for my hearers                      among the german princes who sat under luther at wittenberg was duke ernest of celle whose younger son william of lüneburg was the progenitor of the illustrious hanoverian house at present reigning in great britain duke william held his court at celle a little town of ten thousand people that lies on the railway line between hamburg and hanover in the midst of great plains of sand upon the river aller when duke william had it it was a very humble woodbuilt place with a great brick church which he sedulously frequented and in which he and others of his house lie buried he was a very religious lord and called william the pious by his small circle of subjects over whom he ruled till fate deprived him both of sight and reason sometimes in his latter days the good duke had glimpses of mental light when he would bid his musicians play the psalmtunes which he loved one thinks of a descendant of his two hundred years afterwards blind old and lost of wits singing handel in windsor tower  william the pious had fifteen children eight daughters and seven sons who as the property left among them was small drew lots to determine which one of them should marry and continue the stout race of the guelphs the lot fell on duke george the sixth brother the others remained single or contracted lefthanded marriages after the princely fashion of those days it is a queer picture—that of the old prince dying in his little woodbuilt capital and his seven sons tossing up which should inherit and transmit the crown of brentford duke george the lucky prizeman made the tour of europe during which he visited the court of queen elizabeth and in the year 1617 came back and settled at zell with a wife out of darmstadt his remaining brothers all kept their house at zell for economy’s sake and presently in due course they all died—all the honest dukes ernest and christian and augustus and magnus and george and john—and they are buried in the brick church of brentford yonder by the sandy banks of the aller  dr vehse gives a pleasant glimpse of the way of life of our dukes in zell “when the trumpeter on the tower has blown” duke christian orders—viz at

christian ordains the accounts shall be ready and the expenses in the kitchen the wine and beer cellar the bakehouse and stable made out  duke george the marrying duke did not stop at home to partake of the beer and wine and the sermons he went about fighting wherever there was profit to be had he served as general in the army of the circle of lower saxony the protestant army then he went over to the emperor and fought in his armies in germany and italy and when gustavus adolphus appeared in germany george took service as a swedish general and seized the abbey of hildesheim as his share of the plunder here in the year 1641 duke george died leaving four sons behind him from the youngest of whom descend our royal georges  under these children of duke george the old godfearing simple ways of zell appear to have gone out of mode the second brother was constantly visiting venice and leading a jolly wicked life there it was the most jovial of all places at the end of the seventeenth century and military men after a campaign rushed thither as the warriors of the allies rushed to paris in 1814 to gamble and rejoice and partake of all sorts of godless delights this prince then loving venice and its pleasures brought italian singers and dancers back with him to quiet old zell and worse still demeaned himself by marrying a french lady of birth quite inferior to his own—eleanor d’olbreuse from whom our queen is descended eleanor had a pretty daughter who inherited a great fortune which inflamed her cousin george louis of hanover with a desire to marry her and so with her beauty and her riches she came to a sad end  it is too long to tell how the four sons of duke george divided his territories amongst them and how finally they came into possession of the son of the youngest of the four in this generation the protestant faith was very nearly extinguished in the family and then where should we in england have gone for a king the third brother also took delight in italy where the priests converted him and his protestant chaplain too mass was said in hanover once more and italian soprani piped their latin rhymes in place of the hymns which william the pious and dr luther sang louis xiv gave this and other converts a splendid pension crowds of frenchmen and brilliant french fashions came into his court it is incalculable how much that royal bigwig cost germany every prince imitated the french king and had his versailles his wilhelmshöhe or ludwigslust his court and its splendours his gardens laid out with statues his fountains and waterworks and tritons his actors and dancers and singers and fiddlers his harem with its inhabitants his diamonds and duchies for these latter his enormous festivities his gamingtables tournaments masquerades and banquets lasting a week long for which the people paid with their money when the poor wretches had it with their bodies and very blood when they had none being sold in thousands by their lords and masters who gaily dealt in soldiers staked a regiment upon the red at the gamblingtable swapped a battalion against a dancinggirl’s diamond necklace and as it were pocketed their people  as one views europe through contemporary books of travel in the early part of the last century the landscape is awful—wretched wastes beggarly and plundered halfburned cottages and trembling peasants gathering piteous harvests gangs of such tramping along with bayonets behind them and corporals with canes and catsofninetails to flog them to barracks by these passes my lord’s gilt carriage floundering through the ruts as he swears at the postilions and toils on to the residenz hard by but away from the noise and brawling of the citizens and buyers is wilhelmslust or ludwigsruhe or monbijou or versailles—it scarcely matters which—near to the city shut out by woods from the beggared country the enormous hideous gilded monstrous marble palace where the prince is and the court and the trim gardens and huge fountains and the forest where the ragged peasants are beating the game in it is death to them to touch a feather and the jolly hunt sweeps by with its uniform of crimson and gold and the prince gallops ahead puffing his royal horn and his lords and mistresses ride after him and the stag is pulled down and the grand huntsman gives the knife in the midst of a chorus of bugles and ’tis time the court go home to dinner and our noble traveller it may be the baron of pöllnitz or the count de königsmarck or the excellent chevalier de seingalt sees the procession gleaming through the trim avenues of the wood and hastens to the inn and sends his noble name to the marshal of the court then our nobleman arrays himself in green and gold or pink and silver in the richest paris mode and is introduced by the chamberlain and makes his bow to the jolly prince and the gracious princess and is presented to the chief lords and ladies and then comes supper and a bank at faro where he loses or wins a thousand pieces by daylight if it is a german court you may add not a little drunkenness to this picture of high life but german or french or spanish if you can see out of your palacewindows beyond the trimcut forest vistas misery is lying outside hunger is stalking about the bare villages listlessly following precarious husbandry ploughing stony fields with starved cattle or fearfully taking in scanty harvests augustus is fat and jolly on his throne he can knock down an ox and eat one almost his mistress aurora von königsmarck is the loveliest the wittiest creature his diamonds are the biggest and most brilliant in the world and his feasts as splendid as those of versailles as for louis the great he is more than mortal lift up your glances respectfully and mark him eyeing madame de fontanges or madame de montespan from under his sublime periwig as he passes through the great gallery where villars and vendôme and berwick and bossuet and massillon are waiting can court be more splendid nobles and knights more gallant and superb ladies more lovely a grander monarch or a more miserable starved wretch than the peasant his subject you cannot look on let us bear both these types in mind if we wish to estimate the old society properly remember the glory and the chivalry yes remember the grace and beauty the splendour and lofty politeness the gallant courtesy of fontenoy where the french line bids the gentlemen of the english guard to fire first the noble constancy of the old king and villars his general who fits out the last army with the last crownpiece from the treasury and goes to meet the enemy and die or conquer for france at denain but round all that royal splendour lies a nation enslaved and ruined there are people robbed of their rights—communities laid waste—faith justice commerce trampled upon and wellnigh destroyed—nay in the very centre of royalty itself what horrible stains and meanness crime and shame it is but to a silly harlot that some of the noblest gentlemen and some of the proudest women in the world are bowing down it is the price of a miserable province that the king ties in diamonds round his mistress’s white neck in the first half of the last century i say this is going on all europe over saxony is a waste as well as picardy or artois and versailles is only larger and not worse than herrenhausen                                illustration                                two portraits   it was the first elector of hanover who made the fortunate match which bestowed the race of hanoverian sovereigns upon us britons nine years after charles stuart lost his head his niece sophia one of many children of another luckless dethroned sovereign the elector palatine married ernest augustus of brunswick and brought the reversion to the crown of the three kingdoms in her scanty trousseau one of the handsomest the most cheerful sensible shrewd accomplished of women was sophia186 daughter of poor frederick the winter king of bohemia the other daughters of lovely unhappy elizabeth stuart went off into the catholic church this one luckily for her family remained i cannot say faithful to the reformed religion but at least she adopted no other an agent of the french king’s gourville a convert himself strove to bring her and her husband to a sense of the truth and tells us that he one day asked madame the duchess of hanover of what religion her daughter was then a pretty girl of thirteen years old the duchess replied that the princess was of no religion as yet they were waiting to know of what religion her husband would be protestant or catholic before instructing her and the duke of hanover having heard all gourville’s proposal said that a change would be advantageous to his house but that he himself was too old to change  this shrewd woman had such keen eyes that she knew how to shut them upon occasion and was blind to many faults which it appeared that her husband the bishop of osnaburg and duke of hanover committed he loved to take his pleasure like other sovereigns—was a merry prince fond of dinner and the bottle liked to go to italy as his brothers had done before him and we read how he jovially sold 6700 of his hanoverians to the seigniory of venice they went bravely off to the morea under command of ernest’s son prince max and only 1400 of them ever came home again the german princes sold a good deal of this kind of stock you may remember how george iii’s government purchased hessians and the use we made of them during the war of independence  the ducats duke ernest got for his soldiers he spent in a series of the most brilliant entertainments nevertheless the jovial prince was economical and kept a steady eye upon his own interests he achieved the electoral dignity for himself he married his eldest son george to his beautiful cousin of zell and sending his sons out in command of armies to fight—now on this side now on that—he lived on taking his pleasure and scheming his schemes a merry wise prince enough not i fear a moral prince of which kind we shall have but very few specimens in the course of these lectures  ernest augustus had seven children in all some of whom were scapegraces and rebelled against the parental system of primogeniture and nondivision of property which the elector ordained “gustchen” the electress writes about her second son—“poor gus is thrust out and his father will give him no more keep i laugh in the day and cry all night about it for i am a fool with my children” three of the six died fighting against turks tartars frenchmen one of them conspired revolted fled to rome leaving an agent behind him whose head was taken off the daughter of whose early education we have made mention was married to the elector of brandenburg and so her religion settled finally on the protestant side  a niece of the electress sophia—who had been made to change her religion and marry the duke of orleans brother of the french king a woman whose honest heart was always with her friends and dear old deutschland though her fat little body was confined at paris or marly or versailles—has left us in her enormous correspondence part of which has been printed in german and french recollections of the electress and of george her son elizabeth charlotte was at osnaburg when george was born 1660 she narrowly escaped a whipping for being in the way on that auspicious day she seems not to have liked little george nor george grown up and represents him as odiously hard cold and silent silent he may have been not a jolly prince like his father before him but a prudent quiet selfish potentate going his own way managing his own affairs and understanding his own interests remarkably well  in his father’s lifetime and at the head of the hanover forces of 8000 or 10000 men george served the emperor on the danube against turks at the siege of vienna in italy and on the rhine when he succeeded to the electorate he handled its affairs with great prudence and dexterity he was very much liked by his people of hanover he did not show his feelings much but he cried heartily on leaving them as they used for joy when he came back he showed an uncommon prudence and coolness of behaviour when he came into his kingdom exhibiting no elation reasonably doubtful whether he should not be turned out some day looking upon himself only as a lodger and making the most of his brief tenure of st james’s and hampton court plundering it is true somewhat and dividing amongst his german followers but what could be expected of a sovereign who at home could sell his subjects at so many ducats per head and made no scruple in so disposing of them i fancy a considerable shrewdness prudence and even moderation in his ways the german protestant was a cheaper and better and kinder king than the catholic stuart in whose chair he sat and so far loyal to england that he let england govern herself  having these lectures in view i made it my business to visit that ugly cradle in which our georges were nursed the old town of hanover must look still pretty much as in the time when george louis left it the gardens and pavilions of herrenhausen are scarce changed since the day when the stout old electress sophia fell down in her last walk there preceding but by a few weeks to the tomb james ii’s daughter whose death made way for the brunswick stuarts in england  the two first royal georges and their father ernest augustus had quite royal notions regarding marriage and louis xiv and charles ii scarce distinguished themselves more at versailles or st james’s than these german sultans in their little city on the banks of the leine you may see at herrenhausen the very rustic theatre in which the platens danced and performed masques and sang before the elector and his sons there are the very fauns and dryads of stone still glimmering through the branches still grinning and piping their ditties of no tone as in the days when painted nymphs hung garlands round them appeared under their leafy arcades with gilt crooks guiding rams with gilt horns descended from “machines” in the guise of diana or minerva and delivered immense allegorical compliments to the princes returned home from the campaign  that was a curious state of morals and politics in europe a queer consequence of the triumph of the monarchical principle feudalism was beaten down the nobility in its quarrels with the crown had pretty well succumbed and the monarch was all in all he became almost divine the proudest and most ancient gentry of the land did menial service for him who should carry louis xiv’s candle when he went to bed what prince of the blood should hold the king’s shirt when his most christian majesty changed that garment—the french memoirs of the seventeenth century are full of such details and squabbles the tradition is not yet extinct in europe any of you who were present as myriads were at that splendid pageant the opening of our crystal palace in london must have seen two noble lords great officers of the household with ancient pedigrees with embroidered coats and stars on their breasts and wands in their hands walking backwards for near the space of a mile while the royal procession made its progress shall we wonder—shall we be angry—shall we laugh at these oldworld ceremonies view them as you will according to your mood and with scorn or with respect or with anger and sorrow as your temper leads you up goes gesler’s hat upon the pole salute that symbol of sovereignty with heartfelt awe or with a sulky shrug of acquiescence or with a grinning obeisance or with a stout rebellious no—clap your own beaver down on your pate and refuse to doff it to that spangled velvet and flaunting feather i make no comment upon the spectators’ behaviour all i say is that gesler’s cap is still up in the marketplace of europe and not a few folks are still kneeling to it  put clumsy high dutch statues in place of the marbles of versailles fancy herrenhausen waterworks in place of those of marly spread the tables with schweinskopf specksuppe leberkuchen and the like delicacies in place of the french cuisine and fancy frau von kielmansegge dancing with count kammerjunker quirini or singing french songs with the most awful german accent imagine a coarse versailles and we have a hanover before us “i am now got into the region of beauty” writes mary wortley from hanover in 1716 “all the women have literally rosy cheeks snowy foreheads and necks jet eyebrows to which may generally be added coalblack hair these perfections never leave them to the day of their death and have a very fine effect by candlelight but i could wish they were handsome with a little variety they resemble one another as mrs salmon’s court of great britain and are in as much danger of melting away by too nearly approaching the fire” the sly mary wortley saw this painted seraglio of the first george at hanover the year after his accession to the british throne there were great doings and feasts there here lady mary saw george ii too “i can tell you without flattery or partiality” she says “that our young prince has all the accomplishments that it is possible to have at his age with an air of sprightliness and understanding and a something so very engaging in his behaviour that needs not the advantage of his rank to appear charming” i find elsewhere similar panegyrics upon frederick prince of wales george ii’s son and upon george iii of course and upon george iv in an eminent degree it was the rule to be dazzled by princes and people’s eyes winked quite honestly at that royal radiance  the electoral court of hanover was numerous—pretty well paid as times went above all paid with a regularity which few other european courts could boast of perhaps you will be amused to know how the electoral court was composed there were the princes of the house in the first class in the second the single fieldmarshal of the army the contingent was 18000 pöllnitz says and the elector had other 14000 troops in his pay then follow in due order the authorities civil and military the working privy councillors the generals of cavalry and infantry in the third class the high chamberlain high marshals of the court high masters of the horse the majorgenerals of cavalry and infantry in the fourth class down to the majors the hofjunkers or pages the secretaries or assessors of the tenth class of whom all were noble  we find the master of the horse had 1090 thalers of pay the high chamberlain 2000—a thaler being about three shillings of our money there were two chamberlains and one for the princess five gentlemen of the chamber and five gentlemen ushers eleven pages and personages to educate these young noblemen—such as a governor a preceptor a fechtmeister or fencingmaster and a dancing ditto this latter with a handsome salary of 400 thalers there were three body and court physicians with 800 and 500 thalers a court barber 600 thalers a court organist two musikanten four french fiddlers twelve trumpeters and a bugler so that there was plenty of music profane and pious in hanover there were ten chamber waiters and twentyfour lackeys in livery a maitred’hôtel and attendants of the kitchen a french cook a body cook ten cooks six cooks’ assistants two braten masters or masters of the roast—one fancies enormous spits turning slowly and the honest masters of the roast beladling the dripping a pastry baker a pie baker and finally three scullions at the modest remuneration of eleven thalers in the sugarchamber there were four pastrycooks for the ladies no doubt seven officers in the wine and beer cellars four bread bakers and five men in the plateroom there were 600 horses in the serene stables—no less than twenty teams of princely carriage horses eight to a team sixteen coachmen fourteen postilions nineteen ostlers thirteen helps besides smiths carriagemasters horsedoctors and other attendants of the stable the female attendants were not so numerous i grieve to find but a dozen or fourteen of them about the electoral premises and only two washerwomen for all the court these functionaries had not so much to do as in the present age i own to finding a pleasure in these smallbeer chronicles i like to people the old world with its everyday figures and inhabitants—not so much with heroes fighting immense battles and inspiring repulsed battalions to engage or statesmen locked up in darkling cabinets and meditating ponderous laws or dire conspiracies—as with people occupied with their everyday work or pleasure my lord and lady hunting in the forest or dancing in the court or bowing to their serene highnesses as they pass in to dinner john cook and his procession bringing the meal from the kitchen the jolly butlers bearing in the flagons from the cellar the stout coachman driving the ponderous gilt wagon with eight creamcoloured horses in housings of scarlet velvet and morocco leather a postilion on the leaders and a pair or a halfdozen of running footmen scudding along by the side of the vehicle with conical caps long silverheaded maces which they poised as they ran and splendid jackets laced all over with silver and gold i fancy the citizens’ wives and their daughters looking out from the balconies and the burghers over their beer and mumm rising up cap in hand as the cavalcade passes through the town with torchbearers trumpeters blowing their lusty cheeks out and squadrons of jackbooted lifeguardsmen girt with shining cuirasses and bestriding thundering chargers escorting his highness’s coach from hanover to herrenhausen or halting mayhap at madame platen’s country house of monplaisir which lies halfway between the summer palace and the residenz  in the good old times of which i am treating whilst common men were driven off by herds and sold to fight the emperor’s enemies on the danube or to bayonet king louis’s troops of common men on the rhine noblemen passed from court to court seeking service with one prince or the other and naturally taking command of the ignoble vulgar of soldiery which battled and died almost without hope of promotion noble adventurers travelled from court to court in search of employment not merely noble males but noble females too and if these latter were beauties and obtained the favourable notice of princes they stopped in the courts became the favourites of their serene or royal highnesses and received great sums of money and splendid diamonds and were promoted to be duchesses marchionesses and the like and did not fall much in public esteem for the manner in which they won their advancement in this way mdlle de querouailles a beautiful french lady came to london on a special mission of louis xiv and was adopted by our grateful country and sovereign and figured as duchess of portsmouth in this way the beautiful aurora of königsmarck travelling about found favour in the eyes of augustus of saxony and became the mother of marshal saxe who gave us a beating at fontenoy and in this manner the lovely sisters elizabeth and melusina of meissenbach who had actually been driven out of paris whither they had travelled on a like errand by the wise jealousy of the female favourite there in possession journeyed to hanover and became favourites of the serene house there reigning  that beautiful aurora von königsmarck and her brother are wonderful as types of bygone manners and strange illustrations of the morals of old days the königsmarcks were descended from an ancient noble family of brandenburgh a branch of which passed into sweden where it enriched itself and produced several mighty men of valour  the founder of the race was hans christof a famous warrior and plunderer of the thirty years’ war one of hans’s sons otto appeared as ambassador at the court of louis xiv and had to make a swedish speech at his reception before the most christian king otto was a famous dandy and warrior but he forgot the speech and what do you think he did far from being disconcerted he recited a portion of the swedish catechism to his most christian majesty and his court not one of whom understood his lingo with the exception of his own suite who had to keep their gravity as best they might  otto’s nephew aurora’s elder brother carl johann of königsmarck a favourite of charles ii a beauty a dandy a warrior a rascal of more than ordinary mark escaped but deserved being hanged in england for the murder of tom thynne of longleat he had a little brother in london with him at this time—as great a beauty as great a dandy as great a villain as his elder this lad philip of königsmarck also was implicated in the affair and perhaps it is a pity he ever brought his pretty neck out of it he went over to hanover and was soon appointed colonel of a regiment of h e highness’s dragoons in early life he had been page in the court of celle and it was said that he and the pretty princess sophia dorothea who by this time was married to her cousin george the electoral prince had been in love with each other as children their loves were now to be renewed not innocently and to come to a fearful end  a biography of the wife of george i by dr doran has lately appeared and i confess i am astounded at the verdict which that writer has delivered and at his acquittal of this most unfortunate lady that she had a cold selfish libertine of a husband no one can doubt but that the bad husband had a bad wife is equally clear she was married to her cousin for money or convenience as all princesses were married she was most beautiful lively witty accomplished his brutality outraged her his silence and coldness chilled her his cruelty insulted her no wonder she did not love him how could love be a part of the compact in such a marriage as that with this unlucky heart to dispose of the poor creature bestowed it on philip of königsmarck than whom a greater scamp does not walk the history of the seventeenth century a hundred and eighty years after the fellow was thrust into his unknown grave a swedish professor lights upon a box of letters in the university library at upsala written by philip and dorothea to each other and telling their miserable story  the bewitching königsmarck had conquered two female hearts in hanover besides the electoral prince’s lovely young wife sophia dorothea philip had inspired a passion in a hideous old court lady the countess of platen the princess seems to have pursued him with the fidelity of many years heaps of letters followed him on his campaigns and were answered by the daring adventurer the princess wanted to fly with him to quit her odious husband at any rate she besought her parents to receive her back had a notion of taking refuge in france and going over to the catholic religion had absolutely packed her jewels for flight and very likely arranged its details with her lover in that last long night’s interview after which philip of königsmarck was seen no more  königsmarck inflamed with drink—there is scarcely any vice of which according to his own showing this gentleman was not a practitioner—had boasted at a supper at dresden of his intimacy with the two hanoverian ladies not only with the princess but with another lady powerful in hanover the countess platen the old favourite of the elector hated the young electoral princess the young lady had a lively wit and constantly made fun of the old one the princess’s jokes were conveyed to the old platen just as our idle words are carried about at this present day and so they both hated each other  the characters in the tragedy of which the curtain was now about to fall are about as dark a set as eye ever rested on there is the jolly prince shrewd selfish scheming loving his cups and his ease i think his good humour makes the tragedy but darker his princess who speaks little but observes all his old painted jezebel of a mistress his son the electoral prince shrewd too quiet selfish not illhumoured and generally silent except when goaded into fury by the intolerable tongue of his lovely wife there is poor sophia dorothea with her coquetry and her wrongs and her passionate attachment to her scamp of a lover and her wild imprudences and her mad artifices and her insane fidelity and her furious jealousy regarding her husband though she loathed and cheated him and her prodigious falsehoods and the confidante of course into whose hands the letters are slipped and there is lothario finally than whom as i have said one can’t imagine a more handsome wicked worthless reprobate                                illustration                              a deed of darkness   how that perverse fidelity of passion pursues the villain how madly true the woman is and how astoundingly she lies she has bewitched two or three persons who have taken her up and they won’t believe in her wrong like mary of scotland she finds adherents ready to conspire for her even in history and people who have to deal with her are charmed and fascinated and bedevilled how devotedly miss strickland has stood by mary’s innocence are there not scores of ladies in this audience who persist in it too innocent i remember as a boy how a great party persisted in declaring caroline of brunswick was a martyred angel so was helen of greece innocent she never ran away with paris the dangerous young trojan menelaus her husband illused her and there never was any siege of troy at all so was bluebeard’s wife innocent she never peeped into the closet where the other wives were with their heads off she never dropped the key or stained it with blood and her brothers were quite right in finishing bluebeard the cowardly brute yes caroline of brunswick was innocent and madame laffarge never poisoned her husband and mary of scotland never blew up hers and poor sophia dorothea was never unfaithful and eve never took the apple—it was a cowardly fabrication of the serpent’s  george louis has been held up to execration as a murderous bluebeard whereas the electoral prince had no share in the transaction in which philip of königsmarck was scuffled out of this mortal scene the prince was absent when the catastrophe came the princess had had a hundred warnings mild hints from her husband’s parents grim remonstrances from himself—but took no more heed of this advice than such besotted poor wretches do on the night of sunday the 1st of july 1694 königsmarck paid a long visit to the princess and left her to get ready for flight her husband was away at berlin her carriages and horses were prepared and ready for the elopement meanwhile the spies of countess platen had brought the news to their mistress she went to ernest augustus and procured from the elector an order for the arrest of the swede on the way by which he was to come four guards were commissioned to take him he strove to cut his way through the four men and wounded more than one of them they fell upon him cut him down and as he was lying wounded on the ground the countess his enemy whom he had betrayed and insulted came out and beheld him prostrate he cursed her with his dying lips and the furious woman stamped upon his mouth with her heel he was dispatched presently his body burnt the next day and all traces of the man disappeared the guards who killed him were enjoined silence under severe penalties the princess was reported to be ill in her apartments from which she was taken in october of the same year being then eightandtwenty years old and consigned to the castle of ahlden where she remained a prisoner for no less than thirtytwo years a separation had been pronounced previously between her and her husband she was called henceforth the “princess of ahlden” and her silent husband no more uttered her name  four years after the königsmarck catastrophe ernest augustus the first elector of hanover died and george louis his son reigned in his stead sixteen years he reigned in hanover after which he became as we know king of great britain france and ireland defender of the faith the wicked old countess platen died in the year 1706 she had lost her sight but nevertheless the legend says that she constantly saw königsmarck’s ghost by her wicked old bed and so there was an end of her  in the year 1700 the little duke of gloucester the last of poor queen anne’s children died and the folks of hanover straightway became of prodigious importance in england the electress sophia was declared the next in succession to the english throne george louis was created duke of cambridge grand deputations were sent over from our country to deutschland but queen anne whose weak heart hankered after her relatives at st germains never could be got to allow her cousin the elector duke of cambridge to come and pay his respects to her majesty and take his seat in her house of peers had the queen lasted a month longer had the english tories been as bold and resolute as they were clever and crafty had the prince whom the nation loved and pitied been equal to his fortune george louis had never talked german in st james’s chapel royal  when the crown did come to george louis he was in no hurry about putting it on he waited at home for awhile took an affecting farewell of his dear hanover and herrenhausen and set out in the most leisurely manner to ascend “the throne of his ancestors” as he called it in his first speech to parliament he brought with him a compact body of germans whose society he loved and whom he kept round the royal person he had his faithful german chamberlains his german secretaries his negroes captives of his bow and spear in turkish wars his two ugly elderly german favourites mesdames of kielmansegge and schulenberg whom he created respectively countess of darlington and duchess of kendal the duchess was tall and lean of stature and hence was irreverently nicknamed the maypole the countess was a largesized noblewoman and this elevated personage was denominated the elephant both of these ladies loved hanover and its delights clung round the lindentrees of the great herrenhausen avenue and at first would not quit the place schulenberg in fact could not come on account of her debts but finding the maypole would not come the elephant packed up her trunk and slipped out of hanover unwieldy as she was on this the maypole straightway put herself in motion and followed her beloved george louis one seems to be speaking of captain macheath and polly and lucy the king we had selected the courtiers who came in his train the english nobles who came to welcome him and on many of whom the shrewd old cynic turned his back—i protest it is a wonderful satirical picture i am a citizen waiting at greenwich pier say and crying hurrah for king george and yet i can scarcely keep my countenance and help laughing at the enormous absurdity of this advent  here we are all on our knees here is the archbishop of canterbury prostrating himself to the head of his church with kielmansegge and schulenberg with their raddled cheeks grinning behind the defender of the faith here is my lord duke of marlborough kneeling too the greatest warrior of all times he who betrayed king william—betrayed king james ii—betrayed queen anne—betrayed england to the french the elector to the pretender the pretender to the elector and here are my lords oxford and bolingbroke the latter of whom has just tripped up the heels of the former and if a month’s more time had been allowed him would have had king james at westminster the great whig gentlemen made their bows and congees with proper decorum and ceremony but yonder keen old schemer knows the value of their loyalty “loyalty” he must think “as applied to me—it is absurd there are fifty nearer heirs to the throne than i am i am but an accident and you fine whig gentlemen take me for your own sake not for mine you tories hate me you archbishop smirking on your knees and prating about heaven you know i don’t care a fig for your thirtynine articles and can’t understand a word of your stupid sermons you my lords bolingbroke and oxford—you know you were conspiring against me a month ago and you my lord duke of marlborough—you would sell me or any man else if you found your advantage in it come my good melusina come my honest sophia let us go into my private room and have some oysters and some rhine wine and some pipes afterwards let us make the best of our situation let us take what we can get and leave these bawling brawling lying english to shout and fight and cheat in their own way”  if swift had not been committed to the statesmen of the losing side what a fine satirical picture we might have had of that general sauve qui peut amongst the tory party how mum the tories became how the house of lords and house of commons chopped round and how decorously the majorities welcomed king george  bolingbroke making his last speech in the house of lords pointed out the shame of peerage where several lords concurred to condemn in one general vote all that they had approved in former parliaments by many particular resolutions and so their conduct was shameful st john had the best of the argument but the worst of the vote bad times were come for him he talked philosophy and professed innocence he courted retirement and was ready to meet persecution but hearing that honest mat prior who had been recalled from paris was about to peach regarding the past transactions the philosopher bolted and took that magnificent head of his out of the ugly reach of the axe oxford the lazy and goodhumoured had more courage and awaited the storm at home he and mat prior both had lodgings in the tower and both brought their heads safe out of that dangerous menagerie when atterbury was carried off to the same den a few years afterwards and it was asked what next should be done with him “done with him fling him to the lions” cadogan said marlborough’s lieutenant but the british lion of those days did not care much for drinking the blood of peaceful peers and poets or crunching the bones of bishops only four men were executed in london for the rebellion of 1715 and twentytwo in lancashire above a thousand taken in arms submitted to the king’s mercy and petitioned to be transported to his majesty’s colonies in america i have heard that their descendants took the loyalist side in the disputes which arose sixty years after it is pleasant to find that a friend of ours worthy dick steele was for letting off the rebels with their lives  as one thinks of what might have been how amusing the speculation is we know how the doomed scottish gentlemen came out at lord mar’s summons mounted the white cockade that has been a flower of sad poetry ever since and rallied round the illomened stuart standard at braemar mar with 8000 men and but 1500 opposed to him might have driven the enemy over the tweed and taken possession of the whole of scotland but that the pretender’s duke did not venture to move when the day was his own edinburgh castle might have been in king james’s hands but that the men who were to escalade it stayed to drink his health at the tavern and arrived two hours too late at the rendezvous under the castle wall there was sympathy enough in the town—the projected attack seems to have been known there—lord mahon quotes sinclair’s account of a gentleman not concerned who told sinclair that he was in a house that evening where eighteen of them were drinking as the facetious landlady said “powdering their hair” for the attack of the castle suppose they had not stopped to powder their hair edinburgh castle and town and all scotland were king james’s the north of england rises and marches over barnet heath upon london wyndham is up in somersetshire packington in worcestershire and vivian in cornwall the elector of hanover and his hideous mistresses pack up the plate and perhaps the crown jewels in london and are off via harwich and helvoetsluys for dear old deutschland the king—god save him—lands at dover with tumultuous applause shouting multitudes roaring cannon the duke of marlborough weeping tears of joy and all the bishops kneeling in the mud in a few years mass is said in st paul’s matins and vespers are sung in york minster and dr swift is turned out of his stall and deanery house at st patrick’s to give place to father dominic from salamanca all these changes were possible then and once thirty years afterwards—all this we might have had but for the pulveris exigui jactu that little toss of powder for the hair which the scotch conspirators stopped to take at the tavern  you understand the distinction i would draw between history—of which i do not aspire to be an expounder—and manners and life such as these sketches would describe the rebellion breaks out in the north its story is before you in a hundred volumes in none more fairly than in the excellent narrative of lord mahon the clans are up in scotland derwentwater nithsdale and forster are in arms in northumberland—these are matters of history for which you are referred to the due chroniclers the guards are set to watch the streets and prevent the people wearing white roses i read presently of a couple of soldiers almost flogged to death for wearing oak boughs in their hats on the 29th of may—another badge of the beloved stuarts it is with these we have to do rather than the marches and battles of the armies to which the poor fellows belonged—with statesmen and how they looked and how they lived rather than with measures of state which belong to history alone for example at the close of the old queen’s reign it is known the duke of marlborough left the kingdom—after what menaces after what prayers lies bribes offered taken refused accepted after what dark doubling and tacking let history if she can or dare say the queen dead who so eager to return as my lord duke who shouts god save the king so lustily as the great conqueror of blenheim and malplaquet by the way he will send over some more money for the pretender yet on the sly who lays his hand on his blue ribbon and lifts his eyes more gracefully to heaven than this hero he makes a quasitriumphal entrance into london by temple bar in his enormous gilt coach—and the enormous gilt coach breaks down somewhere by chancery lane and his highness is obliged to get another there it is we have him we are with the mob in the crowd not with the great folks in the procession we are not the historic muse but her ladyship’s attendant talebearer—valet de chambre—for whom no man is a hero and as yonder one steps from his carriage to the next handy conveyance we take the number of the hack we look all over at his stars ribbons embroidery we think within ourselves o you unfathomable schemer o you warrior invincible o you beautiful smiling judas what master would you not kiss or betray what traitor’s head blackening on the spikes on yonder gate ever hatched a tithe of the treason which has worked under your periwig  we have brought our georges to london city and if we would behold its aspect may see it in hogarth’s lively perspective of cheapside or read of it in a hundred contemporary books which paint the manners of that age our dear old spectator looks smiling upon the streets with their innumerable signs and describes them with his charming humour “our streets are filled with ‘blue boars’ ‘black swans’ and ‘red lions’ not to mention ‘flying pigs’ and ‘hogs in armour’ with other creatures more extraordinary than any in the deserts of africa” a few of these quaint old figures still remain in london town you may still see there and over its old hostel in ludgate hill the “belle sauvage” to whom the spectator so pleasantly alludes in that paper and who was probably no other than the sweet american pocahontas who rescued from death the daring captain smith there is the “lion’s head’” down whose jaws the spectator’s own letters were passed and over a great banker’s in fleet street the effigy of the wallet which the founder of the firm bore when he came into london a country boy people this street so ornamented with crowds of swinging chairmen with servants bawling to clear the way with mr dean in his cassock his lackey marching before him or mrs dinah in her sack tripping to chapel her footboy carrying her ladyship’s great prayerbook with itinerant tradesmen singing their hundred cries i remember forty years ago as a boy in london city a score of cheery familiar cries that are silent now fancy the beaux thronging to the chocolatehouses tapping their snuffboxes as they issue thence their periwigs appearing over the red curtains fancy saccharissa beckoning and smiling from the upper windows and a crowd of soldiers brawling and bustling at the door—gentlemen of the life guards clad in scarlet with blue facings and laced with gold at the seams gentlemen of the horse grenadiers in their caps of skyblue cloth with the garter embroidered on the front in gold and silver men of the halberdiers in their long red coats as bluff harry left them with their ruffs and velvet flat caps perhaps the king’s majesty himself is going to st james’s as we pass if he is going to parliament he is in his coachandeight surrounded by his guards and the high officers of his crown otherwise his majesty only uses a chair with six footmen walking before and six yeomen of the guard at the sides of the sedan the officers in waiting follow the king in coaches it must be rather slow work  our spectator and tatler are full of delightful glimpses of the town life of those days in the company of that charming guide we may go to the opera the comedy the puppet show the auction even the cockpit we can take boat at temple stairs and accompany sir roger de coverley and mr spectator to spring garden—it will be called vauxhall a few years since when hogarth will paint for it would you not like to step back into the past and be introduced to mr addison—not the right honourable joseph addison esq george i’s secretary of state but to the delightful painter of contemporary manners the man who when in good humour himself was the pleasantest companion in all england i should like to go into lockit’s with him and drink a bowl along with sir r steele who has just been knighted by king george and who does not happen to have any money to pay his share of the reckoning i should not care to follow mr addison to his secretary’s office in whitehall there we get into politics our business is pleasure and the town and the coffeehouse and the theatre and the mall delightful spectator kind friend of leisure hours happy companion true christian gentleman how much greater better you are than the king mr secretary kneels to  you can have foreign testimony about oldworld london if you like and my beforequoted friend charles louis baron de pöllnitz will conduct us to it “a man of sense” says he “or a fine gentleman is never at a loss for company in london and this is the way the latter passes his time he rises late puts on a frock and leaving his sword at home takes his cane and goes where he pleases the park is commonly the place where he walks because ’tis the exchange for men of quality ’tis the same thing as the tuileries at paris only the park has a certain beauty of simplicity which cannot be described the grand walk is called the mall is full of people at every hour of the day but especially at morning and evening when their majesties often walk with the royal family who are attended only by a halfdozen yeomen of the guard and permit all persons to walk at the same time with them the ladies and gentlemen always appear in rich dresses for the english who twenty years ago did not wear gold lace but in their army are now embroidered and bedaubed as much as the french i speak of persons of quality for the citizen still contents himself with a suit of fine cloth a good hat and wig and fine linen everybody is well clothed here and even the beggars don’t make so ragged an appearance as they do elsewhere” after our friend the man of quality has had his morning or undress walk in the mall he goes home to dress and then saunters to some coffeehouse or chocolatehouse frequented by the persons he would see “for ’tis a rule with the english to go once a day at least to houses of this sort where they talk of business and news read the papers and often look at one another without opening their lips and ’tis very well they are so mute for were they all as talkative as people of other nations the coffeehouses would be intolerable and there would be no hearing what one man said where they are so many the chocolatehouse in st james’s street where i go every morning to pass away the time is always so full that a man can scarce turn about in it”  delightful as london city was king george i liked to be out of it as much as ever he could and when there passed all his time with his germans it was with them as with blücher 100 years afterwards when the bold old reiter looked down from st paul’s and sighed out “was für plunder” the german women plundered the german secretaries plundered the german cooks and intendants plundered even mustapha and mahomet the german negroes had a share of the booty take what you can get was the old monarch’s maxim he was not a lofty monarch certainly he was not a patron of the fine arts but he was not a hypocrite he was not revengeful he was not extravagant though a despot in hanover he was a moderate ruler in england his aim was to leave it to itself as much as possible and to live out of it as much as he could his heart was in hanover when taken ill on his last journey as he was passing through holland he thrust his livid head out of the coachwindow and gasped out “osnaburg osnaburg” he was more than fifty years of age when he came amongst us we took him because we wanted him because he served our turn we laughed at his uncouth german ways and sneered at him he took our loyalty for what it was worth laid hands on what money he could kept us assuredly from popery and wooden shoes i for one would have been on his side in those days cynical and selfish as he was he was better than a king out of st germains with the french king’s orders in his pocket and a swarm of jesuits in his train  the fates are supposed to interest themselves about royal personages and so this one had omens and prophecies specially regarding him he was said to be much disturbed at a prophecy that he should die very soon after his wife and sure enough pallid death having seized upon the luckless princess in her castle of ahlden presently pounced upon hm king george i in his travelling chariot on the hanover road what postilion can outride that pale horseman it is said george promised one of his lefthanded widows to come to her after death if leave were granted to him to revisit the glimpses of the moon and soon after his demise a great raven actually flying or hopping in at the duchess of kendal’s window at twickenham she chose to imagine the king’s spirit inhabited these plumes and took special care of her sable visitor affecting metempsychosis—funereal royal bird how pathetic is the idea of the duchess weeping over it when this chaste addition to our english aristocracy died all her jewels her plate her plunder went over to her relations in hanover i wonder whether her heirs took the bird and whether it is still flapping its wings over herrenhausen  the days are over in england of that strange religion of kingworship when priests flattered princes in the temple of god when servility was held to be ennobling duty when beauty and youth tried eagerly for royal favour and woman’s shame was held to be no dishonour mended morals and mended manners in courts and people are among the priceless consequences of the freedom which george i came to rescue and secure he kept his compact with his english subjects and if he escaped no more than other men and monarchs from the vices of his age at least we may thank him for preserving and transmitting the liberties of ours in our free air royal and humble homes have alike been purified and truth the birthright of high and low among us which quite fearlessly judges our greatest personages can only speak of them now in words of respect and regard there are stains in the portrait of the first george and traits in it which none of us need admire but among the nobler features are justice courage moderation—and these we may recognize ere we turn the picture to the wall    george the second   on the afternoon of the 14th of june 1727 two horsemen might have been perceived galloping along the road from chelsea to richmond the foremost cased in the jackboots of the period was a broadfaced jollylooking and very corpulent cavalier but by the manner in which he urged his horse you might see that he was a bold as well as a skilful rider indeed no man loved sport better and in the huntingfields of norfolk no squire rode more boldly after the fox or cheered ringwood and sweettips more lustily than he who now thundered over the richmond road  he speedily reached richmond lodge and asked to see the owner of the mansion the mistress of the house and her ladies to whom our friend was admitted said he could not be introduced to the master however pressing the business might be the master was asleep after his dinner he always slept after his dinner and woe be to the person who interrupted him nevertheless our stout friend of the jackboots put the affrighted ladies aside opened the forbidden door of the bedroom wherein upon the bed lay a little gentleman and here the eager messenger knelt down in his jackboots  he on the bed started up and with many oaths and a strong german accent asked who was there and who dared to disturb him  “i am sir robert walpole” said the messenger the awakened sleeper hated sir robert walpole “i have the honour to announce to your majesty that your royal father king george i died at osnaburg on saturday last the 10th inst”  “dat is one big lie” roared out his sacred majesty king george ii but sir robert walpole stated the fact and from that day until threeandthirty years after george the second of the name ruled over england  how the king made away with his father’s will under the astonished nose of the archbishop of canterbury how he was a choleric little sovereign how he shook his fist in the face of his father’s courtiers how he kicked his coat and wig about in his rages and called everybody thief liar rascal with whom he differed you will read in all the history books and how he speedily and shrewdly reconciled himself with the bold minister whom he had hated during his father’s life and by whom he was served during fifteen years of his own with admirable prudence fidelity and success but for sir robert walpole we should have had the pretender back again but for his obstinate love of peace we should have had wars which the nation was not strong enough nor united enough to endure but for his resolute counsels and goodhumoured resistance we might have had german despots attempting a hanoverian regimen over us we should have had revolt commotion want and tyrannous misrule in place of a quarter of a century of peace freedom and material prosperity such as the country never enjoyed until that corrupter of parliaments that dissolute tipsy cynic that courageous lover of peace and liberty that great citizen patriot and statesman governed it in religion he was little better than a heathen cracked ribald jokes at bigwigs and bishops and laughed at high church and low in private life the old pagan revelled in the lowest pleasures he passed his sundays tippling at richmond and his holidays bawling after dogs or boozing at houghton with boors over beef and punch he cared for letters no more than his master did he judged human nature so meanly that one is ashamed to have to own that he was right and that men could be corrupted by means so base but with his hireling house of commons he defended liberty for us with his incredulity he kept churchcraft down there were parsons at oxford as doubledealing and dangerous as any priests out of rome and he routed them both he gave englishmen no conquests but he gave them peace and ease and freedom the three per cents nearly at par and wheat at fiveand sixandtwenty shillings a quarter                                illustration                                  ave caesar   it was lucky for us that our first georges were not more highminded men especially fortunate that they loved hanover so much as to leave england to have her own way our chief troubles began when we got a king who gloried in the name of briton and being born in the country proposed to rule it he was no more fit to govern england than his grandfather and greatgrandfather who did not try it was righting itself during their occupation the dangerous noble old spirit of cavalier loyalty was dying out the stately old english high church was emptying itself the questions dropping which on one side and the other—the side of loyalty prerogative church and king—the side of right truth civil and religious freedom—had set generations of brave men in arms by the time when george iii came to the throne the combat between loyalty and liberty was come to an end and charles edward old tipsy and childless was dying in italy  those who are curious about european court history of the last age know the memoirs of the margravine of bayreuth and what a court was that of berlin where george ii’s cousins ruled sovereign frederick the great’s father knocked down his sons daughters officers of state he kidnapped big men all europe over to make grenadiers of his feasts his parades his wine parties his tobacco parties are all described jonathan wild the great in language pleasures and behaviour is scarcely more delicate than this german sovereign louis xv his life and reign and doings are told in a thousand french memoirs our george ii at least was not a worse king than his neighbours he claimed and took the royal exemption from doing right which sovereigns assumed a dull little man of low tastes he appears to us in england yet hervey tells us that this choleric prince was a great sentimentalist and that his letters—of which he wrote prodigious quantities—were quite dangerous in their powers of fascination he kept his sentimentalities for his germans and his queen with us english he never chose to be familiar he has been accused of avarice yet he did not give much money and did not leave much behind him he did not love the fine arts but he did not pretend to love them he was no more a hypocrite about religion than his father he judged men by a low standard yet with such men as were near him was he wrong in judging as he did he readily detected lying and flattery and liars and flatterers were perforce his companions had he been more of a dupe he might have been more amiable a dismal experience made him cynical no boon was it to him to be clearsighted and see only selfishness and flattery round about him what could walpole tell him about his lords and commons but that they were all venal did not his clergy his courtiers bring him the same story dealing with men and women in his rude sceptical way he comes to doubt about honour male and female about patriotism about religion “he is wild but he fights like a man” george i the taciturn said of his son and successor courage george ii certainly had the electoral prince at the head of his father’s contingent had approved himself a good and brave soldier under eugene and marlborough at oudenarde he specially distinguished himself at malplaquet the other claimant to the english throne won but little honour there was always a question about james’s courage neither then in flanders nor afterwards in his own ancient kingdom of scotland did the luckless pretender show much resolution but dapper little george had a famous tough spirit of his own and fought like a trojan he called out his brother of prussia with sword and pistol and i wish for the interest of romancers in general that that famous duel could have taken place the two sovereigns hated each other with all their might their seconds were appointed the place of meeting was settled and the duel was only prevented by strong representations made to the two of the european laughter which would have been caused by such a transaction  whenever we hear of dapper george at war it is certain that he demeaned himself like a little man of valour at dettingen his horse ran away with him and with difficulty was stopped from carrying him into the enemy’s lines the king dismounting from the fiery quadruped said bravely “now i know i shall not run away” and placed himself at the head of the foot drew his sword brandishing it at the whole of the french army and calling out to his own men to come on in bad english but with the most famous pluck and spirit in ’45 when the pretender was at derby and many people began to look pale the king never lost his courage—not he “pooh don’t talk to me that stuff” he said like a gallant little prince as he was and never for one moment allowed his equanimity or his business or his pleasures or his travels to be disturbed on public festivals he always appeared in the hat and coat he wore on the famous day of oudenarde and the people laughed but kindly at the odd old garment for bravery never goes out of fashion  in private life the prince showed himself a worthy descendant of his father in this respect so much has been said about the first george’s manners that we need not enter into a description of the son’s german harem in 1705 he married a princess remarkable for beauty for cleverness for learning for good temper—one of the truest and fondest wives ever prince was blessed with and who loved him and was faithful to him and he in his coarse fashion loved her to the last it must be told to the honour of caroline of anspach that at the time when german princes thought no more of changing their religion than you of altering your cap she refused to give up protestantism for the other creed although an archduke afterwards to be an emperor was offered to her for a bridegroom her protestant relations in berlin were angry at her rebellious spirit it was they who tried to convert her it is droll to think that frederick the great who had no religion at all was known for a long time in england as the protestant hero and these good protestants set upon caroline a certain father urban a very skilful jesuit and famous winner of souls but she routed the jesuit and she refused charles vi and she married the little electoral prince of hanover whom she tended with love and with every manner of sacrifice with artful kindness with tender flattery with entire selfdevotion thenceforward until her life’s end  when george i made his first visit to hanover his son was appointed regent during the royal absence but this honour was never again conferred on the prince of wales he and his father fell out presently on the occasion of the christening of his second son a royal row took place and the prince shaking his fist in the duke of newcastle’s face called him a rogue and provoked his august father he and his wife were turned out of st james’s and their princely children taken from them by order of the royal head of the family father and mother wept piteously at parting from their little ones the young ones sent some cherries with their love to papa and mamma the parents watered the fruit with tears they had no tears thirtyfive years afterwards when prince frederick died—their eldest son their heir their enemy  the king called his daughterinlaw “cette diablesse madame la princesse” the frequenters of the latter’s court were forbidden to appear at the king’s their royal highnesses going to bath we read how the courtiers followed them thither and paid that homage in somersetshire which was forbidden in london that phrase of “cette diablesse madame la princesse” explains one cause of the wrath of her royal papa she was a very clever woman she had a keen sense of humour she had a dreadful tongue she turned into ridicule the antiquated sultan and his hideous harem she wrote savage letters about him home to members of her family so driven out from the royal presence the prince and princess set up for themselves in leicester fields “where” says walpole “the most promising of the young gentlemen of the next party and the prettiest and liveliest of the young ladies formed the new court” besides leicester house they had their lodge at richmond frequented by some of the pleasantest company of those days there were the herveys and chesterfield and little mr pope from twickenham and with him sometimes the savage dean of st patrick’s and quite a bevy of young ladies whose pretty faces smile on us out of history there was lepell famous in ballad song and the saucy charming mary bellenden who would have none of the prince of wales’s fine compliments who folded her arms across her breast and bade hrh keep off and knocked his purse of guineas into his face and told him she was tired of seeing him count them he was not an august monarch this augustus walpole tells how one night at the royal cardtable the playful princesses pulled a chair away from under lady deloraine who in revenge pulled the king’s from under him so that his majesty fell on the carpet in whatever posture one sees this royal george he is ludicrous somehow even at dettingen where he fought so bravely his figure is absurd—calling out in his broken english and lunging with his rapier like a fencingmaster in contemporary caricatures george’s son “the hero of culloden” is also made an object of considerable fun as witness the following picture of him defeated by the french 1757 at hastenbeck                                illustration  i refrain to quote from walpole regarding george—for those charming volumes are in the hands of all who love the gossip of the last century nothing can be more cheery than horace’s letters fiddles sing all through them waxlights fine dresses fine jokes fine plate fine equipages glitter and sparkle there never was such a brilliant jigging smirking vanity fair as that through which he leads us hervey the next great authority is a darker spirit about him there is something frightful a few years since his heirs opened the lid of the ickworth box it was as if a pompeii was opened to us—the last century dug up with its temples and its games its chariots its public places—lupanaria wandering through that city of the dead that dreadfully selfish time through those godless intrigues and feasts through those crowds pushing and eager and struggling—rouged and lying and fawning—i have wanted some one to be friends with i have said to friends conversant with that history show me some good person about that court find me among those selfish courtiers those dissolute gay people some one being that i can love and regard there is that strutting little sultan george ii there is that hunchbacked beetlebrowed lord chesterfield there is john hervey with his deadly smile and ghastly painted face—i hate them there is hoadly cringing from one bishopric to another yonder comes little mr pope from twickenham with his friend the irish dean in his new cassock bowing too but with rage flashing from under his bushy eyebrows and scorn and hate quivering in his smile can you be fond of these of pope i might at least i might love his genius his wit his greatness his sensibility—with a certain conviction that at some fancied slight some sneer which he imagined he would turn upon me and stab me can you trust the queen she is not of our order their very position makes kings and queens lonely one inscrutable attachment that inscrutable woman has to that she is faithful through all trial neglect pain and time save her husband she really cares for no created being she is good enough to her children and even fond enough of them but she would chop them all up into little pieces to please him in her intercourse with all around her she was perfectly kind gracious and natural but friends may die daughters may depart she will be as perfectly kind and gracious to the next set if the king wants her she will smile upon him be she ever so sad and walk with him be she ever so weary and laugh at his brutal jokes be she in ever so much pain of body or heart caroline’s devotion to her husband is a prodigy to read of what charm had the little man what was there in those wonderful letters of thirty pages long which he wrote to her when he was absent and to his mistresses at hanover when he was in london with his wife why did caroline the most lovely and accomplished princess of germany take a little redfaced staring princeling for a husband and refuse an emperor why to her last hour did she love him so she killed herself because she loved him so she had the gout and would plunge her feet in cold water in order to walk with him with the film of death over her eyes writhing in intolerable pain she yet had a livid smile and a gentle word for her master you have read the wonderful history of that deathbed how she bade him marry again and the reply the old king blubbered out “non non j’aurai des maitresses” there never was such a ghastly farce i watch the astonishing scene—i stand by that awful bedside wondering at the ways in which god has ordained the lives loves rewards successes passions actions ends of his creatures—and can’t but laugh in the presence of death and with the saddest heart in that oftenquoted passage from lord hervey in which the queen’s deathbed is described the grotesque horror of the details surpasses all satire the dreadful humour of the scene is more terrible than swift’s blackest pages or fielding’s fiercest irony the man who wrote the story had something diabolical about him the terrible verses which pope wrote respecting hervey in one of his own moods of almost fiendish malignity i fear are true i am frightened as i look back into the past and fancy i behold that ghastly beautiful face as i think of the queen writhing on her deathbed and crying out “pray—pray”—of the royal old sinner by her side who kisses her dead lips with frantic grief and leaves her to sin more—of the bevy of courtly clergymen and the archbishop whose prayers she rejects and who are obliged for propriety’s sake to shuffle off the anxious inquiries of the public and vow that her majesty quitted this life “in a heavenly frame of mind” what a life—to what ends devoted what a vanity of vanities it is a theme for another pulpit than the lecturer’s for a pulpit—i think the part which pulpits play in the deaths of kings is the most ghastly of all the ceremonial the lying eulogies the blinking of disagreeable truths the sickening flatteries the simulated grief the falsehood and sycophancies—all uttered in the name of heaven in our state churches these monstrous threnodies have been sung from time immemorial over kings and queens good bad wicked licentious the state parson must bring out his commonplaces his apparatus of rhetorical blackhangings dead king or live king the clergyman must flatter him—announce his piety whilst living and when dead perform the obsequies of “our most religious and gracious king”  i read that lady yarmouth my most religious and gracious king’s favourite sold a bishopric to a clergyman for 5000l she betted him 5000l that he would not be made a bishop and he lost and paid her was he the only prelate of his time led up by such hands for consecration as i peep into george ii’s st james’s i see crowds of cassocks rustling up the backstairs of the ladies of the court stealthy clergy slipping purses into their laps that godless old king yawning under his canopy in his chapel royal as the chaplain before him is discoursing discoursing about what—about righteousness and judgement whilst the chaplain is preaching the king is chattering in german almost as loud as the preacher so loud that the clergyman—it may be one dr young he who wrote night thoughts and discoursed on the splendours of the stars the glories of heaven and utter vanities of this world—actually burst out crying in his pulpit because the defender of the faith and dispenser of bishoprics would not listen to him no wonder that the clergy were corrupt and indifferent amidst this indifference and corruption no wonder that sceptics multiplied and morals degenerated so far as they depended on the influence of such a king no wonder that whitfield cried out in the wilderness that wesley quitted the insulted temple to pray on the hillside i look with reverence on those men at that time which is the sublimer spectacle—the good john wesley surrounded by his congregation of miners at the pit’s mouth or the queen’s chaplains mumbling through their morning office in their anteroom under the picture of the great venus with the door opened into the adjoining chamber where the queen is dressing talking scandal to lord hervey or uttering sneers at lady suffolk who is kneeling with the basin at her mistress’s side i say i am scared as i look round at this society—at this king at these courtiers at these politicians at these bishops—at this flaunting vice and levity whereabouts in this court is the honest man where is the pure person one may like the air stifles one with its sickly perfumes there are some oldworld follies and some absurd ceremonials about our court of the present day which i laugh at but as an englishman contrasting it with the past shall i not acknowledge the change of today as the mistress of st james’s passes me now i salute the sovereign wise moderate exemplary of life the good mother the good wife the accomplished lady the enlightened friend of art the tender sympathizer in her people’s glories and sorrows  of all the court of george and caroline i find no one but lady suffolk with whom it seems pleasant and kindly to hold converse even the misogynist croker who edited her letters loves her and has that regard for her with which her sweet graciousness seems to have inspired almost all men and some women who came near her i have noted many little traits which go to prove the charms of her character it is not merely because she is charming but because she is characteristic that i allude to her she writes delightfully sober letters addressing mr gay at tunbridge he was you know a poet penniless and in disgrace she says “the place you are in has strangely filled your head with physicians and cures but take my word for it many a fine lady has gone there to drink the waters without being sick and many a man has complained of the loss of his heart who had it in his own possession i desire you will keep yours for i shall not be very fond of a friend without one and i have a great mind you should be in the number of mine”  when lord peterborough was seventy years old that indomitable youth addressed some flaming love or rather gallantry letters to mrs howard—curious relics they are of the romantic manner of wooing sometimes in use in those days it is not passion it is not love it is gallantry a mixture of earnest and acting highflown compliments profound bows vows sighs and ogles in the manner of the clelie romances and millamont and doricourt in the comedy there was a vast elaboration of ceremonies and etiquette of raptures—a regulated form for kneeling and wooing which has quite passed out of our downright manners henrietta howard accepted the noble old earl’s philandering answered the queer loveletters with due acknowledgement made a profound curtsey to peterborough’s profound bow and got john gay to help her in the composition of her letters in reply to her old knight he wrote her charming verses in which there was truth as well as grace “o wonderful creature” he writes—       o wonderful creature a woman of reason     never grave out of pride never gay out of season     when so easy to guess who this angel should be     who would think mrs howard ne’er dreamt it was she   the great mr pope also celebrated her in lines not less pleasant and painted a portrait of what must certainly have been a delightful lady—       i know a thing that’s most uncommon—       envy be silent and attend—     i know a reasonable woman       handsome yet witty and a friend      not warp’d by passion aw’d by rumour       not grave through pride or gay through folly     an equal mixture of good humour       and exquisite soft melancholy      has she no faults then envy says sir       yes she has one i must aver—     when all the world conspires to praise her       the woman’s deaf and does not hear   even the women concurred in praising and loving her the duchess of queensberry bears testimony to her amiable qualities and writes to her “i tell you so and so because you love children and to have children love you” the beautiful jolly mary bellenden represented by contemporaries as “the most perfect creature ever known” writes very pleasantly to her “dear howard” her “dear swiss” from the country whither mary had retired after her marriage and when she gave up being a maid of honour “how do you do mrs howard” mary breaks out “how do you do mrs howard that is all i have to say this afternoon i am taken with a fit of writing but as to matter i have nothing better to entertain you than news of my farm i therefore give you the following list of the stock of eatables that i am fatting for my private tooth it is well known to the whole county of kent that i have four fat calves two fat hogs fit for killing twelve promising black pigs two young chickens three fine geese with thirteen eggs under each several being duckeggs else the others do not come to maturity all this with rabbits and pigeons and carp in plenty beef and mutton at reasonable rates now howard if you have a mind to stick a knife into anything i have named say so”  a jolly set must they have been those maids of honour pope introduces us to a whole bevy of them in a pleasant letter “i went” he says “by water to hampton court and met the prince with all his ladies on horseback coming from hunting mrs bellenden and mrs lepell took me into protection contrary to the laws against harbouring papists and gave me a dinner with something i liked better an opportunity of conversation with mrs howard we all agreed that the life of a maid of honour was of all things the most miserable and wished that all women who envied it had a specimen of it to eat westphalia ham of a morning ride over hedges and ditches on borrowed hacks come home in the heat of the day with a fever and what is worse a hundred times with a red mark on the forehead from an uneasy hat—all this may qualify them to make excellent wives for hunters as soon as they wipe off the heat of the day they must simper an hour and catch cold in the princess’s apartment from thence to dinner with what appetite they may and after that till midnight work walk or think which way they please no lone house in wales with a mountain and rookery is more contemplative than this court miss lepell walked with me three or four hours by moonlight and we met no creature of any quality but the king who gave audience to the vicechamberlain all alone under the garden wall”  i fancy it was a merrier england that of our ancestors than the island which we inhabit people high and low amused themselves very much more i have calculated the manner in which statesmen and persons of condition passed their time—and what with drinking and dining and supping and cards wonder how they got through their business at all they played all sorts of games which with the exception of cricket and tennis have quite gone out of our manners now in the old prints of st james’s park you still see the marks along the walk to note the balls when the court played at mall fancy birdcage walk now so laid out and lord john and lord palmerston knocking balls up and down the avenue most of those jolly sports belong to the past and the good old games of england are only to be found in old novels in old ballads or the columns of dingy old newspapers which say how a main of cocks is to be fought at winchester between the winchester men and the hampton men or how the cornwall men and the devon men are going to hold a great wrestling match at totnes and so on  a hundred and twenty years ago there were not only country towns in england but people who inhabited them we were very much more gregarious we were amused by very simple pleasures every town had its fair every village its wake the old poets have sung a hundred jolly ditties about great cudgelplayings famous grinning through horsecollars great maypole meetings and morrisdances the girls used to run races clad in very light attire and the kind gentry and good parsons thought no shame in looking on dancing bears went about the country with pipe and tabor certain wellknown tunes were sung all over the land for hundreds of years and high and low rejoiced in that simple music gentlemen who wished to entertain their female friends constantly sent for a band when beau fielding a mighty fine gentleman was courting the lady whom he married he treated her and her companion at his lodgings to a supper from the tavern and after supper they sent out for a fiddler—three of them fancy the three in a great wainscoted room in covent garden or soho lighted by two or three candles in silver sconces some grapes and a bottle of florence wine on the table and the honest fiddler playing old tunes in quaint old minor keys as the beau takes out one lady after the other and solemnly dances with her  the very great folks young noblemen with their governors and the like went abroad and made the great tour the home satirists jeered at the frenchified and italian ways which they brought back but the greater number of people never left the country the jolly squire often had never been twenty miles from home those who did go went to the baths to harrogate or scarborough or bath or epsom old letters are full of these places of pleasure gay writes to us about the fiddlers at tunbridge of the ladies having merry little private balls amongst themselves and the gentlemen entertaining them by turns with tea and music one of the young beauties whom he met did not care for tea “we have a young lady here” he says “that is very particular in her desires i have known some young ladies who if ever they prayed would ask for some equipage or title a husband or matadores but this lady who is but seventeen and has 30000l to her fortune places all her wishes on a pot of good ale when her friends for the sake of her shape and complexion would dissuade her from it she answers with the truest sincerity that by the loss of shape and complexion she could only lose a husband whereas ale is her passion”  every country town had its assemblyroom—mouldy old tenements which we may still see in deserted innyards in decayed provincial cities out of which the great wen of london has sucked all the life york at assize time and throughout the winter harboured a large society of northern gentry shrewsbury was celebrated for its festivities at newmarket i read of “a vast deal of good company besides rogues and blacklegs” at norwich of two assemblies with a prodigious crowd in the hall the rooms and the gallery in cheshire it is a maid of honour of queen caroline who writes and who is longing to be back at hampton court and the fun there i peep into a country house and see a very merry party “we meet in the workroom before nine eat and break a joke or two till twelve then we repair to our own chambers and make ourselves ready for it cannot be called dressing at noon the great bell fetches us into a parlour adorned with all sorts of fine arms poisoned darts several pair of old boots and shoes worn by men of might with the stirrups of king charles i taken from him at edgehill”—and there they have their dinner after which comes dancing and supper  as for bath all history went and bathed and drank there george ii and his queen prince frederick and his court scarce a character one can mention of the early last century but was seen in that famous pumproom where beau nash presided and his picture hung between the busts of newton and pope       this picture placed these busts between       gives satire all its strength     wisdom and wit are little seen       but folly at full length   i should like to have seen the folly it was a splendid embroidered beruffled snuffboxed redheeled impertinent folly and knew how to make itself respected i should like to have seen that noble old madcap peterborough in his boots he actually had the audacity to walk about bath in boots with his blue ribbon and stars and a cabbage under each arm and a chicken in his hand which he had been cheapening for his dinner chesterfield came there many a time and gambled for hundreds and grinned through his gout mary wortley was there young and beautiful and mary wortley old hideous and snuffy miss chudleigh came there slipping away from one husband and on the lookout for another walpole passed many a day there sickly supercilious absurdly dandified and affected with a brilliant wit a delightful sensibility and for his friends a most tender generous and faithful heart and if you and i had been alive then and strolling down milsom street—hush we should have taken our hats off as an awful long lean gaunt figure swathed in flannels passed by in its chair and a livid face looked out from the window—great fierce eyes staring from under a bushy powdered wig a terrible frown a terrible roman nose—and we whisper to one another “there he is there’s the great commoner there is mr pitt” as we walk away the abbey bells are set aringing and we meet our testy friend toby smollett on the arm of james quin the actor who tells us that the bells ring for mr bullock an eminent cowkeeper from tottenham who has just arrived to drink the waters and toby shakes his cane at the door of colonel ringworm—the creole gentleman’s lodgings next his own—where the colonel’s two negroes are practising on the french horn  when we try to recall social england we must fancy it playing at cards for many hours every day the custom is wellnigh gone out among us now but fifty years ago was general fifty years before that almost universal in the country “gaming has become so much the fashion” writes seymour the author of the court gamester “that he who in company should be ignorant of the games in vogue would be reckoned lowbred and hardly fit for conversation” there were cards everywhere it was considered illbred to read in company “books were not fit articles for drawingrooms” old ladies used to say people were jealous as it were and angry with them you will find in hervey that george ii was always furious at the sight of books and his queen who loved reading had to practise it in secret in her closet but cards were the resource of all the world every night for hours kings and queens of england sat down and handled their majesties of spades and diamonds in european courts i believe the practice still remains not for gambling but for pastime our ancestors generally adopted it “books prithee don’t talk to me about books” said old sarah marlborough “the only books i know are men and cards” “dear old sir roger de coverley sent all his tenants a string of hogs’ puddings and a pack of cards at christmas” says the spectator wishing to depict a kind landlord one of the good old lady writers in whose letters i have been dipping cries out “sure cards have kept us women from a great deal of scandal” wise old johnson regretted that he had not learnt to play “it is very useful in life” he says “it generates kindness and consolidates society” david hume never went to bed without his whist we have walpole in one of his letters in a transport of gratitude for the cards “i shall build an order to pam” says he in his pleasant dandified way “for the escape of my charming duchess of grafton” the duchess had been playing cards at rome when she ought to have been at a cardinal’s concert where the floor fell in and all the monsignors were precipitated into the cellar even the nonconformist clergy looked not unkindly on the practice “i do not think” says one of them “that honest martin luther committed sin by playing at backgammon for an hour or two after dinner in order by unbending his mind to promote digestion” as for the high church parsons they all played bishops and all on twelfth day the court used to play in state “this being twelfth day his majesty the prince of wales and the knights companions of the garter thistle and bath appeared in the collars of their respective orders their majesties the prince of wales and three eldest princesses went to the chapel royal preceded by the heralds the duke of manchester carried the sword of state the king and prince made offering at the altar of gold frankincense and myrrh according to the annual custom at night their majesties played at hazard with the nobility for the benefit of the groomporter and ’twas said the king won 600 guineas the queen 360 princess amelia twenty princess caroline ten the duke of grafton and the earl of portmore several thousands”  let us glance at the same chronicle which is of the year 1731 and see how others of our forefathers were engaged  “cork 15th january—this day one tim croneen was for the murder and robbery of mr st leger and his wife sentenced to be hanged two minutes then his head to be cut off and his body divided in four quarters to be placed in four crossways he was servant to mr st leger and committed the murder with the privity of the servantmaid who was sentenced to be burned also of the gardener whom he knocked on the head to deprive him of his share of the booty”  “january 3—a postboy was shot by an irish gentleman on the road near stone in staffordshire who died in two days for which the gentleman was imprisoned”  “a poor man was found hanging in a gentleman’s stables at bungay in norfolk by a person who cut him down and running for assistance left his penknife behind him the poor man recovering cut his throat with the knife and a river being nigh jumped into it but company coming he was dragged out alive and was like to remain so”  “the honourable thomas finch brother to the earl of nottingham is appointed ambassador at the hague in the room of the earl of chesterfield who is on his return home”  “william cowper esq and the rev mr john cowper chaplain in ordinary to her majesty and rector of great berkhampstead in the county of hertford are appointed clerks of the commissioners of bankruptcy”  “charles creagh esq and —— macnamara esq between whom an old grudge of three years had subsisted which had occasioned their being bound over about fifty times for breaking the peace meeting in company with mr eyres of galloway they discharged their pistols and all three were killed on the spot—to the great joy of their peaceful neighbours say the irish papers”  “wheat is 26s to 28s and barley 20s to 22s a quarter three per cents 92 best loaf sugar 914d bohea 12s to 14s pekoe 18s and hyson 35s per pound”  “at exon was celebrated with great magnificence the birthday of the son of sir w courtney bart at which more than 1000 persons were present a bullock was roasted whole a butt of wine and several tuns of beer and cider were given to the populace at the same time sir william delivered to his son then of age powdram castle and a great estate”  “charlesworth and cox two solicitors convicted of forgery stood on the pillory at the royal exchange the first was severely handled by the populace but the other was very much favoured and protected by six or seven fellows who got on the pillory to protect him from the insults of the mob”  “a boy killed by falling upon iron spikes from a lamppost which he climbed to see mother needham stand in the pillory”  “mary lynn was burned to ashes at the stake for being concerned in the murder of her mistress”  “alexander russell the foot soldier who was capitally convicted for a street robbery in january sessions was reprieved for transportation but having an estate fallen to him obtained a free pardon”  “the lord john russell married to the lady diana spencer at marlborough house he has a fortune of 30000l down and is to have 100000l at the death of the duchess dowager of marlborough his grandmother”  “march 1 being the anniversary of the queen’s birthday when her majesty entered the fortyninth year of her age there was a splendid appearance of nobility at st james’s her majesty was magnificently dressed and wore a flowered muslin headedging as did also her royal highness the lord portmore was said to have had the richest dress though an italian count had twentyfour diamonds instead of buttons”  new clothes on the birthday were the fashion for all loyal people swift mentions the custom several times walpole is constantly speaking of it laughing at the practice but having the very finest clothes from paris nevertheless if the king and queen were unpopular there were very few new clothes at the drawingroom in a paper in the true patriot no 3 written to attack the pretender the scotch french and popery fielding supposes the scotch and the pretender in possession of london and himself about to be hanged for loyalty—when just as the rope is round his neck he says “my little girl entered my bedchamber and put an end to my dream by pulling open my eyes and telling me that the tailor had just brought home my clothes for his majesty’s birthday” in his temple beau the beau is dunned for a birthday suit of velvet 40l be sure that mr harry fielding was dunned too  the public days no doubt were splendid but the private court life must have been awfully wearisome “i will not trouble you” writes hervey to lady sundon “with any account of our occupations at hampton court no millhorse ever went in a more constant track or a more unchanging circle so that by the assistance of an almanac for the day of the week and a watch for the hour of the day you may inform yourself fully without any other intelligence but your memory of every transaction within the verge of the court walking chaises levées and audiences fill the morning at night the king plays at commerce and backgammon and the queen at quadrille where poor lady charlotte runs her usual nightly gauntlet the queen pulling her hood and the princess royal rapping her knuckles the duke of grafton takes his nightly opiate of lottery and sleeps as usual between the princesses amelia and caroline lord grantham strolls from one room to another as dryden says like some discontented ghost that oft appears and is forbid to speak and stirs himself about as people stir a fire not with any design but in hopes to make it burn brisker at last the king gets up the pool finishes and everybody has their dismission their majesties retire to lady charlotte and my lord lifford my lord grantham to lady frances and mr clark some to supper some to bed and thus the evening and the morning make the day”  the king’s fondness for hanover occasioned all sorts of rough jokes among his english subjects to whom sauerkraut and sausages have ever been ridiculous objects when our present prince consort came among us the people bawled out songs in the streets indicative of the absurdity of germany in general the sausageshops produced enormous sausages which we might suppose were the daily food and delight of german princes i remember the caricatures at the marriage of prince leopold with the princess charlotte the bridegroom was drawn in rags george iii’s wife was called by the people a beggarly german duchess the british idea being that all princes were beggarly except british princes king george paid us back he thought there were no manners out of germany sarah marlborough once coming to visit the princess whilst her royal highness was whipping one of the roaring royal children “ah” says george who was standing by “you have no good manners in england because you are not properly brought up when you are young” he insisted that no english cooks could roast no english coachman could drive he actually questioned the superiority of our nobility our horses and our roast beef  whilst he was away from his beloved hanover everything remained there exactly as in the prince’s presence there were 800 horses in the stables there was all the apparatus of chamberlains courtmarshals and equerries and court assemblies were held every saturday where all the nobility of hanover assembled at what i can’t but think a fine and touching ceremony a large armchair was placed in the assemblyroom and on it the king’s portrait the nobility advanced and made a bow to the armchair and to the image which nebuchadnezzar the king had set up and spoke under their voices before the august picture just as they would have done had the king churfürst been present himself  he was always going back to hanover in the year 1729 he went for two whole years during which caroline reigned for him in england and he was not in the least missed by his british subjects he went again in ’35 and ’36 and between the years 1740 and 1755 was no less than eight times on the continent which amusement he was obliged to give up at the outbreak of the seven years’ war here every day’s amusement was the same “our life is as uniform as that of a monastery” writes a courtier whom vehse quotes “every morning at eleven and every evening at six we drive in the heat to herrenhausen through an enormous linden avenue and twice a day cover our coats and coaches with dust in the king’s society there never is the least change at table and at cards he sees always the same faces and at the end of the game retires into his chamber twice a week there is a french theatre the other days there is play in the gallery in this way were the king always to stop in hanover one could make a ten years’ calendar of his proceedings and settle beforehand what his time of business meals and pleasure would be”  the old pagan kept his promise to his dying wife lady yarmouth was now in full favour and treated with profound respect by the hanover society though it appears rather neglected in england when she came among us in 1740 a couple of the king’s daughters went to see him at hanover anna the princess of orange about whom and whose husband and marriageday walpole and hervey have left us the most ludicrous descriptions and maria of hessecassel with their respective lords this made the hanover court very brilliant in honour of his high guests the king gave several fêtes among others a magnificent masked ball in the green theatre at herrenhausen—the garden theatre with linden and box for screen and grass for a carpet where the platens had danced to george and his father the late sultan the stage and a great part of the garden were illuminated with coloured lamps almost the whole court appeared in white dominos “like” says the describer of the scene “like spirits in the elysian fields at night supper was served in the gallery with three great tables and the king was very merry after supper dancing was resumed and i did not get home till five o’clock by full daylight to hanover some days afterwards we had in the operahouse at hanover a great assembly the king appeared in a turkish dress his turban was ornamented with a magnificent agraffe of diamonds the lady yarmouth was dressed as a sultana nobody was more beautiful than the princess of hesse” so while poor caroline was resting in her coffin dapper little george with his red face and his white eyebrows and goggleeyes at sixty years of age is dancing a pretty dance with madame walmoden and capering about dressed up like a turk for twenty years more that little old bajazet went on in this turkish fashion until the fit came which choked the old man when he ordered the side of his coffin to be taken out as well as that of poor caroline’s who had preceded him so that his sinful old bones and ashes might mingle with those of the faithful creature o strutting turkeycock of herrenhausen o naughty little mahomet in what turkish paradise are you now and where be your painted houris so countess yarmouth appeared as a sultana and his majesty in a turkish dress wore an agraffe of diamonds and was very merry was he friends he was your fathers’ king as well as mine—let us drop a respectful tear over his grave  he said of his wife that he never knew a woman who was worthy to buckle her shoe he would sit alone weeping before her portrait and when he had dried his eyes he would go off to his walmoden and talk of her on the 25th day of october 1760 he being then in the seventyseventh year of his age and the thirtyfourth of his reign his page went to take him his royal chocolate and behold the most religious and gracious king was lying dead on the floor they went and fetched walmoden but walmoden could not wake him the sacred majesty was but a lifeless corpse the king was dead god save the king but of course poets and clergymen decorously bewailed the late one here are some artless verses in which an english divine deplored the famous departed hero and over which you may cry or you may laugh exactly as your humour suits—       while at his feet expiring faction lay     no contest left but who should best obey     saw in his offspring all himself renewed     the same fair path of glory still pursued     saw to young george augusta’s care impart     whate’er could raise and humanize the heart     blend all his grandsire’s virtues with his own     and form their mingled radiance for the throne—     no farther blessing could on earth be given—     the next degree of happiness was—heaven   if he had been good if he had been just if he had been pure in life and wise in council could the poet have said much more it was a parson who came and wept over this grave with walmoden sitting on it and claimed heaven for the poor old man slumbering below here was one who had neither dignity learning morals nor wit—who tainted a great society by a bad example who in youth manhood old age was gross low and sensual and mr porteus afterwards my lord bishop porteus says the earth was not good enough for him and that his only place was heaven bravo mr porteus the divine who wept these tears over george ii’s memory wore george iii’s lawn i don’t know whether people still admire his poetry or his sermons    george the third   we have to glance over sixty years in as many minutes to read the mere catalogue of characters who figured during that long period would occupy our allotted time and we should have all text and no sermon england has to undergo the revolt of the american colonies to submit to defeat and separation to shake under the volcano of the french revolution to grapple and fight for the life with her gigantic enemy napoleon to gasp and rally after that tremendous struggle the old society with its courtly splendours has to pass away generations of statesmen to rise and disappear pitt to follow chatham to the tomb the memory of rodney and wolfe to be superseded by nelson’s and wellington’s glory the old poets who unite us to queen anne’s time to sink into their graves johnson to die and scott and byron to arise garrick to delight the world with his dazzling dramatic genius and kean to leap on the stage and take possession of the astonished theatre steam has to be invented kings to be beheaded banished deposed restored napoleon to be but an episode and george iii is to be alive through all these varied changes to accompany his people through all these revolutions of thought government society to survive out of the old world into ours  when i first saw england she was in mourning for the young princess charlotte the hope of the empire i came from india as a child and our ship touched at an island on the way home where my black servant took me a long walk over rocks and hills until we reached a garden where we saw a man walking “that is he” said the black man “that is bonaparte he eats three sheep every day and all the little children he can lay hands on” there were people in the british dominions besides that poor calcutta servingman with an equal horror of the corsican ogre  with the same childish attendant i remember peeping through the colonnade at carlton house and seeing the abode of the great prince regent i can see yet the guards pacing before the gates of the place the place what place the palace exists no more than the palace of nebuchadnezzar it is but a name now where be the sentries who used to salute as the royal chariots drove in and out the chariots with the kings inside have driven to the realms of pluto the tall guards have marched into darkness and the echoes of their drums are rolling in hades where the palace once stood a hundred little children are paddling up and down the steps to st james’s park a score of grave gentlemen are taking their tea at the athenaeum club as many grizzly warriors are garrisoning the united service club opposite pall mall is the great social exchange of london now—the mart of news of politics of scandal of rumour—the english forum so to speak where men discuss the last dispatch from the crimea the last speech of lord derby the next move of lord john and now and then to a few antiquarians whose thoughts are with the past rather than with the present it is a memorial of old times and old people and pall mall is our palmyra look about this spot tom of ten thousand was killed by königsmarck’s gang in that great red house gainsborough lived and culloden cumberland george iii’s uncle yonder is sarah marlborough’s palace just as it stood when that termagant occupied it at 25 walter scott used to live at the house now no 79 and occupied by the society for the propagation of the gospel in foreign parts resided mrs eleanor gwynn comedian  how often has queen caroline’s chair issued from under yonder arch all the men of the georges have passed up and down the street it has seen walpole’s chariot and chatham’s sedan and fox gibbon sheridan on their way to brookes’s and stately william pitt stalking on the arm of dundas and hanger and tom sheridan reeling out of raggett’s and byron limping into wattier’s and swift striding out of bury street and mr addison and dick steele both perhaps a little the better for liquor and the prince of wales and the duke of york clattering over the pavement and johnson counting the posts along the streets after dawdling before dodsley’s window and horry walpole hobbling into his carriage with a gimcrack just bought out at christie’s and george selwyn sauntering into white’s  in the published letters to george selwyn we get a mass of correspondence by no means so brilliant and witty as walpole’s or so bitter and bright as hervey’s but as interesting and even more descriptive of the time because the letters are the work of many hands you hear more voices speaking as it were and more natural than horace’s dandified treble and sporus’s malignant whisper as one reads the selwyn letters—as one looks at reynolds’s noble pictures illustrative of those magnificent times and voluptuous people—one almost hears the voice of the dead past the laughter and the chorus the toast called over the brimming cups the shout at the racecourse or the gamingtable the merry joke frankly spoken to the laughing fine lady how fine those ladies were those ladies who heard and spoke such coarse jokes how grand those gentlemen  i fancy that peculiar product of the past the fine gentleman has almost vanished off the face of the earth and is disappearing like the beaver or the red indian we can’t have fine gentlemen any more because we can’t have the society in which they lived the people will not obey the parasites will not be as obsequious as formerly children do not go down on their knees to beg their parents’ blessing chaplains do not say grace and retire before the pudding servants do not say “your honour” and “your worship” at every moment tradesmen do not stand hat in hand as the gentleman passes authors do not wait for hours in gentlemen’s anterooms with a fulsome dedication for which they hope to get five guineas from his lordship in the days when there were fine gentlemen mr secretary pitt’s undersecretaries did not dare to sit down before him but mr pitt in his turn went down on his gouty knees to george ii and when george iii spoke a few kind words to him lord chatham burst into tears of reverential joy and gratitude so awful was the idea of the monarch and so great the distinctions of rank fancy lord john russell or lord palmerston on their knees whilst the sovereign was reading a dispatch or beginning to cry because prince albert said something civil  at the accession of george iii the patricians were yet at the height of their good fortune society recognized their superiority which they themselves pretty calmly took for granted they inherited not only titles and estates and seats in the house of peers but seats in the house of commons there were a multitude of government places and not merely these but bribes of actual 500l notes which members of the house took not much shame in assuming fox went into parliament at 20 pitt was just of age his father not much older it was the good time for patricians small blame to them if they took and enjoyed and overenjoyed the prizes of politics the pleasures of social life  in these letters to selwyn we are made acquainted with a whole society of these defunct fine gentlemen and can watch with a curious interest a life which the novelwriters of that time i think have scarce touched upon to smollett to fielding even a lord was a lord a gorgeous being with a blue ribbon a coroneted chair and an immense star on his bosom to whom commoners paid reverence richardson a man of humbler birth than either of the above two owned that he was ignorant regarding the manners of the aristocracy and besought mrs donnellan a lady who had lived in the great world to examine a volume of sir charles grandison and point out any errors which she might see in this particular mrs donnellan found so many faults that richardson changed colour shut up the book and muttered that it were best to throw it in the fire here in selwyn we have the real original men and women of fashion of the early time of george iii we can follow them to the new club at almack’s we can travel over europe with them we can accompany them not only to the public places but to their countryhouses and private society here is a whole company of them wits and prodigals some persevering in their bad ways some repentant but relapsing beautiful ladies parasites humble chaplains led captains those fair creatures whom we love in reynolds’s portraits and who still look out on us from his canvases with their sweet calm faces and gracious smiles—those fine gentlemen who did us the honour to govern us who inherited their boroughs took their ease in their patent places and slipped lord north’s bribes so elegantly under their ruffles—we make acquaintance with a hundred of these fine folks hear their talk and laughter read of their loves quarrels intrigues debts duels divorces can fancy them alive if we read the book long enough we can attend at duke hamilton’s wedding and behold him marry his bride with the curtainring we can peep into her poor sister’s deathbed we can see charles fox cursing over the cards or march bawling out the odds at newmarket we can imagine burgoyne tripping off from st james’s street to conquer the americans and slinking back into the club somewhat crestfallen after his beating we can see the young king dressing himself for the drawingroom and asking ten thousand questions regarding all the gentlemen we can have high life or low the struggle at the opera to behold the violetta or the zamperini—the macaronis and fine ladies in their chairs trooping to the masquerade or madame cornelys’s—the crowd at drury lane to look at the body of miss ray whom parson hackman has just pistolled—or we can peep into newgate where poor mr rice the forger is waiting his fate and his supper “you need not be particular about the sauce for his fowl” says one turnkey to another “for you know he is to be hanged in the morning” “yes” replies the second janitor “but the chaplain sups with him and he is a terrible fellow for melted butter”  selwyn has a chaplain and parasite one dr warner than whom plautus or ben jonson or hogarth never painted a better character in letter after letter he adds fresh strokes to the portrait of himself and completes a portrait not a little curious to look at now that the man has passed away all the foul pleasures and gambols in which he revelled played out all the rouged faces into which he leered worms and skulls all the fine gentlemen whose shoebuckles he kissed laid in their coffins this worthy clergyman takes care to tell us that he does not believe in his religion though thank heaven he is not so great a rogue as a lawyer he goes on mr selwyn’s errands any errands and is proud he says to be that gentleman’s proveditor he waits upon the duke of queensberry—old q—and exchanges pretty stories with that aristocrat he comes home “after a hard day’s christening” as he says and writes to his patron before sitting down to whist and partridges for supper he revels in the thoughts of oxcheek and burgundy—he is a boisterous uproarious parasite licks his master’s shoes with explosions of laughter and cunning smack and gusto and likes the taste of that blacking as much as the best claret in old q’s cellar he has rabelais and horace at his greasy fingers’ ends he is inexpressibly mean curiously jolly kindly and goodnatured in secret—a tenderhearted knave not a venomous lickspittle jesse says that at his chapel in long acre “he attained a considerable popularity by the pleasing manly and eloquent style of his delivery” was infidelity endemic and corruption in the air around a young king himself of the most exemplary life and undoubted piety lived a court society as dissolute as our country ever knew george ii’s bad morals bore their fruit in george iii’s early years as i believe that a knowledge of that good man’s example his moderation his frugal simplicity and godfearing life tended infinitely to improve the morals of the country and purify the whole nation  after warner the most interesting of selwyn’s correspondents is the earl of carlisle grandfather of the amiable nobleman at present viceroy in ireland the grandfather too was irish viceroy having previously been treasurer of the king’s household and in 1778 the principal commissioner for treating consulting and agreeing upon the means of quieting the divisions subsisting in his majesty’s colonies plantations and possessions in north america you may read his lordship’s manifestos in the royal new york gazette he returned to england having by no means quieted the colonies and speedily afterwards the royal new york gazette somehow ceased to be published  this good clever kind highlybred lord carlisle was one of the english fine gentlemen who were wellnigh ruined by the awful debauchery and extravagance which prevailed in the great english society of those days its dissoluteness was awful it had swarmed over europe after the peace it had danced and raced and gambled in all the courts it had made its bow at versailles it had run its horses on the plain of sablons near paris and created the anglomania there it had exported vast quantities of pictures and marbles from rome and florence it had ruined itself by building great galleries and palaces for the reception of the statues and pictures it had brought over singingwomen and dancingwomen from all the operas of europe on whom my lords lavished their thousands whilst they left their honest wives and honest children languishing in the lonely deserted splendours of the castle and park at home  besides the great london society of those days there was another unacknowledged world extravagant beyond measure tearing about in the pursuit of pleasure dancing gambling drinking singing meeting the real society in the public places at ranelaghs vauxhalls and ridottos about which our old novelists talk so constantly and outvying the real leaders of fashion in luxury and splendour and beauty for instance when the famous miss gunning visited paris as lady coventry where she expected that her beauty would meet with the applause which had followed her and her sister through england it appears she was put to flight by an english lady still more lovely in the eyes of the parisians a certain mrs pitt took a box at the opera opposite the countess and was so much handsomer than her ladyship that the parterre cried out that this was the real english angel whereupon lady coventry quitted paris in a huff the poor thing died presently of consumption accelerated it was said by the red and white paint with which she plastered those luckless charms of hers we must represent to ourselves all fashionable female europe at that time as plastered with white and raddled with red she left two daughters behind her whom george selwyn loved he was curiously fond of little children and who are described very drolly and pathetically in these letters in their little nursery where passionate little lady fanny if she had not good cards flung hers into lady mary’s face and where they sat conspiring how they should receive a new motherinlaw whom their papa presently brought home they got on very well with their motherinlaw who was very kind to them and they grew up and they were married and they were both divorced afterwards—poor little souls poor painted mother poor society ghastly in its pleasures its loves its revelries  as for my lord commissioner we can afford to speak about him because though he was a wild and weak commissioner at one time though he hurt his estate though he gambled and lost ten thousand pounds at a sitting—“five times more” says the unlucky gentleman “than i ever lost before” though he swore he never would touch a card again and yet strange to say went back to the table and lost still more yet he repented of his errors sobered down and became a worthy peer and a good country gentleman and returned to the good wife and the good children whom he had always loved with the best part of his heart he had married at oneandtwenty he found himself in the midst of a dissolute society at the head of a great fortune forced into luxury and obliged to be a great lord and a great idler he yielded to some temptations and paid for them a bitter penalty of manly remorse from some others he fled wisely and ended by conquering them nobly but he always had the good wife and children in his mind and they saved him “i am very glad you did not come to me the morning i left london” he writes to g selwyn as he is embarking for america “i can only say i never knew till that moment of parting what grief was” there is no parting now where they are the faithful wife the kind generous gentleman have left a noble race behind them an inheritor of his name and titles who is beloved as widely as he is known a man most kind accomplished gentle friendly and pure and female descendants occupying high stations and embellishing great names some renowned for beauty and all for spotless lives and pious matronly virtues  another of selwyn’s correspondents is the earl of march afterwards duke of queensberry whose life lasted into this century and who certainly as earl or duke young man or greybeard was not an ornament to any possible society the legends about old q are awful in selwyn in wraxall and contemporary chronicles the observer of human nature may follow him drinking gambling intriguing to the end of his career when the wrinkled palsied toothless old don juan died as wicked and unrepentant as he had been at the hottest season of youth and passion there is a house in piccadilly where they used to show a certain low window at which old q sat to his very last days ogling through his senile glasses the women as they passed by  there must have been a great deal of good about this lazy sleepy george selwyn which no doubt is set to his present credit “your friendship” writes carlisle to him “is so different from anything i have ever met with or seen in the world that when i recollect the extraordinary proofs of your kindness it seems to me like a dream” “i have lost my oldest friend and acquaintance g selwyn” writes walpole to miss berry “i really loved him not only for his infinite wit but for a thousand good qualities” i am glad for my part that such a lover of cakes and ale should have had a thousand good qualities—that he should have been friendly generous warmhearted trustworthy “i rise at six” writes carlisle to him from spa a great resort of fashionable people in our ancestors’ days “play at cricket till dinner and dance in the evening till i can scarcely crawl to bed at eleven there is a life for you you get up at nine play with raton your dog till twelve in your dressinggown then creep down to white’s are five hours at table sleep till suppertime and then make two wretches carry you in a sedanchair with three pints of claret in you three miles for a shilling” occasionally instead of sleeping at white’s george went down and snoozed in the house of commons by the side of lord north he represented gloucester for many years and had a borough of his own ludgershall for which when he was too lazy to contest gloucester he sat himself “i have given directions for the election of ludgershall to be of lord melbourne and myself” he writes to the premier whose friend he was and who was himself as sleepy as witty and as goodnatured as george  if in looking at the lives of princes courtiers men of rank and fashion we must perforce depict them as idle profligate and criminal we must make allowances for the rich men’s failings and recollect that we too were very likely indolent and voluptuous had we no motive for work a mortal’s natural taste for pleasure and the daily temptation of a large income what could a great peer with a great castle and park and a great fortune do but be splendid and idle in these letters of lord carlisle’s from which i have been quoting there is many a just complaint made by the kindhearted young nobleman of the state which he is obliged to keep the magnificence in which he must live the idleness to which his position as a peer of england bound him better for him had he been a lawyer at his desk or a clerk in his office—a thousand times better chance for happiness education employment security from temptation a few years since the profession of arms was the only one which our nobles could follow the church the bar medicine literature the arts commerce were below them it is to the middle class we must look for the safety of england the working educated men away from lord north’s bribery in the senate the good clergy not corrupted into parasites by hopes of preferment the tradesmen rising into manly opulence the painters pursuing their gentle calling the men of letters in their quiet studies these are the men whom we love and like to read of in the last age how small the grandees and the men of pleasure look beside them how contemptible the story of the george iii court squabbles are beside the recorded talk of dear old johnson what is the grandest entertainment at windsor compared to a night at the club over its modest cups with percy and langton and goldsmith and poor bozzy at the table i declare i think of all the polite men of that age joshua reynolds was the finest gentleman and they were good as well as witty and wise those dear old friends of the past their minds were not debauched by excess or effeminate with luxury they toiled their noble day’s labour they rested and took their kindly pleasure they cheered their holiday meetings with generous wit and hearty interchange of thought they were no prudes but no blush need follow their conversation they were merry but no riot came out of their cups ah i would have liked a night at the “turk’s head” even though bad news had arrived from the colonies and doctor johnson was growling against the rebels to have sat with him and goldy and to have heard burke the finest talker in the world and to have had garrick flashing in with a story from his theatre—i like i say to think of that society and not merely how pleasant and how wise but how good they were i think it was on going home one night from the club that edmund burke—his noble soul full of great thoughts be sure for they never left him his heart full of gentleness—was accosted by a poor wandering woman to whom he spoke words of kindness and moved by the tears of this magdalen perhaps having caused them by the good words he spoke to her he took her home to the house of his wife and children and never left her until he had found the means of restoring her to honesty and labour o you fine gentlemen you marches and selwyns and chesterfields how small you look by the side of these great men goodnatured carlisle plays at cricket all day and dances in the evening “till he can scarcely crawl” gaily contrasting his superior virtue with george selwyn’s “carried to bed by two wretches at midnight with three pints of claret in him” do you remember the verses—the sacred verses—which johnson wrote on the death of his humble friend levett       well tried through many a varying year       see levett to the grave descend     officious innocent sincere       of every friendless name the friend      in misery’s darkest cavern known       his useful care was ever nigh     where hopeless anguish poured the groan       and lonely want retired to die      no summons mocked by chill delay       no petty gain disdained by pride     the modest wants of every day       the toil of every day supplied      his virtues walked their narrow round       nor made a pause nor left a void     and sure the eternal master found       his single talent well employed   whose name looks the brightest now that of queensberry the wealthy duke or selwyn the wit or levett the poor physician  i hold old johnson and shall we not pardon james boswell some errors for embalming him for us to be the great supporter of the british monarchy and church during the last age—better than whole benches of bishops better than pitts norths and the great burke himself johnson had the ear of the nation his immense authority reconciled it to loyalty and shamed it out of irreligion when george iii talked with him and the people heard the great author’s good opinion of the sovereign whole generations rallied to the king johnson was revered as a sort of oracle and the oracle declared for church and king what a humanity the old man had he was a kindly partaker of all honest pleasures a fierce foe to all sin but a gentle enemy to all sinners “what boys are you for a frolic” he cries when topham beauclerc comes and wakes him up at midnight “i’m with you” and away he goes tumbles on his homely old clothes and trundles through covent garden with the young fellows when he used to frequent garrick’s theatre and had “the liberty of the scenes” he says “all the actresses knew me and dropped me a curtsy as they passed to the stage” that would make a pretty picture it is a pretty picture in my mind of youth folly gaiety tenderly surveyed by wisdom’s merciful pure eyes  george iii and his queen lived in a very unpretending but elegantlooking house on the site of the hideous pile under which his granddaughter at present reposes the king’s mother inhabited carlton house which contemporary prints represent with a perfect paradise of a garden with trim lawns green arcades and vistas of classic statues she admired these in company with my lord bute who had a fine classic taste and sometimes counsel took and sometimes tea in the pleasant green arbours along with that polite nobleman bute was hated with a rage of which there have been few examples in english history he was the butt for everybody’s abuse for wilkes’s devilish mischief for churchill’s slashing satire for the hooting of the mob that roasted the boot his emblem in a thousand bonfires that hated him because he was a favourite and a scotchman calling him “mortimer” “lothario” i know not what names and accusing his royal mistress of all sorts of crimes—the grave lean demure elderly woman who i dare say was quite as good as her neighbours chatham lent the aid of his great malice to influence the popular sentiment against her he assailed in the house of lords “the secret influence more mighty than the throne itself which betrayed and clogged every administration” the most furious pamphlets echoed the cry “impeach the king’s mother” was scribbled over every wall at the court end of the town walpole tells us what had she done what had frederick prince of wales george’s father done that he was so loathed by george ii and never mentioned by george iii let us not seek for stones to batter that forgotten grave but acquiesce in the contemporary epitaph over him—       here lies fred     who was alive and is dead     had it been his father     i had much rather     had it been his brother     still better than another     had it been his sister     no one would have missed her     had it been the whole generation     still better for the nation     but since ’tis only fred     who was alive and is dead     there’s no more to be said   the widow with eight children round her prudently reconciled herself with the king and won the old man’s confidence and goodwill a shrewd hard domineering narrowminded woman she educated her children according to her lights and spoke of the eldest as a dull good boy she kept him very close she held the tightest rein over him she had curious prejudices and bigotries his uncle the burly cumberland taking down a sabre once and drawing it to amuse the child—the boy started back and turned pale the prince felt a generous shock “what must they have told him about me” he asked  his mother’s bigotry and hatred he inherited with the courageous obstinacy of his own race but he was a firm believer where his fathers had been freethinkers and a true and fond supporter of the church of which he was the titular defender like other dull men the king was all his life suspicious of superior people he did not like fox he did not like reynolds he did not like nelson chatham burke he was testy at the idea of all innovations and suspicious of all innovators he loved mediocrities benjamin west was his favourite painter beattie was his poet the king lamented not without pathos in his afterlife that his education had been neglected he was a dull lad brought up by narrowminded people the cleverest tutors in the world could have done little probably to expand that small intellect though they might have improved his tastes and taught his perceptions some generosity  but he admired as well as he could there is little doubt that a letter written by the little princess charlotte of mecklenburgstrelitz—a letter containing the most feeble commonplaces about the horrors of war and the most trivial remarks on the blessings of peace struck the young monarch greatly and decided him upon selecting the young princess as the sharer of his throne i pass over the stories of his juvenile loves—of hannah lightfoot the quaker to whom they say he was actually married though i don’t know who has ever seen the register—of lovely blackhaired sarah lennox about whose beauty walpole has written in raptures and who used to lie in wait for the young prince and make hay at him on the lawn of holland house he sighed and he longed but he rode away from her her picture still hangs in holland house a magnificent masterpiece of reynolds a canvas worthy of titian she looks from the castle window holding a bird in her hand at blackeyed young charles fox her nephew the royal bird flew away from lovely sarah she had to figure as bridesmaid at her little mecklenburg rival’s wedding and died in our own time a quiet old lady who had become the mother of the heroic napiers  they say the little princess who had written the fine letter about the horrors of war—a beautiful letter without a single blot for which she was to be rewarded like the heroine of the old spellingbook story—was at play one day with some of her young companions in the gardens of strelitz and that the young ladies’ conversation was strange to say about husbands “who will take such a poor little princess as me” charlotte said to her friend ida von bulow and at that very moment the postman’s horn sounded and ida said “princess there is the sweetheart” as she said so it actually turned out the postman brought letters from the splendid young king of all england who said “princess because you have written such a beautiful letter which does credit to your head and heart come and be queen of great britain france and ireland and the true wife of your most obedient servant george” so she jumped for joy and went upstairs and packed all her little trunks and set off straightway for her kingdom in a beautiful yacht with a harpsichord on board for her to play upon and around her a beautiful fleet all covered with flags and streamers and the distinguished madame auerbach complimented her with an ode a translation of which may be read in the gentleman’s magazine to the present day—       her gallant navy through the main       now cleaves its liquid way     there to their queen a chosen train       of nymphs due reverence pay      europa when conveyed by jove       to crete’s distinguished shore     greater attention scarce could prove       or be respected more   they met and they were married and for years they led the happiest simplest lives sure ever led by married couple it is said the king winced when he first saw his homely little bride but however that may be he was a true and faithful husband to her as she was a faithful and loving wife they had the simplest pleasures—the very mildest and simplest—little country dances to which a dozen couple were invited and where the honest king would stand up and dance for three hours at a time to one tune after which delicious excitement they would go to bed without any supper the court people grumbling sadly at that absence of supper and get up quite early the next morning and perhaps the next night have another dance or the queen would play on the spinet—she played pretty well haydn said—or the king would read to her a paper out of the spectator or perhaps one of ogden’s sermons o arcadia what a life it must have been there used to be sunday drawingrooms at court but the young king stopped these as he stopped all that godless gambling whereof we have made mention not that george was averse to any innocent pleasures or pleasures which he thought innocent he was a patron of the arts after his fashion kind and gracious to the artists whom he favoured and respectful to their calling he wanted once to establish an order of minerva for literary and scientific characters the knights were to take rank after the knights of the bath and to sport a strawcoloured ribbon and a star of sixteen points but there was such a row amongst the literati as to the persons who should be appointed that the plan was given up and minerva and her star never came down amongst us  he objected to painting st paul’s as popish practice accordingly the most clumsy heathen sculptures decorate that edifice at present it is fortunate that the paintings too were spared for painting and drawing were wofully unsound at the close of the last century and it is far better for our eyes to contemplate whitewash when we turn them away from the clergyman than to look at opie’s pitchy canvases or fuseli’s livid monsters  and yet there is one day in the year—a day when old george loved with all his heart to attend it—when i think st paul’s presents the noblest sight in the whole world when five thousand charity children with cheeks like nosegays and sweet fresh voices sing the hymn which makes every heart thrill with praise and happiness i have seen a hundred grand sights in the world—coronations parisian splendours crystal palace openings pope’s chapels with their processions of longtailed cardinals and quavering choirs of fat soprani—but think in all christendom there is no such sight as charity children’s day non angli sed angeli as one looks at that beautiful multitude of innocents as the first note strikes indeed one may almost fancy that cherubs are singing  of church music the king was always very fond showing skill in it both as a critic and a performer many stories mirthful and affecting are told of his behaviour at the concerts which he ordered when he was blind and ill he chose the music for the ancient concerts once and the music and words which he selected were from samson agonistes and all had reference to his blindness his captivity and his affliction he would beat time with his musicroll as they sang the anthem in the chapel royal if the page below was talkative or inattentive down would come the musicroll on young scapegrace’s powdered head the theatre was always his delight his bishops and clergy used to attend it thinking it no shame to appear where that good man was seen he is said not to have cared for shakespeare or tragedy much farces and pantomimes were his joy and especially when clown swallowed a carrot or a string of sausages he would laugh so outrageously that the lovely princess by his side would have to say “my gracious monarch do compose yourself” but he continued to laugh and at the very smallest farces as long as his poor wits were left him  there is something to me exceedingly touching in that simple early life of the king’s as long as his mother lived—a dozen years after his marriage with the little spinetplayer—he was a great shy awkward boy under the tutelage of that hard parent she must have been a clever domineering cruel woman she kept her household lonely and in gloom mistrusting almost all people who came about her children seeing the young duke of gloucester silent and unhappy once she sharply asked him the cause of his silence “i am thinking” said the poor child “thinking sir and of what” “i am thinking if ever i have a son i will not make him so unhappy as you make me” the other sons were all wild except george dutifully every evening george and charlotte paid their visit to the king’s mother at carlton house she had a throat complaint of which she died but to the last persisted in driving about the streets to show she was alive the night before her death the resolute woman talked with her son and daughterinlaw as usual went to bed and was found dead there in the morning “george be a king” were the words which she was for ever croaking in the ears of her son and a king the simple stubborn affectionate bigoted man tried to be  he did his best he worked according to his lights what virtue he knew he tried to practise what knowledge he could master he strove to acquire he was for ever drawing maps for example and learned geography with no small care and industry he knew all about the family histories and genealogies of his gentry and pretty histories he must have known he knew the whole army  list and all the facings and the exact number of the buttons and all the tags and laces and the cut of all the cocked hats pigtails and gaiters in his army he knew the personnel of the universities what doctors were inclined to socinianism and who were sound churchmen he knew the etiquettes of his own and his grandfather’s courts to a nicety and the smallest particulars regarding the routine of ministers secretaries embassies audiences the humblest page in the anteroom or the meanest helper in the stables or kitchen these parts of the royal business he was capable of learning and he learned but as one thinks of an office almost divine performed by any mortal man—of any single being pretending to control the thoughts to direct the faith to order the implicit obedience of brother millions to compel them into war at his offence or quarrel to command “in this way you shall trade in this way you shall think these neighbours shall be your allies whom you shall help these others your enemies whom you shall slay at my orders in this way you shall worship god”—who can wonder that when such a man as george took such an office on himself punishment and humiliation should fall upon people and chief  yet there is something grand about his courage the battle of the king with his aristocracy remains yet to be told by the historian who shall view the reign of george more justly than the trumpery panegyrists who wrote immediately after his decease it was he with the people to back him who made the war with america it was he and the people who refused justice to the roman catholics and on both questions he beat the patricians he bribed he bullied he darkly dissembled on occasion he exercised a slippery perseverance and a vindictive resolution which one almost admires as one thinks his character over his courage was never to be beat it trampled north under foot it bent the stiff neck of the younger pitt even his illness never conquered that indomitable spirit as soon as his brain was clear it resumed the scheme only laid aside when his reason left him as soon as his hands were out of the straitwaistcoat they took up the pen and the plan which had engaged him up to the moment of his malady i believe it is by persons believing themselves in the right that ninetenths of the tyranny of this world has been perpetrated arguing on that convenient premiss the dey of algiers would cut off twenty heads of a morning father dominic would burn a score of jews in the presence of the most catholic king and the archbishops of toledo and salamanca sing amen protestants were roasted jesuits hung and quartered at smithfield and witches burned at salem and all by worthy people who believed they had the best authority for their actions  and so with respect to old george even americans whom he hated and who conquered him may give him credit for having quite honest reasons for oppressing them appended to lord brougham’s biographical sketch of lord north are some autograph notes of the king which let us most curiously into the state of his mind “the times certainly require” says he “the concurrence of all who wish to prevent anarchy i have no wish but the prosperity of my own dominions therefore i must look upon all who would not heartily assist me as bad men as well as bad subjects” that is the way he reasoned “i wish nothing but good therefore every man who does not agree with me is a traitor and a scoundrel” remember that he believed himself anointed by a divine commission remember that he was a man of slow parts and imperfect education that the same awful will of heaven which placed a crown upon his head which made him tender to his family pure in his life courageous and honest made him dull of comprehension obstinate of will and at many times deprived him of reason he was the father of his people his rebellious children must be flogged into obedience he was the defender of the protestant faith he would rather lay that stout head upon the block than that catholics should have a share in the government of england and you do not suppose that there are not honest bigots enough in all countries to back kings in this kind of statesmanship without doubt the american war was popular in england in 1775 the address in favour of coercing the colonies was carried by 304 to 105 in the commons by 104 to 29 in the house of lords popular—so was the revocation of the edict of nantes popular in france so was the massacre of st bartholomew so was the inquisition exceedingly popular in spain  wars and revolutions are however the politician’s province the great events of this long reign the statesmen and orators who illustrated it i do not pretend to make the subjects of an hour’s light talk187 let us return to our humbler duty of court gossip yonder sits our little queen surrounded by many stout sons and fair daughters whom she bore to her faithful george the history of the daughters as little miss burney has painted them to us is delightful they were handsome—she calls them beautiful they were most kind loving and ladylike they were gracious to every person high and low who served them they had many little accomplishments of their own this one drew that one played the piano they all worked most prodigiously and fitted up whole suites of rooms—pretty smiling penelopes—with their busy little needles as we picture to ourselves the society of eighty years ago we must imagine hundreds of thousands of groups of women in great high caps tight bodies and full skirts needling away whilst one of the number or perhaps a favoured gentleman in a pigtail reads out a novel to the company peep into the cottage at olney for example and see there mrs unwin and lady hesketh those highbred ladies those sweet pious women and william cowper that delicate wit that trembling pietist that refined gentleman absolutely reading out jonathan wild to the ladies what a change in our manners in our amusements since then                                illustration                             lord north mr fox

was orderly it must have been stupid to a degree which i shudder now to contemplate no wonder all the princes ran away from the lap of that dreary domestic virtue it always rose rode dined at stated intervals day after day was the same at the same hour at night the king kissed his daughters’ jolly cheeks the princesses kissed their mother’s hand and madame thielke brought the royal nightcap at the same hour the equerries and women in waiting had their little dinner and cackled over their tea the king had his backgammon or his evening concert the equerries yawned themselves to death in the anteroom or the king and his family walked on windsor slopes the king holding his darling little princess amelia by the hand and the people crowded round quite goodnaturedly and the eton boys thrust their chubby cheeks under the crowd’s elbows and the concert over the king never failed to take his enormous cockedhat off and salute his band and say “thank you gentlemen”                                illustration                                a little rebel   a quieter household a more prosaic life than this of kew or windsor cannot be imagined rain or shine the king rode every day for hours poked his red face into hundreds of cottages round about and showed that shovel hat and windsor uniform to farmers to pigboys to old women making apple dumplings to all sorts of people gentle and simple about whom countless stories are told nothing can be more undignified than these stories when haroun alraschid visits a subject incog the latter is sure to be very much the better for the caliph’s magnificence old george showed no such royal splendour he used to give a guinea sometimes sometimes feel in his pockets and find he had no money often ask a man a hundred questions about the number of his family about his oats and beans about the rent he paid for his house and ride on on one occasion he played the part of king alfred and turned a piece of meat with a string at a cottager’s house when the old woman came home she found a paper with an enclosure of money and a note written by the royal pencil “five guineas to buy a jack” it was not splendid but it was kind and worthy of farmer george one day when the king and queen were walking together they met a little boy—they were always fond of children the good folks—and patted the little white head “whose little boy are you” asks the windsor uniform “i am the king’s beefeater’s little boy” replied the child on which the king said “then kneel down and kiss the queen’s hand” but the innocent offspring of the beefeater declined this treat “no” said he “i won’t kneel for if i do i shall spoil my new breeches” the thrifty king ought to have hugged him and knighted him on the spot george’s admirers wrote pages and pages of such stories about him one morning before anybody else was up the king walked about gloucester town pushed over molly the housemaid who was scrubbing the doorsteps with her pail ran upstairs and woke all the equerries in their bedrooms and then trotted down to the bridge where by this time a dozen of louts were assembled “what is this gloucester new bridge” asked our gracious monarch and the people answered him “yes your majesty” “why then my boys” said he “let us have a huzzay” after giving them which intellectual gratification he went home to breakfast our fathers read these simple tales with fond pleasure laughed at these very small jokes liked the old man who poked his nose into every cottage who lived on plain wholesome roast and boiled who despised your french kickshaws who was a true hearty old english gentleman you may have seen gilray’s famous print of him—in the old wig in the stout old hideous windsor uniform—as the king of brobdingnag peering at a little gulliver whom he holds up in his hand whilst in the other he has an operaglass through which he surveys the pygmy our fathers chose to set up george as the type of a great king and the little gulliver was the great napoleon we prided ourselves on our prejudices we blustered and bragged with absurd vainglory we dealt to our enemy a monstrous injustice of contempt and scorn we fought him with all weapons mean as well as heroic there was no lie we would not believe no charge of crime which our furious prejudice would not credit i thought at one time of making a collection of the lies which the french had written against us and we had published against them during the war it would be a strange memorial of popular falsehood  their majesties were very sociable potentates and the court chronicler tells of numerous visits which they paid to their subjects gentle and simple with whom they dined at whose great countryhouses they stopped or at whose poorer lodgings they affably partook of tea and breadandbutter some of the great folks spent enormous sums in entertaining their sovereigns as marks of special favour the king and queen sometimes stood as sponsors for the children of the nobility we find lady salisbury was so honoured in the year 1786 and in the year 1802 lady chesterfield the court news relates how her ladyship received their majesties on a state bed “dressed with white satin and a profusion of lace the counterpane of white satin embroidered with gold and the bed of crimson satin lined with white” the child was first brought by the nurse to the marchioness of bath who presided as chief nurse then the marchioness handed baby to the queen then the queen handed the little darling to the bishop of norwich the officiating clergyman and the ceremony over a cup of caudle was presented by the earl to his majesty on one knee on a large gold waiter placed on a crimson velvet cushion misfortunes would occur in these interesting genuflectory ceremonies of royal worship bubb dodington lord melcombe a very fat puffy man in a most gorgeous court suit had to kneel cumberland says and was so fat and so tight that he could not get up again “kneel sir kneel” cried my lord in waiting to a country mayor who had to read an address but who went on with his compliment standing “kneel sir kneel” cries my lord in dreadful alarm “i can’t” says the mayor turning round “don’t you see i have got a wooden leg” in the capital burney diary and letters the home and court life of good old king george and good old queen charlotte are presented at portentous length the king rose every morning at six and had two hours to himself he thought it effeminate to have a carpet in his bedroom shortly before eight the queen and the royal family were always ready for him and they proceeded to the king’s chapel in the castle there were no fires in the passages the chapel was scarcely alight princesses governesses equerries grumbled and caught cold but cold or hot it was their duty to go and wet or dry light or dark the stout old george was always in his place to say amen to the chaplain  the queen’s character is represented in burney at full length she was a sensible most decorous woman a very grand lady on state occasions simple enough in ordinary life well read as times went and giving shrewd opinions about books stingy but not unjust not generally unkind to her dependants but invincible in her notions of etiquette and quite angry if her people suffered illhealth in her service she gave miss burney a shabby pittance and led the poor young woman a life which wellnigh killed her she never thought but that she was doing burney the greatest favour in taking her from freedom fame and competence and killing her off with languor in that dreary court it was not dreary to her had she been servant instead of mistress her spirit would never have broken down she never would have put a pin out of place or been a moment from her duty she was not weak and she could not pardon those who were she was perfectly correct in life and she hated poor sinners with a rancour such as virtue sometimes has she must have had awful private trials of her own not merely with her children but with her husband in those long days about which nobody will ever know anything now when he was not quite insane when his incessant tongue was babbling folly rage persecution and she had to smile and be respectful and attentive under this intolerable ennui the queen bore all her duties stoutly as she expected others to bear them at a state christening the lady who held the infant was tired and looked unwell and the princess of wales asked permission for her to sit down “let her stand” said the queen flicking the snuff off her sleeve she would have stood the resolute old woman if she had had to hold the child till his beard was grown “i am seventy years of age” the queen said facing a mob of ruffians who stopped her sedan “i have been fifty years queen of england and i never was insulted before” fearless rigid unforgiving little queen i don’t wonder that her sons revolted from her  of all the figures in that large family group which surrounds george and his queen the prettiest i think is the father’s darling the princess amelia pathetic for her beauty her sweetness her early death and for the extreme passionate tenderness with which her father loved her this was his favourite amongst all the children of his sons he loved the duke of york best burney tells a sad story of the poor old man at weymouth and how eager he was to have this darling son with him the king’s house was not big enough to hold the prince and his father had a portable house erected close to his own and at huge pains so that his dear frederick should be near him he clung on his arm all the time of his visit talked to no one else had talked of no one else for some time before the prince so long expected stayed but a single night he had business in london the next day he said the dullness of the old king’s court stupefied york and the other big sons of george iii they scared equerries and ladies frightened the modest little circle with their coarse spirits and loud talk of little comfort indeed were the king’s sons to the king  but the pretty amelia was his darling and the little maiden prattling and smiling in the fond arms of that old father is a sweet image to look on there is a family picture in burney which a man must be very hardhearted not to like she describes an afterdinner walk of the royal family at windsor—“it was really a mighty pretty procession” she says “the little princess just turned of three years old in a robecoat covered with fine muslin a dressed close cap white gloves and fan walked on alone and first highly delighted with the parade and turning from side to side to see everybody as she passed for all the terracers stand up against the walls to make a clear passage for the royal family the moment they come in sight then followed the king and queen no less delighted with the joy of their little darling the princess royal leaning on lady elizabeth waldegrave the princess augusta holding by the duchess of ancaster the princess elizabeth led by lady charlotte bertie followed office here takes place of rank” says burney—to explain how it was that lady e waldegrave as lady of the bedchamber walked before a duchess—“general budé and the duke of montague and major price as equerry brought up the rear of the procession” one sees it the band playing its old music the sun shining on the happy loyal crowd and lighting the ancient battlements the rich elms and purple landscape and bright greensward the royal standard drooping from the great tower yonder as old george passes followed by his race preceded by the charming infant who caresses the crowd with her innocent smiles  “on sight of mrs delany the king instantly stopped to speak to her the queen of course and the little princess and all the rest stood still they talked a good while with the sweet old lady during which time the king once or twice addressed himself to me i caught the queen’s eye and saw in it a little surprise but by no means any displeasure to see me of the party the little princess went up to mrs delany of whom she is very fond and behaved like a little angel to her she then with a look of inquiry and recollection came behind mrs delany to look at me ‘i am afraid’ said i in a whisper and stooping down ‘your royal highness does not remember me’ her answer was an arch little smile and a nearer approach with her lips pouted out to kiss me”  the princess wrote verses herself and there are some pretty plaintive lines attributed to her which are more touching than better poetry—       unthinking idle wild and young     i laughed and danced and talked and sung     and proud of health of freedom vain     dreamed not of sorrow care or pain     concluding in those hours of glee     that all the world was made for me      but when the hour of trial came     when sickness shook this trembling frame     when folly’s gay pursuits were o’er     and i could sing and dance no more     it then occurred how sad ’twould be     were this world only made for me   the poor soul quitted it—and ere yet she was dead the agonized father was in such a state that the officers round about him were obliged to set watchers over him and from november 1810 george iii ceased to reign all the world knows the story of his malady all history presents no sadder figure than that of the old man blind and deprived of reason wandering through the rooms of his palace addressing imaginary parliaments reviewing fancied troops holding ghostly courts i have seen his picture as it was taken at this time hanging in the apartment of his daughter the landgravine of hessehombourg—amidst books and windsor furniture and a hundred fond reminiscences of her english home the poor old father is represented in a purple gown his snowy beard falling over his breast—the star of his famous order still idly shining on it he was not only sightless he became utterly deaf all light all reason all sound of human voices all the pleasures of this world of god were taken from him some slight lucid moments he had in one of which the queen desiring to see him entered the room and found him singing a hymn and accompanying himself at the harpsichord when he had finished he knelt down and prayed aloud for her and then for his family and then for the nation concluding with a prayer for himself that it might please god to avert his heavy calamity from him but if not to give him resignation to submit he then burst into tears and his reason again fled  what preacher need moralize on this story what words save the simplest are requisite to tell it it is too terrible for tears the thought of such a misery smites me down in submission before the ruler of kings and men the monarch supreme over empires and republics the inscrutable dispenser of life death happiness victory “o brothers” i said to those who heard me first in america—“o brothers speaking the same dear mother tongue—o comrades enemies no more let us take a mournful hand together as we stand by this royal corpse and call a truce to battle low he lies to whom the proudest used to kneel once and who was cast lower than the poorest dead whom millions prayed for in vain driven off his throne buffeted by rude hands with his children in revolt the darling of his old age killed before him untimely our lear hangs over her breathless lips and cries ‘cordelia cordelia stay a little’ ”       vex not his ghost—oh let him pass—he hates him     that would upon the rack of this tough world     stretch him out longer   hush strife and quarrel over the solemn grave sound trumpets a mournful march fall dark curtain upon his pageant his pride his grief his awful tragedy    george the fourth   in twiss’s amusing life of eldon we read how on the death of the duke of york the old chancellor became possessed of a lock of the defunct prince’s hair and so careful was he respecting the authenticity of the relic that bessy eldon his wife sat in the room with the young man from hamlet’s who distributed the ringlet into separate lockets which each of the eldon family afterwards wore you know how when george iv came to edinburgh a better man than he went on board the royal yacht to welcome the king to his kingdom of scotland seized a goblet from which his majesty had just drunk vowed it should remain for ever as an heirloom in his family clapped the precious glass in his pocket and sat down on it and broke it when he got home suppose the good sheriff’s prize unbroken now at abbotsford should we not smile with something like pity as we beheld it suppose one of those lockets of the nopopery prince’s hair offered for sale at christie’s quot libras e duce summo invenies how many pounds would you find for the illustrious duke madame tussaud has got king george’s coronation robes is there any man now alive who would kiss the hem of that trumpery he sleeps since thirty years do not any of you who remember him wonder that you once respected and huzza’d and admired him  to make a portrait of him at first seemed a matter of small difficulty there is his coat his star his wig his countenance simpering under it with a slate and a piece of chalk i could at this very desk perform a recognizable likeness of him and yet after reading of him in scores of volumes hunting him through old magazines and newspapers having him here at a ball there at a public dinner there at races and so forth you find you have nothing—nothing but a coat and wig and a mask smiling below it—nothing but a great simulacrum his sire and grandsires were men one knows what they were like what they would do in given circumstances that on occasion they fought and demeaned themselves like tough good soldiers they had friends whom they liked according to their natures enemies whom they hated fiercely passions and actions and individualities of their own the sailor king who came after george was a man the duke of york was a man big burly loud jolly cursing courageous but this george what was he i look through all his life and recognize but a bow and a grin i try and take him to pieces and find silk stockings padding stays a coat with frogs and a fur collar a star and blue ribbon a pockethandkerchief prodigiously scented one of truefitt’s best nutty brown wigs reeking with oil a set of teeth and a huge black stock underwaistcoats more underwaistcoats and then nothing i know of no sentiment that he ever distinctly uttered documents are published under his name but people wrote them—private letters but people spelt them he put a great “george p” or “george r” at the bottom of the page and fancied he had written the paper some bookseller’s clerk some poor author some man did the work saw to the spelling cleaned up the slovenly sentences and gave the lax maudlin slipslop a sort of consistency he must have had an individuality the dancingmaster whom he emulated nay surpassed—the wigmaker who curled his toupee for him—the tailor who cut his coats had that but about george one can get at nothing actual that outside i am certain is pad and tailor’s work there may be something behind but what we cannot get at the character no doubt never shall will men of the future have nothing better to do than to unswathe and interpret that royal old mummy i own i once used to think it would be good sport to pursue him fasten on him and pull him down but now i am ashamed to mount and lay good dogs on to summon a full field and then to hunt the poor game  on the 12th august 1762 the fortyseventh anniversary of the accession of the house of brunswick to the english throne all the bells in london pealed in gratulation and announced that an heir to george iii was born five days afterwards the king was pleased to pass letters patent under the great seal creating hrh the prince of great britain electoral prince of brunswicklüneburg duke of cornwall and rothsay earl of carrick baron of renfrew lord of the isles and great steward of scotland prince of wales and earl of chester  all the people at his birth thronged to see this lovely child and behind a gilt chinascreen railing in st james’s palace in a cradle surmounted by the three princely ostrich feathers the royal infant was laid to delight the eyes of the lieges among the earliest instances of homage paid to him i read that “a curious indian bow and arrows were sent to the prince from his father’s faithful subjects in new york” he was fond of playing with these toys an old statesman orator and wit of his grandfather’s and greatgrandfather’s time never tired of his business still eager in his old age to be well at court used to play with the little prince and pretend to fall down dead when the prince shot at him with his toy bow and arrows—and get up and fall down dead over and over again—to the increased delight of the child so that he was flattered from his cradle upwards and before his little feet could walk statesmen and courtiers were busy kissing them  there is a pretty picture of the royal infant—a beautiful buxom child—asleep in his mother’s lap who turns round and holds a finger to her lip as if she would bid the courtiers around respect the baby’s slumbers from that day until his decease sixtyeight years after i suppose there were more pictures taken of that personage than of any other human being who ever was born and died—in every kind of uniform and every possible court dress—in long fair hair with powder with and without a pigtail—in every conceivable cockedhat—in dragoon uniform—in windsor uniform—in a fieldmarshal’s clothes—in a scotch kilt and tartans with dirk and claymore a stupendous figure—in a frogged frockcoat with a fur collar and tight breeches and silk stockings—in wigs of every colour fair brown and black—in his famous coronation robes finally with which performance he was so much in love that he distributed copies of the picture to all the courts and british embassies in europe and to numberless clubs townhalls and private friends i remember as a young man how almost every diningroom had his portrait                                illustration  there is plenty of biographical tattle about the prince’s boyhood it is told with what astonishing rapidity he learned all languages ancient and modern how he rode beautifully sang charmingly and played elegantly on the violoncello that he was beautiful was patent to all eyes he had a high spirit and once when he had had a difference with his father burst into the royal closet and called out “wilkes and liberty for ever” he was so clever that he confounded his very governors in learning and one of them lord bruce having made a false quantity in quoting greek the admirable young prince instantly corrected him lord bruce could not remain a governor after this humiliation resigned his office and to soothe his feelings was actually promoted to be an earl it is the most wonderful reason for promoting a man that ever i heard lord bruce was made an earl for a blunder in prosody and nelson was made a baron for the victory of the nile  lovers of long sums have added up the millions and millions which in the course of his brilliant existence this single prince consumed besides his income of 50000l 70000l 100000l 120000l a year we read of three applications to parliament debts to the amount of 160000l of 650000l besides mysterious foreign loans whereof he pocketed the proceeds what did he do for all this money why was he to have it if he had been a manufacturing town or a populous rural district or an army of five thousand men he would not have cost more he one solitary stout man who did not toil nor spin nor fight—what had any mortal done that he should be pampered so  in 1784 when he was twentyone years of age carlton palace was given to him and furnished by the nation with as much luxury as could be devised his pockets were filled with money he said it was not enough he flung it out of window he spent 10000l a year for the coats on his back the nation gave him more money and more and more the sum is past counting he was a prince most lovely to look on and christened prince florizel on his first appearance in the world that he was the handsomest prince in the whole world was agreed by men and alas by many women  i suppose he must have been very graceful there are so many testimonies to the charm of his manner that we must allow him great elegance and powers of fascination he and the king of france’s brother the count d’artois a charming young prince who danced deliciously on the tightrope—a poor old tottering exiled king who asked hospitality of king george’s successor and lived awhile in the palace of mary stuart—divided in their youth the title of first gentleman of europe we in england of course gave the prize to our gentleman until george’s death the propriety of that award was scarce questioned or the doubters voted rebels and traitors only the other day i was reading in the reprint of the delightful noctes of christopher north the health of the king is drunk in large capitals by the loyal scotsman you would fancy him a hero a sage a statesman a pattern for kings and men it was walter scott who had that accident with the broken glass i spoke of anon he was the king’s scottish champion rallied all scotland to him made loyalty the fashion and laid about him fiercely with his claymore upon all the prince’s enemies the brunswicks had no such defenders as those two jacobite commoners old sam johnson the lichfield chapman’s son and walter scott the edinburgh lawyer’s  nature and circumstance had done their utmost to prepare the prince for being spoiled the dreadful dullness of papa’s court its stupid amusements its dreary occupations the maddening humdrum the stifling sobriety of its routine would have made a scapegrace of a much less lively prince all the big princes bolted from that castle of ennui where old king george sat posting up his books and droning over his handel and old queen charlotte over her snuff and her tambourframe most of the sturdy gallant sons settled down after sowing their wild oats and became sober subjects of their father and brother—not ill liked by the nation which pardons youthful irregularities readily enough for the sake of pluck and unaffectedness and good humour  the boy is father of the man our prince signalized his entrance into the world by a feat worthy of his future life he invented a new shoebuckle it was an inch long and five inches broad “it covered almost the whole instep reaching down to the ground on either side of the foot” a sweet invention lovely and useful as the prince on whose foot it sparkled at his first appearance at a court ball we read that “his coat was pink silk with white cuffs his waistcoat white silk embroidered with variouscoloured foil and adorned with a profusion of french paste and his hat was ornamented with two rows of steel beads five thousand in number with a button and loop of the same metal and cocked in a new military style” what a florizel do these details seem trivial they are the grave incidents of his life his biographers say that when he commenced housekeeping in that splendid new palace of his the prince of wales had some windy projects of encouraging literature science and the arts of having assemblies of literary characters and societies for the encouragement of geography astronomy and botany astronomy geography and botany fiddlesticks french balletdancers french cooks horsejockeys buffoons procurers tailors boxers fencingmasters china jewel and gimcrack merchants—these were his real companions at first he made a pretence of having burke and pitt and sheridan for his friends but how could such men be serious before such an empty scapegrace as this lad fox might talk dice with him and sheridan wine but what else had these men of genius in common with their tawdry young host of carlton house that ribble the leader of such men as fox and burke that man’s opinions about the constitution the india bill justice to the catholics—about any question graver than the button for a waistcoat or the sauce for a partridge—worth anything the friendship between the prince and the whig chiefs was impossible they were hypocrites in pretending to respect him and if he broke the hollow compact between them who shall blame him his natural companions were dandies and parasites he could talk to a tailor or a cook but as the equal of great statesmen to set up a creature lazy weak indolent besotted of monstrous vanity and levity incurable—it is absurd they thought to use him and did for awhile but they must have known how timid he was how entirely heartless and treacherous and have expected his desertion his next set of friends were mere table companions of whom he grew tired too then we hear of him with a very few select toadies mere boys from school or the guards whose sprightliness tickled the fancy of the wornout voluptuary what matters what friends he had he dropped all his friends he never could have real friends an heir to the throne has flatterers adventurers who hang about him ambitious men who use him but friendship is denied him  and women i suppose are as false and selfish in their dealings with such a character as men shall we take the leporello part flourish a catalogue of the conquests of this royal don juan and tell the names of the favourites to whom one after the other george prince flung his pockethandkerchief what purpose would it answer to say how perdita was pursued won deserted and by whom succeeded what good in knowing that he did actually marry mrs fitzherbert according to the rites of the roman catholic church that her marriage settlements have been seen in london that the names of the witnesses to her marriage are known this sort of vice that we are now come to presents no new or fleeting trait of manners debauchees dissolute heartless fickle cowardly have been ever since the world began this one had more temptations than most and so much may be said in extenuation for him  it was an unlucky thing for this doomed one and tending to lead him yet farther on the road to the deuce that besides being lovely so that women were fascinated by him and heir apparent so that all the world flattered him he should have a beautiful voice which led him directly in the way of drink and thus all the pleasant devils were coaxing on poor florizel desire and idleness and vanity and drunkenness all clashing their merry cymbals and bidding him come on  we first hear of his warbling sentimental ditties under the walls of kew palace by the moonlight banks of thames with lord viscount leporello keeping watch lest the music should be disturbed  singing after dinner and supper was the universal fashion of the day you may fancy all england sounding with choruses some ribald some harmless but all occasioning the consumption of a prodigious deal of fermented liquor       the jolly muse her wings to try no frolic flights need take     but round the bowl would dip and fly like swallows round a lake   sang morris in one of his gallant anacreontics to which the prince many a time joined in chorus and of which the burden is—       and that i think’s a reason fair to drink and fill again   this delightful boon companion of the prince’s found “a reason fair” to forgo filling and drinking saw the error of his ways gave up the bowl and chorus and died retired and religious the prince’s table no doubt was a very tempting one the wits came and did their utmost to amuse him it is wonderful how the spirits rise the wit brightens the wine has an aroma when a great man is at the head of the table scott the loyal cavalier the king’s true liegeman the very best raconteur of his time poured out with an endless generosity his store of oldworld learning kindness and humour grattan contributed to it his wondrous eloquence fancy feeling tom moore perched upon it for awhile and piped his most exquisite little lovetunes on it flying away in a twitter of indignation afterwards and attacking the prince with bill and claw in such society no wonder the sitting was long and the butler tired of drawing corks remember what the usages of the time were and that william pitt coming to the house of commons after having drunk a bottle of port wine at his own house would go into bellamy’s with dundas and help finish a couple more  you peruse volumes after volumes about our prince and find some halfdozen stock stories—indeed not many more—common to all the histories he was goodnatured an indolent voluptuous prince not unkindly one story the most favourable to him of all perhaps is that as prince regent he was eager to hear all that could be said in behalf of prisoners condemned to death and anxious if possible to remit the capital sentence he was kind to his servants there is a story common to all the biographies of molly the housemaid who when his household was to be broken up owing to some reforms which he tried absurdly to practise was discovered crying as she dusted the chairs because she was to leave a master who had a kind word for all his servants another tale is that of a groom of the prince’s being discovered in corn and oat peculations and dismissed by the personage at the head of the stables the prince had word of john’s disgrace remonstrated with him very kindly generously reinstated him and bade him promise to sin no more—a promise which john kept another story is very fondly told of the prince as a young man hearing of an officer’s family in distress and how he straightway borrowed six or eight hundred pounds put his long fair hair under his hat and so disguised carried the money to the starving family he sent money too to sheridan on his deathbed and would have sent more had not death ended the career of that man of genius besides these there are a few pretty speeches kind and graceful to persons with whom he was brought in contact but he turned upon twenty friends he was fond and familiar with them one day and he passed them on the next without recognition he used them liked them loved them perhaps in his way and then separated from them on monday he kissed and fondled poor perdita and on tuesday he met her and did not know her on wednesday he was very affectionate with that wretched brummell and on thursday forgot him cheated him even out of a snuffbox which he owed the poor dandy saw him years afterwards in his downfall and poverty when the bankrupt beau sent him another snuffbox with some of the snuff he used to love as a piteous token of remembrance and submission and the king took the snuff and ordered his horses and drove on and had not the grace to notice his old companion favourite rival enemy superior in wraxall there is some gossip about him when the charming beautiful generous duchess of devonshire died—the lovely lady whom he used to call his dearest duchess once and pretend to admire as all english society admired her—he said “then we have lost the bestbred woman in england” “then we have lost the kindest heart in england” said noble charles fox on another occasion when three noblemen were to receive the garter says wraxall “a great personage observed that never did three men receive the order in so characteristic a manner the duke of a advanced to the sovereign with a phlegmatic cold awkward air like a clown lord b came forward fawning and smiling like a courtier lord c presented himself easy unembarrassed like a gentleman” these are the stories one has to recall about the prince and king—kindness to a housemaid generosity to a groom criticism on a bow there are no better stories about him they are mean and trivial and they characterize him the great war of empires and giants goes on day by day victories are won and lost by the brave torn smoky flags and battered eagles are wrenched from the heroic enemy and laid at his feet and he sits there on his throne and smiles and gives the guerdon of valour to the conqueror he elliston the actor when the coronation was performed in which he took the principal part used to fancy himself the king burst into tears and hiccup a blessing on the people i believe it is certain about george iv that he had heard so much of the war knighted so many people and worn such a prodigious quantity of marshal’s uniforms cockedhats cock’s feathers scarlet and bullion in general that he actually fancied he had been present in some campaigns and under the name of general brock led a tremendous charge of the german legion at waterloo  he is dead but thirty years and one asks how a great society could have tolerated him would we bear him now in this quarter of a century what a silent revolution has been working how it has separated us from old times and manners how it has changed men themselves i can see old gentlemen now among us of perfect good breeding of quiet lives with venerable grey heads fondling their grandchildren and look at them and wonder at what they were once that gentleman of the grand old school when he was in the 10th hussars and dined at the prince’s table would fall under it night after night night after night that gentleman sat at brookes’s or raggett’s over the dice if in the petulance of play or drink that gentleman spoke a sharp word to his neighbour he and the other would infallibly go out and try to shoot each other the next morning that gentleman would drive his friend richmond the black boxer down to moulsey and hold his coat and shout and swear and hurrah with delight whilst the black man was beating dutch sam the jew that gentleman would take a manly pleasure in pulling his own coat off and thrashing a bargeman in a street row that gentleman has been in a watchhouse that gentleman so exquisitely polite with ladies in a drawingroom so loftily courteous if he talked now as he used among men in his youth would swear so as to make your hair stand on end i met lately a very old german gentleman who had served in our army at the beginning of the century since then he has lived on his own estate but rarely meeting with an englishman whose language—the language of fifty years ago that is—he possesses perfectly when this highly bred old man began to speak english to me almost every other word he uttered was an oath as they used it they swore dreadfully in flanders with the duke of york before valenciennes or at carlton house over the supper and cards read byron’s letters so accustomed is the young man to oaths that he employs them even in writing to his friends and swears by the post read his account of the doings of young men at cambridge of the ribald professors one of whom “could pour out greek like a drunken helot” and whose excesses surpassed even those of the young men read matthews’s description of the boyish lordling’s housekeeping at newstead the skullcup passed round the monks’ dresses from the masquerade warehouse in which the young scapegraces used to sit until daylight chanting appropriate songs round their wine “we come to breakfast at two or three o’clock” matthews says “there are gloves and foils for those who like to amuse themselves or we fire pistols at a mark in the hall or we worry the wolf” a jolly life truly the noble young owner of the mansion writes about such affairs himself in letters to his friend mr john jackson pugilist in london  all the prince’s time tells a similar strange story of manners and pleasure in wraxall we find the prime minister himself the redoubted william pitt engaged in high jinks with personages of no less importance than lord thurlow the lord chancellor and mr dundas the treasurer of the navy wraxall relates how these three statesmen returning after dinner from addiscombe found a turnpike open and galloped through it without paying the toll the turnpike man fancying they were highwaymen fired a blunderbuss after them but missed them and the poet sang—       how as pitt wandered darkling o’er the plain     his reason drown’d in jenkinson’s champagne     a rustic’s hand but righteous fate withstood     had shed a premier’s for a robber’s blood   here we have the treasurer of the navy the lord high chancellor and the prime minister all engaged in a most undoubted lark in eldon’s memoirs about the very same time i read that the bar loved wine as well as the woolsack not john scott himself he was a good boy always and though he loved port wine loved his business and his duty and his fees a great deal better  he has a northern circuit story of those days about a party at the house of a certain lawyer fawcett who gave a dinner every year to the counsel  “on one occasion” related lord eldon “i heard lee say ‘i cannot leave fawcett’s wine mind davenport you will go home immediately after dinner to read the brief in that cause that we have to conduct tomorrow’  “ ‘not i’ said davenport ‘leave my dinner and my wine to read a brief no no lee that won’t do’  “ ‘then’ said lee ‘what is to be done who else is employed’  “davenport—‘oh young scott’  “lee—‘oh he must go mr scott you must go home immediately and make yourself acquainted with that cause before our consultation this evening’ ”  “this was very hard upon me but i did go and there was an attorney from cumberland and one from northumberland and i do not know how many other persons pretty late in came jack lee as drunk as he could be  “ ‘i cannot consult tonight i must go to bed’ he exclaimed and away he went then came sir thomas davenport  “ ‘we cannot have a consultation tonight mr wordsworth’ wordsworth i think was the name it was a cumberland name shouted davenport ‘don’t you see how drunk mr scott is it is impossible to consult’ poor me who had scarce had any dinner and lost all my wine—i was so drunk that i could not consult well a verdict was given against us and it was all owing to lawyer fawcett’s dinner we moved for a new trial and i must say for the honour of the bar that those two gentlemen jack lee and sir thomas davenport paid all the expenses between them of the first trial it is the only instance i ever knew but they did we moved for a new trial on the ground i suppose of the counsel not being in their senses and it was granted when it came on the following year the judge rose and said—  “ ‘gentlemen did any of you dine with lawyer fawcett yesterday for if you did i will not hear this cause till next year’  “there was great laughter we gained the cause that time”  on another occasion at lancaster where poor bozzy must needs be going the northern circuit “we found him” says mr scott “lying upon the pavement inebriated we subscribed a guinea at supper for him and a halfcrown for his clerk”—no doubt there was a large bar and that scott’s joke did not cost him much—“and sent him when he waked next morning a brief with instructions to move for what we denominated the writ of quare adhaesit pavimento with observations duly calculated to induce him to think that it required great learning to explain the necessity of granting it to the judge before whom he was to move” boswell sent all round the town to attorneys for books that might enable him to distinguish himself—but in vain he moved however for the writ making the best use he could of the observations in the brief the judge was perfectly astonished and the audience amazed the judge said “i never heard of such a writ—what can it be that adheres pavimento are any of you gentlemen at the bar able to explain this”  the bar laughed at last one of them said—  “my lord mr boswell last night adhaesit pavimento there was no moving him for some time at last he was carried to bed and he has been dreaming about himself and the pavement”  the canny old gentleman relishes these jokes when the bishop of lincoln was moving from the deanery of st paul’s he says he asked a learned friend of his by name will hay how he should move some especially fine claret about which he was anxious  “pray my lord bishop” says hay “how much of the wine have you”  the bishop said six dozen  “if that is all” hay answered “you have but to ask me six times to dinner and i will carry it all away myself”  there were giants in those days but this joke about wine is not so fearful as one perpetrated by orator thelwall in the heat of the french revolution ten years later over a frothing pot of porter he blew the head off and said “this is the way i would serve all kings”  now we come to yet higher personages and find their doings recorded in the blushing pages of timid little miss burney’s memoirs she represents a prince of the blood in quite a royal condition the loudness the bigness boisterousness creaking boots and rattling oaths of the young princes appeared to have frightened the prim household of windsor and set all the teacups twittering on the tray on the night of a ball and birthday when one of the pretty kind princesses was to come out it was agreed that her brother prince william henry should dance the opening minuet with her and he came to visit the household at their dinner  “at dinner mrs schwellenberg presided attired magnificently miss goldsworthy mrs stanforth messrs du luc and stanhope dined with us and while we were still eating fruit the duke of clarence entered  “he was just risen from the king’s table and waiting for his equipage to go home and prepare for the ball to give you an idea of the energy of his royal highness’s language i ought to set apart an objection to writing or rather intimating certain forcible words and beg leave to show you in genuine colours a royal sailor  “we all rose of course upon his entrance and the two gentlemen placed themselves behind their chairs while the footmen left the room but he ordered us all to sit down and called the men back to hand about some wine he was in exceeding high spirits and in the utmost good humour he placed himself at the head of the table next mrs schwellenberg and looked remarkably well gay and full of sport and mischief yet clever withal as well as comical  “ ‘well this is the first day i have ever dined with the king at st james’s on his birthday pray have you all drunk his majesty’s health’  “ ‘no your royal highness your royal highness might make dem do dat’ said mrs schwellenberg  “ ‘oh by —— i will here you’ to the footman ‘bring champagne i’ll drink the king’s health again if i die for it yes i have done it pretty well already so has the king i promise you i believe his majesty was never taken such good care of before we have kept his spirits up i promise you we have enabled him to go through his fatigues and i should have done more still but for the ball and mary—i have promised to dance with mary i must keep sober for mary’ ”  indefatigable miss burney continues for a dozen pages reporting hrh’s conversation and indicating with a humour not unworthy of the clever little author of evelina the increasing state of excitement of the young sailor prince who drank more and more champagne stopped old mrs schwellenberg’s remonstrances by giving the old lady a kiss and telling her to hold her potatotrap and who did not “keep sober for mary” mary had to find another partner that night for the royal william henry could not keep his legs  will you have a picture of the amusements of another royal prince it is the duke of york the blundering general the beloved commanderinchief of the army the brother with whom george iv had had many a midnight carouse and who continued his habits of pleasure almost till death seized his stout body  in pückler muskau’s letters that german prince describes a bout with hrh who in his best time was such a powerful toper that “six bottles of claret after dinner scarce made a perceptible change in his countenance”  “i remember” says pückler “that one evening—indeed it was past midnight—he took some of his guests among whom were the austrian ambassador count meervelt count beroldingen and myself into his beautiful armoury we tried to swing several turkish sabres but none of us had a very firm grasp whence it happened that the duke and meervelt both scratched themselves with a sort of straight indian sword so as to draw blood meervelt then wished to try if the sword cut as well as a damascus and attempted to cut through one of the wax candles that stood on the table the experiment answered so ill that both the candles candlesticks and all fell to the ground and were extinguished while we were groping in the dark and trying to find the door the duke’s aide de camp stammered out in great agitation ‘by g—— sir i remember the sword is poisoned’  “you may conceive the agreeable feelings of the wounded at this intelligence happily on further examination it appeared that claret and not poison was at the bottom of the colonel’s exclamation”  and now i have one more story of the bacchanalian sort in which clarence and york and the very highest personage of the realm the great prince regent all play parts the feast took place at the pavilion at brighton and was described to me by a gentleman who was present at the scene in gilray’s caricatures and amongst fox’s jolly associates there figures a great nobleman the duke of norfolk called jockey of norfolk in his time and celebrated for his table exploits he had quarrelled with the prince like the rest of the whigs but a sort of reconciliation had taken place and now being a very old man the prince invited him to dine and sleep at the pavilion and the old duke drove over from his castle of arundel with his famous equipage of grey horses still remembered in sussex  the prince of wales had concocted with his royal brothers a notable scheme for making the old man drunk every person at table was enjoined to drink wine with the duke—a challenge which the old toper did not refuse he soon began to see that there was a conspiracy against him he drank glass for glass he overthrew many of the brave at last the first gentleman of europe proposed bumpers of brandy one of the royal brothers filled a great glass for the duke he stood up and tossed off the drink “now” says he “i will have my carriage and go home” the prince urged upon him his previous promise to sleep under the roof where he had been so generously entertained “no” he said he had had enough of such hospitality a trap had been set for him he would leave the place at once and never enter its doors more  the carriage was called and came but in the halfhour’s interval the liquor had proved too potent for the old man his host’s generous purpose was answered and the duke’s old grey head lay stupefied on the table nevertheless when his postchaise was announced he staggered to it as well as he could and stumbling in bade the postilions drive to arundel they drove him for half an hour round and round the pavilion lawn the poor old man fancied he was going home when he awoke that morning he was in bed at the prince’s hideous house at brighton you may see the place now for sixpence they have fiddlers there every day and sometimes buffoons and mountebanks hire the riding house and do their tricks and tumbling there the trees are still there and the gravel walks round which the poor old sinner was trotted i can fancy the flushed faces of the royal princes as they support themselves at the portico pillars and look on at old norfolk’s disgrace but i can’t fancy how the man who perpetrated it continued to be called a gentleman  from drinking the pleased muse now turns to gambling of which in his youth our prince was a great practitioner he was a famous pigeon for the playmen they lived upon him egalité orleans it was believed punished him severely a noble lord whom we shall call the marquis of steyne is said to have mulcted him in immense sums he frequented the clubs where play was then almost universal and as it was known his debts of honour were sacred whilst he was gambling jews waited outside to purchase his notes of hand his transactions on the turf were unlucky as well as discreditable though i believe he and his jockey and his horse escape were all innocent in that affair which created so much scandal  arthur’s almack’s bootle’s and white’s were the chief clubs of the young men of fashion there was play at all and decayed noblemen and brokendown senators fleeced the unwary there in selwyn’s letters we find carlisle devonshire coventry queensberry all undergoing the probation charles fox a dreadful gambler was cheated in very late times—lost 200000l at play gibbon tells of his playing for twentytwo hours at a sitting and losing 500l an hour that indomitable punter said that the greatest pleasure in life after winning was losing what hours what nights what health did he waste over the devil’s books i was going to say what peace of mind but he took his losses very philosophically after an awful night’s play and the enjoyment of the greatest pleasure but one in life he was found on a sofa tranquilly reading an eclogue of virgil  play survived long after the wild prince and fox had given up the dicebox the dandies continued it byron brummell—how many names could i mention of men of the world who have suffered by it in 1837 occurred a famous trial which pretty nigh put an end to gambling in england a peer of the realm was found cheating at whist and repeatedly seen to practise the trick called sauter la coupe his friends at the clubs saw him cheat and went on playing with him one greenhorn who had discovered his foul play asked an old hand what he should do “do” said the mammon of unrighteousness “back him you fool” the best efforts were made to screen him people wrote him anonymous letters and warned him but he would cheat and they were obliged to find him out since that day when my lord’s shame was made public the gamingtable has lost all its splendour shabby jews and blacklegs prowl about racecourses and tavern parlours and now and then inveigle silly yokels with greasy packs of cards in railroad ears but play is a deposed goddess her worshippers bankrupt and her table in rags  so is another famous british institution gone to decay—the ring the noble practice of british boxing which in my youth was still almost flourishing  the prince in his early days was a great patron of this national sport as his granduncle culloden cumberland had been before him but being present at a fight at brighton where one of the combatants was killed the prince pensioned the boxer’s widow and declared he never would attend another battle “but nevertheless”—i read in the noble language of pierce egan whose smaller work on pugilism i have the honour to possess—“he thought it a manly and decided english feature which ought not to be destroyed his majesty had a drawing of the sporting characters in the fives court placed in his boudoir to remind him of his former attachment and support of true courage and when any fight of note occurred after he was king accounts of it were read to him by his desire” that gives one a fine image of a king taking his recreation—at ease in a royal dressinggown—too majestic to read himself ordering the prime minister to read him accounts of battles how cribb punched molyneux’s eye or jack randall thrashed the game chicken  where my prince did actually distinguish himself was in driving he drove once in four hours and a half from brighton to carlton house—fiftysix miles all the young men of that day were fond of that sport but the fashion of rapid driving deserted england and i believe trotted over to america where are the amusements of our youth i hear of no gambling now but amongst obscure ruffians of no boxing but amongst the lowest rabble one solitary fourinhand still drove round the parks in london last year but that charioteer must soon disappear he was very old he was attired after the fashion of the year 1825 he must drive to the banks of styx ere long—where the ferryboat waits to carry him over to the defunct revellers who boxed and gambled and drank and drove with king george  the bravery of the brunswicks that all the family must have it that george possessed it are points which all english writers have agreed to admit and yet i cannot see how george iv should have been endowed with this quality swaddled in featherbeds all his life lazy obese perpetually eating and drinking his education was quite unlike that of his tough old progenitors his grandsires had confronted hardship and war and ridden up and fired their pistols undaunted into the face of death his father had conquered luxury and overcome indolence here was one who never resisted any temptation never had a desire but he coddled and pampered it if ever he had any nerve frittered it away among cooks and tailors and barbers and furnituremongers and opera dancers what muscle would not grow flaccid in such a life—a life that was never strung up to any action—an endless capua without any campaign—all fiddling and flowers and feasting and flattery and folly when george iii was pressed by the catholic question and the india bill he said he would retire to hanover rather than yield upon either point and he would have done what he said but before yielding he was determined to fight his ministers and parliament and he did and he beat them the time came when george iv was pressed too upon the catholic claims the cautious peel had slipped over to that side the grim old wellington had joined it and peel tells us in his memoirs what was the conduct of the king he at first refused to submit whereupon peel and the duke offered their resignations which their gracious master accepted he did these two gentlemen the honour peel says to kiss them both when they went away fancy old arthur’s grim countenance and eagle beak as the monarch kisses it when they were gone he sent after them surrendered and wrote to them a letter begging them to remain in office and allowing them to have their way then his majesty had a meeting with eldon which is related at curious length in the latter’s memoirs he told eldon what was not true about his interview with the new catholic converts utterly misled the old exchancellor cried whimpered fell on his neck and kissed him too we know old eldon’s own tears were pumped very freely did these two fountains gush together i can’t fancy a behaviour more unmanly imbecile pitiable this a defender of the faith this a chief in the crisis of a great nation this an inheritor of the courage of the georges many of my hearers no doubt have journeyed to the pretty old town of brunswick in company with that most worthy prudent and polite gentleman the earl of malmesbury and fetched away princess caroline for her longing husband the prince of wales old queen charlotte would have had her eldest son marry a niece of her own that famous louisa of strelitz afterwards queen of prussia and who shares with marie antoinette in the last age the sad preeminence of beauty and misfortune but george iii had a niece at brunswick she was a richer princess than her serene highness of strelitz—in fine the princess caroline was selected to marry the heir to the english throne we follow my lord malmesbury in quest of her we are introduced to her illustrious father and royal mother we witness the balls and fêtes of the old court we are presented to the princess herself with her fair hair her blue eyes and her impertinent shoulders—a lively bouncing romping princess who takes the advice of her courtly english mentor most generously and kindly we can be present at her very toilette if we like regarding which and for very good reasons the british courtier implores her to be particular what a strange court what a queer privacy of morals and manners do we look into shall we regard it as preachers and moralists and cry woe against the open vice and selfishness and corruption or look at it as we do at the king in the pantomime with his pantomime wife and pantomime courtiers whose big heads he knocks together whom he pokes with his pantomime sceptre whom he orders to prison under the guard of his pantomime beefeaters as he sits down to dine on his pantomime pudding it is grave it is sad it is theme most curious for moral and political speculation it is monstrous grotesque laughable with its prodigious littlenesses etiquettes ceremonials sham moralities it is as serious as a sermon and as absurd and outrageous as punch’s puppetshow  malmesbury tells us of the private life of the duke princess caroline’s father who was to die like his warlike son in arms against the french presents us to his courtiers his favourite his duchess george iii’s sister a grim old princess who took the british envoy aside and told him wicked old stories of wicked old dead people and times who came to england afterwards when her nephew was regent and lived in a shabby furnished lodging old and dingy and deserted and grotesque but somehow royal and we go with him to the duke to demand the princess’s hand in form and we hear the brunswick guns fire their adieux of salute as hrh the princess of wales departs in the frost and snow and we visit the domains of the prince bishop of osnaburg—the duke of york of our early time and we dodge about from the french revolutionists whose ragged legions are pouring over holland and germany and gaily trampling down the old world to the tune of Ça ira and we take shipping at slade and we land at greenwich where the princess’s ladies and the prince’s ladies are in waiting to receive her royal highness                                illustration  what a history follows arrived in london the bridegroom hastened eagerly to receive his bride when she was first presented to him lord malmesbury says she very properly attempted to kneel he raised her gracefully enough embraced her and turning round to me said—  “harris i am not well pray get me a glass of brandy”  i said “sir had you not better have a glass of water”  upon which much out of humour he said with an oath “no i will go to the queen”  what could be expected from a wedding which had such a beginning—from such a bridegroom and such a bride i am not going to carry you through the scandal of that story or follow the poor princess through all her vagaries her balls and her dances her travels to jerusalem and naples her jigs and her junketings and her tears as i read her trial in history i vote she is not guilty i don’t say it is an impartial verdict but as one reads her story the heart bleeds for the kindly generous outraged creature if wrong there be let it lie at his door who wickedly thrust her from it spite of her follies the great hearty people of england loved and protected and pitied her “god bless you we will bring your husband back to you” said a mechanic one day as she told lady charlotte bury with tears streaming down her cheeks they could not bring that husband back they could not cleanse that selfish heart was hers the only one he had wounded steeped in selfishness impotent for faithful attachment and manly enduring love—had it not survived remorse was it not accustomed to desertion  malmesbury gives us the beginning of the marriage story—how the prince reeled into chapel to be married how he hiccupped out his vows of fidelity—you know how he kept them how he pursued the woman whom he had married to what a state he brought her with what blows he struck her with what malignity he pursued her what his treatment of his daughter was and what his own life he the first gentleman of europe there is no stronger satire on the proud english society of that day than that they admired george  no thank god we can tell of better gentlemen and whilst our eyes turn away shocked from this monstrous image of pride vanity weakness they may see in that england over which the last george pretended to reign some who merit indeed the title of gentlemen some who make our hearts beat when we hear their names and whose memory we fondly salute when that of yonder imperial manikin is tumbled into oblivion i will take men of my own profession of letters i will take walter scott who loved the king and who was his sword and buckler and championed him like that brave highlander in his own story who fights round his craven chief what a good gentleman what a friendly soul what a generous hand what an amiable life was that of the noble sir walter i will take another man of letters whose life i admire even more—an english worthy doing his duty for fifty noble years of labour day by day storing up learning day by day working for scant wages most charitable out of his small means bravely faithful to the calling which he had chosen refusing to turn from his path for popular praise or princes’ favour—i mean robert southey we have left his old political landmarks miles and miles behind we protest against his dogmatism nay we begin to forget it and his politics but i hope his life will not be forgotten for it is sublime in its simplicity its energy its honour its affection in the combat between time and thalaba i suspect the former destroyer has conquered kehama’s curse frightens very few readers now but southey’s private letters are worth piles of epics and are sure to last among us as long as kind hearts like to sympathize with goodness and purity and love and upright life “if your feelings are like mine” he writes to his wife “i will not go to lisbon without you or i will stay at home and not part from you for though not unhappy when away still without you i am not happy for your sake as well as my own and little edith’s i will not consent to any separation the growth of a year’s love between her and me if it please god she should live is a thing too delightful in itself and too valuable in its consequences to be given up for any light inconvenience on your part or mine on these things we will talk at leisure only dear dear edith we must not part”  this was a poor literary gentleman the first gentleman in europe had a wife and daughter too did he love them so was he faithful to them did he sacrifice ease for them or show them the sacred examples of religion and honour heaven gave the great english prodigal no such good fortune peel proposed to make a baronet of southey and to this advancement the king agreed the poet nobly rejected the offered promotion  “i have” he wrote “a pension of 200l a year conferred upon me by the good offices of my old friend c wynn and i have the laureateship the salary of the latter was immediately appropriated as far as it went to a life insurance for 3000l which with an earlier insurance is the sole provision i have made for my family all beyond must be derived from my own industry writing for a livelihood a livelihood is all that i have gained for having also something better in view and never therefore having courted popularity nor written for the mere sake of gain it has not been possible for me to lay by anything last year for the first time in my life i was provided with a year’s expenditure beforehand this exposition may show how unbecoming and unwise it would be to accept the rank which so greatly to my honour you have solicited for me”  how noble his poverty is compared to the wealth of his master his acceptance even of a pension was made the object of his opponents’ satire but think of the merit and modesty of this state pensioner and that other enormous drawer of public money who receives 100000l a year and comes to parliament with a request for 650000l more  another true knight of those days was cuthbert collingwood and i think since heaven made gentlemen there is no record of a better one than that of brighter deeds i grant you we may read performed by others but where of a nobler kinder more beautiful life of duty of a gentler truer heart beyond dazzle of success and blaze of genius i fancy shining a hundred and a hundred times higher the sublime purity of collingwood’s gentle glory his heroism stirs british hearts when we recall it his love and goodness and piety make one thrill with happy emotion as one reads of him and his great comrade going into the victory with which their names are immortally connected how the old english word comes up and that old english feeling of what i should like to call christian honour what gentlemen they were what great hearts they had “we can my dear coll” writes nelson to him “have no little jealousies we have only one great object in view—that of meeting the enemy and getting a glorious peace for our country” at trafalgar when the royal sovereign was pressing alone into the midst of the combined fleets lord nelson said to captain blackwood “see how that noble fellow collingwood takes his ship into action how i envy him” the very same throb and impulse of heroic generosity was beating in collingwood’s honest bosom as he led into the fight he said “what would nelson give to be here”  after the action of the 1st of june he writes—“we cruised for a few days like disappointed people looking for what they could not find until the morning of little sarah’s birthday between eight and nine o’clock when the french fleet of twentyfive sail of the line was discovered to windward we chased them and they bore down within about five miles of us the night was spent in watching and preparation for the succeeding day and many a blessing did i send forth to my sarah lest i should never bless her more at dawn we made our approach on the enemy then drew up dressed our ranks and it was about eight when the admiral made the signal for each ship to engage her opponent and bring her to close action and then down we went under a crowd of sail and in a manner that would have animated the coldest heart and struck terror into the most intrepid enemy the ship we were to engage was two ahead of the french admiral so we had to go through his fire and that of two ships next to him and received all their broadsides two or three times before we fired a gun it was then near ten o’clock i observed to the admiral that about that time our wives were going to church but that i thought the peal we should ring about the frenchman’s ears would outdo their parish bells”  there are no words to tell what the heart feels in reading the simple phrases of such a hero here is victory and courage but love sublimer and superior here is a christian soldier spending the night before battle in watching and preparing for the succeeding day thinking of his dearest home and sending many blessings forth to his sarah “lest he should never bless her more” who would not say amen to his supplication it was a benediction to his country—the prayer of that intrepid loving heart  we have spoken of a good soldier and good men of letters as specimens of english gentlemen of the age just past may we not also—many of my elder hearers i am sure have read and fondly remember his delightful story—speak of a good divine and mention reginald heber as one of the best of english gentlemen the charming poet the happy possessor of all sorts of gifts and accomplishments birth wit fame high character competence—he was the beloved parish priest in his own home of hoderel “counselling his people in their troubles advising them in their difficulties comforting them in distress kneeling often at their sickbeds at the hazard of his own life exhorting encouraging where there was need where there was strife the peacemaker where there was want the free giver”  when the indian bishopric was offered to him he refused at first but after communing with himself and committing his case to the quarter whither such pious men are wont to carry their doubts he withdrew his refusal and prepared himself for his mission and to leave his beloved parish “little children love one another and forgive one another” were the last sacred words he said to his weeping people he parted with them knowing perhaps he should see them no more like those other good men of whom we have just spoken love and duty were his life’s aim happy he happy they who were so gloriously faithful to both he writes to his wife those charming lines on his journey—       if thou my love wert by my side my babies at my knee     how gladly would our pinnace glide o’er gunga’s mimic sea      i miss thee at the dawning grey when on our deck reclined     in careless ease my limbs i lay and woo the cooler wind      i miss thee when by gunga’s stream my twilight steps i guide     but most beneath the lamp’s pale beam i miss thee by my side      i spread my books my pencil try the lingering noon to cheer     but miss thy kind approving eye thy meek attentive ear      but when of morn and eve the star beholds me on my knee     i feel though thou art distant far thy prayers ascend for me      then on then on where duty leads my course be onward still—     o’er broad hindostan’s sultry meads o’er bleak almorah’s hill      that course nor delhi’s kingly gates nor wild malwah detain     for sweet the bliss us both awaits by yonder western main      thy towers bombay gleam bright they say across the dark blue                 sea     but ne’er were hearts so blithe and gay as there shall meet in                 thee   is it not collingwood and sarah and southey and edith his affection is part of his life what were life without it without love i can fancy no gentleman  how touching is a remark heber makes in his travels through india that on inquiring of the natives at a town which of the governors of india stood highest in the opinion of the people he found that though lord wellesley and warren hastings were honoured as the two greatest men who had ever ruled this part of the world the people spoke with chief affection of judge cleaveland who had died aged twentynine in 1784 the people have built a monument over him and still hold a religious feast in his memory so does his own country still tend with a heart’s regard the memory of the gentle heber  and cleaveland died in 1784 and is still loved by the heathen is he why that year 1784 was remarkable in the life of our friend the first gentleman of europe do you not know that he was twentyone in that year and opened carlton house with a grand ball to the nobility and gentry and doubtless wore that lovely pink coat which we have described i was eager to read about the ball and looked to the old magazines for information the entertainment took place on the 10th february in the european magazine of march 1784 i came straightway upon it—  “the alterations at carlton house being finished we lay before our readers a description of the state apartments as they appeared on the 10th instant when hrh gave a grand ball to the principal nobility and gentry the entrance to the state room fills the mind with an inexpressible idea of greatness and splendour  “the state chair is of a gold frame covered with crimson damask on each corner of the feet is a lion’s head expressive of fortitude and strength the feet of the chair have serpents twining round them to denote wisdom facing the throne appears the helmet of minerva and over the windows glory is represented by st george with a superb gloria  “but the saloon may be styled the chefd’œuvre and in every ornament discovers great invention it is hung with a figured lemon satin the windowcurtains sofas and chairs are of the same colour the ceiling is ornamented with emblematical paintings representing the graces and muses together with jupiter mercury apollo and paris two ormolu chandeliers are placed here it is impossible by expression to do justice to the extraordinary workmanship as well as design of the ornaments they each consist of a palm branching out in five directions for the reception of lights a beautiful figure of a rural nymph is represented entwining the stems of the tree with wreaths of flowers in the centre of the room is a rich chandelier to see this apartment dans son plus beau jour it should be viewed in the glass over the chimneypiece the range of apartments from the saloon to the ballroom when the doors are open formed one of the grandest spectacles that ever was beheld”  in the gentleman’s magazine for the very same month and year—march 1784—is an account of another festival in which another great gentleman of english extraction is represented as taking a principal share—  “according to order he the commanderinchief was admitted to a public audience of congress and being seated the president after a pause informed him that the united states assembled were ready to receive his communications whereupon he arose and spoke as follows—  “ ‘mr president—the great events on which my resignation depended having at length taken place i present myself before congress to surrender into their hands the trust committed to me and to claim the indulgence of retiring from the service of my country  “ ‘happy in the confirmation of our independence and sovereignty i resign the appointment i accepted with diffidence which however was superseded by a confidence in the rectitude of our cause the support of the supreme power of the nation and the patronage of heaven i close this last act of my official life by commending the interests of our dearest country to the protection of almighty god and those who have the superintendence of them to his holy keeping having finished the work assigned me i retire from the great theatre of action and bidding an affectionate farewell to this august body under whose orders i have so long acted i here offer my commission and take my leave of the employments of my public life’ to which the president replied—  “ ‘sir having defended the standard of liberty in the new world having taught a lesson useful to those who inflict and those who feel oppression you retire with the blessings of your fellow citizens though the glory of your virtues will not terminate with your military command but will descend to remotest ages’ ”  which was the most splendid spectacle ever witnessed—the opening feast of prince george in london or the resignation of washington which is the noble character for afterages to admire—yon fribble dancing in lace and spangles or yonder hero who sheathes his sword after a life of spotless honour a purity unreproached a courage indomitable and a consummate victory which of these is the true gentleman what is it to be a gentleman is it to have lofty aims to lead a pure life to keep your honour virgin to have the esteem of your fellow citizens and the love of your fireside to bear good fortune meekly to suffer evil with constancy and through evil or good to maintain truth always show me the happy man whose life exhibits these qualities and him we will salute as gentleman whatever his rank may be show me the prince who possesses them and he may be sure of our love and loyalty the heart of britain still beats kindly for george iii—not because he was wise and just but because he was pure in life honest in intent and because according to his lights he worshipped heaven i think we acknowledge in the inheritrix of his sceptre a wiser rule and a life as honourable and pure and i am sure the future painter of our manners will pay a willing allegiance to that good life and be loyal to the memory of that unsullied virtue       footnotes       1 the influence of scott on thackeray is undoubted and freely       confessed but i cannot fall in with “certain persons of       distinction” in making esmond very specially indebted to       woodstock woodstock is a very great book in itself and amazing       when one knows its circumstances but it is even for scott very       specially and exclusively objective esmond is subjective also       in the highest degree      2 this form which he used elsewhere than in the biographia       literaria is better than esemplastic which he employed there      3 the justice or accuracy of his individual presentments and even of       his general view of the time is quite another matter we may touch       on part of it presently but the real point is that the whole is of       a piece at least in potentia that it gives a world that might       have existed      4 the lectures on the humourists were of course delivered before       esmond was published but in another sense they are only       aftercrops or byproducts the notes sometimes very interesting       are james hannay’s      5 as might perhaps have been expected from its original appearance       not piecemeal but in the regular threevolume form esmond was not       very much altered by its author in later issues there was indeed       a “revised” edition in 1858 in which a considerable number of minor       changes nearly all for the better were made these have been       carefully considered but in practically every case there was really       nothing to do but to follow them silently for it would be absurd       in the present edition to chronicle solemnly the rectification of       mere misprints like “hoxton” for “hexton” or the change from       “was never” to “never was” in some points of orthography       “chelsea” and “chelsey” for instance thackeray never reached       full consistency and he has sometimes been caught in the       intricacies of the castlewood relations and nomenclature c so       too walcote which is near wells at first moves to the       neighbourhood of winchester later and there are other       characteristic oversights but on the whole there is little need       of comment and none of variants save in a very few instances       where the “revised” edition seems to have been altered for the       worse        on the other hand in recent editions of thackeray published by his       representatives considerable alterations to the english       humourists c in text and notes have been introduced dates       being changed in accordance with later researches quotations in       which thackeray was pretty lax adjusted to their originals and so       forth as the chief authorities consulted in making these       alterations were the late sir leslie stephen mr austin dobson and       mr sidney lee there need not be much question as to their       accuracy and it perhaps shows undue hardihood in the present editor       not to adopt them but it seems to him that thackeray’s books are       not so much textbooks of history literary and other where       accuracy is the first point as literature where it is not such       corrections could be most properly introduced in the notes of a       fuller commentated edition less so it may seem in an almost       unannotated text in particular thackeray’s misquotations they       are not seldom distinct improvements sometimes directly form the       basis of his own remarks which become less apposite if the       citations are corrected        as the text of this volume has few original illustrations some       miscellaneous sketches are added to it      6 lionel tipton created baron bergamot ann 1686 gentleman usher of       the back stairs and

without issue no groom of the posset was appointed by the       prince of orange nor hath there been such an officer in any       succeeding reign      7 to have this rank of marquis restored in the

castlewood i have heard that her ladyship       sent almost the whole of the money to king james a proceeding which       so irritated my lord castlewood that he actually went to the parish       church and was only appeased by the marquis’s title which his       exiled majesty sent to him in return for the 15000l his faithful       subject lent him      8 Ὄ πόποι οἷον δή νυ θεοὺς βροτοὶ

walcote who hath ever since remained with me—h e     10 this passage in the memoirs of esmond is written on a leaf inserted       into the ms book and dated 1744 probably after he had heard of       the duchess’s death     11 our grandfather’s hatred of the duke of marlborough appears all       through his account of these campaigns he always persisted that the       duke was the greatest traitor and soldier history ever told of and       declared that he took bribes on all hands during the war my lord       marquis for so we may call him here though he never went by any       other name than colonel esmond was in the habit of telling many       stories which he did not set down in his memoirs and which he had       from his friend the jesuit who was not always correctly informed       and who persisted that marlborough was looking for a bribe of two       millions of crowns before the campaign of ramillies        and our grandmother used to tell us children that on his first       presentation to my lord duke the duke turned his back upon my       grandfather and said to the duchess who told my lady dowager at       chelsea who afterwards told colonel esmond—“tom esmond’s bastard       has been to my levee he has the hangdog look of his rogue of a       father”—an expression which my grandfather never forgave he was as       constant in his dislikes as in his attachments and exceedingly       partial to webb whose side he took against the more celebrated       general we have general webb’s portrait now at castlewood va     12 ’tis not thus woman loves col

favour at court with whom beatrix esmond had       communication and two noblemen of the greatest rank and a member       of the house of commons who was implicated in more transactions       than one in behalf of the stuart family     17 there can be very little doubt that the doctor mentioned by my dear       father was the famous dr arbuthnot—r e w     18 my dear father saith quite truly that his manner towards our sex       was uniformly courteous from my infancy upwards he treated me with       an extreme gentleness as though i was a little lady i can scarce       remember though i tried him often ever hearing a rough word from       him nor was he less grave and kind in his manner to the humblest       negresses on his estate he was familiar with no one except my       mother and it was delightful to witness up to the very last days       the confidence between them he was obeyed eagerly by all under him       and my mother and all her household lived in a constant emulation to       please him and quite a terror lest in any way they should offend       him he was the humblest man with all this the least exacting the       most easily contented and mr benson our minister at castlewood       who attended him at the last ever said—“i know not what colonel       esmond’s doctrine was but his life and death were those of a devout       christian”—r e w     19 this remark shows how unjustly and contemptuously even the best of       men will sometimes judge of our sex lady esmond had no intention of       triumphing over her daughter but from a sense of duty alone pointed       out her deplorable wrong—r e     20 in london we addressed the prince as royal highness invariably       though the women persisted in giving him the title of king     21 the anecdote is frequently told of our performer rich     22 he was from a younger branch of the swifts of yorkshire his       grandfather the rev thomas swift vicar of goodrich in       herefordshire suffered for his loyalty in charles i’s time that       gentleman married elizabeth dryden a member of the family of the       poet sir walter scott gives with his characteristic minuteness in       such points the exact relationship between these famous men swift       was “the son of dryden’s second cousin” swift too was the enemy       of dryden’s reputation witness the battle of the books—“the       difference was greatest among the horse” says he of the moderns       “where every private trooper pretended to the command from tasso       and milton to dryden and withers” and in poetry a rhapsody he       advises the poetaster to—        read all the prefaces of dryden       for these our critics much confide in       though merely writ at first for filling       to raise the volume’s price a shilling        “cousin swift you will never be a poet” was the phrase of dryden       to his kinsman which remained alive in a memory tenacious of such       matters     23 “miss hetty” she was called in the family—where her face and her       dress and sir william’s treatment of her all made the real fact       about her birth plain enough sir william left her a thousand       pounds     24 sometimes during his mental affliction he continued walking about       the house for many consecutive hours sometimes he remained in a       kind of torpor at times he would seem to struggle to bring into       distinct consciousness and shape into expression the intellect       that lay smothering under gloomy obstruction in him a pierglass       falling by accident nearly fell on him he said he wished it had       he once repeated slowly several times “i am what i am” the last       thing he wrote was an epigram on the building of a magazine for arms       and stores which was pointed out to him as he went abroad during       his mental disease—        behold a proof of irish sense       here irish wit is seen       when nothing’s left that’s worth defence       they build a magazine     25 besides these famous books of scott’s and johnson’s there is a       copious life by thomas sheridan dr johnson’s “sherry” father       of richard brinsley and son of that goodnatured clever irish       doctor thomas sheridan swift’s intimate who lost his chaplaincy       by so unluckily choosing for a text on the king’s birthday       “sufficient for the day is the evil thereof” not to mention less       important works there is also the remarks on the life and writings       of dr jonathan swift by that polite and dignified writer the       earl of orrery his lordship is said to have striven for literary       renown chiefly that he might make up for the slight passed on him       by his father who left his library away from him it is to be       feared that the ink he used to wash out that stain only made it look       bigger he had however known swift and corresponded with people       who knew him his work which appeared in 1751 provoked a good deal       of controversy calling out among other brochures the interesting       observations on lord orrery’s remarks c of dr delany     26 dr wilde’s book was written on the occasion of the remains of swift       and stella being brought to the light of day—a thing which happened       in 1835 when certain works going on in st patrick’s cathedral       dublin afforded an opportunity of their being examined one hears       with surprise of these skulls “going the rounds” of houses and       being made the objects of dilettante curiosity the larynx of       swift was actually carried off phrenologists had a low opinion of       his intellect from the observations they took        dr wilde traces the symptoms of illhealth in swift as detailed in       his writings from time to time he observes likewise that the       skull gave evidence of “diseased action” of the brain during       life—such as would be produced by an increasing tendency to       “cerebral congestion”     27 “he dr johnson seemed to me to have an unaccountable prejudice       against swift for i once took the liberty to ask him if swift had       personally offended him and he told me he had not”—boswell’s tour       to the hebrides     28 few men to be sure dared this experiment but yet their success       was encouraging one gentleman made a point of asking the dean       whether his uncle godwin had not given him his education swift who       hated that subject cordially and indeed cared little for his       kindred said sternly “yes he gave me the education of a dog”       “then sir” cried the other striking his fist on the table “you       have not the gratitude of a dog”        other occasions there were when a bold face gave the dean pause       even after his irish almostroyal position was established but he       brought himself into greater danger on a certain occasion and the       amusing circumstances may be once more repeated here he had       unsparingly lashed the notable dublin lawyer mr serjeant

the serjeant it is said swore to have his life he presented       himself at the deanery the dean asked his name “sir i am serjeant       bettesworth”        “in what regiment pray” asked swift        a guard of volunteers formed themselves to defend the dean at this       time     29 “but my hamilton i will never hide the freedom of my sentiments       from you i am much inclined to believe that the temper of my friend       swift might occasion his english friends to wish him happily and       properly promoted at a distance his spirit for i would give it the       proper name was ever untractable the motions of his genius were       often irregular he assumed more the air of a patron than of a       friend he affected rather to dictate than advise”—orrery     30 “an anecdote which though only told by mrs pilkington is well       attested bears that the last time he was in london he went to dine       with the earl of burlington who was but newly married the earl it       is supposed being willing to have a little diversion did not       introduce him to his lady nor mention his name after dinner said       the dean ‘lady burlington i hear you can sing sing me a song’       the lady looked on this unceremonious manner of asking a favour with       distaste and positively refused he said ‘she should sing or he       would make her why madam i suppose you take me for one of your       poor english hedgeparsons sing when i bid you’ as the earl did       nothing but laugh at this freedom the lady was so vexed that she       burst into tears and retired his first compliment to her when he       saw her again was ‘pray madam are you as proud and illnatured       now as when i saw you last’ to which she answered with great good       humour ‘no mr dean i’ll sing for you if you please’ from which       time he conceived a great esteem for her”—scott’s life “he had       not the least tincture of vanity in his conversation he was       perhaps as he said himself too proud to be vain when he was       polite it was in a manner entirely his own in his friendships he       was constant and undisguised he was the same in his       enmities”—orrery     31 “i make no figure but at court where i affect to turn from a lord       to the meanest of my acquaintances”—journal to stella        “i am plagued with bad authors verse and prose who send me their       books and poems the vilest i ever saw but i have given their names       to my man never to let them see me”—journal to stella        the following curious paragraph illustrates the life of a courtier—        “did i ever tell you that the lord treasurer hears ill with the left       ear just as i do i dare not tell him that i am so sir for       fear he should think that i counterfeited to make my       court”—journal to stella     32 the war of pamphlets was carried on fiercely on one side and the       other and the whig attacks made the ministry swift served very       sore bolingbroke laid hold of several of the opposition       pamphleteers and bewails their “factitiousness” in the following       letter—        “bolingbroke to the earl of strafford        “whitehall july 23rd 1712        “it is a melancholy consideration that the laws of our country are       too weak to punish effectually those factitious scribblers who       presume to blacken the brightest characters and to give even       scurrilous language to those who are in the first degrees of honour       this my lord among others is a symptom of the decayed condition       of our government and serves to show how fatally we mistake       licentiousness for liberty all i could do was to take up hart the       printer to send him to newgate and to bind him over upon bail to       be prosecuted this i have done and if i can arrive at legal proof       against the author ridpath he shall have the same treatment”        swift was not behind his illustrious friend in this virtuous       indignation in the history of the four last years of the queen the       dean speaks in the most edifying manner of the licentiousness of the       press and the abusive language of the other party        “it must be acknowledged that the bad practices of printers have       been such as to deserve the severest animadversion from the       public the adverse party full of rage and leisure since their       fall and unanimous in their cause employ a set of writers by       subscription who are well versed in all the topics of defamation       and have a style and genius levelled to the generality of their       readers however the mischiefs of the press were too exorbitant       to be cured by such a remedy as a tax upon small papers and a bill       for a much more effectual regulation of it was brought into the       house of commons but so late in the session that there was no time       to pass it for there always appeared an unwillingness to cramp       overmuch the liberty of the press”        but to a clause in the proposed bill that the names of authors       should be set to every printed book pamphlet or paper his       reverence objects altogether for says he “beside the objection to       this clause from the practice of pious men who in publishing       excellent writings for the service of religion have chosen out of       an humble christian spirit to conceal their names it is certain       that all persons of true genius or knowledge have an invincible       modesty and suspicion of themselves upon first sending their       thoughts into the world”        this “invincible modesty” was no doubt the sole reason which induced       the dean to keep the secret of the drapier’s letters and a hundred       humble christian works of which he was the author as for the       opposition the doctor was for dealing severely with them he writes       to stella—        journal letter xix        “london march 25th 171011        “ we have let guiscard

and       his english birth makes its mark strikingly enough every now and       then in his writings thus in a letter to pope scott’s swift       vol xix p 97 he says—        “we have had your volume of letters some of those who highly       value you and a few who knew you personally are grieved to find       you make no distinction between the english gentry of this kingdom       and the savage old irish who are only the vulgar and some       gentlemen who live in the irish parts of the kingdom but the       english colonies who are three parts in four are much more       civilized than many counties in england and speak better english       and are much better bred”        and again in the fourth drapier’s letter we have the following—        “a short paper printed at bristol and reprinted here reports mr       wood to say ‘that he wonders at the impudence and insolence of the       irish in refusing his coin’ when by the way it is the true       english people of ireland who refuse it although we take it for       granted that the irish will do so too whenever they are       asked”—scott’s swift vol iv p 143        he goes further in a goodhumoured satirical paper on barbarous       denominations in ireland where after abusing as he was wont the       scotch cadence as well as expression he advances to the “irish       brogue” and speaking of the “censure” which it brings down says—        “and what is yet worse it is too well known that the bad       consequence of this opinion affects those among us who are not the       least liable to such reproaches farther than the misfortune of being       born in ireland although of english parents and whose education       has been chiefly in that kingdom”—ibid vol vii p 149        but indeed if we are to

fortunate in their expression when they placed a man’s happiness in       the tranquillity of his mind and indolence of body for while we are       composed of both i doubt both must have a share in the good or ill       we feel as men of several languages say the same things in very       different words so in several ages countries constitutions of       laws and religion the same thing seems

indignities he suffered in his household from the       subjoined extracts from the journal to stella—        “i called at mr secretary the other day to see what the d—— ailed       him on sunday i made him a very proper speech told him i observed       he was much out of temper that i did not expect he would tell me       the cause but would be glad to see he was in better and one thing       i warned him of—never to appear cold to me for i would not be       treated like a schoolboy that i had felt too much of that in my       life already” meaning sir william temple c c—journal to

     a conversation on the dean’s pamphlets excited one of the doctor’s       liveliest sallies “one in particular praised his conduct of the       allies—johnson ‘sir his conduct of the allies is a performance       of very little ability why sir tom davies might have written       the conduct of the allies’ ”—boswell’s life of johnson     42 “whenever he fell into the company of any person for the first time       it was his custom to try their tempers and disposition by some       abrupt question that bore the appearance of rudeness if this were       well taken and answered with good humour he afterwards made amends       by his civilities but if he saw any marks of resentment from       alarmed pride vanity or conceit he dropped all further       intercourse with the party this will be illustrated by an anecdote       of that sort related by mrs pilkington after supper the dean       having decanted a bottle of wine poured what remained into a glass       and seeing it was muddy presented it to mr pilkington to drink it       ‘for’ said he ‘i always keep some poor parson to drink the foul       wine for me’ mr pilkington entering into his humour thanked him       and told him ‘he did not know the difference but was glad to get a       glass at any rate’ ‘why then’ said the dean ‘you shan’t for i’ll       drink it myself why —— take you you are wiser than a paltry       curate whom i asked to dine with me a few days ago for upon my       making the same speech to him he said he did not understand such       usage and so walked off without his dinner by the same

have so much learning and experience his       colloquist describes the struldbrugs to him        “he said they commonly acted like mortals till about thirty years       old after which by degrees they grew melancholy and dejected       increasing in both till they came to fourscore this he learned from       their own confession for otherwise there not being above two or       three of that species born in an age they were too few to form a       general observation by when they came to fourscore years which is       reckoned the extremity of living in this country they had not only       all the follies and infirmities of other old men but many more       which arose from the prospect of never dying they were not only       opinionative peevish covetous morose vain talkative but       incapable of friendship and dead to all natural affection which       never descended below their grandchildren envy and impotent desires       are their prevailing passions but those objects against which their       envy seems principally directed are the vices of the younger sort       and the deaths of the old by reflecting on the former they find       themselves cut off from all possibility of pleasure and whenever       they see a funeral they lament and repent that others are gone to       a harbour of rest to which they themselves never can hope to       arrive they have no remembrance of anything but what they learned       and observed in their youth and middle age and even that is very       imperfect and for the truth or particulars of any fact it is safer       to depend on common tradition than upon their best recollections       the least miserable among them appear to be those who turn to       dotage and entirely lose their memories these meet with more pity       and assistance because they want many bad qualities which abound in       others        “if a struldbrug happened to marry one of his own kind the marriage       is dissolved of course by the courtesy of the kingdom as soon as       the younger of the two comes to be fourscore for the law thinks it       to be a reasonable indulgence that those who are condemned without       any fault of their own to a perpetual continuance in the world       should not have their misery doubled by the load of a wife        “as soon as they have completed the term of eighty years they are       looked on as dead in law their heirs immediately succeed to their       estates only a small pittance is reserved for their support and       the poor ones are maintained at the public charge after that       period they are held incapable of any employment of trust or       profit they cannot purchase lands or take leases neither are they       allowed to be witnesses in any cause either civil

names of persons even of       those who are their nearest friends and relatives for the same       reason they can never amuse themselves with reading because their       memory will not serve to carry them from the beginning of a sentence       to the end and by this defect they are deprived of the only       entertainment whereof they might otherwise be capable        “the language of this country being always on the flux the       struldbrugs of one age do not understand those of another neither       are they able after two hundred years to hold any conversation       further than by a few general words with their neighbours the       mortals and thus they lie under the disadvantage of living like       foreigners in their own country        “this was the account given me of the struldbrugs as near as i can       remember i afterwards saw five or six of different ages the       youngest not above two hundred years old who were brought to me       several times by some of my friends but although they were told       ‘that i was a great traveller and had seen all the world’ they had       not the least curiosity to ask me a single question only desired i       would give

  very scanty allowance        “they are despised and hated by all sorts of people when one of       them is born it is reckoned ominous and their birth is recorded       very particularly so that you may know their age by consulting the       register which however has not been kept above a thousand years       past or at least has been destroyed by time or public disturbances       but the usual way of computing how old they are is by asking them       what kings or great persons they can remember and then consulting       history for infallibly the last prince in their mind did not begin

old age they acquired an additional ghastliness in proportion to       their number of years which is not to be described and among half       a dozen i soon distinguished which was the eldest

had a story of her own to tell       about the blue eyes of young jonathan one may say that the book of       swift’s life opens at places kept by these blighted flowers varina       must have a paragraph        she was a miss jane waryng sister to a college chum of his in       1696 when swift was nineteen years old we find him writing a       loveletter to her beginning “impatience is the most inseparable       quality of a lover” but absence made a great difference in his       feelings so four years afterwards the tone is changed he writes       again a very curious letter offering to marry her and putting the       offer in such a way that nobody could possibly accept it        after dwelling on his poverty c he says conditionally “i shall       be blessed to have you in my arms without regarding whether your       person be beautiful or your fortune large cleanliness in the       first and competency in the second is all i ask for”        the editors do not tell us what became of varina in life one would       be glad to know that she met with some worthy partner and lived       long enough to see her little boys laughing over lilliput without       any arrière

  “she was sickly from her childhood until about the age of fifteen       but then she grew into perfect health and was looked upon as one of       the most beautiful graceful and agreeable young women in       london—only a little too fat her hair was blacker than a raven and       every feature of her face in perfection        “ properly speaking”—he goes on with a calmness which under the       circumstances is terrible—“she has been dying six months”        “never was any of her sex born with better gifts of the mind or who       more improved them by reading and conversation all of us who had       the happiness of her friendship agreed unanimously that in an       afternoon’s or evening’s conversation she never failed before we       parted of delivering the best thing that was said in the company       some of us have written down several of her sayings or what the       french call bons mots wherein she excelled beyond belief”        the specimens on record however in the dean’s paper called bons       mots de stella scarcely bear out this last part of the panegyric       but the following prove her wit        “a gentleman who had been very silly and pert in her company at       last began to grieve at remembering the loss of a child lately dead       a bishop sitting by comforted him—that he should be easy because       ‘the child was gone to heaven’ ‘no my lord’ said she ‘that is it       which most grieves him because he is sure never to see his child       there’        “when she was extremely ill her physician said ‘madam you are       near the bottom of the hill but we will endeavour to get you up       again’ she answered ‘doctor i fear i shall be out of breath       before i get up to the top’        “a very dirty clergyman of her acquaintance who affected smartness       and repartees was asked by some of the company how his nails came       to be so dirty he was at a loss but she solved the difficulty by       saying ‘the doctor’s nails grew dirty by scratching himself’        “a quaker apothecary sent her a vial corked it had a broad brim       and a label of paper about its neck ‘what is that’—said she—‘my

fine painting but in general fictitious she was fond of dress       impatient to be admired very romantic in her turn of mind       superior in her own opinion to all her sex full of pertness

inclinations so much or as often as you remember there was such a       one in the world if you continue to treat me as you do you will       not be made uneasy by me long it is impossible to describe

you more but those       resolves to your misfortune did not last long for there is       something in human nature that prompts one so to find relief in this       world i must give way to it and beg

for me left that this complaint may touch your soul with       pity i say as little as ever i can did you but know what i       thought i am sure it would move you to forgive me and believe i       cannot help telling you this and live”—vanessa m 1714     55 “if we consider swift’s behaviour so far only as it relates to       women we shall find that he looked upon them rather as busts than       as whole figures”—orrery        “you must have smiled to have found his house a constant seraglio of       very virtuous women who attended him from morning to       night”—orrery        a correspondent of sir walter scott’s furnished him with the       materials on which to found the following interesting passage about       vanessa—after she had retired to cherish her passion in retreat—        “marley abbey near celbridge where miss vanhomrigh resided is       built much in the form of a real cloister especially in its       external appearance an aged man upwards of ninety by his own       account showed the grounds to my correspondent he was the son of       mrs vanhomrigh’s gardener and used to work with his father in the       garden while a boy he remembered the unfortunate vanessa well and       his account of her corresponded with the usual description of her       person especially as to her embonpoint he said she went seldom       abroad and saw little company her constant amusement was reading       or walking in the garden she avoided company and was always       melancholy save when dean swift was there and then she seemed       happy the garden was to an uncommon degree crowded with laurels       the old man said that when miss vanhomrigh expected the dean she       always planted with her own hand a laurel or two against his       arrival he showed her favourite seat still called ‘vanessa’s       bower’ three or four trees and some laurels indicate the spot       there were two seats and a rude table within the bower the opening       of which commanded a view of the liffey in this sequestered       spot according to the old gardener’s account the dean and vanessa       used often to sit with books and writing materials on the table       before them”—scott’s swift vol i pp 2467 “ but miss       vanhomrigh irritated at the situation in which she found herself       determined on bringing to a crisis those expectations of a union       with the object of her affections—to the hope of which she had clung       amid every vicissitude of his conduct towards her the most probable       bar was his undefined connexion with mrs johnson which as it must       have been perfectly known to her had doubtless long elicited her       secret jealousy although only a single hint to that purpose is to       be found in their correspondence and that so early as 1713 when       she writes to him—then in ireland—‘if you are very happy it is       illnatured of you not to tell me so except ’tis what is       inconsistent with mine’ her silence and patience under this state       of uncertainty for no less than eight years must have been partly       owing to her awe for swift and partly perhaps to the weak state       of her rival’s health which from year to year seemed to announce       speedy dissolution at length however vanessa’s impatience       prevailed and she ventured on the decisive step of writing to mrs       johnson herself requesting to know the nature of that connexion       stella in reply informed her of her marriage with the dean and       full of the highest resentment against swift for having given       another female such a right in him as miss vanhomrigh’s inquiries       implied she sent to him her rival’s letter of interrogatories and       without seeing him or awaiting his reply retired to the house of       mr ford near dublin every reader knows the consequence swift in       one of those paroxysms of fury to which he was liable both from       temper and disease rode instantly to marley abbey as he entered       the apartment the sternness of his countenance which was       peculiarly formed to express the fiercer passions struck the       unfortunate vanessa with such terror that she could scarce ask       whether he would not sit down he answered by flinging a letter on       the table and instantly leaving the house remounted his horse       and returned to

hurt my health and so i quitted it”—pope       spence’s anecdotes     86 “when he returned to england in 1702 with a meanness of       appearance which gave testimony of the difficulties to which he had       been reduced he found his old patrons out of power and was       therefore for a time at full leisure for the cultivation of his       mind”—johnson lives of the poets     87 “mr addison wrote very fluently but he was sometimes very slow and       scrupulous in correcting he would show his verses to several       friends and would alter almost everything that any of them hinted       at as wrong he seemed to be too diffident of himself and too much       concerned about his character as a poet or as he worded it too       solicitous for that kind of praise which god knows is but a very       little matter after all”—pope spence’s anecdotes     88 “as to poetical affairs” says pope in 1713 “i am content at       present to be a bare lookeron cato was not so much the wonder

in their possession which they do not enjoy it is       therefore a kind and good office to acquaint them with their own       happiness and turn their attention to such instances of their good       fortune as they are apt to overlook persons in the married state       often want such a monitor and pine away their days by looking upon       the same condition in anguish and murmuring which carries with it       in the opinion of others a complication of all the pleasures of       life and a retreat from its inquietudes        “i am led into this thought by a visit i made to an old friend who       was formerly my schoolfellow he came to town last week with his       family for the winter and yesterday morning sent me word his wife       expected me to dinner i am as it were at home at that house and       every member of it knows me for their wellwisher i cannot indeed       express the pleasure it is to be met by the children with so much       joy as i am when i go thither the boys and girls strive who shall       come first when they think it is i that am knocking at the door       and that child which loses the race to me runs back again to tell       the father it is mr bickerstaff this day i was led in by a pretty       girl that we all thought must have forgot me for the family has       been out of town these two years her knowing me again was a mighty       subject with us and took up our discourse at the first entrance       after which they began to rally me upon a thousand little stories       they heard in the country about my marriage to one of my       neighbours’ daughters upon which the gentleman my friend said       ‘nay if mr bickerstaff marries a child of any of his old       companions i hope mine shall have the preference there is mrs       mary is now sixteen and would make him as fine a widow as the best       of them but i know him too well he is so enamoured with the very       memory of those who flourished in our youth that he will not so       much as look upon the modern beauties i remember old gentleman       how often you went home in a day to refresh your countenance and       dress when teraminta reigned in your heart as we came up in the       coach i repeated to my wife some of your verses on her’ with such       reflections on little passages which happened long ago we passed       our time during a cheerful and elegant meal after dinner his lady       left the room as did also the children as soon as we were alone       he took me by the hand ‘well my good friend’ says he ‘i am       heartily glad to see thee i was afraid you would never have seen       all the company that dined with you today again do not you think       the good woman of the house a little altered since you followed her       from the playhouse to find out who she was for me’ i perceived a       tear fall down his cheek as he spoke which moved me not a little       but to turn the discourse i said ‘she is not indeed that       creature she was when she returned me the letter i carried from you       and told me “she hoped as i was a gentleman i would be employed       no more to trouble her who had never offended me but would be so       much the gentleman’s friend as to dissuade him from a pursuit which       he could never succeed in” you may remember i thought her in       earnest and you were forced to employ your cousin will who made       his sister get acquainted with her for you you cannot expect her to       be for ever fifteen’ ‘fifteen’ replied my good friend ‘ah you       little understand—you that have lived a bachelor—how great how       exquisite a pleasure there is in being really beloved it is       impossible that the most beauteous face in nature should raise in me       such pleasing ideas as when i look upon that excellent woman that       fading in her countenance is chiefly caused by her watching with me       in my fever this was followed by a fit of sickness which had like       to have carried me off last winter i tell you sincerely i have so       many obligations to her that i cannot with any sort of moderation       think of her present state of health but as to what you say of       fifteen she gives me every day pleasure beyond what i ever knew in       the possession of her beauty when i was in the vigour of youth       every moment of her life brings me fresh instances of her       complacency to my inclinations and her prudence in regard to my       fortune her face is to me much more beautiful than when i first saw       it there is no decay in any feature which i cannot trace from the       very instant it was occasioned by some anxious concern for my       welfare and interests thus at the same time methinks the love i       conceived towards her for what she was is heightened by my       gratitude for what she is the love of a wife is as much above the       idle passion commonly called by that name as the loud laughter of       buffoons is inferior to the elegant mirth of gentlemen oh she is       an inestimable jewel in her examination of her household affairs       she shows a certain fearfulness to find a fault which makes her       servants obey her like children and the meanest we have has an       ingenuous shame for an offence not always to be seen in children in       other families i speak freely to you my old friend ever since her       sickness things that gave me the quickest joy before turn now to a       certain anxiety as the children play in the next room i know the       poor things by their steps and am considering what they must do       should they lose their mother in their tender years the pleasure i       used to take in telling my boy stories of battles and asking my       girl questions about the disposal of her baby and the gossipping of       it is turned into inward reflection and melancholy’        “he would have gone on in this tender way when the good lady       entered and with an inexpressible sweetness in her countenance       told us ‘she had been searching her closet for something very good       to treat such an old friend as i was’ her husband’s eyes sparkled       with pleasure at the cheerfulness of her countenance and i saw all       his fears vanish in an instant the lady observing something in our       looks which showed we had been more serious than ordinary and       seeing her husband receive her with great concern under a forced       cheerfulness immediately guessed at what we had been talking of       and applying herself to me said with a smile ‘mr bickerstaff do       not believe a word of what he tells you i shall still live to have       you for my second as i have often promised you unless he takes       more care of himself than he has done since his coming to town you       must know he tells me that he finds london is a much more healthy       place than the country for he sees several of his old acquaintances       and schoolfellows are here—young fellows with fair fullbottomed       periwigs i could scarce keep him this morning from going out       openbreasted’ my friend who is always extremely delighted with       her agreeable humour made her sit down with us she did it with       that easiness which is peculiar to women of sense and to keep up       the good humour she had brought in with her turned her raillery       upon me ‘mr bickerstaff you remember you followed me one night       from the playhouse suppose you should carry me thither tomorrow       night and lead me in the front box’ this put us into a long field       of discourse about the beauties who were the mothers to the present       and shined in the boxes twenty years ago i told her ‘i was glad       she had transferred so many of her charms and i did not question       but her eldest daughter was within half a year of being a toast’        “we were pleasing ourselves with this fantastical preferment of the       young lady when on a sudden we were alarmed with the noise of a       drum and immediately entered my little godson to give me a point of       war his mother between laughing and chiding would have put him       out of the room but i would not part with him so i found upon       conversation with him though he was a little noisy in his mirth       that the child had excellent parts and was a great master of all       the learning on the other side of eight years old i perceived him a       very great historian in aesop’s fables but he frankly declared to       me his mind ‘that he did not delight in that learning because he       did not believe they were true’ for which reason i found he had       very much turned his studies for about a twelvemonth past into the       lives of don bellianis of greece guy of warwick the seven       champions and other historians of that age i could not but       observe the satisfaction the father took in the forwardness of his       son and that these diversions might turn to some profit i found       the boy had made remarks which might be of service to him during the       course of his whole life he would tell you the mismanagement of       john hickerthrift find fault with the passionate temper in bevis of       southampton and loved st george for being the champion of england       and by this means had his thoughts insensibly moulded into the       notions of discretion virtue and honour i was extolling his       accomplishments when his mother told me ‘that the little girl who       led me in this morning was in her way a better scholar than he       betty’ said she ‘deals chiefly in fairies and sprites and       sometimes in a winter night will terrify the maids with her       accounts until they are afraid to go up to bed’        “i sat with them until it was very late sometimes in merry       sometimes in serious discourse with this particular pleasure which       gives the only true relish to all conversation a sense that every       one of us liked each other i went home considering the different       conditions of a married life and that of a bachelor and i must       confess it struck me with a secret concern to reflect that       whenever i go off i shall leave no traces behind me in this pensive       mood i return to my family that is to say to my maid my dog my       cat who only can be the better or worse for what happens to       me”—the tatler    102 “as to the pursuits after affection and esteem the fair sex are       happy in this particular that with them the one is much more nearly       related to the other than in men the love of a woman is inseparable       from some esteem of her and as she is naturally the object of       affection the woman who has your esteem has also some degree of       your love a man that dotes on a woman for her beauty will whisper       his friend ‘that creature has a great deal of wit when you are well       acquainted with her’ and if you examine the bottom of your esteem       for a woman you will find you have a greater opinion of her beauty       than anybody else as to us men i design to pass most of my time       with the facetious harry bickerstaff but william bickerstaff the       most prudent man of our family shall be my executor”—tatler no       206    103 the correspondence of steele passed after his death into

passed to mr       thomas a grandson of a natural daughter of steele’s and part to       lady trevor’s next of kin mr scurlock they were published by the       learned nichols—from whose later edition of them in 1809 our       specimens are quoted        here we have him in his courtship—which was not a very long one        to mrs scurlock        “aug 30 1707        “madam—        “i beg pardon

beseech the author of       love to bless the rites he has ordained—and mingle with our       happiness a just sense of our transient condition and a resignation       to his will which only can regulate our minds to a steady endeavour       to please him and each other        “i am for ever your faithful servant        “rich steele”        some few hours afterwards apparently mistress scurlock received       the next one—obviously written later in the day        “saturday night aug 30 1707        “dear lovely mrs scurlock—        “i have been in very good company where your health

young lady’s mamma he dates from “lord       sunderland’s office whitehall” and states his clear income at       1025l per annum “i promise myself” says he “the pleasure of       an industrious and virtuous life in studying to do things agreeable       to you”        they were married according to the most probable conjectures about       the 7th inst there are traces of a tiff about the middle of the       next month she being prudish and fidgety as he was impassioned and       reckless general progress however may be seen from the following       notes the “house in bury street st james’s” was now taken        to mrs steele        “oct 16 1707        “dearest being on earth—        “pardon me if you do not see me till eleven o’clock having met a       schoolfellow from india by whom i

‘dear prue’ a receipt for the saucepan and       spoon and a note of 23l of lewis’s which will make up the       50l i promised for your ensuing occasion        “i know no happiness in this life in

to make me as happy as it is possible to be in       this life rising a little in a morning and being disposed to a       cheerfulness  would not be amiss”        in another he is found excusing his coming home being “invited to       supper to mr boyle’s” “dear prue” he says on this occasion “do       not send after me for i shall be ridiculous”    104 of this famous bishop steele wrote—        virtue with so much ease on bangor sits       all faults he pardons though he none commits    105 here we have some of his later letters—        to lady steele       “hampton court march 16 171617

tell me you want a little flattery from me i assure you i know       no one who deserves so much commendation as yourself and to whom       saying the best things would be so little like flattery the

which attend the       good qualities of other people of which you are exempt but       indeed though you have every perfection you have an extravagant       fault which almost frustrates the good in you to me and that is       that you do not love to dress to appear to shine out even at my       request and to make me proud of you or rather to indulge the pride       i have that you are mine

looking after her estate there steele about this       time was much occupied with a project for conveying fish alive by       which as he constantly assures his wife he firmly believed he       should make his fortune it did not succeed however        lady steele died in december of the succeeding year she lies buried       in westminster abbey    106 lord chesterfield sends these verses to voltaire in a characteristic       letter    107 steele replied to dennis in an answer to a whimsical pamphlet       called “the character of sir john edgar” what steele had to       say against the crossgrained old critic discovers a great deal of       humour        “thou never didst let the sun into thy garret for fear he should       bring a bailiff along with him        “your years are about sixtyfive an ugly vinegar face that if you       had any command you would be obeyed out of fear from your       illnature pictured there not from any other motive your height is       about some five feet five inches you see i can give your exact       measure as well as if i had taken your dimension with a good cudgel       which i promise you to do as soon as ever i have the good fortune to       meet you        “your doughty paunch stands before you like a firkin of butter and       your ducklegs seem to be cast for carrying burdens        “thy works are libels upon others and satires upon thyself and       while they bark at men of sense call him knave and fool that wrote       them thou hast a great antipathy to thy own species and hatest the       sight of a fool but in thy glass”        steele had been kind to dennis and once got arrested on account of       a pecuniary service which he did him when john heard of the       fact—“’sdeath” cries john “why did not he keep out of the way as i       did”        the answer concludes by mentioning that cibber had offered ten       pounds for the discovery of the authorship of dennis’s pamphlet on       which says steele—        “i am only sorry he has offered so much because the twentieth       part would have overvalued his whole carcass but i know the       fellow that he keeps to give answers to his creditors will betray       him for he gave me his word to bring officers on the top of the       house that should make a hole through the ceiling of his garret and       so bring him to the punishment he deserves some people think this       expedient out of the way and that he would make his escape upon       hearing the least noise i say so too but it takes him up half an       hour every night to fortify himself with his old hair trunk two or       three jointstools and some other lumber which he ties together       with cords so fast that it takes him up the same time in the morning       to release himself”    108 gay calls him—“dear prior  beloved by every muse”—mr pope’s       welcome from greece        swift and prior were very intimate and he is frequently mentioned       in the journal to stella “mr prior” says swift “walks to make       himself fat and i to keep myself down we often walk round the       park together”        in swift’s works there is a curious tract called remarks on the       characters of the court of queen anne scott’s edition vol xii       the remarks are not by the dean but at the end of each is an       addition in italics from his hand and these are always       characteristic thus to the duke of marlborough he adds       “detestably covetous” c prior is thus noticed—        “matthew prior esq commissioner of trade        “on the queen’s accession to the throne he was continued in his       office is very well at court with the ministry and is an entire       creature of my lord jersey’s whom he supports by his advice is one       of the best poets in england but very facetious in conversation a       thin hollowlooked man turned of 40 years old this is near the       truth”        yet counting as far as to fifty his years       his virtues and

   had just such another design of going to cambridge expecting there       the copy of a new kind of horace from dr —— and if mr tonson       went he was preengaged to attend him being to have the printing       of the said copy so in short i borrowed this stonehorse of my       publisher which he had of mr oldmixon for a debt he lent me too       the pretty boy you see after me he was a smutty dog yesterday and       cost me more than two hours to wash the ink off his face but the       devil is a fairconditioned devil and very forward in his       catechism if you have any more bags he shall carry them’        “i thought mr lintot’s civility not to be neglected so gave the       boy a small bag containing three shirts and an elzevir virgil and       mounting in an instant proceeded on the road with my man before       my courteous stationer beside and the aforesaid devil behind        “mr lintot began in this manner ‘now damn them what if they       should put it into the newspaper how you and i went together to       oxford what would i care if i should go down into sussex they       would say i was gone to the speaker but what of that if my son       were but big enough to go on with the business by gd i would keep       as good company as old jacob’        “hereupon i inquired of his son ‘the lad’ says he ‘has fine       parts but is somewhat sickly much as you are i spare for nothing       in his education at westminster pray don’t you think westminster       to be the best school in england most of the late ministry came out       of it so did many of this ministry i hope the boy will make his       fortune’        “ ‘don’t you design to let him pass a year at oxford’ ‘to what       purpose’ said he ‘the universities do but make pedants and i       intend to breed him a man of business’        “as mr lintot was talking i observed he sat uneasy on his saddle       for which i expressed some solicitude ‘nothing’ says he ‘i can       bear it well enough but since we have the day before us methinks       it would be very pleasant for you to rest awhile under the woods’       when we were alighted ‘see here what a mighty pretty horace i       have in my pocket what if you amused yourself in turning an ode       till we mount again lord if you pleased what a clever miscellany       might you make at leisure hours’ ‘perhaps i may’ said i ‘if we       ride on the motion is an aid to my fancy a round trot very much       awakens my spirits then jog on apace and i’ll think as hard as i       can’        “silence ensued for a full hour after which mr lintot lugged the       reins stopped short and broke out ‘well sir how far have you       gone’ i answered seven miles ‘z—ds sir’ said lintot ‘i thought       you had done seven stanzas oldisworth in a ramble round wimbledon       hill would translate a whole ode in half this time i’ll say that       for oldisworth though i lost by his timothy’s he translates an ode       of horace the quickest of any man in england i remember dr king       would write verses in a tavern three hours after he could not       speak and there is sir richard in that rumbling old chariot of       his between fleet ditch and st giles’s pound shall make you half a       job’        “ ‘pray mr lintot’ said i ‘now you talk of translators what is       your method of managing them’ ‘sir’ replied he ‘these are the       saddest pack of rogues in the world in a hungry fit they’ll swear       they understand all the languages in the universe i have known one       of them take down a greek book upon my counter and cry “ah this       is hebrew” and must read it from the latter end by gd i can       never be sure in these fellows for i neither understand greek       latin french nor italian myself but this is my way i agree with       them for ten shillings per sheet with a proviso that i will have       their doings corrected with whom i please so by one or the other       they are led at last to the true sense of an author my judgement       giving the negative to all my translators’ ‘then how are you sure       these correctors may not impose upon you’ ‘why i get any civil       gentleman especially any scotchman that comes into my shop to       read the original to me in english by this i know whether my first       translator be deficient and whether my corrector merits his money       or not        “ ‘i’ll tell you what happened to me last month i bargained with       s—— for a new version of lucretius to publish against tonson’s       agreeing to pay the author so many shillings at his producing so       many lines he made a great progress in a very short time and i       gave it to the corrector to compare with the latin but he went       directly to creech’s translation and found it the same word for       word all but the first page now what d’ye think i did i arrested       the translator for a cheat nay and i stopped the corrector’s pay       too upon the proof that he had made use of creech instead of the       original’        “ ‘pray tell me next how you deal with the critics’ ‘sir’ said he       ‘nothing more easy i can silence the most formidable of them the       rich ones for a sheet apiece of the blotted manuscript which cost       me nothing they’ll go about with it to their acquaintance and       pretend they had it from the author who submitted it to their       correction this has given some of them such an air that in time       they come to be consulted with and dedicated to as the tiptop       critics of the town—as

every stripling every versifier—” he was going on when my       wife called to dinner “sir” said i “will you please to eat a       piece of beef with me” “mr lintot” said he “i am very sorry you       should be at the expense of this great book i am really concerned       on your account” “sir i am much obliged to you if you can dine       upon a piece of beef together with a slice of pudding—” “mr       lintot i do not say but mr pope if he would condescend to advise       with men of learning—” “sir the pudding is upon the table if you       please to go in” my critic complies he comes to a taste of your       poetry and tells me in the same breath that the book is       commendable and the pudding excellent’        “ ‘now sir’ continued mr lintot ‘in return for the frankness i       have shown pray tell me is it the opinion of your friends at court       that my lord lansdowne will be brought to the bar or not’ i told       him i heard he would not and i hoped it my lord being one i had       particular obligations to—‘that may be’ replied mr lintot ‘but       by g— if he is not i shall lose the printing of a very good trial’        “these my lord are a few traits with which you discern the genius       of mr lintot which i have chosen for the subject of a letter i       dropped him as soon as i got to oxford and paid a visit to my lord       carleton at middleton

that time used to assemble it is said that       when addison had suffered any vexation from the countess he       withdrew the company from button’s house        “from the coffeehouse he went again to a tavern where he often sat       late and drank too much wine”—dr johnson        will’s coffeehouse was on the west side of bow street and “corner       of russell street” see handbook of london    127 “my acquaintance with mr addison commenced in 1712 i liked him       then as well as i liked any man and was very fond of his       conversation it was very soon after that mr addison advised me       ‘not to be content with the applause of half the nation’ he used to       talk much and often to me of moderation in parties and used to       blame his dear friend steele for being too much of a party man he       encouraged me in my design of translating the iliad which was       begun that year and finished in 1718”—pope spence’s anecdotes    128 “addison who was no stranger to the world probably saw the       selfishness of pope’s friendship and resolving that he should have       the consequences of his officiousness to himself informed dennis by       steele that he was sorry for the insult”—johnson life of       addison    129 “while i was heated with what i had heard i wrote a letter to mr       addison to let him know ‘that i was not unacquainted with this       behaviour of his that if i was to speak of him severely in return       for it it should not be in such a dirty way that i should rather       tell him himself fairly of his faults and allow his good qualities       and that it should be something in the following manner’ i then       subjoined the first sketch of what has since been called my satire       on addison he used me very civilly ever after and

seems to us       highly improbable that addison should have been guilty of a villany       seems to us highly improbable but that these two men should have       conspired together to commit a villany seems to us improbable in       a tenfold degree”—macaulay    131 lord bolingbroke to the three yahoos of twickenham        “july 23 1726        “jonathan alexander john most excellent

is abundantly evidenced in their       correspondence when he found himself in his last illness he wrote       thus from his retreat at hampstead to swift        “hampstead oct 4 1734        “my dear and worthy friend—        “you have no reason to put me among the rest of your forgetful       friends for i wrote two long letters to you to which i never       received one word of answer the first was about your health the       last i sent a great while ago by one de la mar i can assure you       with great truth that none of your friends or acquaintance has a       more warm heart towards you than myself i am going out of this       troublesome world and you among the rest of my friends shall have       my last prayers and good wishes        “ i came out to this place so reduced by a dropsy and an asthma       that i could neither sleep breathe eat nor move i most earnestly       desired and begged of god that he would take me contrary to my       expectation upon venturing to ride which i had forborne for some       years i recovered my strength to a pretty considerable degree       slept and had my stomach again what i did i can assure you was       not for life but ease for i am at present in the case of a man       that was almost in harbour and then blown back to sea—who has a       reasonable hope of going to a good place and an absolute certainty       of leaving a very bad one not that i have any particular disgust at       the world for i have as great comfort in my own family and from the       kindness of my friends as any man but the world in the main       displeases me and i have too true a presentiment of calamities that       are to befall my country however if i should have the happiness to       see you before i die you will find that i enjoy the comforts of       life with my usual cheerfulness i cannot imagine why you are       frightened from a journey to england the reasons you assign are not       sufficient—the journey i am sure would do you good in general i       recommend riding of which i have always had a good opinion and can       now confirm it from my own experience        “my family give you their love and service the great loss i       sustained in one of them gave me my first shock and the trouble i       have with the rest to bring them to a right temper to bear the loss       of a father who loves them and whom they love is really a most       sensible affliction to me i am afraid my dear friend we shall       never see one another more in this world i shall to the last       moment preserve my love and esteem for you being well assured you       will never leave the paths of virtue and honour for all that is in       this world is not worth the least deviation from the way it will be       great pleasure

scholar with great brilliance of       wit a wit who in the crowd of life retained and discovered a noble       ardour of religious zeal”        dugald stewart has testified to arbuthnot’s ability in a department       of which he was particularly qualified to judge “let me add that       in the list of philosophical reformers the authors of martinus       scriblerus ought not to be overlooked their happy ridicule of the       scholastic logic and metaphysics is universally known but few are       aware of the acuteness and sagacity displayed in their allusions to       some of the most vulnerable passages in locke’s essay in this part       of the work it is commonly understood that arbuthnot had the       principal share”—see preliminary dissertation to encyclopaedia

voice faltered ‘and well it might       sir’ said johnson ‘for they are noble lines’ ”        j boswell junior    143 coleridge speaks of the “beautiful female faces” in hogarth’s       pictures “in whom” he says “the satirist never extinguished that       love of beauty which belonged to him as a poet”—the friend    144 “i was pleased with the reply of a gentleman who being asked which       book he esteemed most in his library answered ‘shakespeare’ being       asked which he esteemed next best replied ‘hogarth’ his graphic       representations are indeed books they have the teeming fruitful       suggestive meaning of words other pictures we look at—his prints       we read        “the quantity of thought which hogarth crowds into every picture       would almost unvulgarize every subject which he might choose        “i say not that all the ridiculous subjects of hogarth have       necessarily something in them to make us like them some are       indifferent to us some in their nature repulsive and only made       interesting by the wonderful skill and truth to nature in the       painter but i contend that there is in most of them that sprinkling       of the better nature which like holy water chases away and       disperses the contagion of the bad they have this in them besides       that they bring us acquainted with the everyday human face—they       give us skill to detect those gradations of sense and virtue which       escape the careless or fastidious observer in the circumstances of       the world about us and prevent that disgust at common life that       taedium quotidianarum formarum which an unrestricted passion for       ideal forms and beauties is in danger of producing in this as in       many other things they are analogous to the best novels of smollett       and fielding”—charles lamb        “it has been observed that hogarth’s pictures are exceedingly unlike       any other representations of the same kind of subjects—that they       form a class and have a character peculiar to themselves it may       be worth while to consider in what this general distinction       consists        “in the first place they are in the strictest sense historical       pictures and if what fielding says be true that his novel of tom       jones ought to be regarded as an epic prosepoem because it       contained a regular development of fable manners character and       passion the compositions of hogarth will in like manner be found       to have a higher claim to the title of epic pictures than many which       have of late arrogated that denomination to themselves when we say       that hogarth treated his subjects historically we mean that his       works represent the manners and humours of mankind in action and       their characters by varied expression everything in his pictures       has life and motion in it not only does the business of the scene       never stand still but every feature and muscle is put into full       play the exact feeling of the moment is brought out and carried to       its utmost height and then instantly seized and stamped on the       canvas for ever the expression is always taken en passant in a       state of progress or change and as it were at the salient       point his figures are not like the background on which they are       painted even the pictures on the wall have a peculiar look of their       own again with the rapidity variety and scope of history       hogarth’s heads have all the reality and correctness of portraits       he gives the extremes of character and expression but he gives them       with perfect truth and accuracy this is in fact what       distinguishes his compositions from all others of the same kind       that they are equally remote from caricature and from mere still       life his faces go to the very verge of caricature and yet never       we believe in any single instance go beyond it”—hazlitt    145 he made this excursion in 1732 his companions being john thornhill       son of sir james scott the landscapepainter tothall and       forrest    146 “dr johnson made four lines once on the death of poor hogarth       which were equally true and pleasing i know not why garrick’s were       preferred to them—        the hand of him here torpid lies       that drew th’ essential forms of grace       here closed in death th’ attentive eyes       that saw the manners in the face        “mr hogarth among the variety of kindnesses shown to me when i was       too young to have a proper sense of them was used to be very       earnest that i should obtain the acquaintance and if possible the       friendship of dr johnson whose conversation was to the talk of       other men like titian’s painting compared to hudson’s he said       ‘but don’t you tell people now that i say so’ continued he ‘for       the connoisseurs and i are at war you know and because i hate       them they think i hate titian—and let them’  of dr       johnson when my father and he were talking about him one day ‘that       man’ says hogarth ‘is not contented with believing the bible but       he fairly resolves i think to believe nothing but the bible       johnson’ added he ‘though so wise a fellow is more like king       david than king solomon for he says in his haste all men are       liars’ ”—mrs piozzi        hogarth died on the 26th of october 1764 the day before his death       he was removed from his villa at chiswick to leicester fields “in a       very weak condition yet remarkably cheerful” he had just received       an agreeable letter from franklin he lies buried at chiswick    147 to sir watkin phillips bart of jesus college oxon        “dear phillips—in my last i mentioned my having spent an evening       with a society of authors who seemed to be jealous and afraid of       one another my uncle was not at all surprised to hear me say i was       disappointed in their conversation ‘a man may be very entertaining       and instructive upon paper’ said he ‘and exceedingly dull in       common discourse i have observed that those who shine most in       private company are but secondary stars in the constellation of       genius a small stock of ideas is more easily managed and sooner       displayed than a great quantity crowded together there is very       seldom anything extraordinary in the appearance and address of a       good writer whereas a dull author generally distinguishes himself       by some oddity or extravagance for this reason i fancy that an       assembly of grubs must be very diverting’        “my curiosity being excited by this hint i consulted my friend dick       ivy who undertook to gratify it the very next day which was sunday       last he carried me to dine with s—— whom you and i have long known       by his writings he lives in the skirts of the town and every       sunday his house is open to all unfortunate brothers of the quill       whom he treats with beef pudding and potatoes port punch and       calvert’s entire butt beer he has fixed upon the first day of the       week for the exercise of his hospitality because some of his guests       could not enjoy it on any other for reasons that i need not       explain i was civilly received in a plain yet decent habitation       which opened backwards into a very pleasant garden kept in       excellent order and indeed i saw none of the outward signs of       authorship either in the house or the landlord who is one of those       few writers of the age that stand upon their own foundation without       patronage and above dependence if there was nothing characteristic       in the entertainer the company made ample amends for his want of       singularity        “at two in the afternoon i found myself one of ten messmates seated       at table and i question if the whole kingdom could produce such       another assemblage of originals among their peculiarities i do not       mention those of dress which may be purely accidental what struck       me were oddities originally produced by affectation and afterwards       confirmed by habit one of them wore spectacles at dinner and       another his hat flapped though as ivy told me the first was noted       for having a seaman’s eye when a bailiff was in the wind and the       other was never known to labour under any weakness or defect of       vision except about five years ago when he was complimented with a       couple of black eyes by a player with whom he had quarrelled in his       drink a third wore a laced stocking and made use of crutches       because once in his life he had been laid up with a broken leg       though no man could leap over a stick with more agility a fourth       had contracted such an antipathy to the country that he insisted       upon sitting with his back towards the window that looked into the       garden and when a dish of cauliflower was set upon the table he       snuffed up volatile salts to keep him from fainting yet this       delicate person was the son of a cottager born under a hedge and       had many years run wild among asses on a common a fifth affected       distraction when spoke to he always answered from the purpose       sometimes he suddenly started up and rapped out a dreadful oath       sometimes he burst out alaughing then he folded his arms and       sighed and then he hissed like fifty serpents        “at first i really thought he was mad and as he sat near me       began to be under some apprehensions for my own safety when our       landlord perceiving me alarmed assured me aloud that i had nothing       to fear ‘the gentleman’ said he ‘is trying to act a part for       which he is by no means qualified if he had all the inclination in       the world it is not in his power to be mad his spirits are too       flat to be kindled into phrenzy’ ‘’tis no bad pppuff       howowever’ observed a person in a

no affinity betwixt them’ it       seems this wag after having made some abortive attempts in plain       speaking had recourse to this defect by means of which he       frequently extorted the laugh of the company without the least       expense of genius and that imperfection which he had at first       counterfeited was now become so habitual that he could not lay it       aside        “a certain winking genius who wore yellow gloves at dinner had on       his first introduction taken such offence at s—— because he looked       and talked and ate and drank like any other man that he

unsuccessful advances       towards an intimacy with s—— at last gave him to understand by a       third person that he had written a poem in his praise and a satire       against his person that if he would admit him to his house the       first should be immediately sent to press but that if he persisted       in declining his friendship he would publish the satire without       delay s—— replied that he looked upon wyvil’s panegyric as in       effect a species of infamy and would resent it accordingly with a       good cudgel but if he published the satire he might deserve his       compassion and had nothing to fear from his revenge wyvil having       considered the alternative resolved to mortify s—— by printing the       panegyric for which he received a sound drubbing then he swore the       peace against the aggressor who in order to avoid a prosecution at       law admitted him to his good graces it was the singularity in       s——’s conduct on this occasion that reconciled him to the       yellowgloved philosopher who owned he had some genius and from       that period cultivated his acquaintance        “curious to know upon what subjects the several talents of my fellow       guests were employed i applied to my communicative friend dick ivy       who gave me to understand that most of them were or had been       understrappers or journeymen to more creditable authors for whom       they translated collated and compiled in the business of       bookmaking and that all of them had at different times laboured       in the service of our landlord

resembled the confusion of tongues at babel we had       the irish brogue the scotch accent and foreign idiom twanged off       by the most discordant vociferation for as they all spoke together       no man had any chance to be heard unless he could bawl louder than       his fellows it must be owned however there was nothing pedantic       in their discourse they carefully avoided all learned

imprisonment in the king’s bench avenged this stinging       paragraph        but the critical was to smollett a perpetual fountain of “hot       water” among less important controversies may be mentioned that       with grainger the translator of tibullus grainger replied in a       pamphlet and in the next number of the review we find him       threatened with “castigation” as an “owl that

“on smollett’s arrival he was introduced to his mother with the       connivance of mrs telfer her daughter as a gentleman from the       west indies who was intimately acquainted with her son the better       to support his assumed character he endeavoured to preserve a       serious countenance approaching to a frown but while his mother’s       eyes were riveted on his countenance he could not refrain from       smiling she immediately sprung from her chair and throwing her       arms round his neck exclaimed ‘ah my son my son i have found       you at last’        “she afterwards told

his other writings    154 “richardson” says worthy mrs barbauld in her memoir of him       prefixed to his correspondence “was exceedingly hurt at this       joseph andrews the more so as they had been on good terms and       he was very intimate with fielding’s two sisters he never appears       cordially to have forgiven it perhaps it was not in human nature he       should and he always speaks in his letters with a great deal of       asperity of tom jones more indeed than was quite graceful in a       rival author no doubt he himself thought his indignation was solely       excited by the loose morality of the work and of its author but he       could tolerate cibber”    155 it must always be borne in mind that besides that the doctor       couldn’t be expected to like fielding’s wild life to say nothing of       the fact that they were of opposite sides in politics richardson       was one of his earliest and kindest friends yet johnson too as       boswell tells

present day without perhaps being in the ground a better man would       have perished rather than submit to be kept by a harridan of       fortune therefore this novel is and indeed pretends to be no

little from the accident       related in the novel—a frightful overturn which destroyed the       gristle of her nose he loved her passionately and she returned his       affection        “his

in 1736       about the same time he succeeded himself to an estate of 200l       per annum and on the joint amount he lived for some time as a       splendid country gentleman in dorsetshire three years brought him       to the end of his fortune when he returned to london and became a       student of law    158 in the gentleman’s magazine for 1786 an anecdote is related of       harry fielding “in whom” says the correspondent “good nature and       philanthropy in their extreme degree were known to be the prominent       features” it seems that “some parochial taxes” for his house in       beaufort buildings had long been demanded by the collector “at       last harry went off to johnson and obtained by a process of       literary mortgage the needful sum he was returning with it when he       met an old college chum whom he had not seen for many years he       asked the chum to dinner with him at a neighbouring tavern and       learning that he was in difficulties emptied the contents of his       pocket into his on returning home he was informed that the       collector had been twice for the money ‘friendship has called for       the money and had it’ said fielding ‘let the collector call       again’ ”        it is elsewhere told of him that being in company with the earl of       denbigh his kinsman and the conversation turning upon their       relationship the earl asked him how it was that he spelled his name       “fielding” and not “feilding” like the head of the house “i       cannot tell my lord” said he “except it be that my branch of the       family were the first that knew how to spell”    159 in 1749 he was made justice of the peace for westminster and       middlesex an office then paid by fees and very laborious without       being particularly reputable it may be seen from his own words in       the introduction to the voyage what kind of work devolved upon       him and in what a state he was during these last years and still       more clearly how he comported himself through all        “whilst i was preparing for my journey and when i was almost       fatigued to death with several long examinations relating to five       different murders all committed within the space of a week by       different gangs of streetrobbers i received a message from his       grace the duke of newcastle by mr carrington the king’s       messenger to attend his grace the next morning in lincoln’s inn       fields upon some business of importance but i excused myself from       complying with the message as besides being lame i was very ill       with the great fatigues i had lately undergone added to my       distemper        “his grace however sent mr carrington the very next morning with       another summons with which though in the utmost distress i       immediately complied but the duke happening unfortunately for me       to be then particularly engaged after i had waited some time sent       a gentleman to discourse with me on the best plan which could be       invented for these murders and robberies which were every day       committed in the streets upon which i promised to transmit my       opinion in writing to his grace who as the gentleman informed me       intended to lay it before the privy council        “though this visit cost me a severe cold i notwithstanding set       myself down to work and in about four days sent the duke as regular       a plan as i could form with all the reasons and arguments i could       bring to support it drawn out on several sheets of paper and soon       received a message from the duke by mr carrington acquainting me       that my plan was highly approved of and that all the terms of it       would be complied with        “the principal and most material of these terms was the immediately       depositing 600l in my hands at which small charge i undertook to       demolish the then reigning gangs and to put the civil policy into       such order that no such gangs should ever be able for the future       to form themselves into bodies or at least to remain any time       formidable to the public        “i had delayed my bath journey for some time contrary to the       repeated advice of my physical acquaintances and the ardent desire       of my warmest friends though my distemper was now turned to a deep       jaundice in which case the bath waters are generally reputed to be       almost infallible but i had the most eager desire to demolish this       gang of villains and cutthroats        “after some weeks the money was paid at the treasury and within a       few days after 200l of it had come into my hands the whole gang       of cutthroats was entirely dispersed”        further on he says—        “i will confess that my private affairs at the beginning of the       winter had but a gloomy aspect for i had not plundered the public       or the poor of those sums which men who are always ready to plunder       both as much as they can have been pleased to suspect me of taking       on the contrary by composing instead of inflaming the quarrels of       porters and beggars which i blush when i say hath not been       universally practised and by refusing to take a shilling from a       man who most undoubtedly would not have had another left i had       reduced an income of about 500l a year of the dirtiest money       upon earth to little more than 300l a considerable portion of       which remained with my clerk”    160 he came of a suffolk family—one of whom settled in nottinghamshire       the famous “starling” was actually the family crest    161 “it was in this parish” of animo in wicklow “during our stay       that i had that wonderful escape in falling through a millrace       whilst the mill was going and of being taken up unhurt the story       is incredible but known for truth in all that part of ireland       where hundreds of the common people flocked to see me”—sterne    162 “my wife returns to toulouse and proposes to pass the summer at       bagnères—i on the contrary go and visit my wife the church in       yorkshire we all live the longer at least the happier for having       things our own way this is my conjugal maxim i own ’tis not the       best of maxims but i maintain ’tis not the worst”—sterne’s       letters 20th january 1764    163 in a collection of seven letters by sterne and his friends       printed for private circulation in 1844 is a letter of m       tollot who was in france with sterne and his family in 1764 here       is a paragraph—        “nous arrivâmes le lendemain à montpellier où nous trouvâmes notre       ami mr sterne sa femme sa fille mr huet et quelques autres       anglaises j’eus je vous l’avoue beaucoup de plaisir en revoyant       le bon et agréable tristram il avait été assez longtemps à       toulouse où il se serait amusé sans sa femme qui le poursuivit       partout et qui voulait être de tout ces dispositions dans cette       bonne dame lui ont fait passer d’assez mauvais momens il supporte       tous ces désagrémens avec une patience d’ánge”        about four months after this very characteristic letter sterne       wrote to the same gentleman to whom tollot had written and from his       letter we may extract a companion paragraph—        “ all which being premised i have been for eight weeks smitten       with the tenderest passion that ever tender wight underwent i wish       dear cousin thou couldst conceive perhaps thou canst without my       wishing it how deliciously i canter’d away with it the first month       two up two down always upon my hanches along the streets from       my hotel to hers at first once—then twice then three times a day       till at length i was within an ace of setting up my hobbyhorse in       her stable for good and all i might as well considering how the       enemies of the lord have blasphemed thereupon the last three weeks       we were every hour upon the doleful ditty of parting—and thou mayest       conceive dear cousin how it altered my gait and air—for i went and       came like any louden’d carl and did nothing but jouer des       sentimens with her from sunrising even to the setting of the same       and now she is gone to the south of france and to finish the       comédie i fell ill and broke a vessel in my lungs and half bled       to death voilà mon histoire”        whether husband or wife had most of the patience d’ánge may be       uncertain but there can be no doubt which needed it most    164 “tristram shandy is still a greater object of admiration the man       as well as the book one is invited to dinner when he dines a       fortnight before as to the volumes yet published there is much       good fun in them and humour sometimes hit and sometimes missed       have you read his sermons with his own comick figure from a       painting by reynolds at the head of them they are in the style i       think most proper for the pulpit and show a strong imagination and       a sensible heart but you see him often tottering on the verge of       laughter and ready to throw his periwig in the face of the       audience”—gray’s letters june 22nd 1760        “it having been observed that there was little hospitality in       london—johnson ‘nay sir any man who has a name or who has the       power of pleasing will be very generally invited in london the       man sterne i have been told has had engagements for three       months’ goldsmith ‘and a very dull fellow’ johnson ‘why no       sir’ ”—boswell’s life of johnson        “her miss monckton’s vivacity enchanted the sage and they used to       talk together with all imaginable ease a singular instance happened       one evening when she insisted that some of sterne’s writings were       very pathetic johnson bluntly denied it ‘i am sure’ said she       ‘they have affected me’ ‘why’ said johnson smiling and rolling       himself about—‘that is because dearest you’re a dunce’ when she       some time afterwards mentioned this to him he said with equal truth       and politeness ‘madam if i had thought so i certainly should not       have said it’ ”—boswell’s life of johnson    165 a passage or two from sterne’s sermons may not be without interest       here is not the following levelled against the cruelties of the       church of rome stamped with the autograph of the author of the       sentimental journey—        “to be convinced of this go with me for a moment into the prisons       of the inquisition—behold religion with mercy and justice chained       down under her feet—there sitting ghastly upon a black tribunal       propped up with racks and instruments of torment—hark—what a       piteous groan—see the melancholy wretch who uttered it just       brought forth to undergo the anguish of a mocktrial and endure the       utmost pain that a studied system of religious cruelty has been       able to invent behold this helpless victim delivered up to his       tormentors his body so wasted with sorrow and long confinement       you’ll see every nerve and muscle as it suffers observe the last       movement of that horrid engine—what convulsions it has thrown him       into consider the nature of the posture in which he now lies       stretched—what exquisite torture he endures by it—’tis all nature       can bear—good god see how it keeps his weary soul hanging upon his       trembling lips willing to take its leave but not suffered to       depart behold the unhappy wretch led back to his cell—dragg’d out       of it again to meet the flames—and the insults in his last agonies       which this principle—this principle that there can be religion       without morality—has prepared for him”—sermon 27th        the next extract is preached on a text to be found in judges xix       ver 1 2 3 concerning a “certain levite”—        “such a one the levite wanted to share his solitude and fill up that       uncomfortable blank in the heart in such a situation for       notwithstanding all we meet with in books in many of which no       doubt there are a good many handsome things said upon the secrets       of retirement c yet still ‘it is not good for man to be       alone’ nor can all which the coldhearted pedant stuns our ears       with upon the subject ever give one answer of satisfaction to the       mind in the midst of the loudest vauntings of philosophy nature       will have her yearnings for society and friendship—a good heart       wants some object to be kind to—and the best parts of our blood and       the purest of our spirits suffer most under the destitution        “let the torpid monk seek heaven comfortless and alone god speed       him for my own part i fear i should never so find the way let me       be wise and religious but let me be man wherever thy providence       places me or whatever be the road i take to thee give me some       companion in my journey be it only to remark to ‘how our shadows       lengthen as our sun goes down’—to whom i may say ‘how fresh is the       face of nature how sweet the flowers of the field how delicious       are these fruits’ ”—sermon 18th        the first of these passages gives us another drawing of the famous       “captive” the second shows that the same reflection was suggested       to the rev laurence by a text in judges as by the       filledechambre        sterne’s sermons were published as those of “mr yorick”    166 “i am glad that you are in love—’twill cure you at least of the       spleen which has a bad effect on both man and woman—i myself must       even have some dulcinea in my head it harmonizes the soul and in       these cases i first endeavour to make the lady believe so or       rather i begin first to make myself believe that i am in love—but i       carry on my affairs quite in the french way sentimentally—l’amour       say they n’est rien sans sentiment now notwithstanding they       make such a pother about the word they have no precise idea       annexed to it and so much for that same subject called       love”—sterne’s letters may 23rd 1765        “ps—my sentimental journey will please mrs j—— and my lydia his       daughter afterwards mrs medalle—i can answer for those two it is       a subject which works well and suits the frame of mind i have been       in for some time past i told you my design in it was to teach us to       love the world and our fellow creatures better than we do—so it runs       most upon those gentler passions

’tis       true then an author must feel himself or his reader will not—but       i have torn my whole frame into pieces by my feelings—i believe the       brain stands as much in need of recruiting as the body therefore i       shall set out for town the twentieth of next month after having       recruited myself a week at york i might indeed solace myself with       my wife who is come from france but in fact i have long been a       sentimental being whatever your lordship may think to the       contrary”    168 “it is known that sterne died in hired lodgings and i have been       told that his attendants robbed him even of his gold sleevebuttons       while he was expiring”—dr ferriar        “he died at no 41 now a cheesemonger’s on the west side of old       bond street—handbook of london”    169 “in february 1768 laurence sterne his frame exhausted by long       debilitating illness expired at his lodgings in bond street       london there was something in the manner of his death singularly       resembling the particulars detailed by mrs quickly as attending       that of falstaff the compeer of yorick for infinite jest however       unlike in other particulars as he lay on his bed totally exhausted       he complained that his feet were cold and requested the female       attendant to chafe them she did so and it seemed to relieve him       he complained that the cold came up higher and whilst the assistant       was in the act of chafing his ankles and legs he expired without a       groan it was also remarkable that his death took place much in the       manner which he himself had wished and that the last offices were       rendered him not in his own house or by the hand of kindred       affection but in an inn and by strangers        “we are well acquainted with sterne’s features and personal       appearance to which he himself frequently alludes he was tall and       thin with a hectic and consumptive appearance”—sir walter scott    170 “with regard to sterne and the charge of licentiousness which       presses so seriously upon his character as a writer i would remark       that there is a sort of knowingness the wit of which depends       firstly on the modesty it gives pain to or secondly on the       innocence and innocent ignorance over which it triumphs or thirdly       on a certain oscillation in the individual’s own mind between the       remaining good and the encroaching evil of his nature—a sort of       dallying with the devil—a fluxionary art of combining courage and       cowardice as when a man snuffs a candle with his fingers for the       first time or better still perhaps like that trembling daring       with which a child touches a hot teaurn because it has been       forbidden so that the mind has its own white and black angel the       same or similar amusement as may be supposed to take place between       an old debauchee and a prude—the feeling resentment on the one       hand from a prudential anxiety to preserve appearances and have a       character and on the other an inward sympathy with the enemy we       have only to suppose society innocent and then ninetenths of this       sort of wit would be like a stone that falls in snow making no       sound because exciting no resistance the remainder rests on its       being an offence against the good manners of human nature itself        “this source unworthy as it is may doubtless be combined with wit       drollery fancy and even humour and we have only to regret the       misalliance but that the latter are quite distinct from the former       may be made evident by abstracting in our imagination the morality       of the characters of mr shandy my uncle toby and trim which are       all antagonists to this spurious sort of wit from the rest of       tristram shandy and by supposing instead of them the presence       of two or three callous debauchees the result will be pure disgust       sterne cannot be too severely censured for thus using the best       dispositions of our nature as the panders and condiments for the       basest”—coleridge literary remains vol i pp 141 142    171 “he was a friend to virtue and in his most playful pages never       forgets what is due to it a gentleness delicacy and purity of       feeling distinguishes whatever he wrote and bears a correspondence       to the generosity of a disposition which knew no bounds but his last       guinea        “the admirable ease and grace of the narrative as well as the       pleasing truth with which the principal characters are designed       make the vicar of wakefield one of the most delicious morsels of       fictitious composition on which the human mind was ever employed        “ we read the vicar of wakefield in youth and in age—we return       to it again and again and bless the memory of an author who       contrives so well to reconcile us to human nature”—sir walter       scott    172 “now herder came” says goethe in his autobiography relating his       first acquaintance with goldsmith’s masterpiece “and together with       his great knowledge brought many other aids and the later       publications besides among these he announced to us the vicar of       wakefield as an excellent work with the german translation of       which he would make us acquainted by reading it aloud to us       himself        “a protestant country clergyman is perhaps the most beautiful       subject for a modern idyl he appears like melchizedeck as priest       and king in one person to the most innocent situation which can be       imagined on earth to that of a husbandman he is for the most       part united by similarity of occupation as well as by equality in       family relationships he

consolation is not sufficient for the present to call up and       guarantee the hope of a happier future imagine such a man with pure       human sentiments strong enough not to deviate from them under any       circumstances and by this already elevated above the multitude of       whom one cannot expect purity and firmness give him the learning       necessary for his office as well as a cheerful equable activity       which is even passionate as it neglects no moment to do good—and       you will have him well endowed but at the same time add the       necessary limitation so that he must not only pause in a small       circle but may also perchance pass over to a smaller grant him       good nature placability resolution and everything else       praiseworthy that springs from a decided character and over all       this a cheerful spirit of compliance and a smiling toleration of       his own failings and those of others—then you will have put       together pretty well the image of our excellent wakefield        “the delineation of this character on his course of life through       joys and sorrows the everincreasing interest of the story by the       combination of the entirely natural with the strange and the       singular make this novel one of the best which has ever been       written besides this it has the great advantage that it is quite       moral nay in a pure sense christian—represents the reward of a       goodwill and perseverance in the right strengthens an unconditional       confidence in god and attests the final triumph of good over evil       and all this without a trace of cant or pedantry the author was       preserved from both of these by an elocution of mind that shows       itself throughout in the form of irony by which this little work       must appear to us as wise as it is amiable the author dr       goldsmith has without question a great insight into the moral       world into its strength and its infirmities but at the same time       he can thankfully acknowledge that he is an englishman and reckon       highly the advantages which his country and his nation afford him       the family with the delineation of which

obviously enough censuring his       indecency and slighting his wit and ridiculing his manner in the       53rd letter in the citizen of the world        “as in common conversation” says he “the best way to make the       audience laugh is by first laughing yourself so in writing the       properest manner is to show an attempt at humour which will pass       upon most for humour in reality to effect this readers must be       treated with the most perfect familiarity in one page the author is       to make them a low bow and in the next to pull them by the nose he       must talk in riddles and then send them to bed in order to dream       for the solution” c        sterne’s humorous mot on the subject of the gravest part of the       charges then as now made against him may perhaps be quoted here       from the excellent the respectable sir walter scott “soon after       tristram had appeared sterne asked a yorkshire lady of fortune       and condition whether she had read his book ‘i have not mr       sterne’ was the answer ‘and to be plain with you i am informed it       is not proper for female perusal’ ‘my dear good lady’ replied the       author ‘do not be gulled by such stories the book is like your       young heir there’ pointing to a child of three years old who was       rolling on the carpet in his white tunics ‘he shows at times a       good deal that is usually concealed but it is all in perfect       innocence’ ”    182 “goldsmith told us that he was now busy in writing a natural       history and that he might have full leisure for it he had taken       lodgings at a farmer’s house near to the sixmile stone in the       edgeware road and had carried down his books in two returned       postchaises he said he believed the farmer’s family thought him an       odd character similar to that in which the spectator appeared to       his landlady and her children he was the gentleman mr mickle       the translator of the lusiad and i went to visit him at this       place a few days afterwards he was not at home but having a       curiosity to see his apartment we went in and found curious scraps       of descriptions of animals scrawled upon the wall with a blacklead       pencil”—boswell    183 “when goldsmith was dying dr turton said to him ‘your pulse is in       greater disorder than it should be from the degree of fever which       you have is your mind at ease’ goldsmith answered it was not”—dr       johnson in boswell        “chambers you find is gone far and poor goldsmith is gone much       farther he died of a fever exasperated as i believe by the fear       of distress he had raised money and squandered it by every       artifice of acquisition and folly of expense but let not his       failings be remembered he was a very great man”—dr johnson to       boswell july 5th 1774    184 “when burke was told of goldsmith’s death he burst into tears       reynolds was in his paintingroom when the messenger went to him       but at once he laid his pencil aside which in times of great family       distress he had not been known to do left his paintingroom and       did not reenter it that day        “the staircase of brick court is said to have been filled with       mourners the reverse of domestic women without a home without       domesticity of any kind with no friend but him they had come to       weep for outcasts of that great solitary wicked city to whom he       had never forgotten to be kind and charitable and he had domestic       mourners too his coffin was reopened at the request of miss       horneck and her sister such was the regard he was known to have for       them that a lock might be cut from his hair it was in mrs gwyn’s       possession when she died after nearly seventy years”—forster’s       goldsmith    185 “goldsmith’s incessant desire of being conspicuous in company was       the occasion of his sometimes appearing to such disadvantage as one       should hardly have supposed possible in a man of his genius when       his literary reputation had risen deservedly high and his society       was much courted he became very jealous of the extraordinary       attention which was everywhere paid to johnson one evening in a       circle of wits he found fault with me for talking of johnson as       entitled to the honour of unquestionable superiority ‘sir’ said       he ‘you are for making a monarchy of what should be a republic’        “he was still more mortified when talking in a company with fluent       vivacity and as he flattered himself to the admiration of all       present a german who sat next him and perceived johnson rolling       himself as if about to speak suddenly stopped him saying ‘stay       stay—toctor shonson is going to zay zomething’ this was no doubt       very provoking especially to one so irritable as goldsmith who       frequently mentioned it with strong expressions of indignation        “it may also be observed that goldsmith was sometimes content to be       treated with an easy familiarity but upon occasions would be       consequential and important an instance of this occurred in a small       particular johnson had a way of contracting the names of his       friends as beauclerk beau boswell bozzy i remember one day       when tom davies was telling that dr johnson said—‘we are all in       labour for a name to goldy’s play’ goldsmith seemed displeased       that such a liberty should be taken with his name and said ‘i have       often desired him not to call me goldy’ ”        this is one of several of boswell’s depreciatory mentions of       goldsmith—which may well irritate biographers and admirers—and also       those who take that more kindly and more profound view of boswell’s       own character which was opened up by mr carlyle’s famous article       on his book no wonder that mr irving calls boswell an “incarnation       of toadyism” and the worst of it is that johnson himself has       suffered from this habit of the laird of auchenleck’s people are       apt to forget under what boswellian stimulus the great doctor       uttered many hasty things—things no more indicative of the nature       of the depths of his character than the phosphoric gleaming of the       sea when struck at night is indicative of radical corruption of       nature in truth it is clear enough on the whole that both johnson       and goldsmith appreciated each other and that they mutually knew       it they were as it were tripped up and flung against each other       occasionally by the blundering and silly gambolling of people in       company        something must be allowed for boswell’s “rivalry for johnson’s good       graces” with oliver as sir walter scott has remarked for oliver       was intimate with the doctor before his biographer was—and as we       all remember marched off with him to “take tea with mrs williams”       before boswell had advanced to that honourable degree of intimacy       but in truth boswell—though he perhaps showed more talent in his       delineation of the doctor than is generally ascribed to him—had not       faculty to take a fair view of two great men at a time besides       as mr forster justly remarks “he was impatient of goldsmith from       the first hour of their acquaintance”—life and adventures p
