64813284	the garret and the garden by rm ballantyne    chapter one  the garret and the garden or low life high up  sudden friendships  in the midst of the great wildernesswe might almost say the wildsof that comparatively unknown region which lies on the surrey side of the thames just above london bridge there sauntered one fine day a big bronzed seaman of middle age  he turned into an alley down which nautically speaking he rolled into a shabby little court  there he stood still for a few seconds and looked around him as if in quest of something  it was a miserable povertystricken court with nothing to commend it to the visitor save a certain air of partialcleanliness and semirespectability which did not form a feature of the courts in its neighbourhood  i say capting remarked a juvenile voice close at hand youve bin an sailed into the wrong port  the sailor glanced in all directions but was unable to see the owner of the voice until a slight coughif not a suppressed laughcaused him to look up when he perceived the sharp knowing and dirty face of a small boy who calmly contemplated him from a window not more than a foot above his head  fun mischief intelligence precocity sat enthroned on the countenance of that small boy and suffering wrinkled his young brow  how dee know im in the wrong portmonkey demanded the sailor  cause there aint no grogshop in itgorilla retorted the boy  there is a mysterious but wellknown power of attraction between kindred spirits which induces them to unite like globules of quicksilver at the first moment of contact  brief as was this interchange of politenesses it sufficed to knit together the souls of the seaman and the small boy  a mutual smile nod and wink sealed as it were the sudden friendship  come now younker said the sailor thrusting his hands into his coatpockets and leaning a little forward with legs well apart as if in readiness to counteract the rolling of the court in a heavy sea theres no occasion for you an me to go beatin aboutoff an on lets come to close quarters at once  i havent putt in here to look for no grogshop  wich i didnt say you ad interrupted the boy  no more you did youngster  well what i dropped in here for was to look arter an old woman  if youd said a young un now i might ave blieved you returned the pert urchin  you may believe me then for i wants a young un too  well old salt rejoined the boy resting his ragged arms on the windowsill and looking down on the weatherbeaten man with an expression of patronising interest youve come to the right shop anyhow for that keemodity  in lunon weve got old women by the thousand an young uns by the million to say nuffin o middleaged uns an chicks  have ee got a partikler pattern in yer eye now or dee ony want

a slection  bein neither a beak nor a gentleman lad what would you say your name was to me  tommy splint replied the boy promptly  splint cause wen i was picked up a small babby at the workus door my

worry to childn wen theyre good so on the whole i think were better without em  chimleypot liz is parent enough for me  and who may chimneypot liz be asked the sailor with sudden interest  hm returned the boy with equally sudden caution and hesitancy  i didnt say chimneypot but chimleypot liz  wat is she  wy shes the ugliest old ooman in this great meetropilis an shes got the jolliest old art in lunon  her skin is wrinkled equal to the rynossris at the zooi seed that beast once at a sundayschool treat an her nose has been tryin for some years past to kiss her chin wich it would ave managed long ago too but for a tooth shes got in the upper jaw  shes ony got one but my that is a fang so loose that youd expect it to be blowed out every time she coughs  its a reglar grinder an cutter an stabber all in one an the way it works sometimes in the mouth sometimes outside the lip now an then straight out like a ships bowspritis most amazin an she drives it about like a nigger slave  gives it no rest  i do declare i wouldnt be that there fang for ten thousand a year  shes got two black eyes too has old liz clear an bright as beadsfit to bore holes through you wen she aint pleased and er nose is ooked  but i say before i tell you more about er i wants to know wot youve got to do with er  an wats your name  ive gave you mine  fair exchange you know  true tommy thats only right an fair  but i aint used to lookin up when discoorsin  couldnt you come down here an lay alongside  no old salt i couldnt but you may come up here if you like  youll be the better of a rise in the world wont you  the gangway lays just round the corner but mind your skyscraper for the ports low  theres a seat in the winder here  go ahead starboard your helm straight up then ardaport steady mind your jibboom splice the mainbrace heave the maindeck overboard and cast anchor longside o me  following these brief directions as far as was practicable the sailor soon found himself on the landing of the stair where tommy was seated on a rickety packingcase awaiting him  now lad said the man seating himself beside his new friend from what you tells me i think that chimneypot  chimley remarked the boy correcting  well then chimleypot liz from your account of her must be the very woman i wants  ive sought for her far an wide alow and aloft an bin directed here an there an everywhere except the right where till now  but ill explain  the man paused a moment as if to consider and it became evident to the boy that his friend was labouring under some degree of excitement which he erroneously put down to drink  my name continued the sailor is sam blakesecond mate o the seacow not long in from china  i didnt ship as mate  bein a shipwrecked seaman you see  shipwrecked exclaimed the boy with much interest expressed in his sharp countenance  ay lad shipwrecked an not the first time neither but i was keen to get home havin bin kep a prisoner for an awful long spell by pirates  pints interrupted the boy again as he gazed in admiration at his stalwart friend but he added i dont believe you  its all barn there aint no pints now an you think youve got hold of a green un  tommy said the sailor in a remonstrative tone did i ever deceive you  never replied the boy fervently leastwise not since we come acquaint arf an hour back  look here said sam blake baring his brawny left arm to the elbow and displaying sundry deep scars which once must have been painful wounds an look at this he added opening his shirtfront and exposing a mighty chest that was seamed with similar scars in all directions thats what the pirates did to me an my matestorturin of us afore killin us  oh i say exclaimed the urchin in a tone in which sympathy was mingled with admiration tell us all about it sam  not now my lad business firstpleasure arterwards  i prefers pleasure first an business arter sam  owever ave it yer own way  well you see continued the sailor turning down his wen i went to sea that time i left a wife an a babby behind me but soon arter i got out to china i got a letter tellin me that my susan was dead and that the babby had bin took charge of by a old nurse in the family where susan had been a housemaid  you may be sure my heart was wellnigh broke by the news but i comforted myself wi the thought o gittin home again an takin care o the dear babbya gal it was called susan arter its mother  it was at that time i was took by the pirates in the malay seasnow fifteen long years gone by  wat an you aint bin ome or seed yer babby for fifteen years exclaimed tommy splint  not for fifteen long year replied his friend  you see tommy the pirates made a slave o me an took me up country into the interior of one o their biggest islands where i hadnt a chance of escapin  but i did manage to escape at last through gods blessin an got to hongkong in a small coaster found a shipthe seacowabout startin for england shorthanded an got a berth on board of her  on the voyage the second mate was washed overboard in a gale so as i was a handy chap the capen he promoted me an now im huntin about for my dear little one all over london  but its a big place is london  yes an i suspect that youll find your little un raither a big un too by this time  no doubt returned the seaman with an absent air then looking with sudden earnestness into his little companions face he added well tommy splint as i said just now ive cruised about far an near after this old woman as took charge o my babby without overhaulin of her for she seems to have changed her quarters pretty often but i keep up my hopes for i do feel as if id run her down at lasther name was lizbeth morley  oho exclaimed tommy splint with a look of sharp intelligence so you think that chimleypot liz may be your lizbeth and our susy your babby  im more than half inclined to think that my boy returned the sailor growing more excited  is the old womans name morley  dun know  never heard nobody call her nothin but liz  and how about susan  thats the babby said the boy with a grin  yesyes said sam anxiously  well that babbys about five fut four now without er boots  you see uman creeturs are apt to grow considerable in fifteen yearsaint they  but is her name blake demanded the seaman  not as i knows of susys wot we all calls erso chimleypot liz calls er an so she calls erself an there aint another susy like her for five miles round  but come up sam an ill introduce eetheyre both overead  so saying the lively urchin grasped his new friend by the hand and led him by a rickety staircase to the rookeries above    chapter two  flowers in the desert  beauty and ugliness form a contrast which is presented to us every day of our lives though perhaps we may not be much impressed by the fact and this contrast is presented in evervarying aspects  we do not however draw the readers attention to one of the striking aspects of the contrastsuch as is presented by the hippopotamus and the gazelle or the pug with the bashed nose and the italian greyhound  it is to one of the more delicate phases that we would pointto that phase of the contrast wherein the fight between the two qualities is seen progressing towards victory and ugliness is not only overborne but overwhelmed by beauty  for this purpose we convey the reader to a scene of beauty that might compare favourably with any of the most romantic spots on this fair earthon the riviera or among the brazilian wilds or for that matter in fairyland itself  it is a gardena remarkably small garden to be sure but one that is arranged with a degree of taste and a display of fancy that betokens the gardener a genius  among roses and mignonette heliotrope clematis and wallflower chrysanthemums verbenas and sweetpeas are intertwined on rustic trelliswork the rich green leaves of the ivy and the graceful virginia creeper in such a manner that the surroundings of the miniature garden are completely hidden from view and nothing but the bright blue sky is visible save where one little opening in the foliage reveals the prospect of a grand glittering river where leviathans of the deep and small fry of the shallows of every shape and size disport themselves in the blaze of a summer sun  beauty meets the eye wherever turned but let the head of the observer be extended ever so little beyond the charmed circle of that garden and nearly all around is ugliness supreme  for this is a garden on the roof of an old house the grand river is the thames alive with the shipping of its worldwide commerce and all around lies that interminable forest of rookery chimneys where wild ungainly forms tell of the insane and vain efforts of man to cope with smoke where wild beastsin the form of catshold their nightly revels imitating the yells of agonised infants filling the dreams of sleepers with ideas of internal thunder or combustion and driving the sleepless mad  susyour susyis the cause of this miracle of beauty in the midst of misery this glowing gem in a setting of ugliness  it is her modest little head that has bent over the boxes of earth which constitute her landed property her pretty little fingers which have trained the stems and watered the roots and cherished the flowers until the barren housetop has been made to blossom like the rose  and love as usual has done it alllove to that very ugly old woman chimneypot liz who sits on the rustic chair in the midst of the garden enjoying it all  for liz has been a mother to that motherless bairn from her earliest years  she has guarded fed and clothed her from infancy taught her from gods book the old old story of redeeming love and led her to the feet of jesus  it would be strange indeed if susy did not love the ugly old woman until at last she came to regard the wrinkles as veritable lines of beauty the nutcracker nose and chin as emblems of persistent goodness the solitary wobbling tooth as a sign of unconquerable courage and the dark eyeswell it required no effort of imagination to change the character of the old womans eyes for they had always been good kindly expressive eyes and were at that date as bright and lively as when she was sweet sixteen  but chimneypot liz was poordesperately poor else she had not been there for if heaven was around and within her assuredly something very like pandemonium was underneath her and it not unfrequently appeared as if the evil spirits below were surging to and fro in a fierce endeavour to burst up the whole place and hurl the old woman with her garden into the river  evil spirits indeed formed the dread foundation of the old womans abode for although her own court was to some extent free from the curse this particular pile of building of which the garden formed the apex had a grogshop opening on another court for its foundationstone  from that sink of iniquity literal and unmitigated though not unadulteratedspirits of evil rose like horrid fumes from the pit and maddened the human spirits overhead  these descending to the foundationden soaked themselves in the material spirit and carried it up until the whole tenement seemed to reek and reel under its malign influence  but strange to say the riot did not rise as high as the garden on the roofonly the echoes reached that little paradise  now it is a curious almost unaccountable fact which no one would ever guess that a teapot was the cause of thisat least a secondary cause for a teapot was the chief instrument in checking if not turning the tide of evil  yes chimneypot liz held her castle in the very midst of the enemy almost singlehanded with no visible weapon of offence or defence but a teapot  we say visible because liz did indeed possess other and very powerful weapons which were not quite so obvioussuch as the word of god in her memory the love of god in her heart and the spirit of god in her soul  to the outside world however the teapot was her weapon and shield  we have read of such a weapon before somewhere in the glorious annals of city missions but just now we are concerned only with the teapot of our own liz of chimneypot notoriety  seated as we have said in a rustic chair gazing through the foliage at the busy thames and plying her knitting needles briskly while the sun seemed to lick up and clear away the fogs and smoke of the great city chimneypot liz enjoyed her thoughts until a loud clatter announced that susy had knocked over the wateringpot  oh granny thus she styled her im so sorry  so stupid of me luckily theres no water in it  never mind dear said the old woman in a soft voice and with a smile which for a moment exposed the waste of gums in which the solitary fang stood ive got no nervesnever had any and hope i never may have by the way that reminds meis the tea done susy  yes not a particle left replied the girl rising from her floral labours and thereby showing that her graceful figure matched well with her pretty young face  it was a fair face with golden hair divided in the middle and laid smooth over her white brow not sticking confusedly out from it like the tangled scrub on a neglected common or the frontal locks of a highland bull  thats bad susy remarked old liz pushing the fang about with her tongue for a few seconds  you see i had made up my mind to go down tonight and have a chat with mrs rampy and i wouldnt like to visit her without my teapot  the dear old woman is so fond of a cup of tea and she dont often get it good poor thing  no i shouldnt like to go without my teapot it would disappoint her you knowthough ive no doubt she would be glad to see me even emptyhanded  i should just think she would said susy with a laugh as she stooped to arrange some of the fastenings of her garden i should just think she would  indeed i doubt if that dear old woman would be alive now but for you granny  the girl emphasised the dear laughingly for mrs rampy was one of those middleaged females of the destitute class whose hearts have been so steeled against their kind by suffering and drink as to render them callous to most influences  the proverbial soft spot in mrs rampys heart was not reached until an assault had been made on it by chimneypot liz with her teapot  even then it seemed as if the softness of the spot were only of the guttapercha type  perhaps not perhaps not my dear returned old liz with that pleased little smile with which she was wont to recognise a philanthropic success a smile which always had the effect of subduing the tooth and rendering the plain face almost beautiful  although bordering on the lowest state of destitutionand that is a remarkably low state in londonold liz had an air of refinement about her tones words and manner which was very different from that of the poor people around her  this was not altogether though partly due to her christianity  the fact is the old woman had seen better days for fifty years she had been nurse in an amiable and wealthy family the numerous children of which seemed to have been born to bloom for a few years in the rugged garden of this world and then be transplanted to the better land  only the youngest son survived  he entered the army and went to indiathat deadly maelstrom which has swallowed up so much of british youth and blood and beauty  when the old couple became bankrupt and died the old nurse found herself alone and almost destitute in the world  it is not our purpose to detail here the sad steps by which she descended to the very bottom of the social ladder taking along with her susan her adopted daughter and the child of a deceased fellowservant we merely tell thus much to account for her position and her partial refinementboth of which conditions she shared with susan  now then said the latter i must go granny  stickle and screw are not the men to overlook faults  if im a single minute late i shall have to pay for it  and quite right susy quite right  why should stickle and screw lose a minute of their peoples work  their people would be angry enough if they were to be paid a penny short of their wages  besides the firm employs over two hundred hands and if every one of these was to be late a minute there would be two hundred minutes gonenigh four hours isnt it  you should be able to count that right off susy havin been so long at the boardschool  i dont dispute it granny said the girl with a light laugh as she stood in front of a triangular bit of lookingglass tying on her poor but neatly made hat  and i am usually three or four minutes before my time but stickle and screw are hard on us in other ways so different from samson and son where lily hewat goes  now im off  ill be sure to be back by halfpast nine or soon after  as the girl spoke footsteps were heard ascending the creaky wooden stair  another moment and tommy splint entering with a theatrical air announced  a wisitor  he was closely followed by sam blake who no sooner beheld susy than he seemed to become paralysed for he stood gazing at her as if in eager but helpless amazement  susy was a good deal surprised at this but feeling that if she were to wait for the clearing up of the mystery she would infallibly be late in reaching the shop of the exacting stickle and screw she swept lightly past the seaman with a short laugh and ran downstairs  without a word of explanation sam sprang after her but although smart enough on the shrouds and ladders of shipboard he failed to accommodate himself to the stairs of rookeries and went down as he afterwards expressed it by the run coming to an anchor at the bottom in a sitting posture  of course the lithe and active susy escaped him and also escaped being too late by only half a minute  never mind shell be back again between nine and ten oclock unless they keep her late said old liz after sam had explained who he was and found that susy was indeed his daughter and chimneypot liz the nurse who had tended his wife to her dying day and afterwards adopted his child  i never was took aback so in all my life said the seaman sitting down beside the old woman and drawing a sigh so long that it might have been likened to a moderate breeze  shes the born image o what her dear mother was when i first met her  my susy  well its not every poor seaman as comes off a long voyage an finds that hes fallen heir to a property like that  you may well be proud of her said old liz and youll be prouder yet when you come to know her  i know it and im proud to shake your hand mother an thankee kindly for takin such care o my helpless lassie  you say shell be home about ten  yes if shes not kep late  she always comes home about that time meanwhile youll have something to eat  tommy boy fetch out the loaf and the cheese and the teapot  you know where to find em  tommys an orphan capn blake that ive lately taken in hand  hes a good boy is tommy but rather wild  wot can you expect of a horphing said the boy with a grin for he had overheard the latter remark though it was intended only for the visitors ear  but i say granny there aint no cheese here cept a bit o rind that even a mouse would scorn to look at  never mind bring out the loaf tommy  an there aint no use continued the boy o bringin out the teapot cause there aint a grain o tea nowheres  oh  i forgot returned old liz slightly confused ive just run out o tea capn blake an i havent a copper at present to buy any but  never mind that old girl and i aint quite captain yet though trendin in that direction  you come out along wi me tommy  ill soon putt these matters to rights  old liz could not have remonstrated even if she had wished to do so for her impulsive visitor was gone in a moment followed by his extremely willing little friend  they returned in quarter of an hour  there you are said the seaman taking the articles one by one from a basket carried by tommy a big loaf pound o butter ditto tea three pound o sugar six eggs hunk o cheese paper o saltforgot the pepper never mind  youve bin an forgot the sassengers toobut here they are said tommy plucking the delectable viands from the bottom of the basket with a look of glee and laying them on the table  chimneypot liz did not look surprised she only smiled and nodded her head approvingly for she felt that sam blake understood the right thing to do and did it  soon the celebrated teapot was going the round full swing while the air was redolent of fried sausage and cheese mingled with the perfume of roses and mignonette for this meal you must know was eaten in the garden in the afternoon sunshine while the cookingdone in the attic which opened on the gardenwas accomplished by sam assisted by tommy  well you air a trump said the latter to the former as he sat down greasy and glowing beside the seaman at the small table where old liz presided like a humble duchess  we need hardly say that the conversation was animated and that it bore largely on the lifehistory of the absent susy  youre quite sure that shell be here by ten asked the excited father for the fiftieth time that afternoon  yes im sure of itunless shes kep late answered liz  but susy did not return at the usual hour so her impatient father was forced to conclude that she had been kep latetoo late  in his anxiety he resolved to sally forth under the guidance of tommy splint to inquire for the missing susy at the wellknown establishment of stickle and screw  let us anticipate him in that quest  at the usual hour that night the employes of stickle and screw left work and took their several ways home ward  susy had the company of her friend lily hewat as far as chancery lane  beyond that point she had to go alone  being summertime the days were long and susy was one of those stronghearted and strongnerved creatures who have a tendency to fear nothing  she had just passed over london bridge and turned into a labyrinth of small streets on the surrey side of the river when a drunken man met her in a darkish and deserted alley through which she had to pass  the man seized her by the arm  susy tried to free herself  in the struggle that ensued she fell with a loud shriek and struck her head on the kerbstone so violently that she was rendered insensible  seeing this the man proceeded to take from her the poor trinkets she had about her and would have succeeded in robbing her but for the sudden appearance on the scene of a lowland scot clad in a homespun suit of shepherds plaida strapping ruddy youth of powerful frame fresh from the braes of yarrow    chapter three  a visitor from the north  how that lowland scot came to the rescue just in the nick of time is soon told  mither said he one evening striding into his fathers dwellinga simple cottage on a moorand sitting down in front of a bright old woman in a black dress whose head was adorned with that frilled and baggy affair which is called in scotland a mutch im gawin to lunon  hoots havers david  its no havers mither  times are guid  weve saved a pickle siller faither can spare me for a wee whilesae im aff to lunon the morns mornin  an what for demanded mrs laidlaw letting her hands and the sock on which they were engaged drop on her lap as she looked inquiringly into the grave countenance of her handsome son  to seek a wife maybe replied the youth relaxing into that very slight smile with which grave and sternfeatured men sometimes betray the presence of latent fun  mrs laidlaw resumed her sock and needle with no further remark than hoots yere haverin for she knew that her son was only jesting in regard to the wife  indeed nothing was further from that sons intention or thoughts at the time than marriage so allowing the ripple to pass from his naturally grave and earnest countenance he continued  ye see mither im twuntythree noo an i wad like to see something o the warld afore i grow aulder an settle doon to my wark  as i said faither can spare me a while so ill jist tak my fit in my haund an awa to see the great bawbylon  ye speak o gaun to see the warld laddie as if ee was a gentleman  div ee think mother that the warld was made only for gentlemen to travel in demanded the youth with the gentlest touch of scorn in his tone  to this question the good woman made no reply indeed her stalwart son evidently expected none for he rose a few minutes later and proceeded to pack up his slender wardrobe in a shoulderbag of huge size which however was well suited to his own proportions  next day david laidlaw took the road which so many men have taken before himfor good or ill  but unlike most of his predecessors he was borne towards it on the wings of steam and found himself in great babylon early the following morning with his mothers last caution ringing strangely in his ears  david she had said i ken ye was only jokin but dinna ye be ower sure o yersel  although thae english lassies are a kine o waux dolls they have a sort o way wi them that might be dangerous to lads like you  hm  david had replied in that short tone of selfsufficiency which conveys so much more than the syllable would seem to warrant  the scottish youth had neither kith nor kin in london but he had one friend an old school companion who several years before had gone to seek his fortune in the great city and whose address he knew  to this address he betook himself on the morning of his arrival but found that his friend had changed his abode  the whole of that day did david spend in going about  he was sent from one place to another in quest of his friend and made diligent use of his long legs but without success towards evening he was directed to a street on the surrey side of the thames and it was while on his way thither that he chanced to enter the alley where poor susan was assaulted  like most scotsmen of his class and size david laidlaw was somewhat leisurely and slow in his movements when not called to vigorous exertion but when he heard the girls shriek and a moment later saw her fall he sprang to her side with one lithe bound like that of a bengal tiger and aimed a blow at her assailant which had it taken effect would have interrupted for some timeif not terminated for everthat rascals career  but the thief though drunk was young strong and active  it is also probable that he was a professional pugilist for instead of attempting to spring back from the blowwhich he had not time to dohe merely put his head to one side and let it pass  at the same instant david received a stinging whack on the right eye which although it failed to arrest his rush filled his vision with starry coruscations  the thief fell back and the scot tripped over him  before he could recover himself the thief was up like an acrobat and gone  at the same moment two policemen rushing on the scene in answer to the girls shriek seized david by the collar and held him fast  there was highland as well as lowland blood in the veins of young laidlaw  this sanguinary mixture is generally believed to possess effervescing properties when stirred  it probably does  for one moment the strength of goliath of gath seemed to tingle in davids frame and the vision of two policemens heads battered together swam before his eyesbut he thought better of it and restrained himself  tak yer hands aff me freens he said suddenly unclosing his fists and relaxing his brows  yed better see after the puir lassie  an dinna fear for me  im no gawn to rin awa  perceiving the evident truth of this latter remark the constables turned their attention to the girl who was by that time beginning to recover  where am i asked susy gazing into the face of her rescuer with a dazed look  yer a right puir bairn  see tak had o my airm said the scot  thats the way now take hold of mine said one of the constables in a kindly tone come alongyoull be all right in a minute  the station is close at hand  thus supported the girl was led to the nearest police station where david laidlaw gave a minute account of what had occurred to the rather suspicious inspector on duty  while he was talking susan who had been provided with a seat and a glass of water gazed at him with profound interest  she had by that time recovered sufficiently to give her account of the affair and as there was no reason for further investigation of the matter she was asked if her home was far off and a constable was ordered to see her safely there  ye needna fash said david carelessly im gawn that way mysel an if the puir lassie has nae objection ill be glad to  the abrupt stoppage in the youths speech was caused by his turning to susy and looking full and attentively in her face which now that the colour was restored and the dishevelled hair rearranged had a very peculiar effect on him  his mothers idea of a waux doll instantly recurred to his mind but the interest and intelligence in susys pretty face was very far indeed removed from the vacant imbecility which usually characterises that fancy article of juvenile luxury  of course if the girl wishes you to see her home said the inspector i have no objection but ill send a constable to help you to take care of her  help me to tak care o her exclaimed david whose pride was sorely hurt by the distrust implied in these words man i could putt her in my pooch an you alang wi her  of this remark mr inspector who had resumed his pen took no notice whatever but went on writing while one of the constables prepared to obey his superiors orders  in his indignation the young scot resolved to fling out of the office and leave the police to do as they pleased in the matter but glancing at susy as he turned round he again met the gaze of her soft blue eyes  cway lassie i wull gang wi ye he said advancing quickly and offering his arm  being weak from the effects of her fall susy accepted the offer willingly and was supported on the other side by a policeman  in a short time the trio ascended the rookery stair and presented themselves to the party in the garretgarden just as sam blake and tommy splint were about to leave it  it is impossible to describe adequately the scene that ensuedthe anxiety of the poor seaman to be recognised by his long lost babby the curious but not unnatural hesitancy of that babby to admit that he was her father though earnestly assured of the fact by chimneypot liz the surprise of david laidlaw and even of the policeman at being suddenly called to witness so interesting a domestic scene and the gleeful ecstasy of tommy splint over the whole affairflavoured as it was with the smell and memory of recent sassengers  when the constable at last bid them goodnight and descended the stair the young scot turned to go feeling with intuitive delicacy that he was in the way but once again he met the soft blue eyes of susy and hesitated  hallo young man cried sam blake on observing his intention you aint agoin to leave usarter saving my gals life prapsanywise her property  no no youll stop here all night an  he paused well i do declare i forgot i wasnt aboard my own ship but again he paused and looked at old liz  ive no room for any of you in the garret said that uncompromising woman there aint more than one compartment in it and thats not too big for me an susy but youre welcome both of you to sleep in the garden if you choose  tommy sleeps there under a big box and a clever seafarin man like you could  all right old lady cried the seaman heartily  ill stop an thankee well soon rig up a couple o bunks  so you will stop too young manby the way youyou didnt give us your name yet  my name is david laidlaw but i wont stop thankee replied the scot with unexpected decision of manner  ye see ive been lookin a this day for an auld freen an i must find him afore the morns mornin if i should seek him a nicht  but butmaybe ill come an speer for ee in a day or twaif i may  if you mean that you will come and call mr laidlaw said old liz we will be delighted to see you at any time  dont forget the address  nae fearill putt it i my notebuik said david drawing a substantial volume from his breast pocket and entering the addressmrs morley cherub courttherein  having shaken hands all round he descended the stair with a firm tread and compressed lips until he came out on the main thoroughfare when he muttered to himself sternly  waux dolls indeed theres nane o thae dollsll git the better o me hm a bonny wee face nae doot but what div i care for bonny faces if the hairts no richt  but suppose that the heart is right  who could have whispered that question  david laidlaw could not stop to inquire but began to hum    oh this is no my ain lassie   kind though the lassie be  in a subdued tone as he sauntered along the crowded street which by that time was blazing with gaslight in the shopwindows and oillamps on the hucksters barrows  the song however died on his lips and he moved slowly along stopping now and then to observe the busy and to him novel scene till he reached a comparatively quiet turning which was dimly lighted by only one lamp here he felt a slight twitch at the bag which contained his little all like lightning he turned and seized by the wrist a man who had already opened the bag and laid hold of some of its contents  grasping the poor wretch by the neck with his other hand he held him in a grip of iron    chapter four  dangers threaten  the man who had been thus captured by david was one of those wretched forlorn creatures who seem to reach a lower depth of wretchedness and degradation in london than in any other city in the world  although young and strongly made he was pale gaunt and haggard with a look about the eyes and mouth which denoted the habitual drunkard  the meanness of his attire is indescribable  he trembledwhether from the effects of dissipation or fear we cannot sayas his captor led him under the lamp with a grip on the collar that almost choked him but when the light fell full on his haggard face a feeling of intense pity induced the scot to relax his hold  oh ye puir meeserable crater he said but stopped abruptly for the man made a sudden and desperate effort to escape  he might as well have struggled in the grasp of a gorilla  na na my man yell no twust yersel oot o my grup sae easy keep quiet noo an ill no hurt ee  what gars ye gang aboot tryin to steal like that  steal explained the man fiercely what else can i do  i must live  ive just come out of prison and am flung on the world to be kicked about like a dog and starve  let me go or ill kill you  na eell no kill me  im no sae easy killed as ee think returned david again tightening the grasp of his right hand while he thrust his left into his trouserspocket  at that moment the bullseye light of an advancing constable became visible and the defiant air of the thief gave place to a look of anxious fear  it was evident that the dread of another period of prison life was strong upon the trembling wretch  drawing out a handful of coppers david thrust them quickly into the mans hand and said  hae tak them an aff ye go an ask the lord to help ee to dae better  the strong hand relaxed another moment and the man slipping round the corner like an unwholesome spirit was gone  can ye direck me polisman said the scot to the constable as he was about to pass t toor street  never heard of it said the constable brusquely but civilly enough  thats queer noo  i was telt it was hereabootstoor street  oh perhaps you mean tower street said the constable with a patronising smile  perhaps i div returned the scot with that touch of cynicism which is occasionally seen in his race  can ee direck me tilt  yes but it is on the other side of the river  naits on this side o the river said david quietly yet confidently  the conversation was here cut short by the bursting on their ears of a sudden noise at some distance  the policeman turned quickly away and when david advanced into the main street he observed that there was some excitement among its numerous and riotous occupants  the noise continued to increase and it became evident that the cause of it was rapidly approaching for the sound changed from a distant rumble into a steady roar in the midst of which stentorian shouts were heard gradually the roar culminated for in another moment there swept round the end of the street a pair of apparently runaway horses with two powerful lamps gleaming or rather glaring above them  on each side of the driver of the galloping steeds stood a man shouting like a maniac of the boatswain type  all three were brasshelmeted like antique charioteers  other helmets gleamed behind them  little save the helmets and the glowing lamps could be seen through the dark and smoky atmosphere as the steam fireengine went thundering by  now if there was one thing more than another that david laidlaw desired to see it was a london fire  often had he read about these fires for he was a great reader of books as well as newspapers and deeply had his enthusiasm been stirred though not expressed by accounts of thrilling escapes and heroic deeds among the firemen  his eyes therefore flashed back the flame of the lamps as the engine went past him like a red thunderbolt and he started off in pursuit of it  but as many people know and all may believe running in a crowded london street is difficulteven to an expert london thief  our scot found that out after a sixtyyards run then he had the wisdom to stop just as a little boy leaped out of his way exclaiming  ullo goliah mind were youre agoin to  i wonder yer mother let you hout all alone  whars the fire laddie demanded david with some impatience  ow should i know scotty  i aint a pleeceman ham i that i should be expected to know heverythink  as the engine had by that time vanished no one could tell where the fire was and as the street had reverted to its normal condition of noise and bustle david laidlaw gave up the search for it  he also gave up as hopeless further search for his friend that night and resolved to avail himself of one of those numerous establishments in the windows of which it was announced that good beds were to be had within  entering one the landlord of which had a round jovial countenance he ordered tea toast and sausages with pen ink and paper  having heartily consumed the former he devoted himself to the latter and proceeded to write a letter  here is the epistle  bawbylon i dinna ken where  5th july 18  dear mitherhere i am in lunon an wow but it is an awfu place eell no believe me but ive been lost twa or three times aready an ive

be ready for mair adventurs the mornin  yell admit that ive done gey n weel for the first day  at this rate ill be able to write a storybuik when i git hame  respecks to faither  yer affectionate son david  psthe lanlords just been in an ive had a lang crack wi him aboot the puir folk an the thieves o this great bawbylon  wow but i am wae for them  seems to me they have na got a chance i the battle o life  he says hell tak me to see ane o their low lodginhooses the morn  guidnicht    we turn now to a very different sceneto a west end drawingroom in which is to be found every appliance in the way of comfort and luxurious ease that ingenuity can devise or labour produce  an exceedingly dignified large selfpossessed yet respectful footman with magnificent calves in white stockings has placed a silver tray with three tiny cups and a tiny teapot thereon near to the hand of a beautiful middleaged ladythe mistress of the mansion  she is reading a letter with evident interest  a girl of seventeen whose style of beauty tells of the closest relationship sits beside her eagerly awaiting the news which is evidently contained in the letter  oh i am so glad rosa they have found traces of her at last  of who motherold nurse asked rosa  yes your fathers old nurse indeed i may say mine also for when i was a little girl i used to pay long visits to your grandfathers house and it seems that she is in great povertyalmost destitute  dear dear old nurse you wont be long in poverty if i can help it  as she spoke a handsome man of middle age and erect carriage entered the room  there was an expression of care and anxiety on his countenance which however partly disappeared when the lady turned towards him with a triumphant look and held up the letter  didnt i tell you jack that your lawyer would find our old nurse if any one could  he writes me that she has been heard of living in some very poor district on the south side of the thames and hopes to be able to send me her exact address very soon  i felt quite sure that mr lockhart would find her he is such an obliging and amiable man as well as clever  i declare that i cant bear to look at all the useless luxury in which we live when i think of the good and true creatures like old nurse who are perishing in absolute destitution  but being disgusted with our luxury and giving it all up would not mend matters little wife returned jack with a faint smile  rich people are not called upon to give up their riches but to use themto spend well within their means so as to have plenty to spare in the way of helping those who are willing to help themselves and sustaining those who cannot help themselves  the law of supply and demand has many phases and the profits resulting therefrom are overruled by a higher power than the laws of political economy  there are righteous rich as well as poor there are wicked poor as well as rich  what you and i have got to do in this perplexing world is to cut our particular coat according to our cloth  just so said the lady with energy  your last remark is to the point whatever may be the worth of your previous statements and i intend to cut off the whole of my superfluous skirts in order to clothe old nurse and such as she with them  rosa laughingly approved of this decision for she was likeminded with her mother but her father did not respond  the look of care had returned to his brow and there was cause for it for colonel brentwood had just learned from his solicitor that he was a ruined man  it is hard to have to bring you such news darling he said taking his wifes hand especially when you were so happily engaged in devising liberal things for the poor but god knows what is best for us he gave us this fortune when he inclined uncle richard to leave it to us and now he has seen fit to take it away  but howwhat do you mean by taking it away asked poor mrs brentwood perceiving that her husband really had some bad news to tell  listen i will explain  when uncle richard weston died unexpectedly leaving to us his estate we regarded it you know as a gift from god and came to england resolving to spend our wealth in his service  well yesterday mr lockhart informed me that another will has been found of later date than that which made me uncle richards heir in which the whole estate is left to a distant connection of whose very existence i had become oblivious  well jack returned the lady with a valiant effort to appear reconciled but that is not ruin you know  your pay still remains to us  ii fear not  that is to say believing the estate to be mine i have come under obligations which must be met and besides i have spent considerable sums which must be refundedall of which if i understand the law of the land rightly means ruin  for some moments mrs brentwood sat in silent meditation  well she said at length with the air of one who has made up her mind i dont understand much about the law of the land  all i know is that my purse is full of gold just now so i will snap my fingers at the law of the land and go right off to visit and succour our dear old liz    chapter five  a night of adventures  according to arrangement david laidlaw was taken the following evening by his landlord mr spivin to see one of the low lodginghouses of london  our adventurous scot had often read and heard that some of the low quarters of london were dangerous for respectable men to enter without the escort of the police but his natural courage and his thorough confidence in the strength of his bulky frame inclined him to smile at the idea of danger  nevertheless by the advice of his new friend the landlord he left his watch and money with the exception of a few coppers behind himcarefully stowed under the pillow of his bed in his shoulderbag  for further security the door of his room was locked and the key lung on a nail in an outoftheway corner known only as mr spivin pointed out to their two selves  but hoo dis it happen mr speevin asked david as they walked along the streets together that ye can gang safely amang the thieves withoot a polisman t proteck ye  oh as to that replied the jolly landlord im connected with a religious society which sends agents down among them poor houtcasts to convert em  they hall knows me bless you  but i aint agoin with you myself  you see im a very busy man and engagements which i ad forgotten prevents me but ive made an arrangement with one o the converted thieves to take you to a few of the worst places in london of course he can pass you hevery where as one of his friends  to this david made no reply save with a slight humph as he looked earnestly at his companion  but mr spivin wore an expression of seraphic candour  here he is added the landlord as they turned a corner and drew near to a man in mean attire who seemed to be waiting for some one  hes rather disreputable to look at only just been converted an not avin ad the chance yet to better himselfbuthalloyou seem to know him  the last exclamation and remark were called forth by the look of surprise on laidlaws face and the air almost of alarm on that of the meanlooking manalarm which was by no means unnatural seeing that he was none other than the fellow who had attempted to rob our scotsman the previous night  david however was quick to recover himself  know him he cried with a hearty laugh ay i ken him weel  i lent him a helpin haund last nicht no far frae here  surely he was not beggin exclaimed mr spivin in tones of virtuous reproof for a noo convert to go abeggin you know would be houtrageous  na na answered david with a quiet and somewhat cynical smile he wasna beggin puir lad but i took peety on im an geed im some bawbees  so this is yer new convert is he an hes to be my guide hell do  hell do  sae ill bid ye guidnicht mr speevin  as the scot held out his hand in a very decided manner the landlord was obliged to depart without further enlightenment after cautioning the converted thief to take good care of his friend  when he was gone the scotsman and the exconvict stood looking silently at each other the first with an earnest yet halfsarcastic smile the other with a mingled expression of reckless amusement in which however there was a trace of anxiety  weel noo said the former arent ye an ootanoot blagyird  if you mean by that an outandout blackguard answered the thief youre not far wrong  yere honest the noo ony way remarked the scot with a nod  noo my man look ye here  ye are nae mair convertit than yer freen speevin is though i took him for a rale honest man at first  but bein a blagyird as ye admit im wullin t hire ye in that capacity for the nicht  noo what i want is t see low life in lunon an if yell tak me to what they may ca the warst haunts o vice ill mak it worth yer whilean ive got mair siller than ye think for maybe  a stern frown settled on the thiefs face as david spoke  i suppose he said that you want me to show you the misery and destitootion among the poor of london that you may return to your ome in the north and boast that you ave done the slums  nana yere quite mistaen man returned david quickly but i want t see for mysel what ive heard sae muckle abootto see if its a true for im waeim correcting himself sorryfor the puir craturs an wud fain help some o them if i could  noo freen he continued laying his huge hand gently on the mans shoulder if ye want to earn something anll tak me t where i want t gangguid  if noill bid ye guidnicht  do you know said the man with a furtive glance at davids kindly face the risk you run from the men who live in such places if you go alone and unprotected  i ken the risk they run if they daur t meddle wi me  besides ill be naether alane nor unproteckit if ive you wi me for i can trust ye  a peculiar smile played for a moment on the haggard features of the thief  scotchman he said whatever your name may be i  my name is david laidlaw an ive nae cause t be ashamed ot  well mr laidlaw returned the thief in vastly improved language and tone im indebted to you for a good supper and a warm bed last night besides yours is the first friendly touch or kind voice that has greeted me since i was discharged and youve said you can trust me so ill do my best for you even though you should not give me a penny but remember you will go among a rough lot whom i have but little power to control  hoots cway man an dinna waste time haverin  saying this he grasped his guide by the arm in a friendly way and walked off much to the surprise of a policeman with an aquiline nose who turned his bullseye full on them as they passed and then went on his way shaking his head sagaciously  as the illassorted pair advanced the streets they traversed seemed to grow narrower and dirtier  the inhabitants partook of the character of their surroundings and it struck our scotsman that as ordinary shops became fewer and meaner grogshops became more numerous and selfassertive  from out of these dens of debauchery there issued loud cries and curses and ribald songs and occasionally one or two of the wretched revellers male or female were thrust out that they might finish off a quarrel with a fight in the street or because they insisted on having more drink without having the means to pay for it  at one particular point a woman in unwomanly rags was seen leaning up against a lamppost with an idiotical expression on her bloated face making an impassioned speech to some imaginary person at her elbow  the speech came to an abrupt end when losing her balance she fell to the ground and lay there in drunken contentment  at the same moment the attention of our explorer was drawn to a riot close at hand occasioned by two men engaged in a fierce encounter they were loudly cheered and backed by their friends until all were scattered by two powerful constables who swooped suddenly on the scene and captured one of the combatants while the other almost overturned david as he ran against him in passing and escaped  come down here said the thief turning sharp to the left and passing under a low archway  it led to a narrow alley which seemed to terminate in total darkness even laidlaws stout heart beat somewhat faster as he entered it but he did not hesitate  at the end of the passage a dim light appeared  it was thrown by a very dirty lamp and disclosed a small court of unutterable meanness and inconceivable smells  one or two men had brushed past them and david observed that his guide accosted these in a language or slang which he did not understand  ive got a friend in here said his guide opening a door and disclosing an extremely dirty room of about ten feet square  a woman with her back towards the door was busy at a washtub  ragged clothes were drying on a clothesline  a shattered bed on which lay a bundle of straw and a torn blanket stood in one corner a rickety table in another  water and soapsuds blotched the broken floor amongst which played two little boys absolutely naked  thats a woman that tries to keep respectable whispered the thief with something like a bitter laugh  hallo molly heres a genlemn as wants to bid ee goodnight  molly raised herself cleared the soapsuds from her thin arms and turned a haggard but not dissipated face towards her visitor who was almost choked not only by the smell of the place but by an uncontrollable gush of pity  my puir wumin he exclaimed hastily thrusting his everready hand into his pocket i didna mean t come in on ee unawears  hae yell no objec to a wheen bawbees  he put all the coppers he possessed into the womans hand and hurried out of the room  weel weel muttered david as they continued their walk through the miserable region ive gane an gied her a the siller i had i my pouch  pair thing  shell need it but ive naething left for onybody else  its just as well for theres nothing left now for any one to steal said his companion  whar are ee gaun noo asked laidlaw  the question put was not answered for his guide bidding him wait a minute turned into a doorway and engaged in a lowtoned conversation with a man  returning to his friend with an air of indecision about him the thief was on the point of speaking when a small party of men and womenevidently of the better classescame round the corner and approached  oho exclaimed the thief drawing his companion into the shade of the opposite doorway were in luck  you see this is what they call a low lodginghouse and the doorkeeper thought that respectable as you are in dress and looks it might not be wise to take you in  but well go in now at the tail o this lot and nobody will take notice of you only follow close to me  two of the lot who approached appeared to be respectablydressed young men carrying something like a large box between them  there were five altogether in the party two of whom seemed to be plainlydressed ladies  they entered the house at once with a quiet goodnight to the doorkeeper and were followed by the thief and david  entering a very large irregularlyformed room they proceeded to the upper end where a huge coal fire blazed  the room was crowded with men and boys of varied appearance and character  from every rank in society they had gravitatedbut all were stamped with the same branddestitution  they were not however destitute of lungs as the babel of sounds proved nor of tobacco as the clouds of smoke demonstrated  little notice was taken of the visitors  they were well known in that haunt of crime and woe  angels of mercy they were who after the labours of each day gave their spare time to the work of preaching salvation in jesus to lost souls  to the surprise of laidlaw the box before referred to became a harmonium when opened up and soon the harmony of praise to god ascended from the reeking den  then followed prayerbrief and to the pointafter which an earnest appeal was made to the sorrowing the suffering and the criminal to come and find deliverance and rest in the saviour  we may not dwell on this  some listened carelessly some earnestly others not at all  come now whispered the thief to his friend towards the close theyll have spotted you and will want to have a talk  weve no time for that  follow me  david who had been deeply interested also wanted to have a talk with these servants of the king of kings but his guide being already halfway down the room he was constrained to follow  another moment and they were in the street    chapter six  enemies turned to friends  you want to see as much as you can i suppose remarked the thief as he hastened along  come ill take you to our den  it seemed as if the man were leading his companion into deeper and deeper depths for the dark passage into which they finally turned and along which they groped their way seemed to be the very vestibule of pandemonium cries as of fierce and evil spirits being heard at the farther end of it  now said the thief stopping whatever you do here dont show fight  this is a thieves den  the passage at its farther end became absolutely dark so that the thief had to lead our hero by the hand  turning abruptly to the right they came upon a door through which there issued sounds of terrible revelry a knock produced no effect  a second and louder knock resulted in dead silence  then a female voice was heard inside  to it our thief replied in the language of the slums  immediately the door was opened just enough to let the two men glide in then it was shut with a bang and bolted  hallo trumps who ave you got here  were did you pick im up is he a noo member shouted several voices amid general laughter  the speakers were among a company of men and women whose general appearance and reckless expressions of countenance seemed to indicate that they were past redemption  the den in which they sat drinking smoking and gambling consisted of a dirty room fitted with narrow tables out of which opened an inner apartment  the door of this had been removedprobably for firewood in a time of scarcity  both rooms were lighted with dim oillamps  some of the company were beggars and tramps of the lowest type but most were evidently of the vicious and criminal order  there was a tendency to unpleasant curiosity in regard to the stranger but the thief whom we may now call trumps put an end to this with a few slang words and led his friend to a seat in the inner room whence he could observe nearly the whole party and all that went on  some of the more intoxicated among them objected to be snubbed by trumps and were beginning to scowl at the visitor no doubt with sinister intentions when the outer door was again opened and a young thief obviously familiar with the place entered closely followed by a respectablelooking man in a surtout and a light topcoat  it required no second look to tell that the newcomer was a city missionary  like our scot he had gained admission to the place through the influence of a friendly thief  hullo more visitors growled a big savagelooking man with an apron who proved to be the landlord of the den  advancing quickly to this man the missionary said in a quiet gentle tone  you supply coffee i see  may i have a cup  no you maynt you spy  i know you you canting wretch  he locked the door as he spoke and then striding forward in a towering rage threatened vengeance on the intruder  the company expecting a scene rose en masse to their feet while those in the inner room crowded to the front  laidlaw who was for the moment forgotten in this new excitement followed them  he was well enough informed in reference to the work of the london city missionaries to understand at a glance that one of those fearless men had managed to worm his way into the thieves den and was perhaps in danger of his life  that the man realised his danger was apparent from the fact that he stood erect and closed his eyes for a momentevidently in silent prayer for help in the hour of need  the act probably saved him for the ferocious landlord although ready enough to crush defiance with a savage blow did not quite see his way to dash his great fist into a mild manly face with shut eyes  it was such an unusual way of receiving his onset that he hesitated and lowered his fist  suddenly the missionary drew out a pocketbible and pointing upwards with it said in loud solemn tones a great white throne will be set up among the stars above us  the saviour who died for sinners will sit upon it and the dead that are in their graves shall hear his voice and live  we shall be there  at this the people were silenced apparently under a spellsome gazing upwards as if to see the throne others staring into the missionarys face in wonder  and i and you and you he continued pointing to one and another shall be there we must all stand before the judgmentseat of christ i am not an enemy or a spy but a servant of the lord jesus who will be your judge at the last day  he is now the saviour of the ruined and lost and in his name i offer you mercy through the blood he shed for you upon the cross  in his blessed book it is written whosoever believeth on him shall be saved  i hope to come again before long to see you friends  now landlord open that door and let me out  the landlord who seemed to be thoroughly taken aback unlocked the door with a trembling hand and the missionary passed out  but that was not the end of this remarkable visit  it was only the beginning of a grand work for christ which afterwards took place in and around that thieves den  on this however we may not do more than touch here  smitten in conscience that landlord hurried out after the missionary and actually begged of him to repeat his visit  then he returned to the den and found his people recovering somewhat from their surprise  but touched though the landlord was he had by no means changed his character  now then he demanded going up to david laidlaw are you a missionary too  na freen i am not but i maist wush that i was for its a graund wark t carry help t the destitute  well guvnor cried one fellow with a crushed nose and a huge black eye if thats wot youre aankerin arter you can go aead ere an elp us to yer earts content for were all destitoot in this ere den  so come along table down all the cash youve got about you  ill dae that wi pleasure said david rising promptly and turning all his pockets inside out  ye shall hae every bodle i possess  a general laugh greeted this proceeding and one young thief shouted well done checkers referring to his garments but ow comes it that youve bin cleaned out  plain as peasoup cried another  dont you see  hes bin keepin company with trumps  here trumps rose to explain  no pals thats not the reason but just before comin here he gave away every rap he had to poor widow grain  hes a brick cried one man with a fierce oath  hes a fool shouted another with a fiercer oath  regardless of the interruption trumps went on to explain how he had attempted to rob our hero and been caught by him and let off with a mild reproof and a lot of coppers  he also explained how that blackhearted villain tandy spivin meaning davids landlord had hired himtrumpsto take this genlemn pointing to david down into the den for a purpusahem of course on bein introdooced to him continued trumps i at once recognised the scotchman i had tried to rob and expected he would refuse to go with me but i soon found that scotty was a deep as well as a plucky cove and wasnt to be done out of his fun by trifles for he said he would go to the slums with me because he could trust metrust me palsnote that  a loud explosion of laughter interrupted the speaker at this point  what exclaimed several voices said e could trust you trumps  ay cried the thief looking suddenly fierce and why not  isnt it said theres honour among thieves  thrue for ye cried a big burglariouslooking irishman sure theres honour twixt the likes o you an me trumps but that genlemn ant a thief  thats so bill exclaimed another man with bloodshot eyes and beetling brows an its my opinion that as the cove haint got no browns e ought to contribute is checker suit to the good o the ouse it would fetch summat  the interest in the missionarys words seemed to be passing away for at this point the language and looks of some of the company made david laidlaw feel that he was indeed in a ticklish position  the threats and noise were becoming louder and more furious and he was beginning to think of the hopeless resource of using his fists when a loud exclamation followed by a dead silence drew every eye to the door  the girl to whom the keeping of it had been intrusted had neglected her duty for a moment  in letting one of the company out she incautiously stood looking through the open chink into the dark passage  that instant was seized by two tall and powerful limbs of the law in cloth helmets and with bullseye lanterns who pushed quietly but quickly into the room  shutting the door one of the constables stood with his back against it while the other advanced and examined the faces of the company one by one  there was dead silence for the constables were men of business not of words while the criminals some of whom became grave as well as silent seemed very anxious not to attract undue attention  the particular person wanted however was not there at that time  on coming to david who met the glare of the bullseye with his grave smile the constable looked surprised  i think young man he said in a low voice youve come to the wrong shop here  thats my business replied david coolly  well you know best of course but if youll take my advice youll come out of this place along with us  na  ill bide where i am  ill trust them  brayvo well done scotty burst from the company whose courage quickly revived when they found that no one there was wanted  the policemen laughed and went out  noo freens i want to say a word said david rising  im gaun awa an its ower late t mak a speech the nicht but i want t ask leave t come back here again an hae a crack wi ye  i want t ask ee some questions an gie ye some guid advice  may i come  of course you may scotty said the landlord grasping davids hand and receiving a goodhumoured squeeze that made him wince  youre a trump and well give you the freedom of the ouse  wont we pals  agreed agreed shouted the whole company and weve got two trumps now added a wag amid much laughter and staves of hes a jolly good fellow during the singing of which laidlaw and his friend took their departure  having marked the position of the den well and taken its bearings they said goodnight cordially and separated the thief to his lair and the scotsman to his lodging where he fully expected that the villain tandy spivin had availed himself of the opportunity to rob him  but he was wrong  he found his bag with his watch and money and his little all intact as he had left it    chapter seven  mischief brewing  david laidlaw was one of those comfortably constituted men who eat heartily sleep profoundly and lie thinking in bed in the mornings when awakewith philosophic intensity  on the morning after his first day in london our heros mind had to grapple with the perplexing question whether it was possible that a man with a jovial face a hearty manner welloff to all appearance in a worldly point of view and who chanced to have a mans money at his mercy yet did not take it could be a deceiver and in league with thieves  impossible  yet there were the damaging facts that mr spivin had introduced a thief to him as a true and converted man and that this thief besides denying his own conversion had pronounced himspivina blackhearted villain  it bothers me said david at length getting over the side of the bed and sitting there for some time abstractedly stroking his chin  pondering the subject deeply he dressed called for breakfast met spivin with a quiet guidmornin freen said that he had had a pleesant time ot i the slums and then went out to visit his friends in cherub court  before going however he removed his money from his bag put it in an inner breastpocket and paid his bill  you wont be back to dinner i suppose said the landlord in his genial manner  na  im gaun to plowter aboot a day an see the toon  i may be late o comin in but yell keep my bed for me an tak care o my bag  spivin said he would do so with such hearty goodwill that david said mentally hes innocent  at the moment a tall dark man with a sharp intelligent expression entered the house and bade the landlord goodmorning  the latter started laughed winked glanced expressively at the scotsman and returned the strangers salute in a tone that induced david to say mentally hes guilty  gravely pondering these contradictory opinions our hero walked along until he found himself close to the alley which led into cherub court a female yell issued from the alley as he came up and mrs rampy suddenly appeared in a state of violent selfassertion  she was a strong redfaced woman who might have been born a man perhaps with advantage  she carried a brokenlipped jug and was on her way to the shop which was at least the second cause of all her woes  standing aside to let the virago pass laidlaw proceeded to the court where to his great surprise he found tommy splint sitting on a doorstep not exactly in tears but with disconsolation deeply impressed on his dirty young face  eh laddie whats wrang exclaimed the scot his mind reverting anxiously and strangely enough to the waux doll  o mr laidlow exclaimed the boy  na na interrupted david im no laid low yet though the lunon folk hae done their best to bring me t that condeetion  my names laidlaw laddie  freens ca me david an ye may do the same

weel ye better stop where ye are an veepas ye saya wee while langer  ill gang up to see them  a minute more and david tapping at the garret door was bidden to enter by a sweet voice which caused the slightest imaginable sensation in his heart  susan was there alonenot owling as tommy had expressed it but with the traces of tears obviously about her eyes  she blushed deeply and looked a little confused as david entered probably because of being caught with the signs aforesaid on her cheeks  guidmornin miss blake said david earnestly giving the girl a warm shake of the hand  o lassie but i am sorry to hear that yere in trouble  i do assure ye that if a pund or twa would help yer granny  sh mr laidlaw said susan looking furtively round and speaking low  granny will hear  you must not offer her money  from father indeed if he were here she would accept it but not from aa stranger  am i then such a stranger asked david in a peculiar tone for the word sounded cold and disagreeable  again susan blushed yet felt a tendency to laugh as she replied well you know although you have helped me in trouble it is not very long since we met  but come and see granny shes in the gardenand please dont speak of our troubles  weel weel please yersel lassie returned the scot almost sternly as he followed susan into the garden on the roof where old liz sat in her rustic chair resting her head on her hand and looking sadly at the sunlight which flickered through the foliage on to the zinc floor despite susans caution laidlaw sat down beside the old woman and took her hand  noo mrs morley he said its o no use me tryin to haud my tongue whan i want to speak  im a plain northcountry man an i canna thole to see a puir auld body in trouble withoot offerin t help her  ive been telt o susys misfortin an aboot the rent and if yell accep  no sir no said old liz firmly but without any look of that pride with which she had been credited  i will not accept money from  but im no askin ye interrupted david to accep money as a giftonly as a loan ye ken withoot interest of course  not even as a loan said the old woman  besides young man you must not fancy that i am altogether penniless  i appen to ave shares in an american railway which my landlord advised me to buy with my small savings  no doubt just at present the dividend on the shares of the washab and roria railway have fallen off terribly but  what railway asked laidlaw quickly  the washab and roria  somewhere in the united states said liz  hm  i was readin the papers yestreen said david  ye see im fond o fishin aboot odd corners o the papersthe money market an stocks an the likean i noticed that vera railwayowin to its daftlike name nae dootan its deevidends are firstrate  ye could sell oot enow at a high profit gin ye like  indeed  you must be mistaken i think replied the old woman for i ave ad almost nothink for a year or two  you see my landlord who takes charge of these matters for me  thats mr lockhart the lawyer ye mean  yes  he says theyre losing money now and there was no dividend at all last halfyear  hm that is strange said david stroking his chin uncommon strange  dyou think mr lockhart has made a mistake mr laidlaw asked susan hopefully  ay i think he hes made a mistake  but ooll see  an noo to change the subjec ill tell ee aboot some o the adventurs i had last nicht  from this point david laidlaw entertained old liz and susy and tommy splint who had by that time joined them with a graphic account of his adventures in the slums in the telling of which he kept his audience in fits of laughter yet spoke at times with such pathos that susan was almost moved to tears  noo i must away he said at length rising  ive got partikler business in haund  come wi me tammy  ill want ee and ill come back sune to see ye auld liz  dinna ye tak on aboot losin yer place su miss blake lass  yell git a better place afore langtak my word for t  on the way downstairs laidlaw and his little companion passed a tall gentleman and two ladies who were ascending  ere the foot of the stair was reached loud exclamations of recognition and joy were heard in the regions above  i say exclaimed tommy splint with wideopen eyes aint they agoin of it up there  lets go back an listen  na ye wee rascal well no gang back  if ye want to be freens wi me yell no daur to putt yer lug to keyholes  come awa  its nae business o yours or mine  they had not gone far in the direction of chancery lane when to their surprise they met sam blake who had changed his mind about the visit to liverpool  david at once seized him by the arm and made him walk with them while he explained the circumstances in which his daughter and old liz had been so suddenly placed  wouldnt it be better for me said sam to steer straight for the garden than to go along with you  nayell gang wi me  its plain that they hae auld freens veesitin them at the gairden sae wed better lat them alane  besides i want ye for a wutness im no much o a polis man nevertheless im gaun to try my haund at a bit o detective business  just you come wi me and niver say a word till yere spoken to  heave ahead then skipper youre in command returned the sailor with a quiet laugh  it was echoed by little tommy who was hugely pleased with the semimysterious looks and nods of his scottish friend and regarded the turn affairs seemed to be taking as infinitely superior to mere ordinary mischief  arrived at chancery lane they soon discovered the office of john lockhart esquire solicitor  entering they found the principal seated at a table covered with papers and legal documents of all kinds  both the lawyer and the farmer felt but did not show some surprise on looking at each other    chapter eight  dark designs  the lawyer was first to speak  it strikes me i have seen you before he said looking at laidlaw with a sharp steady gaze  ay sir an ive seen you before returned the latter with an extremely simple look  i saw ye whan i was comin oot o the hoose o mr speevin whar im lodgin  oh exactly returned the lawyer with a bland smile pray be seated gentlemen and let me know your business  they obeyedsam blake with an expression of stolid stupidity on his countenance which was powerfully suggestive of a ships figurehead tommy with an air of meekness that was almost too perfect  it would be tedious to detail the conversation that ensued  suffice it to say that david said he was a scotch farmer on a visit to london that he possessed a good lot of spare cash for which at the time being he got very small interest that he did not understand business matters very well but what he wanted to know was how he should go about investing fundsin foreign railways for instance such as the washab and roria line  at this point he was interrupted by mr lockhart who asked what had put that particular railway into his head and was informed that the newspapers had done so by showing it to be the line whose shares produced very high dividends at that time  im richt i fancy said david  yes you are right and i could easily put you in the way of investing in that railway  have the shares been lang at this high figure asked laidlaw  yes they have improved steadily for several years back  what say ye to that freend demanded david turning to sam with a triumphant look  sam turned on his friend a look as expressionless as that of a dutch clock and said sententiously i says go in an win  i says ditto thought tommy splint but he meekly and wisely held his tongue  meanwhile the lawyer went into another room from which returning after a short absence he produced a bundle of reports which fully bore out his statement as to the flourishing condition of the washab and roria railway  weel ill see aboot it said david after a few moments consideration with knitted brows  in the meantime sir what have i to pay to you for yer information  mr lockhart said he had nothing to pay and hoped he would have the pleasure of seeing him soon again  noo isnt that a blagyird demanded laidlaw when they were again in the street  no doubt he is replied sam but how will you manage to haul him up and prove that he has been swindling the old woman  hoo can i tell  am i a lawyer  but ill fin oot somehoo  well mate while you are finding out returned the sailor ill go to cherub court  so tommy will you go with mr laidlaw or with me  the boy looked first at one and then at the other with a curious howhappycouldibewitheither expression on his sharp countenance and then elected to accompany the sailor  on the way he told sam of the swell visitors to the garret whom laidlaw had prevented him from going back to see  quite right he was tommy my boy said his friend  it is easy to see that you have not profited as much as you might from the example and teaching of my dear susy an chimneypot liz  chimleypot murmured the boy correcting him in a low tone  vell you could ardly expect he added that a child of my age should git the profit all at once  i suppose its like a bad ease o waxination it hant took properly yet  then we must have you revaccinated my boy  but tell me what were the swells like  the description of the swells occupied tommy all the rest of the walk to cherub court where they found old liz and susan in a state of great excitement about the visitors who had just left  why who dye think they was exclaimed the old woman making the fang wobble with a degree of vigour that bid fair to unship it altogether it was my dear sweet little boy jacky  little boy  granny cried susan with a merry laugh  of course child i mean what he was and ever will be to me  hes a tall middleaged gentleman now an with that nice wife that used to visit usan their sweet daughterjust like what the mother was exceptin those hideous curls tumblin about her pretty brow as i detest more than i can tell  an shes goin to be married too young as she is to a clergyman down in devonshire where the family was used to go every summer alongside o their lawyer mr lockhart as they was so fond of though the son as has the business now aint like his father the sweet childdear dear how it do call up old times  and didnt they broke in tommy never say a word about elpin you granny to git hout of your troubles  ow could they offer to elp me returned old liz sternly wen they knew nothink about my troubles an im very glad they didnt for it would have spoiled their visit altogether if theyd begun it by offerin me assistance  for shame tommy  youre not yet cured o greed my dear  did i say i was replied the urchin with a hurt look  lest the reader should entertain tommys idea we may here mention that colonel brentwood and his wife knowing old lizs character had purposely refrained from spoiling their first visit by referring to money matters  after a full and free discussion of the state of affairsin which however no reference was made to the recent visit to the lawyer or to the suspected foul play of that gentlemanthe sailor went off to overhaul messrs stickle and screw in the hope of inducing that firm to retain susy on its staff  failing which he resolved to pay a visit to samson and son  as for tommy he went off in a freeandeasy sort of way without any definite designs in search of adventures  that evening old liz filled her teapot threw her apron over it and descended to the court to visit mrs rampy  well you are a good creetur said that masculine female looking up as her friend entered  come away sit down i was wantin some one to cheer me up a bit for ive just ad a scrimidge with mrs blathers an its bin ard work  but she ave comed off second best i knows  as a black eye dishevelled hair and a scratched nose constituted mrs rampys share in the scrimidge mrs blatherss condition could not have been enviable  but it was evident from mrs rampys tone and manner that a more powerful foe than mrs blathers had assaulted her that afternoon  ah mrs rampy said her visitor pouring out a cup of tea with a liberal allowance of sugar if youd only give up that  now old liz interrupted her friend impressively dont you go for to preach me a sermon on drink  its all very well to preach religion thats natral like an dont much signify  youre welcome  but wotiver you do old liz keep off the drink  well thats just what i do replied liz promptly as she handed her friend a cup of hot tea and thats just what i was goin to advise you to do  keep off the drink  feeling that she had slightly committed herself mrs rampy gave a short laugh and proceeded to drink with much gusto and with a preliminary heres luck from the force of habit  but whats the matter with you today liz she asked setting her cup down empty and looking if not asking for more you looks dull  do i  i shouldnt ought to im sure for theres more blessins than sorrows in my cup said liz  just you put another lump o sugar in my cup anyhow returned her friend  i likes it sweet liz  thank ee  but what as appened to you  old liz explained her circumstances in a pitiful tone yet without making very much phrase about it though she could not refrain from expressing wonder that her railway dividends had dwindled down to nothing  now look ee here chimleypot liz cried mrs rampy in a fierce voice and bringing her clenched fist down on the table with a crash that made the teacups dance  you aint the only ooman as as got a teapot  she rose took a masculine stride towards a cupboard and returned with a teapot of her own which though of the same quality as that of her friend and with a similarly broken spout was much larger  taking off the lid she emptied its contents in a heapsilver and copper with one or two gold pieces intermixedon the table  there  thems my savins an youre welcome to what you need liz for as sure as youre alive and kickin if youve got into the ands of skinflint lockhart ell sell you up garding an all  i know im ahi know im  so elp yourself liz  tears rose to the eyes of old liz and her heart swelled with joy for was there not given to her here unquestionable evidence of her success in the application of lovingkindness  assuredly it was no small triumph to have brought drunken riotous closefisted miserly fierce mrs rampy to pour her hardwon savings at her feet for which on her knees she thanked god that night fervently  meanwhile however she said with a grave shake of her head  now mrs rampy that is uncommon good of you an i would accept it at once but i really wont require it for now that susys father as returned i can borrow it from him an sure hes better able to lend it than you are  now dont be angry mrs rampy butave some more tea  while she was speaking her friend shovelled the money back into the teapot with violence and replaced it in her cupboard with a bang  you wont git the hoffer twice she said sitting down again  now liz lets ave another cup an dont spare the sugar  that i wont said liz with a laugh as she poured out her cheering but not inebriating beverage  on the second day after the teaparty just described john lockhart esquire and mr spivin met in a low publichouse not far from cherub court  they drank sparingly and spoke in whispers  it may seem strange that two such men should choose a low tavern in such a neighbourhood for confidential intercourse but when we explain that both were landlords of numerous halfdecayed tenements there the choice will not seem so peculiar  lockhart frowned darkly at his companion  from what you have told me of his inquiries about me he said this mans suspicions had certainly been roused and he would not have rested until he had made undesirable discoveries  it is lucky that you managed to get the job so well done  they put their heads together and whispered lower  from time to time lockhart gave vent to a grim laugh and spivin displayed his feelings in a tooamiable smile    chapter nine  the plot thickens  in his remarkably eager and somewhat eccentric pursuit of pleasurethat pursuit which is so universal yet so diverse among men to say nothing about boystommy splint used to go about town like a jovial lioncub seeking whom he might terrify  to do him justice tommy never had any settled intention of being wicked  his training at the hands of chimneypot liz and the gentle susy had so far affected his arab spirit that he had learned on the whole to prefer what he styled upright to dishonourable mischief  for instance he would not steal but he had no objection to screen a thief or laugh at his deeds  his natural tenderness of heart prevented his being cruel to dogs or cats but it did not prevent his ruffling some of the former into furious rage and terrifying many of the latter into cataleptic fits  one afternoon having roved about for some time without aim sometimes howling in at open doors and bolting frequently heaping banter upon goodnatured policemen occasionally asking of mild old ladies the way to places he had never heard of or demanding what oclock it was of people who did not possess watches and whistling most of the time with irritating intensityour little hero at last came to the conclusion that felicity was not to be obtained by such coursesnot at least at that time  he was out of sorts somehow so he would return to the garden and comfort susy and the old woman ie find comfort to himself in their society  he went whistling along therefore until his steps were suddenly and violently arrested  to account for this we must tell how about this time it chanced that a very drunk man of the very lowest london type as far as appearance went awoke from a heavy slumber which he had been enjoying under the seat of a compartment in a certain low ginpalace  he was about to stretch himself and give vent to a noisy yawn when the word laidlaw smote his ear  pale wornout cadaverous threadbare inexpressibly mean the man gently raised his dissolute form on one elbow and listened to two men in a box beside him  their heads met almost over the spot where his own head rested  the men were lockhart and spivin and the occasion was that on which we have already described them as engaged in plotting or referring to the downfall of the man from scotland  trumps for he was the listener though well practised in the art of eavesdropping could not gather the gist of the plotters discourse only this he made out that in some way or other they meant to do or had done mischief to the man who had spared and helped and above all had trusted him  it was tantalising to hear so little though so near for from his position under the seat he could have grasped mr lockharts ankles  but the plotters were much too knowing to speak in tones that could be easily overheard  besides other noisy people were arguing in the neighbouring and opposite compartments so that the confusion of tongues rendered them they thought safe  even the man under the seat although so very near would have failed to catch the drift of a single sentence had not the name of laidlaw sharpened his ears and faculties  one that he did catch however was suggestive viz put the 50 pound note in his bag or something to that effect  when the two friends rose to depart trumps sank noiselessly on the ground like a filthy shadow but the quick eye of the lawyer caught sight of his leg  lockhart started turned aside and gave trumps a kick in the ribs  it was a sharp painful kick but drew from him only a heavy snore  to make quite sure the man of law administered another kick  this caused the recumbent man to growl forth a savage oath which terminated in a snore so very natural that the lawyer fell into the trap and went off with the contemptuous remarkdead drunk  trumps however was very much the reverse  he was indeed all alive and greatly sobered by his nap as well as by what he had heard  he rose and followed the plotters but missed them in the crowd outside  in his anxiety to overtake them he ran somewhat violently against tommy splint and thus arrested him as we have said in the pursuit of pleasure  hallo thunderbolt exclaimed the boy sternly as he started back and doubled his fists who let you out o noogate  the thief was about to pass without deigning a reply when glancing at the small questioner he suddenly stopped and held out his hand  i say splint is it you ive run into  well its uncommon like me  anyow not a twin brother i spose it must be myself  but i haint got the pleasure o your acquaintance as i knows on  what  dont you remember trumps  no i dont remember trumps an wots more i dont blieve from the look of im that any of trumpss family or friends wants to remember im  the possibility that the boy might remember trumps was not so unlikely after all for being of a highly social disposition tommy was pretty well acquainted with and known to nearly all the thieves and pickpockets of the locality  indeed he would certainly have been one of themselves but for garretgarden influences  well tommy said the thief confidentially i remember you an i wants a little conversation with you  no you dont returned the boy retreating you wants my wipe or puss or ticker you door suthin o that sortbut youve come to the wrong shop you have  but really tommy ive got summat to say to ee about your noo friend from scotland david laidlaw  how dee know hes my friend asked tommy becoming suddenly interested  cause ive seen you jawin with im an ive seen you go up together to visit chimneypot liz an susy an  oh you knows chimleypot liz an susy do ye  but of course you does everybody as knows anythink knows them  ay lad an i knows lawyer lockhart too said trumps with a peculiar look him that owns the ouses ereabouts an draws the rents  draws the rents interrupted the boy with a look of scorn screws the rents you mean  jus so boyscrews em  ah e is a thief is lawyer lockhart  come if thats so youve no occasion to be ard on im trumps for youre in the same boat you know  no i aint replied trumps with virtuous indignation for es a mean thief  oh an youre a ighminded one i spose returned the boy with a hearty chuckle but come along young man  if youve suthin to tell me about daaavid laidlaw im your man  this way  he led the man down the alley across the court round the corner and up the stair to the landing  there you are he said this is my snuggerymy boodwar so to speak sot down an out with it  seated there the thief in low confidential and solemn tones related what he had seen and heard in the publichouse and told of his own acquaintance with and interest in laidlaw  the willains exclaimed tommy  an wot dee think theyre agoin to do  screw im someow an git im out o the way  but wy  thats wot i wants to ask you lad  i knows nothing more than ive told ee  we must save daaavid exclaimed tommy in a tragic manner clutching his hair and glaring  tommys sense of the ludicrous was too strong for him even in the most anxious times and the notion of him and trumps saving anybody overwhelmed him for a moment nevertheless he really was excited by what he had heard  comecome with me he cried suddenly seizing trumps by the sleeve of his shabby coat and half dragging him up to the garret where he found old liz and susy in the garden on the roof  allow me to introdooce a friend granny  e aint much to look at but never mind es a good un to go  old liz and susy had become too much accustomed to low life in its worst phases to be much troubled by the appearance of their visitor and when he had explained the object of his visit they became deeply interested  you think then said liz after listening to the whole story that lawyer lockhart intends to hide a 50 pound note in mr laidlaws travelling bag and say he stole it  yes maam thats what i think  and for what purpose asked susy with some anxiety  to git him convicted an sent to prison miss replied trumps promptly  i know lawyer lockhartwe call im liar lockhart in the well ahem an as i was sayin es a villain asll stick at nothing if e sets is art on gittin mr laidlaw into prison ell git im in for what purpus of course i dont know  after further discussion of the subject it was finally arranged that tommy splint should go straight to the house of mr spivin where the scotsman lodged and reconnoitre  and be sure tommy whispered susan at the head of the stair when he was about to leave that you find out all about this horrid plot  we must save him  he saved me you know she added with a blush  yes we must save im said the boy in a tone of determination that inspired confidence in the girl even though it made her laugh  trumps accompanied tommy part of the way and told him that he knew some ugly things about lawyer lockhart that might get that gentleman into difficulties if he could only prove them but he couldnt quite see his way to that not being learned enough in the law  you see tommy  thomas if you please interrupted the urchin with dignity  my hintimates calls me tommy but you aint one o them yet mr trumps you aint even on my wisitin list  praps i may promote yer to that some day butit depends  now look ere slimeycoatif any one larned in the law was inclined to pump you could you be pumped  with a remarkably sly look trumps replied yesfor a consideration  all right young man  give me your card or if you haint got one let me know were you ang hout  having been satisfied on this point tommy told the thief that he had no further use for him and as he wished to cross london bridge alone he trumps was free to make himself scarce    chapter ten  detective doings  for a considerable time the boy prowled about the house of mr spivin in the hope of seeing david laidlaw go out or in but our scot did not appear  at last a servantgirl came to the open door with a broom in her hand to survey the aspect of things in general  tommy walked smartly up to her despite the stern gaze of a suspicious policeman on the opposite side of the street  my sweet gal he said affably touching his cap is capting laidlaw within  theres no captain laidlaw here answered the girl sharply there was a daivid laidlaw but  daaavid my dear not daivid  the genlmn hisself told me and surely e knows ow to prenounce is own name best  youve a deal of cheek boyanyway laidlaw as bin took up an es now in prison  the sudden look of consternation on the boys face caused the girl to laugh  dee know were theyve took im to  no i dont  but surely you dont blieve es guilty said the boy forgetting even his humorous tendencies in his anxiety about his friend  no i dont said the girl becoming suddenly earnest for mary an me saw  marthaaa shouted a female voice from the interior of the house at that moment  the girl ran in  at the same time the suspicious policeman came up with now then youngster move on  move off you mean bobby  haint you been to school yet stoopid cried the boy applying his thumb to his nose and moving his fingers in what he styled a thumbetrical manner as he ran away  but poor tommy splint was in no jesting mood  he had been impressed with the idea from infancyrightly or wronglythat once in the clutches of the law it was no easy matter to escape from them and he was now utterly incapable of deciding what his next step should be  in this difficulty he was about to return disconsolate to cherub court when it occurred to him that it might be worth while to pay a visit to the good ship seacow and obtain the opinion of sam blake  although it was broad day and the sun was glowing gloriously in an unclouded sky he found sam down in a dark hole which he styled his bunk fast asleep  sam did not move when tommy shook and woke him  he merely opened his eyes quietly and said all right my lad whats up  after hearing the boys story to the end he merely said mind your helmclear out flung off his blankets and bounded to the floor like an acrobat  being already in his shirt short drawers and stockings it did not take quite a minute to don trousers vest and coat  another minute sufficed for the drawing on of boots fastening a necktie running a broken comb through his front locks and throwing on a glazed hat  two minutes all told  men whose lives often depend on speed acquire a wonderful power of calmlyrapid action  what dee say to it sam asked tommy as they hurried along the streets  hold on avast belay  im thinkin said sam  the boy accordingly held on avasted and belayed until his companion had thought it out  yes thats it said the sailor at last  ill go an see colonel colonelwhats is name old lizs friendburntwood is it or  brentwood said tommy  thats itbrentwood  you dont know his address do you  no  never mind well go to cherub court an get it and then make sail for the colonels  ive no more notion which way to steer lad than the man in the moon but the colonel will be sure to know how to lay our course an hell be willin ive no doubt first for his own sake seein that this lockhart is his own lawyer second for old lizs sake seein that her affairs are involved in it and third for the sake of his country if hes a good and true man  the sailor was not disappointed  colonel brentwood did not indeed himself know exactly how to act but he knew that the best thing to do in the circumstances was to seek aid from those who did know  he therefore went straight to scotland yardthat celebrated centre of the london police forceand put the matter before the authorities there  a detective named dean was appointed to take the job in hand  john observed mrs brentwood to her husband prophetically after an interview with the detective at their own house you may depend upon it that mr dean will discover that more things are amiss than this affair of the scotsman and dear old nurse  possiblyindeed probably returned the colonel but what makes you think so  the fact that no thorough scoundrel ever yet confined himself to one or two pieces of villainy  but lockhart is not yet proved to be a thorough scoundrel  you have condemned the poor man my dear without trial and on insufficient evidence  insufficient evidence echoed dora indignantly  what more do you want  has he not systematically robbed dear old liz  are not the railway share lists and reports open to inspection  true dora true  be not indignant  i have admitted that you may be right  our detective will soon find out  he has the calm selfconfident penetrating look of a man who could if possible screw something out of nothing  whether or not mr dean possessed the power ascribed to him is yet to be seen  we have not space to follow him through the whole of the serpentine sinuosities of his investigations but we will watch him at one or two salient points of his course  first of all he visited tommy splint who in the privacy of his boodwar revealed to him as he thought every scrap of information about the affair that he possessed  to all of this mr dean listened in perfect silence patiently and with a smile of universal benevolence he not only appreciated all the boys commentaries and jests and prophecies on the situation but encouraged the full development of his communicative disposition  tommy was charmed  never before had he met with such an audienceexcept perhaps in susy  when the boy had fairly run himself out mr dean proceeded to pump and squeeze and the amount of relevant matter that he pumped and squeezed out of him in crossquestioning was so great that tommy was lost in a mixture of admiration and humility  you see up to that time he had thought himself rather a knowing fellow but mr dean managed to remove the scales from his eyes  now my boy said the detective after having squeezed him quite flat and screwed the very last drop out of him you are quite sure i suppose as to mr trumpss wordsnamely that he knew mrs morley chimneypot liz as you call her  parding  i never called her thatchimleypot is her name  well chimleypot be itand that he had formerly known mr lockhart but did not say when or where he had first become acquainted with either yet trumpss peculiar look and manner when speaking of the lawyer led you to think he knew more about him than he chose to tell  right you air sir  thats ow it stands  good and in reference to the servantgirlyou are sure that she became suddenly very earnest when she said she believed laidlaw was not guilty and that she and some one named mary had seen something but you dont know what owing to a sudden interruption  right again sir  now then said mr dean rising we will go up and see mrs morley  they found the old woman alone knitting in her rustic chair in her floral bower on the roof  mr dean sat down to have a chat and tommy seated himself on a stool to gaze and listen for he was fascinated somehow by the detective  it was really interesting to observe the tact with which the man approached his subject and the extreme patience with which he listened to the somewhat garrulous old woman  being a briton he began of course with the weather but slid quickly and naturally from that prolific subject to the garden in connection with which he displayed a considerable knowledge of horticulturebut this rather in the way of question than of comment  to slide from the garden to the gardener was very easy as well as natural and here mr dean quite won the old womans heart by his indirect praise of susys manipulation of plants and soils  to speak of susy without referring to susys early history would have been to show want of interest in a very interesting subject  mr dean did not err in this respect  from susys mother he naturally referred to the family in which she and old liz had been in service and to the return of the only surviving member of it to england  all this was very interesting no doubt but it did not throw much light into the mind of mr dean until old liz mentioned the fact that mr lockhart besides being solicitor to the brentwoods was also solicitor to old mr weston who had left his property to colonel brentwood  she also said that she feared from what mrs brentwood had recently said to her there was some difficulty about the will which was a pity as the only people she knew besides mr lockhart who knew anything about it were a footman named rogers and a butler named sutherland both of whom had been witnesses to the will but the footman had gone to the bad and the butler had gone she knew not where  then mr dean began to smell another rat besides that which he was just then in pursuit of for the colonel had incidentally mentioned to him the circumstance of the estate passing away from him owing to a new will having been recently discovered  although the matter was not the detectives present business he made a mental note of it  after quitting the garden and promising soon to return the detective had an interview with mr trumps in the parlour of the thieves missionary  many a fallen and apparently lost man and woman had been brought to the saviour in that parlour by that missionarythe same whom we have introduced to the reader in the thieves den  through the medium of tommy splint the interview was brought about and no sooner did trumps ascertain the object that dean had in view than he became suddenly confidential  now look here he said when he found himself alone with mr dean i knows more about them brentwoods and westons than you think for  no doubt you do and i suppose you wish to sell your knowledge at the highest possible figure said dean with a very slight smile  youre wrong for once returned trumps  if youd said that to me two days ago id ave said yes but ive eard things in this blessed room wich as made me change my mind  youre welcome to all i knows for nothing  mr dean did not believe in sudden conversion nevertheless he expressed gratification  being what the yankees call cute he avoided anything like eagerness in gaining information  my business here however he said is to get information about that scotsman you know and the charge of theft by mr lockhart  we believe laidlaw to be innocent and understanding that you think as we do and that you know something about him we hope you may be able to help us  from this point mr dean began to pump and squeeze and trumps proved worthy of his name in the way he submitted to both processes  at last when nothing more was to be got mr dean said in a somewhat careless way you are acquainted i believe with old mrs morleychimneypot liz they call herare you not  yes i am  ive known her long  knew her when i was footman in a family connected with the brentwoods  oho thought mr dean with sudden surprise for he began to smell more of his second rat but he looked stolid said nothing did not move a muscle merely nodded his head gently as if to say go on  now i know what youre driving at continued trumps with a very knowing wink an ill help you  first place my name aint trumps  i know thatits rodgers said the detective  whew how dee know that exclaimed the thief in extreme surprise  we detectives know everything said dean  oh then theres no need for me to tell you anything more returned trumps alias rodgers with a grin  well i dont know exactly everything returned dean but i do know at least i guessthat you were a footman in the service of richard weston esquire of weston hall in kent that the butlers name was sutherland and that you and he were witnesses to mr westons will  just so  youre right  now are you aware said mr dean that colonel brentwood has lost or is going to lose his estate because a new will by richard weston has been found leaving it to another man  no i did not know that but that clears up to me the mystery of the will that i witnessed  you must know that when we were witnessing the will sutherland and me both noticed that it was eight pages of big paper and that it seemed to have two beginningsone bein in the middle  master couldnt see well an was very weak at the timeso weak that when he came to the last page the pen fell out of his hand and only half of the last name was signed  mr lockhart said that would do however an we witnessed it  master never completed the signature for he took to his bed that very day and no one ever saw him put pen to paper again  sutherland often spoke to me about that and wondered if a will with an imperfect signature would pass  howsever it was none of our business so we forgot about it and soon after sutherland went to stay with a family in pimlico as butler where i think he is now  as for me  yes i know said dean significantly you need not recall that just now  can you give me the name and address of the family in pimlico  good now then said mr dean after booking his information ill want to see you again so dont get yourself into scrapes and keep your tongue quiet  your missionary will help you i have no doubt meanwhile i will go and pay a visit to a certain martha who lives on the other side of the river    chapter eleven  pumping and squeezingthe garret class etcetera  when mr dean succeeded with some difficulty in obtaining a private interview with mr spivins servant martha he proceeded with much politeness and subtlety to pump and squeeze her  and it may be remarked here that mr dean had what martha afterwards styled a way with him that was quite irresistible insomuch that she was led somehow to speak of things she never meant to mention and to reveal things she never intended to confess  you see sir she said its the dooty of me an mary to do the bedrooms wen the familys at breakfast  well that morning we went as usual to mr laidlaws room first because es quick with is meals an wants is boots put in is room so as he may get out immediately  mr laidlaw as no luggage sir only a shoulderbag an it was lyin open on the table so me an mary looked into it just toto  to see that nothing had tumbled out suggested mr dean  i understand  just so sir assented martha and there was nothink in it but a spare shirt rolled up and a pair of socks and a small bibleno money or watch or anythink that would break even if it did tumble outis shavin things and all that being on the dressintableso  so your mind was relieved marthawell go on  but as we was agoin to close the bag continued the girl we observed an inner pocket an mary says praps there was a loveletter in it  i laughed an said lets look an see  so we looked an saw nothink  you both looked and were quite sure of that asked mr dean  yes quite sure for we both felt the pocket all round as well as looked into it  well go on  then we shut the bag and after we had finished the room we was just goin out when master he ran upstairs as if he was in a hurry  he came into the room with a bit of paper in is and somethink like a bank note but he started on seein us an crumpled up the paper an stuffed it in is pocket  at the same time e got very angry scolded us for being so slow and ordered us off to the other rooms  not ten minutes after that in comes mr lockhart the lawyer with two policemen an seizes mr laidlaw who was still at is breakfast  at first he got very angry an shoved one policemen over the sofa and the other into the coalscuttle at the same time sayin in a growly voice i thinkeeveawgeenmadtheegitheroh i cant speak scotch exclaimed martha bursting into a laugh  better not try my dear said dean with a peculiar smile  well then continued martha on recovering herself when the policemen got up again mr laidlaw said he had no intention of running away only e said rinnin awa and that he would go with them quietly if theyd only be civil e called it seevil and assured them they had made a mistake  they was more civil after that for mr laidlaw ad doubled is fists an looked oh my like a bengal tiger robbed of its young ones  so they all went straight to the bedroom and me an mary followed with master and missis and the waiters an they searched all round the room coming to the bag last though it was the only thing on the table and right under their noses an sure enough they found a 50 pound note there in the little pocket  and what said the scotsman to that asked mr dean with a slight grin  he said turning to master it was you did thateeblagyird cried martha again bursting into laughter at her scotch  and then continued martha one of the policemen said e ad seen mr laidlaw not long ago in company with a wellknown thief and the other one swore e ad seen im the same night in a thieves den and that e was hevidently on a friendly footin wi them for e ad refused to quit the place and was hinsolent  at this lawyer lockhart shook is ead and said e thought it was a bad case an the poor scotsman seemed so took aback that e said nothinkonly stared from one to another and went off quietly to prison  after investigating the matter a little further and obtaining through martha a private interview with mary who corroborated all that her fellowservant had said mr dean went straight to pimlico and interviewed the butler who had been in the service of the weston family thereafter he visited colonel brentwood and in the presence of his wife and daughter discussed the whole affair from beginning to end  we will spare the reader that discussion and turn towards newgate  on the evening of that day poor david laidlaw found himself in durance vile with massive masonry around him and a very vesuvius of indignation within him  fortunately in the afternoon of the following day which chanced to be sunday a safety valvea sort of craterwas allowed to him in the shape of pen ink and paper  using these materials he employed his enforced leisure in writing to that receptacle of his early and later joys and woeshis mother  whar dye think ive gotten t noo mither the letter began

to see me i my cell an the moment he cam in though he was half greetin he lookit roond an said isnt this a sell  eh but he is auldfarrant wi mair gumption than mony fullgrown men to say naething o women  but david laidlaw had more friends in london than he was aware of  at the very time that he was penning the foregoing epistle to his mother a number of disreputablelooking men were bewailing his fate and discussing his affairs in the thieves den and two equally disreputable women were quarrelling over the same subject in a wretched dwelling in the presence of a third woman who presided over a teapot  one of the women whose visage exhibited marks of recent violence struck her fist on the table and exclaimed no mrs rampy you are wrong as usual  the story i eard about im was quite different an i believes it too for them scotsmen are a rough lotno better than they should be  mrs blathers remarked mrs rampy in a soft sarcastic tone which she was wont to assume when stung to the quick and which her friend knew from experience was the prelude to a burst of passion i may be wrong as usual but as you have never seen or conwersed with this scotsman an dont know nothink about im perhaps you will condescend to give me an liz the kreckt wershion  now mrs rampy interposed old liz grasping her teapot dont be angry for mrs blathers is right  scotsmen are no better than they should be  neither are english nor irish nor welshmen  in fact theres none of usmen or womennearly as good as we should be  now i am sure it wont be denied continued liz in an argumentative tone that mrs blathers might be better  ha  i wont deny it said mrs rampy with emphasis  nor continued liz hastening to equalise her illustration nor that mrs rampy might be better  right you are said mrs blathers with sarcasm  and im still surer said liz hurriedlya little put out at the ready reception of her propositionsthat i might be better  not at all interrupted both ladies at once youre a trump liz youre a dear creetur  come then cried old liz with a laugh that set the fang wobbling you are at all events agreed upon that point sohave another cup mrs rampy  thankee liz and plenty of sugar  hm you need it muttered mrs blathers no sugar at all for me liz  well now cried liz rendered bold by desperation i do wonder that two such strong warmhearted women as you should so often fall out each of you loves some onedont i knowwith powerful affection so why couldnt you love each other  this tribute to their feelings so tickled the women that they set down their teacups and laughed prodigiously  now dotheres a couple of dearsshake hands over your tea an lets have a pleasant talk said old liz following up her advantage  the mollified women did not shake hands but each raised her teacup to her lips and winked  your ealth blathers  same to you rampy  and now liz said the latter as she pushed in her cup for more lets ear all about it  yes said mrs blathers also pushing in her cup lets ave your wersion liz  while liz gives her version of laidlaws misfortunes we will return to the garden where being sunday afternoon susy blake was busy with a small class of the most disreputable little ragged boys that the neighbourhood produced  the boys were emphatically bad boys  they feared neither god nor man the property of other people was their chief source of livelihood and the streets or the jails were their homes  nevertheless when in the garden class those boys were patterns of good behaviour because each boy knew that if he did not behave and keep quiet he would infallibly be dismissed from the class and this was a punishment which none of them could endure  unlike many other teachers susy had not to go about enticing boys to her sabbath class  her chief difficulty was to prevent them coming in such numbers as would have overflowed the garden altogether  and the secret of this was that susy blake possessed much of an unconscious influence called lovingkindness  no weapon of the spiritual armoury is equal to this  in the hands of a man it is tremendous  in those of a pretty girl it is irresistible  by means of it she brought the fiercest little arabs of the slums to listen to the story of jesus and his love  she afterwards asked god the holy spirit to water the good seed sown and the result was success  but lovingkindness was not her only weapon  she had in addition quite a glittering little armoury in which were such weapons as play of fancy lively imagination fervent enthusiasm resolute purpose fund of anecdote sparkling humour intense earnestness and the like all of which she kept flashing around the heads of her devoted worshippers until they were almost beside themselves with astonishment repentance and good resolves  of course when away from her influence the astonishment was apt to diminish the repentance to cease and the good resolves to vanish away but resolute purpose had kept susy at them until in the course of time there was a perceptible improvement in the environment of cherub court and a percentage of souls rescued from the ranks of the ragamuffins  on this particular sunday tommy splint who was a regular attendant at the garden class arrived late  why tommy said the teacher turning herself from a little boy on whom she had been trying specially to impress some grand eternal truth this is not like you  has anything happened to detain you  no susy answered the boy slipping into his placewith a compound expression in which the spirit of fun whom no one doubted gave the lie to the spirit of penitence in whom no one believedbut ive bin to a sort o sunday class aready  indeed where have you been  at mrs rampys were i seed a most hedifyin spectaclegranny tryin to bring mrs rampy an mrs blathers to a eavenly state of mind over a cup of tea an them both resistin of er like one oclock  ah my boy said susy shaking her head and a finger at the urchin youve been eavesdropping again  no indeed susy i hant returned the boy quite earnestly not since the time you nabbed me with my ear to the keyole of quarrelsome tims door  i was asittin at mrs rampys open door quite openly likethough not quite in sight i dessayan they was pitchin into each other quite openly too an granny atryin to pour ile on the troubled waters  it was as good as a play  but wen mrs rampy takes up her cup to drink the ealth of mrs b an says with sitch a look your ealth blathers i could old on no longer  i split and bolted thats wot brought me ere a little sooner than i might ave bin  there was a tendency to laugh at this explanation which susy did not check but after a few moments she held up a finger which produced instant silence while she drew a letter from her pocket  im sorry to disappoint you today tommy she said handing him the letter but i must send you with this to my father  mr brentwood called with it not half an hour since saying it was of importance to have it delivered soon as it was connected with the case of mr laidlaw  so be off with it as fast as you can  you know where to find fatheron board the seacow  tommy splint was indeed disappointed at having to leave the garden class thus abruptly  he consoled himself however with the reflection that he was perhaps doing important service to his friend daaavid laidlaw he further consoled himself on reaching the court below by uttering a shriek which sent a cat that chanced to be reposing there in rampant alarm into the depths of a convenient cellar  thereafter he went into a contemplative frame of mind to the docks and found sam blake as usual in his bunk  i say sam dee spend all yer timenight and dayin yer bunk  not exactly lad answered the seaman with a smile but without showing any intention to rise  you see we seadogs have a hard time of it  what with bein liable to be routed out at all hours an expected to work at any hour we git into a way of making a grab at sleep when an where we gits the chance  im makin up leeway just now  bin to church in the forenoon though  i aint a heathen tommy  you looks uncommon like one anyhowwith your air an ead an beard an blankits mixed up together all of a mush  theres a letter for ee old man  without a word the sailor took the epistle read it slowly while the boy watched him keenly then thrust it under his pillow  you aint agoin to clear for action at once then said the boy  no not just yet  any message for me asked tommy  none wotsomedever  seeing that his friend did not intend to be communicative the boy wisely changed the subject  now sam about them pirits  were was it they fust got old of you  down somewheres among the philippine islands replied sam drawing the blankets more comfortably round him but to tell you the truth lad after theyd taken our ship an made every man o the crew walk the plank except me an the skipper they putt us in the hold tied up hand an futt so as we could scarce move  why they spared us was a puzzle to me at the time but i afterwards found out it was because somehow theyd got it into their heads that the skipper an mate of our ship knew somethin about where some treasure that they were after had been buried  hand me that there pipe tommynot the noo one the short black fellow wi the turks head on the bowl  thankee  an did you know about the treasure asked tommy handing the pipe in question  bless you no returned the seaman proceeding to render the confined air of the bunk still more unbearable we knowd of no treasure  if we had wed have bin arter it ourselves double quick  as it was they burnt us wi hot irons an tortered us in various ways to make us confess but we had nothin to confess so had to grin an bear it sometimes to yell an bear it  you see lad they mistook me for the mate so thats how i came to escape  he was a fine man was that mate continued the seaman in a lower tone a strong handsome kind young officer an a great favourite  ive often wondered why he was taken an me spared  praps it was for susys sake suggested tommy  sam looked at the boya quick halfsurprised glance  not a bad notion that my lad  i shouldnt wonder if it was for susys sake  i never thought o that before  anyhow i comfort myself sometimes when i think o the poor mate that he was saved a deal o torterin which let me tell you aint easy to bear  but go aead sam with more about the pirits said tommy  no lad nonot just now  i wants to snooze  soyou clap on all sail an youll be in time yet for the tail end o susys lesson    chapter twelve  through fire and smoke to felicity  free once more david laidlaw naturally directed his steps towards cherub court  his freedom was the result of mr deans labours for with the information which he had ferreted out that sedate individual found no difficulty in proving the innocence of our scotsman and the guilt in more matters than one of mr john lockhart  the latter was however too wideawake for our detective for when a warrant was obtained for his apprehension and mr dean went to effect the capture it was found that the bird had flown with a considerable amount of clients property under his wing  although laidlaws period of incarceration had been unusually brief it had afforded ample time for meditation  davids powers of meditation were stronghis powers of action even stronger  while in his cell he had opened his little biblethe only book allowed himand turned to the passage which states that it is not good that man should be alone  then he turned to that which asserts that a good wife is from the lord after which he sat on his bench a long time with his eyes closedit might be in meditation perhaps in prayer  the only words that escaped him however were in a murmur  ay mither yere right  yeve been right iver since i kent ye  but yell be sair putt aboot woman whan ye hear that shes a waux doll doll indeed angel wad be mair like the truth  but haud ye there david yeve no gotten her yet  with some such thoughts in his brain and a fixed resolve in his heart he presented himself in the garden on the roof where he found old liz susy and sam blake assembled  they all seemed as if oppressed by some disappointment but their looks changed instantly on the entrance of the visitor  susy especially sprang up with a bright smile but observing the readiness and the look with which laidlaw advanced to meet her she checked herself blushed and looked as well as felt confused  my poor little girl is greatly put about said sam blake in explanation because shes just heard from samson and son that theyve too many hands already an dont want her  dont want her exclaimed the scot theyre born eediots  the emphasis with which this was said caused susy to laugh and to discover that her skirt had been caught by a nail in one of the flowerboxes  at the same time a vague suspicion for the first time entered the head of old liz causing her to wobble the fang with vigour and look at laidlaw with some anxiety  at this critical moment feet were heard clattering and stumbling up the stair as if in tremendous haste  next moment tommy burst upon their vision in a full suit of superfine blue with brass buttons  tommy exclaimed susy in amazement  no madamno  tummas if you please said the boy with dignity though almost bursting with suppressed excitement  im manservant to colonel john brentwood esquire mp frzqt feller of the royal societyan good society an every other society  salary not yet fixed lodgin washin an wittles found  parkisites warious  but why didnt you tell us of this before asked liz patting the urchins head and smiling benignantly  cause i wanted to screw you up vith surprise an ive done it too but ive ony jest entered on my dooties and ave bin sent immedingtly with a message that you an susy are expected to pay us a wisit which is now doo an mr daaavid laidlaw is to go there right awayvithout delayas we say in the poetical vest end  and when are susy and i expected asked liz  tomorrer  but what are you tommy  what are you engaged to do asked susy  play wi the knives amoose myself wi the boots and shoes of a mornin entertain wisitors at the door with brief conversations take occasional strolls with messages be a sorter companion to miss rosa wots to be married in a veek or two and ginerally to enjoy myself im a tiger i is but i dont growloh no  i only purr  my name is tummas an my ome is marble alls  our scotsman went off without delay in response to the message and was thus prevented from carrying out his fixed resolve just then however he wouldnt give in not he he would soon find a more convenient opportunity  meanwhile tommy splint having particularly requested and obtained leave to spend the nighthis last night before going to servicewith his granny he and sam set to work in the garden to rig up temporary sleeping arrangements a la robinson crusoe for it was arranged that they should have a grand supper in the garret in honour of the rescue of laidlawthe returned convict alias ticketofleave man as tommy called himand that the males of the party should thereafter sleep in the garden  need we say that the supperparty was jovial  we think not  the ticketofleave man and the tiger were inimitable in their own lines and sam came out so strong on the pirits of the philippine islands that the tiger even declared himself to be satiated with blood as for susyshe would have been an amply sufficient audience for each of the party had all the others been away and the fang of old liz became riotously demonstrative though she herself remained silent gazing from one face to another with her glittering black eyes  finally the ladies retired to rest in the garret and the gentlemen went to sleep in the garden  ah how very old yet ever new is the word that man knows not what an hour may bring forth  forces unseen unthought of are ever at work around us from the effects of which it may be human strength is powerless to deliver  that night lateor rather about the early hours of morninga spark which earlier in the night had fallen from the pipe of a drunkard in the publichouse below began to work its deadly way through the boarding of the floor  for a long time there was little smoke and no flame gradually however the spark grew to a burning mass which created the draught of air that fanned it  it chanced that night that under the influence of some irresistible impulse or antagonistic affinity like a musical discord mrs rampy and mrs blathers were discussing their friends and neighbours in the abode of the former without the softening influence of the teapot and old liz  i smells a smell exclaimed mrs rampy sniffing  wery likely remarked mrs blathers your ouse aint overclean  but the insinuation was lost on mrs rampy who was naturally keen of scent  she rose ran to the window opened it thrust out her dishevelled head and exclaimed fire  no it aint said her friend its ony smoke  unfortunately the two women wondered for a few precious minutes and ran out to the court into which from a back window of the publichouse smoke was slowly streaming  just then a slight glimmer was seen in the same window  fire fire yelled mrs rampy now thoroughly alarmed  smoke smooooke shrieked mrs blathers  the two women were gifted with eminently persuasive lungs  all the surrounding courts and streets were roused in a few minutes and poured into the lanes and alleys which led to cherub court  that extremely vigilant body the london fire brigade had their nearest engines out in two minutes  many of the more distant men were roused by telegraph  though in bed partially clad and asleep at one moment the next moment they were leaping into boots and pantaloons which stood agape for them  brasshelmeted and like comets with a stream of fire behind them they were flying to the rescue five minutes after the yell and shriek of fiiire and smooooke  owing to the great elevation of the garden and its being surrounded by stacks of chimneys it was some minutes before the sleepers there were aroused  then like giants refreshed david and sam leapt from their bunks and like jackinthebox tommy splint shot from his kennel there was no occasion to dress  in the circumstances the three had turned in as sam expressed it all standing  they rushed at the door of the garret but it was bolted on the inside susy who had been awake had heard the alarm and drawn the bolt so as to give time for hastily throwing on a few garments  the men thundered violently and tried to force the door but the door was strong and an instinctive feeling of delicacy restrained them for a few seconds from bursting it open  susy  susy roared the father open  quick  fire  one moment father  im dressing granny and  a loud shriek terminated the sentence for the flames gathering headway with wild rapidity had burstup some part of the liquor den at the basement and went roaring up the staircase sending dense clouds of smoke in advance  this was enough  laidlaw threw his heavy bulk against the door burst lock and hinge and sent it flat on the garret floor  blinding smoke met and almost choked him as he fell and sam tumbling over him caught up the first person his hands touched and bore her out  it was old lizhalf dressed and wrapped in a blanket  susy also half dressed and with a shawl wrapped round her shoulders was carried out by laidlaw  both were unhurt though half stifled by smoke and greatly alarmed  ye ken the hoose tammy hoo shall we gang  theres no way to escape cried the poor boy with a distracted look  one glance at the staircase convinced laidlaw that escape in that direction was impossible  plunging into the garret again he seized the door and jammed it into its place thus stopping the gush of black smoke and giving them a few minutes breathing space  is there a rope in the garret asked sam eagerly  nonothink o the kind gasped tommy  no sheetsblankets asked the scot  only two or three replied susan who supported liz in the rustic chair  theyre much worn and not enough to reach near the ground  it was no time for useless talk  the two men said no more but sprang on the parapet outside the garden to find if possible a way of escape by the roofs of the neighbouring houses  the sight they beheld was sufficiently appalling  the fire which raged below them cast a noonday glare over the wilderness of chimneystacks around revealing the awful nature of their position and in one direction thousands of upturned faces  the men were observed as they ran along the parapet and a deep hoarse cry from the sympathetic multitude rose for a few moments above the roaring of the flames  on two sides the walls of the building went sheer down sixty feet or more without a break into a yard which bristled with broken wood and old lumber  evidently death faced them in that direction  the third side was the gableend of the garret  on the fourth side there was a descent of twelve feet or so on to the roof of the next block which happened to be lowerbut that block was already in flames  there is our chief hope said the sailor pointing to it  nay responded laidlaw in a low voice pointing upwardsoor main hope is there  i thocht they had fireescapes here he added turning to tommy who had joined them  so they ave but no escape can be got down the yards ere  the halleys is too narrer  come ill git a blankit to lower susan and auld liz said laidlaw hastening back to the garden where the trembling women awaited the result of their inspection  while the scotsman removed the door and dashed once again into the smokefilled garret the sailor hurriedly explained to the women what they were going to attempt and impressed upon them the necessity of submitting entirely to whatever was required of them which will be he said chiefly to shut your eyes an keep quiet  laidlaw quickly returned with a couple of sheets and a blanket  sam knotted the sheets together in sailorlike fashion while his friend made a secure bundle of old liz with the blanket  sam was lowered first to the roof of the tenement which we have said was already on fire and stood ready to receive liz  she was safely let down and the sheetrope was detached  well no mak a bundle o you said david turning to susy jist putt it roond yer waist  when she was safely lowered tommy was grasped by an arm and let down till his feet rested on sams head whence he easily leaped to the roof and then david let himself drop  to reach a place of temporary safety they had now to walk on the top of a partition of old brick about eight inches wide a fall from which on one side meant death on the other side broken bones at the least  they knew that a loose brick or a false step might be fatal but there was no alternative  sam turned to his daughter ye could never cross that susy he said  although no coward the poor girl shrank from the giddy ledge which was rendered more dangerous and terrible by being now surrounded by occasional puffs of smoke and clouds of steam from the water of a dozen hydrants which by that time were playing into the raging flames  to add to the horrors of the situation beams and masses of masonry were heard occasionally crashing in the interior of the building  sam advanced to take susy in his arms but laidlaw stepped between them  leave her t me he said the auld womans lichter an yere no sae strong as me  saying which he lifted the girl in his left arm as if she had been but a little child and mounted the parapet keeping his right arm free to balance himself or cling to anything if need be  sam who was quite equal to the emergency took old liz into his arms and followed but cast one glance back at tommy  never mind me sam cried the boy who having got over his first panic rose heroically to the occasion  the crowd below saw what they were attempting and gave them a cheer of encouragement yet with bated breath as if they dreaded the issue  a few seconds and they were past that danger but still stood on the burning house at another part of the roof  here being suddenly drenched by spray from one of the engines sam and tommy made for the shelter of a chimneystack  as there was not room behind it for more laidlaw carried his light burden to another stack and looked hastily round to see what next could be done  just at that moment there was a wild cheer below in the midst of which a stentorian voice came to them as it were on the wings of fire and smokestay where you are a minutethe escape is coming  thank god exclaimed laidlaw looking down at the fair head which rested on his shoulder  the cheeks were deadly white and the eyes closed but the pressure of her arms showed that the girl clung to him for very life  a bright shower of sparks at the moment flew around them  heeven an pandemonium brought thegither he thought as he bent over to protect her  his face was very near to hers  my puir wee doo he muttered and placed a timid kiss upon the pale cheek which instantly coloured as if the fires around had suddenly kindled them  o lassie forgie me  i didna mean to do thai raillydidnot but i couldna help it  i wad hae waited till ye gied me leave  but after awhat for no  i thought t ask ye t gie me the right this very day  and o lassie if i might only hope that  he stopped and something induced him to do that again  at the same moment another mighty roar ascended from the crowd and the head of the great fireescape rose like a solemn spectre through smoke fire and steam not ten yards from where he stood  hooray shouted tommy for he felt that they were saved  laidlaw said nothing but sprang to the head of the ladder got carefully upon it and began steadily to descend with susy  sam was about to follow with old liz but glanced at tommy  go first lad  arter you mate said the boy stepping politely back you see tigers like captings are always last to leave a sinkin ship  it was neither the time nor place for ceremony  with something approaching almost to a laugh the seaman got on the ladder as smartly as he would have taken to the shrouds of a ship and tommy followed  halfway down they met a swirl of smoke with an occasional tongue of flame shooting through it from a shattered window  at the same moment they encountered a brasshelmeted fellow springing boldly up through the same to the rescue  gang doon again freen shouted laidlaw when his heel came in contact with the helmet  were a safe here  he paused just a moment to draw the shawl completely over susys head and arms and to pull her dress well round her feet  then burying his face in the same shawl and shutting his eyes he descended steadily but swiftly  for a moment or two the rounds of the ladder felt like heated iron bars and there was a slight frizzling of his brown curly locks at the back  then a fresh draught of air and a tremendous stream of water that nigh washed him off the ladder  next moment they were safe on the ground in the midst of the wildlycheering crowd through which burst mrs rampy in a flood of joyful tears and seized old liz in her arms  mrs blathers followed close at her heels  my she exclaimed in sudden amazement staring at old lizs its gone  so it is cried mrs rampy for once agreeing  and so it was  the last fang belonging to chimneypot liz had perished in that great conflagration  many were the offers that old liz received of house accommodation that night from the lowest of washerwomen to the highest of tradesmen but sam blake in her behalf declined them all and proceeded to the main street to hail a cab  she aint urt is she  youre not takin er to a hospital cried one of the crowd  youll come back agin to stay with us lizwont you  no we wont cried a boys voice  weve come into our fortins an are agoin to live in the vest end for ever an ever  whos that blue spider asked a boy wynosurely it aintyesi do blieve its tommy splint  dont believe tommy friends said old liz as she was about to get into the cab  ill soon be back again to see you  trust me  this was received with a tremendous cheer as they all got inside except laidlaw who mounted the box  stop said the latter as the coachman was about to drive off  he pointed to the burning house where the raging fire had reached the rooftree  the crowd seemed awed into silence as they gazed  one swirl more of the flaming tongues and the garret was consumed another swirl and the garden was licked from the scene as effectually as though it had never been    chapter thirteen  the last  how that wonderful man detective dean managed it all is best known to himself and those myrmidons of the law who aided and abetted him in his investigations but certain it is that he prepared as pretty a little thunderbolt for john lockhart esquire as any man could wish to see  he not only ferreted out all the details of the matter involving the washab and roria railway and chimneypot liz but he obtained proof through a clerk in the solicitors office and a stain in a sheet of paper and a halffinished signature that the will by which mr lockhart intended to despoil colonel brentwood was a curiouslycontrived forgery  as men in search of the true and beautiful frequently stumble by accident on truths for which they did not search and beauties of which they had formed no conception so our detective unearthed a considerable number of smaller crimes of which the lawyer had been guiltyto the satisfaction of all concerned and the establishment of mrs brentwoods character as a prophetess so that didnt i tell you so jack became a familiar arrangement of household words in the ears of the poor colonel for some time afterwards  but the man of law did not await the discharge of the thunderbolt  as mr dean expressed it he was too cute for that  by some occult means known only to legal men he discovered what was in the air took time by the forelock and retired into privacyperhaps to the back settlements of peruwith all the available cash that he could righteously or otherwise scrape together  by so doing however he delivered colonel brentwood from all hindrance to the enjoyment of his rightful property and opened the eyes of chimneypot liz to the true value of shares in the washab and roria railway  a few days after the culminating of these eventsfor things came rapidly to a headmrs rampy of cherub court issued invitations for a small teaparty  this was the more surprising that mrs rampy was extremely poor and had hitherto been economical to an extent which deprived her of a sufficiency of food even for herself  but the neighbours soon came to know that a line of telegraph had been recently set up between cherub court and the west end through which flowed continuously a series of communications that were more or less astounding and agreeable to the inhabitants  the posts of this telegraph were invisible the wires passed high overhead very high and the particular kind of electricity used wassympathy  it must be explained here that it was the northern side of the court which had been burned so that mrs rampy inhabiting the south side still occupied her suite of apartmentsa parlour and a coalhole  the parlour having once been a wareroom was unusually large and well adapted for a teaparty  the coalhole having been a mere recess was well adapted for puzzling the curious as to what had been the object of its architect in contriving it  the party was not large but it was select  it included a washerwoman with very red arms a caretaker who had obviously failed to take care of herself a couple of chimneysweeps with partially washed faces a charwoman with her friend the female greengrocer who had been burned out of the opposite side of the court two or three costermongers a burglar several thieves a footman in resplendent livery a few noted drunkards and chimneypot liz with her teapotnot the original teapot of coursethat had perished in the flamesbut one indistinguishably like it which had been presented to her by colonel brentwood  she had insisted on carrying it with her to cherub court on that occasion on the ground that they would hardly recognise her without it especially now that the fang was gone  the resplendent footman had been the first guest to arrive along with liz and was welcomed by the hostess and mrs blatherswho aided and abetted her friend on that occasionwith effusive demonstrations of goodwill and surprise  thereafter the footman who seemed to be eccentric sat in a corner with his face buried in his hands and did not move while the other guests were assembling  when the room was full and the tea poured out mrs rampy looked at liz with a sly awkward air which was quite foreign to her nature  ah mrs rampy said liz dont be ashamed  lord bless usan our wittles said mrs rampy suddenly shutting her eyes as she opened her mouth to the intense surprise of her guests now then she added in a tone of great relief go aead wen youve got the chance  theres more were that come from  and about the cake mrs blathers like a good creetur  an it aint much o this blowhout you owes to me  i ony supplied the sugar cause that was in the ouse anyways  it is a good deed mrs rampy said old liz with a smile if youve supplied all the sweetness to the feast  thats a lie cried the hostess sharply  it was you that supplied it  if it adnt bin for you liz id never ave  mrs rampy broke down at this point and threw her apron over her head to conceal her feelings  at the same moment the eccentric footman raised his head and something like a pistolshot was heard as the burglar brought his palm down on his thigh exclaiming  i knowd it  trumpsor his ghost  es too fat for a ghost remarked a humorous thief  no mate i aint trumps said the resplendent man rising before the admiring gaze of the party  my name is rodgers footman to colonel brentwood of weston all  im a noo man houtside an in an ive come ere apurpuse to surprise you not only wi the change in my costoom but wi the noos that my masters comin down

take tea with us  an es bringin a lord with ima live lord  wot better is a live lord than any other man growled a thief with radical proclivities  right you are jim scroodger said trumps turning sharply on the speaker a live lord is no better than any other man unless e is better  indeed considerin is circumstances es a good deal wuss if es no better but a live lord is better than a dead thief wich youll be soon jim if you dont mend yer ways  hear hear and a laugh from the company  moreover continued trumps the lord thats acomin is better than most other men  hes a trump  not a brother o yourneh murmured the burglar  wy trumps i thought you was a detective  not in plain cloes surely remarked the humorous thief  ave another cup o tea man and shut up cried mrs blathers growing restive  well ladies and genlemen all resumed trumps with a benignant smile you know this lord thats acomin  some o you made im a present of a barrow an a hass once  i know im  bless is eart cried a costermonger through a mouthful of cake  at that moment the expected guests arrived  but reader we must not dwell upon what followed  there is no need  it is matter of history  while the inhabitants of the slums were thus enjoying a social evening together david laidlaw was busy with one of his numerous epistles to that repository of all confidenceshis mother  the deed is done mither he wrote an the waux doll is mine for better or waur till death us do pairt  of course i dinna mean that were mairried yet  na na  that event must be celebrated on the braes o yarrow wi your help an blessin  but

an its hundred o thoosands o thieves an pickpockets an burglarsto say naething o its prisons an lawyers an waux dolls  but im haverin  yell be gled t hear that colonel brentwoodhim that befreended meis a richt  his lawyer turned oot to be a leear an a swindler  the will that was to turn the colonel oot o a his possessions is a forgery  his bonny bairn rosa is like mysel gaun to be mairried an as the colonel has nae mair bairns hes gaun to devote himselso his wife saysto considerin the poor  frae my personal observation o lunnon hell hae mair than enough to consider honest man  in my last letter i gied ye a full accoont o the fire but i didna tell e that it was amang the chimleypots and bleezes that i was moved to what they ca pop the question to my susy  it was a daftlike thing to do i confess especially for a sedate kin o man like me but woman a mans no jist himsel at sik a time  after a it was a graund climax to my somewhat queer sort o coortin  the only thing im feart o in bawbylon is that the wee crater tammy splint should come to ken aboot it for i wad niver hear the end ot if he did  ye see though he was there a the time he didna ken what i was about speakin o that the bairn has been made a flunkey by the colonela teeger they ca him  whats mair surprisin yet is that he has taen the puir thief trumpsalias rodgersinto his hoosehold likewise and made him a flunkey  mrs brentwooddory as he cas herdidna quite like the notion at first but the colonels got a wonderfu wheedlin wey wi him an whan he said if you an i have been redeemed an reinstated why should not rodgers  dory like a wise woman gied in the argement ye ken was unanswerable  onywie hes in plush now an white stockins  an that minds me that theyve putt the wee laddie splint into blue tights wi brass buttons  he just looks like an uncanny sort o speeder  its a daftlike dress for onything but a puggy but the bairns as prood ot as if it was quite reasonable  it maitters little what he putts on hooiver for he wad joke an cut capers baith pheesical an intellectual i verily believe if he was gaun to be hanged  my faitherinlaw to be sam blake says hell come to scotland for the waddn but hell no stop  hes that fond o the sea that he canna leave t  its my opeenion that hell no rest till he gits a pirits knife in his breedbaskit  mairs the peety for hes a fine man  but the best news ive got to tell e mither is that colonel brentwood an his wife an daughter an her guidmana sensible sort o chiel though he is englishare a comin doon to spend the autumn on the braes o yarrow  noo ill stop  susys waitin for me an sends her loveyer affectionate son david laidlaw  we must take the liberty now good reader of directing your attention to another time and place  and first as regards time  one day three weeks after the events which have just been narrated mrs brentwood took susan blake through a stained glass door out upon a leaded roof and bade her look about her the roof was not high up however  it only covered the kitchen which was a projection at the back of the colonels mansion  susan somewhat surprised looked inquiringly in the ladys face  a fine view is it not asked mrs brentwood  very fine indeed said susy and she was strictly correct for the back of the house commanded an extensive view of one of the most beautiful parts of hampstead heath  does it not remind you susan a little a very little of the views from the garretgarden asked the lady with a curious expression in her handsome eyes  well hardly replied susan scarce able to repress a smile  you see there is no river or shipping and one misses the chimneypots  chimneypots exclaimed mrs brentwood why what do you call these pointing to a row of onestorey stables not far off the roofs of which were variously ornamented with red pots and iron zigzag pipes  as to the river dont you see the glimmer of that sheet of water through the trees in the distance a pond or canal it is im not sure which but im quite sure that the flagstaff of our eccentric naval neighbour is sufficiently suggestive of shipping is it not  well madam if one tries to make believe very much  ah susan i see you have not a powerful imagination  perhaps it is as well  now i have brought you here to help me with a plot which is to be a great secret  you know it is arranged that dear old nurse is to spend the summer on the braes of yarrow with the laidlaws and the winter in london with me  so i want you to fit up this roof of the kitchen exactly in the way you arranged the garden on the roof at cherub court  i will send a carpenter to measure the place for flowerboxes and our gardener will furnish you with whatever seeds you may require  now remember exactly the same even to the rustic chair if you can remember it  you may be very sure that susy entered with right goodwill into this little plot  she had been temporarily engaged by mrs brentwood as ladysmaid so that she might have present employment and a home before her marriage and then travel free of expense with the family to scotland where she should be handed over to her rightful owner  the office of ladysmaid was however a mere sinecure so the bride had plenty of time to devote to the garden  old liz meanwhile was carefully confined to another part of the house so that she might not discover the plot and the tiger from whom no secrets could by any possibility be kept was forbidden to blab on pain of instant death and dismissal  now daaavid remarked that blue spider when he communicated the secret to him mums the word  if you mentions it the kernels family will bust up  i will return to the streets from vich i came trumps alias rodgers to the den hout of vich e was auled  susan will take the wail and retire to a loonatic asylum an daaavid laidlaw will be laid low for the rest of is mortial career  neer fash yer heed about me tammy my man im as close as an eyster  we pass now from the far south to the other side of the borderland  great bawbylon is far behind us  the breezy uplands around tell that we have reached the braes of yarrow  a huge travelling carriage is slowly toiling up the side of a hill  inside are colonel and mrs brentwood rosa and chimneypot liz  beside the driver sits trumps in travelling costume  in the rumble are susan blake and tommy splint  rosas husband and sam blake are to follow in a few days  oh what a lovely scene exclaimed susy as the carriage gained the summit of an eminence and pulled up to breathe the horses  yaas  not so badfor scotland said the tiger languidly  and what a pretty cottage added susan pointing to an eminence just beyond that on which they had halted where a long low whitewashed dwelling lay bathed in sunshine  yaas  and i say susy yonder is a native said tommy becoming suddenly animated andwelli do believe without a kilt  but hes got the reglar orthodox shepherdswhew  a prolonged whistle ended the boys sentence as he glanced quickly in susans face  the flushed cheeks told eloquently that she also had made a discovery and the rapid strides of the native showed that he was likewise affected in a similar way  the colonels headthrust out at the carriage window and exclaiming why dora weve arrived  here is mr laidlaw himselfcompleted as it were the tableau vivant  another moment and hands were being heartily shaken with the insides but david did not linger  nodding pleasantly to the tiger he held up both hands  being so tall he just managed to reach those of susan as she stood up in the rumble  jump he said ye needna fear my lassie  susan jumped and was made to alight on scottish soil like a feather of eiderdown  laidlaw stooped apparently to whisper something in the girls ear but to the unspeakable delight of the observant tiger he failed to get past the mouth and whispered it there  go it daaavid exclaimed the urchin with a patronising wink and a broad smile  look there susy said laidlaw pointing to the sunbathed cottage  home asked the maiden with an inquiring glance  hame responded david  mither is waiting for e there  do ye see the track across the field where the burn rins  its a short cut  the coachll have to gang roond by the brig  rin lassie  he released susy who sprang down the bank crossed the streamlet by a plank bridge and ran into the cottage where she found mrs laidlaw in the passage with eager eyes but labouring under powerful selfrestraint  mother exclaimed susy flinging her arms round the stout old womans neck  ehmy bonnie wee doo said mrs laidlaw as she looked kindly down on the little head and stroked the fair hair with her toilworn hands while a venerable old man stood beside her looking somewhat imbecile and blowing his nose  just then the carriage rolled up to the door and mrs laidlaw leaving her auld man for a few minutes to do the honours of the house retired to her chamber and there on her knees confessed thankfully that she like her son had been effectually conquered by a waux doll    reader what more can we say  is it necessary to add that the two principals in the business being well pleased everybody else was satisfied  we think not  but it may not be uninteresting to state that from that auspicious day a regular system of annual visitation was established between bawbylon and the braes of yarrow which held good for many a year one peculiarity of the visitation being that the bawbylonians and their progeny revelled on the braes chiefly in summer while the yarrowites with their bairns always took their southern flight in winter  thus our two old women mrs laidlaw and chimneypot lizwho fought rather shy of each other at first but became mutual admirers at lastled as it were a triple life now on the sunny slopes and amid the sweet influences of the braes anon in the smoke and the unsavoury odours of the slums and sometimes amid the refinements and luxury of the west end in all of which situations they were fain to confess that the ways of god are wonderful and past finding out  of course david laidlaw did not fail to redeem his promise to revisit the thieves den and many a man and youth was he the means of plucking from the jaws of spiritual death during his occasional and frequent visits to londonin which work he was ably seconded by tommy splint when that volatile spirit grew up to manhood  and among their coadjutors none were more helpful in the work of bringing souls to christ than mrs rampy and her bosomfriend mrs blathers  strange to say liz came to her end in a garret after all  on a raw november day she went under the care of susy to visit an old friend near cherub court in a garret not very unlike her old home  while there she was struck down  there was no painapparently no disease simply a sudden sinking of the vital powers  they laid the dear old woman on her friends bed and in halfanhour she had passed away while the faithful susy held her hand and whispered words from the master in her ear  thus old liz having finished her grand work on earth was transplanted from the garret in the slums to the garden of the lord  the end
