327     johnstone of the border     chapter i  the summons   sable lake shone like a mirror among the ragged pines as it ran back between the rocks smooth as oil except where a puff of wind streaked its flashing surface with faint blue wrinkles behind it the lonely woods rolled on south to lake superior and north to hudson bay at one place a new transcontinental railroad cut its way through the forest hammers rang and noisy gravel plows emptied the ballast cars along the halfgraded track but these sounds of human activity were quickly lost and in a mile or two only the splash of water and the elfin sighing in the pinetops broke the deep silence of the woods this belt of tangled forest where the trees are stunted and the soil is sterile offers no attraction to homesteader or lumberman in consequence it has lain desolate since the halfbreed voyageurs who crossed it with canoe and dogteam abandoned the northwest trail when the canadian pacific locomotives began to pant through the rockcuts by lake superior  the solitude itself had drawn andrew johnstone into the quiet bush the lone trail had a charm for him he knew the empty spaces of canada for his inaptitude for an idle life had led him on adventurous journeys through many leagues of its trackless forest he was of the type that preferred some degree of hardship to conventional comfort his one ambition had been to be a soldier it was the career which from early boyhood he had chosen he had entered woolwich as a prize cadet and had left it with honors but a few weeks later he had met with an accident on a mountain crag and his military career was suddenly closed the surgeons did what they could but it soon was obvious that andrew never again would be able to take his place in the british army he was not crippled he could still walk well but he limped slightly and his injured knee gave him trouble sometimes  he sat alone now on a rock that jutted out into the lake the thick branches of a spruce sagged above him and furnished a welcome shadow for it was a close hot day a few feet behind him a gray trout lay in the fryingpan beside a log hearth and beyond that stood a small weatherbeaten tent with flecks of bright sunlight filtering through the trees and spreading over it in fantastic shapes  andrew lighted his pipe and looked about him in languid content the pines that came down to the lakes edge were small and ragged some had been blackened by fire and some leaned drunkenly but their resinous sweetness hung about the camp in the shadow the reflection of worn rock and rigid branch floated on the crystal water but the reflections quivered and there was a soft splash upon the pebbles near andrews feet he heard it with reminiscent satisfaction and a touch of longing it reminded him of the swirl of the salt tide along the solway shore and his thoughts went back to the old country he had left two years before  he wondered what elsie and dick were doing at home at the old house in annandale he called appleyard home because he loved it better perhaps than dick did although the place did not belong to him when he was left an orphan dicks father had brought him up with stern kindness and he had afterward spent a month or two at appleyard whenever it was possible indeed in the old mans last illness he had promised that so far as things permitted he would look after his somewhat flighty cousin andrew remembered with a twinge that he had not done much to keep his promise but after all there seemed no reason to believe that dick needed him  then he thought of little elsie as he had called her though she must be grown up now he was much the elder but they had always been good friends no doubt they would try to marry her to dick andrew was fond of dick but he did not think him good enough for elsie  for nearly an hour he sat on the rock lounging back against an outcropping boulder thinking of appleyard and little elsie then his thoughts were interrupted by a sound near the tentsome animal scampering pastand he stood up and looked out across the lake his pose easy and virile showed a wiry figure of medium height and the strong sunshine touched his brown face it was not a face that attracted attention but the eyes were gravely goodhumored and the mouth was firm  andrew was watching for the gleam of a varnished hull whitney his american partner had gone to the railroad for provisions three days previously and should have returned the canoe he had taken had been built in toronto especially for them andrew would have been satisfied with an indian birchbark but whitney not only was a keen sport but he had enough money to afford the best of everything  at last something twinkled far up the lake and andrews keen eyes distinguished a small dark speck amidst the play of light he knew that it was whitney for only a canoe from which the varnish had not worn off would so catch the sunshine when the craft had grown into shape andrew sat down again and watched her draw nearer with quiet approval he liked to see things done well and there was a rhythmic precision in whitneys movements that suggested welldirected power the paddle flashed at exact intervals the lithe form behind it bent with a graceful swing and a curl of foam broke away from the gliding hull modern as she was the canoe did not jar upon the primitive austerity of the wilds andrew felt this though he could not have put it into words for there was something innately primitive in him  he sprang from a rugged stock for he was a descendant of the annandale johnstones whose crest was significantly the flying spur appleyard stood on the edge of the bleak moorlands that drop down to the western marshes of the scottish border and he knew every lonely rise and boggy flat that his mosstrooper ancestors had ridden on moonless nights it is possible that in his youthful rambles across the high windswept waste he had acquired something that linked him to the past in later times his people had made some mark as soldiers and explorers but for the past two generations the head of the house had been a quiet country laird  whitney drew near and in a few minutes ran the canoe upon the shingle and stood smiling at andrew when he had pulled her up he was young and athletic with brown hair and eyes brown skin a rather thin face and an alert halfhumorous air his clothes had been specially designed for hunting trips by a fashionable new york tailor but they now looked much the worse for use in the wilds  ive got the grub and brought our mail he said throwing andrew a packet heres your lot you can wade through it while i fix supper  id have had things ready andrew replied but i was stuck for flour and pork youve covered some ground today  some laughed whitney it was pretty fierce clambering over the portages with the canoe on my head but i made much better time than i could have done when i struck the woods two months ago looks as if the harder you have to work the stronger you get natures way of fixing things but im not tired so ill fix supper while you read your news  andrew opened a letter in a girlish hand and while he read it lingering over the words his thoughts went back with longing to appleyard on the solway shore he pictured the low house built of scottish granite and beaten by the winds the red moorland rolling north in waves and the flash of wet sands in the distance edged with white surf by the savage tides it was an artless letter treating of loved homely things but it showed sweetness of temperament and andrew thought halfconcealed uneasiness the reason for this became obvious when he read the postscript        i am anxious about dick he is not very strong you       know and i wish that you were here  andrew felt troubled for he knew that elsie never made the worst of things dick was weak of will as well as of body and his dissipation had a marked effect on him there was nothing vicious in the lad but he lacked stability and it looked as if elsie could not counteract the rather demoralizing influences to which andrew imagined the boy was subjected  he opened a montreal newspaper and then soon forgot appleyard it was some time since any news from england had reached him and the cablegrams predicted coming war he read on until whitney took the trout and a can of coffee off the fire and called him to supper andrew ate as usual because he was hungry but he said very little and wore a preoccupied air  whitney waited until the meal was finished then he turned to his comrade as he lighted his pipe  theres something worrying you he said bluntly out with it  i was wondering whether youd mind my not going north with you on the hunting trip this fall  i certainly would mind all the same ill let you off if theres a reason  andrew folded the letter so that the last page came on top and handed it to him with the newspaper whitney carefully read the first column in the paper before he looked up he wanted to understand the situation and andrew was not good at explaining  i dont quite get the drift of things he said first of all whos elsie woodhouse  in a way shes like dicks sister they were brought up together and elsie always tried to take care of himthough shes really no relation dick is my cousin  whitney nodded and tried to be patient  do you want to go home because shes anxious about the fellow he asked  its rather complicated andrew answered with some hesitation you see dicks father raised me and i always thought in his way he was fond of me  whitney found the workings of his companions mind more interesting than the particulars about his relatives andrew was sometimes slow but one could rely on his doing the right thing in the end  and elsie whitney suggested did he raise her too  oh no when he died dicks mother soon married again a man called staffer clever fellow but i never quite trusted him then she died and staffer was left in charge of appleyard until dick came of age he brought his sister there mrs woodhouse a widow and elsies her daughter dick and elsie were both quite young then but from the beginning elsie made it her business to take care of dick  you like her said whitney noticing a certain tenderness in his companions voice  yes said andrew slowly i never liked anybody quite as much but thats all there is to it shes much younger than i am and shell probably marry dick  if shes like his sister and has been looking after him she more probably wont im getting dick fixed as a bit of a maverick he and his stepfather dont get on  on the contrary they get on very well thats the trouble  how  andrew hesitated  well you see staffer does most things well hes excellent company and a witty talker the kind of man a lad would try to copy  makes the pace pretty hot eh one of your smart set  hes extravagant but he never gets into debt hell play cards on champagne half the night and get up next morning as steady as a rock and bring down a corkscrewing snipe with the first barrel ive seldom seen a better man on a horse  think ive got him placed your cousin will want nerve and judgment to play up to him but well take the newspaper now why do you want to go back you wont fight  i cant andrew replied with some color in his face its my misfortune after i fell on the pillar rock  whitney gave him a sympathetic nod  you take me wrong i mean your countrymen its been stated in your parliament that they have no obligation to fight for france  andrew filled his pipe before he answered  they wont see her smashed he said quietly  im not sure of it after reading the english newspapers  you dont know us yet andrew replied  whitney smiled for he knew that his comrade would carry out an obligation to the farthest limit but he said nothing and for the next few minutes andrew thoughtfully looked about  the sun was getting low and dark shadows stretched across the glassy lake but in the distance a small gray dot moved amidst a ring of widening ripples a loon was fishing presently a wild unearthly cry rang through the stillness as the bird called its mate and after that everything was very quiet except for a soft splash of falling water a long way off the dew was settling on the brush about the camp and the cooling air was heavy with the fragrance of the pines it all appealed to andrew the lonely woods had a strange charm for him  im lame and not much use but it doesnt seem quite the thing to stay here enjoying myself just now he said perhaps something i could do might turn up when i got home  but you havent a home you lived in a boat for some years didnt you  i thought of living in one again its cheap and gives you liberty you can move about where you like then theres good wildfowl shooting in the bays along our coast that would keep me occupiedif i could find nothing else  pretty lonely though isnt it  sometimes when youre windbound in a desolate gut among the sands the winter nights seem long then if you have to clear out in a hurry with a sudden breeze sending the sea inshore and theres the anchor and kedge to get you feel youd like an extra hand  then why dont you ship one  its hard to find the right man living on board a small cruiser hasnt much attraction unless youre used to it  whitney chuckled  thats easily understood i think you need a partner howd i do  andrew gave him an eager look and then answered discouragingly  its rough work youre often wet through and cant dry your clothes and sometimes theres not much to eat you cant cook on a miniature stove when shes rolling hard then theres no headroom and you get cramped because you cant stand up straight  well whitney declared smilingly it cant be much rougher than clambering over rock ledges and smashing through the brush with a canoe on your head so my friend if you have no marked objection im coming along for one thing an english friend of ours who lived in new york has a shooting lodge in the galloway district and my mother and sister are over there i can plant myself on them if i get tired of you  andrew said nothing and whitney thought him reluctant to take advantage of his rash offer  its settled old man whitney went on lightly well pull out at sunup and get on to the canadian pacific at whitefish creek ill try to catch a trout now and then well go to sleep  he launched the canoe and when he paddled out across the darkening lake andrew sat by the sinking fire feeling quietly satisfied he did not know what he might find to do when he reached scotland but he would have a partner in whom he had confidence     chapter ii  a painful memory   a week after leaving sable lake andrew and whitney stood one night on portage avenue winnipeg the air was hot and oppressive as it often is in the prairie city during late summer and smooth sidewalks and roadway wet with heavy rain glistened like ice in the lamplight the downpour had now slackened to a scattered splashing of big warm drops and thunder rumbled in the distance at one place the imposing avenue was blocked by a crowd through which the streetcars crept slowly with clanging bells the crowd seemed bent on holding its ground but there was not much jostling and its general air was one of stern interest rather than excitement the small dark figures that filled the gap between the towering buildings were significantly quiet and where a ray of light fell across them the rows of faces were all turned in one direction  andrew studied them as he stood on the outskirts of the throng human nature always interested him he noticed first that these men were better dressed and looked more prosperous than the members of similar gatherings he had watched in the old country it was however not altogether their clothes that conveyed the impression there was a hint of selfconfident optimism in their faces and bearing though one could see that they were graver than usual their appearance was rather american than british and although this was mainly suggested by certain mannerisms and the cut of their clothes andrew was conscious of a subtle difference he could not explain for one thing an english street crowd is generally drawn from one particular walk of life and if units of different rank join it they stand apart and separate this gathering in winnipeg included men of widely different callingsfarmers from the plains merchants artisans clerks and flourmill handsbut they had somehow an air of common purpose and solidarity  whitney indicated them after he had lighted a cigarette  its almost an hour before our train goes out and these fellows evidently expect a new bulletin to be posted up soon he said they interest me because i dont know how to class them theyre developing themselves on our lines but they dont belong to us if this were a city in the united states thered be something doing joshing and pushing or somebody would start a song yet i guess they wouldnt like you to call them englishmen  thats true andrew agreed  then theyre pretty good customers of ours and anxious to trade went on whitney and yet when we offered them reciprocity they wouldnt have it they had all to gain because the natural outlet for their commerce is to the south but they said they were british and shut the door on us on the other hand i get on with them better than you can and if we wanted a job in this city id get it before you now our states are sovereign but theyre all american  ours are sovereign but not english andrew replied ones strictly canadian another frankly australian and so on were an individualistic race and our different branches grow their own way it looks like a loose arrangement but weve found we hold together well youll see when the bulletin comes outif its what i expect  well wait whats this fellow talking about  a short darkskinned man had buttonholed a neighbor and was speaking vivaciously his dark eyes snapping  but mossieu the alliance la belle alliance he exclaimed and wheeled around to andrew is it not determine in london that we fight  spotted you first time partner whitney laughed and then turned to the man when did you come over  for a moment the fellow looked puzzled  two hundred year mossieu that is the family she arrive me i am born in kebec  whitney smiled at andrew  you havent made much of a britisher of him yet theyll speak better german in alsace in much less time if the prussians keep their grip  alsace cried the frenchcanadian attendez mais attendez the great day come together we take her back it is an obligation mossieu vive la belle alliance  your people claim there isnt an alliance whitney said to andrew  i dont know this is certain if our friends attacked we step into the ring  there was a sudden movement in the crowd which pressed closer upon the newspaper office opposite and a cry was raised as a lighted car came clanging down the street  hold that driver up  the car slowed but still came on until a welldressed citizen stepped quietly in front of it  stop he said you cant get through  the car stopped and as the passengers got out a window in the tall building opposite was opened a bulletin board was hoisted in and for the next two minutes the crowd stood silent and motionless andrew felt his nerves tingle and noted that whitneys face was tense though his interest in the matter could hardly be personal there was something that stirred the imagination in the sight of the intent quiet throng that awaited the result of a crisis not of their making they had had no say in the quarrel that began far off in the obscure east but one could not doubt that they meant to make it their own their stern gravity caused andrew a halfconscious thrill of pride  after all they sprang from british stock and he knew what kind of men they were he had seen the miles of wheat that covered the broken prairie waste cities that rose as if by magic in a few months time and railroads flung across quaking muskegs and driven through towering rocks at a speed unthought of in the mother country he had heard the freighttrains roaring through the great desolation between the ottawa and the western plains where no traffic would ever be found and had wondered at the optimism which in spite of tremendous obstacles had built eight hundred miles of track to link the st lawrence to the rich land beyond these canadians were hard men who tempered with cool judgment a vast energy and enthusiasm and the mother countrys foes would have to reckon with them  there was a strange dead silence as the board was replaced and the bold black letters stood out in the lamplight so far as andrew could afterward remember the bulletin read  war inevitable england must keep her word  kaisers armies marching british fleet sails with sealed orders  a few cablegrams followed and when they were read a deep murmur rose from the crowd but there was no strong excitement these were not the men to indulge in emotional sentiment their attitude indicated relief from suspense and steady resolve perhaps it was characteristic that the man who had stopped the car waved his hand to the driver  now you may go ahead he said  breaking into groups they began to talk and andrew caught snatches of their conversation  a big thing but were going to put it through said one if you hadnt fired out laurier wed have been rushing our own fleet across the ocean now  well his neighbor replied weve got the boys we want to call a city meeting right off manitoba cant be left behind  manitobas all right another declared well send them all the flour they want besides men who can ride and shoot theyll put the maple leaf right up to the front but we want to hustle before regina and calgary get a start on us  the man turned to a companion and the two moved off they were followed by other groups and as one passed andrew heard an exultant voice  i tell you what happen vive la belle alliance  whitney and andrew crossed the emptying street and walked toward the station i guess you noticed they didnt talk about the old countrys program whitney remarked its what manitoba and the west are going to do that interests them my notion is that it will be something big  one feels that andrew agreed somehow its stirring  and its contagious when they hoist the flag youll see some of the boys from our side riding across the frontier to the rally  youre bound to keep neutral andrew objected  officially yes but when a man can drop a flying crane with the rifle and bust a wild range horse they wont ask if he was born in montana or saskatchewan  they walked up main street and it was obvious that the news had spread for talking men blocked the sidewalk here and there and the wide windows of the hotels were full when they reached the station whitney went off to check their baggage and andrew sat down rather disconsolately in the great waitingroom the damp weather had affected his knee and he frowned as he stretched it out for his aches reminded him painfully of his disadvantages while he sat there a summerevening train from winnipeg beach arrived and a stream of smartlydressed excursionists passed through the hall breaking off to ask for the latest news their keen interest was significant and andrew felt downcast canada approved the old countrys action and meant to do her part but he was useless nobody wanted him  moodily lighting a cigarette he recalled his youthful ambitions for he had meant to follow where his ancestors had led it was not for nothing that their crest was the flying spur and their traditions had fired him to the study of difficult sciences which he had mastered by dogged determination rather than cleverness his heart was in his work he meant to make a good horseartilleryman and he had thrilled with keen satisfaction when the examiners placed him near the top of the list then came the momentous day in ennerdale that altered everything six months after the accident he had resigned his commission knowing that he would never walk quite straight again  well all that was done with but now when britons everywhere were springing to arms he was good for nothing he reflected gloomily that he might as well stay in canada yet if he were in england there was a chance that something might turn up for him to do  besides there was little elsie     whitney came swinging across the marble floor of the waitingroom just as an official at the door announced that their train was ready to start     chapter iii  the solway shore   there was a light wind from the westward and the flood tide running east smoothed the sea to a faintly wrinkled heave when the rowan crept across wigtown bay on the southern coast of scotland andrew lounged at the tiller while whitney sat in the cockpit holding a tray on which were laid out a pot of smoketainted tea several thick slices of bread sardines and marmalade  whitney wore a woolen sweaterwhich had been white a few days before but now was a dingy graynew blue trousers already streaked with rust and an expensive yachting cap which had got badly crushed his hands were not immaculate and there was a sootsmear on his face  this kind of yachtings not quite what ive been used to he remarked on long island sound you dont get the sea we ran into coming round the head last night and when we went cruising in small craft we always hired somebody to do the dirty work  theres not much room for a paid hand on board the rowan andrew replied hesitatingly still if youd like  you dont want a man  he would be rather in the way and i dont know what hed find to do except the cooking  and hauling the dinghy up a muddy beach taking out the kedge on a stormy night and pulling twenty fathoms of heavy chain about when you shift your moorings i could think of a few other trifles if i tried but i wont insist it looks as if i were going to get some muscle up  whitney thought his companion had a private reason for dispensing with a paid hand and an extra man was certainly not needed for openwater navigation for andrew had shown himself quite capable of sailing the rowan alone after searching the glasgow yachtagents registers for a boat of sufficiently light draught they had bought the rowan at an ayrshire port and whitney got a surprise when his partner drove her through the furious tiderace that swirls around the mull of galloway in a strong breeze of wind he had confidence in the little yacht after that she was thirtytwo feet long low in the water and broad of beam but her mast was short and her canvas snug whitney knew the disadvantages of a long heavy boom her deck was laid with narrow planks no longer white for there were stains like blood upon them where the rain had run from the mainsail which was tanned with cutch  now the canvas glowed a warm orange in the evening light as its tall peak swayed gently across the sky and the ripples that lapped the gliding hull united beneath the counter and trailed astern in silky lines  to starboard far off the isle of man rose in a high black sawedge above the shining sea ahead to the east water and sky were soft blue to port the scottish hills rose in shades of gray and purple  andrew named them as the boat crept on  cairn harry running straight up from the water dirk hatteraik stored his brandy in a cave on raven crag and john knox hid in barrholm tower in the long patch of woods the black ridge behind is cairnsmoor o fleet and a waste of moors runs back from it toward the head of clyde the water of cree flows through the dark hollow  the cree whitney exclaimed that is where my mother and sister are our friend has a grouse moor and some salmon rights he paused and laughed i can imagine them sitting down to dinner under the electric light in somebodys ancestral hall with a frozen british butler running the show wonder what theyd say if they knew i wasnt far off living like an indian on board this craft  there are no ancestral halls beside the cree and electric lights are scarce in the galloway wilds andrew explained  whitney chuckled he was not thinking of ancestral halls but was wondering what his sister madge would think of his comrade on the surface andrew was easygoing ingenuous and diffident but beneath this lay an unwavering firmness  historic country isnt it he remarked to make andrew talk  yes said andrew in an apologetic tone and started off on his favorite hobby  slowly the sea grew dimmer the sunset glow behind them faded to a smoky red and while they drifted east with the flood tide a black island detached itself from the dusky shore soon a trembling beam flashed out from its summit  the ross andrew said i was wrecked there  tell me about it requested whitney lounging in the cockpit lazily watching a razorbill which had risen with a hoarse croak from the boats rippling wake  it was the only time such a thing ever happened to me and i dont understand it yet i was living on board the arrow then shooting from a punt she was a stiff roomy boat of nearly nine tons and id just had her pulled up at glencaple for an overhaul staffer dicks stepfather found me a glasgow carpenter who had been building some anglers boats at lochmaben  and what had the carpenter to do with your being wrecked  nothing so far as i can see though ive thought about him now and then  andrew paused for a moment and whitney knowing his comrade waited for him to go on  the ebb had been running for some time when i left gibbs hole and a nasty surf broke on the sands there was not wind enough to account for it but everything was harshly clear and thats often threatening however i set the big jib and topsail because i wanted to clear the banks before the flood tide made it runs from four to six knots an hour among the solway shoals and theres some risk of knocking the boats bilges in if you get aground the breeze fell light and near dusk i came round and stood inshore on the port tack so that i could if necessary slip back into rough firth the scotch channel of the solway is no place to run for on a dirty night  when i got down to abbey head the swell was growing steep and the sea looked ragged where it cut the horizonwhich showed there was wind out there the shootingpunt i was towing was a drag and i didnt make much progress until a smart southwesterly breeze sprang up soon after dark i could just lay my course down the coast and i hung on to big jib and topsail while i could with two or three hours of that wind id be able to run in behind the ross which you see ahead then the breeze freshened suddenly and she listed over until most of her lee deck was in the water for a time after that i had my hands full  so i imagine whitney remarked ive seen a big jib give two men trouble when they had to take it in and you were alone and had the topsail up im not surprised that you got wrecked  i wasnt wrecked just then in fact i made her snug with two reefs in the mainsail and i lighted the compass binnacle the trouble was that the wind was drawing ahead and the night had turned very dark i couldnt get a glimpse of the coast and it wouldnt have been wise to run back yet theres a light on hestan island but i wouldnt have found water enough across the sands in rough firth shed have gone down at her anchor if id brought up to wait  well i ate some sandwiches i had ready and stood on she was plunging wildly and putting her stormjib into the sea that was getting up but she was an able boat and the punt towed pretty well when id made an extra rope fast to her  you wouldnt find that easy whitney suggested as he pictured the lonely mans struggle to haul up the heavy craft while the yacht on which he must relinquish control rolled with thrashing canvas athwart the combers  i let the arrow come up and dropped the peak the worst was that i had to lean right out with both hands on the punt while i made the second rope fast and i nearly went overboard when she lurched i made it fast but when we went on i got a shock for the water was washing up from under the cockpit floor you see as shed shipped two or three combers id thought it was washing down  the floorings would be nearly two feet above her bottom planks whitney said  yes it meant she was leaking hard and ill admit that rather staggered me because shed always been a remarkably tight craft well i hove her to again lighted the cabin lamp and pulled up the floorings this wasnt easy they were closely fitted and the carpenter had nailed one or two of them down i cant tell you why he did it but i tore my hand before i got them loose you can understand that i had to be quick she wouldnt lie to well with nobody at the helm and kept forging up head to wind and falling off again the way she lurched about threw me against the lockers and once or twice i heard a sea come on board there was too much water for me to find where it was coming in and when i crawled out and tried the pump it wouldnt draw so i went back and felt for the bottom of its pipe there was a suctionbox at the end and it seemed to be stuffed up with shavings the carpenter must have thrown them under the floor  rather a curious place to put them whitney commented i suppose a shaving had stuck under a valve and stopped the pump but as youd have a grid on the suctionbox how did they get in  ive never found out but id like to meet that carpenter andrew replied grimly  he felt for his pipe and lighted it and whitney had to prompt him before he resumed  things didnt look hopeful it was blowing hard she was leaking fast and i couldnt pump her out i had to make the ross while she kept afloat i thought about cutting the punt adrift but it seemed a waste and afterward i was glad i didnt as it was a dead beat to windward speed was important and the only thing was to keep her sailing hard and let the seas come on board there was so much spray flying that i couldnt see the punt astern but the drag on the towlines showed that she was there then the old boat began to get sluggish and it made me savage shed brought me through many a stiff blow and i was fond of her the ross light was getting brighter but a sea that came over the coaming washed out the binnacle lamp when i was ready to make the sound if id been able to take the lights bearing and look at the chart i might have sailed her in  well with the compass gone i had to run for it blind and she was so waterlogged that she would hardly steer then suddenly she stopped with a shock that threw me from the helm what had happened was plain and when the next sea washed over her i pulled up the punt cut the lines and fell into the well she swung away on top of a comber and i wondered where shed take me for there were crags about and the paddles had washed overboard she was full and waterlogged but i lay along the deck and she kept right side up until we came ashore on a bank of shingle rocks ran up behind it and there was a gully i couldnt cross at the end of the cove i pulled the punt up and spent the night lying behind her out of the wind when i wasnt tramping about the shingle to keep myself warm in the morning a coastguard showed me a way up the cliff and when i came back there later there was no sign of the arrow  andrew stopped and for some minutes the silence was broken by the rustle of the flapping topsail and the soft splash at the bows it had grown dark and the sea was faintly phosphorescent pale blue and green spangles glimmered down the wake ross island had faded into the black head behind it but a bright beam of light still glittered across the water  on the face of it the reason you were wrecked is obvious whitney said the boat began to strain when she was pounding overpressed with sail through a steep head sea and you couldnt pump her out besides as shed just been hauled up for repairs a butt may have got started by the hammering or a seam have been left open  the carpenter was a good workman andrew replied quietly  he may have neglected something for all that boats will leak when theyre driven hard pumps get out of order and a stranger might nail down a floor board you kept loose the curious point is that all these things should happen together whitney paused and smiled of course if you had some dangerous secret or were heir to a great estate that somebody else wanted one might suggest a melodramatic explanation  ive no secret anybody would give twopence for and i inherit nothing except a very small annuity  then youll have to put the series of accidents down to coincidence where were you bound for when you came to grief  andrew glanced back toward a stretch of water that still shone faintly among the shadowy hills  up yonder near the head of wigtown bay to shoot geese dick was to come on by train and join me hes fond of wildfowling and i took advantage of it to get him away  away from what  andrew hesitated  well you see he was inclined to go the pace and staffer had some friends at appleyard just thenclever amusing menabouttown who were fond of cards and knew all about the turf dick tried to play up to them and he was losing a good deal of money and drinking rather more than was good for him  and his stepfather encouraged his extravagance  oh no staffer gave him good advice in a cynical witty way told him he must pull up because the pace was too hot for a lad i never quite liked the man but one must be fair and he was willing to let me take dick in fact he agreed it was the best thing to do  but as it turned out you didnt take him were you much at appleyard afterward  no one of staffers friends offered me a pretty good post abroad and everybody thought i ought to seize the chance but i didnt in consequence a kind of coolness grew up and i havent stayed long at appleyard since dick sends a message and elsie writes long letters now and then  whitney stood up and stretched himself a rhythmic throb of engines stole out of the silence and some distance off a yellow and a green light moved across the level sea overhead the topsail cut black against the sky and the water had grown more luminous in the eddying wake to the east a thin silver moon was shining above the dim heights of cumberland tiny ripples lapped the rowans side but the breeze was faint and everything was still  the flood will take us to rough firth and we may as well stand on andrew said you can go below ill call you if youre wanted  carefully lowering his head whitney crept into the small cabin and lighted the lamp its illumination showed the oilskins swinging against the forecastle bulkhead and the narrow table on top of the centerboard trunk which ran up the middle of the floor on each side were lockers that served as seats and two folding cots were strapped against the skin of the boat whitney let one down and got into it with his clothes on he had found that this was prudent when cruising in small vessels there was a rack loaded with odds and ends a few inches above his head and a smell of tarred rope paraffin and mildewed canvas came out of the forecastle but this did not trouble him and he was soon asleep  in the meanwhile andrew sat at the helm his mind busy with gloomy thoughts     chapter iv  appleyard   it was a stormy evening when whitney caught his first glimpse of appleyard he felt disappointed he had expected to see an ancient border tower with modern additions but the low straightfronted house did not look much more than a century old it was solidly built of gray granite with mullioned windows and a small pepperbox turret at one end but while it made no pretense of architectural beauty whitney admitted that it had some charm for one thing appleyard stood boldly on the breast of a knoll with dark firs packed closely about it and the landscape it commanded was ruggedly wild bleak pastures and lonely moorland stained a purplered rolled back to the hills that melted into leaden cloud in the north to the south a strip of green littoral was dotted with white farmsteads and traversed by the curves of a river that flashed where it caught the light  beyond this level strip the solway sands ran far out to sea glowing red in the angry sunset and pierced by channels of slategreen water in the distance a narrow white line showed where their edge was washed by the receding tide on the western shore of the wide estuary criffells lonely height stood out a harsh darkblue against a saffron glare  the car sped across an iron bridge spanning a ravine where hazel mountainash and scrub oak grew among the stones skirted a broad lawn and stopped at the door whitney was presented to mrs woodhouse and staffer who welcomed him cordially and then he shook hands with dick they entered the house at once and whitney found himself in a large square hall which looked older than the rest of the building the light was dim for the windows were narrow and were placed unusually high in the massive walls a wood fire burned in the big oldfashioned hearth but the place felt chilly and especially cheerless  dick took them up a staircase that led to a gallery at the back of the hall  your kit arrived from glasgow and i think youll find all you want laid out in your rooms he said dinner will be ready as soon as you have changed  they went along a passage and whitney was glad to be left alone in his room it was his first visit to an old scottish house and although not an antiquarian he was capable of receiving impressions from places and he wanted to discover what influence appleyard had on him he noted that a fire was laid ready in the grate although it was august and until that morning the weather had been warm the room was rather bare but the few articles of oldfashioned furniture were solid and were made on a good model they were marked by a certain austerity of taste and he thought of them as businesslike the plain selfcolored rugs and curtains had a similar effect everything that utility demanded was there but he marked the absence of luxury and ornament  the walls were very thick and there were seats in the deep window recesses opening one of the casements whitney stopped a minute and looked out he could see a stretch of wet sands that were now growing dim and the faint line of surf and then by turning sharply black hills running back into gathering cloud the air was unusually keen and although darkness was fast coming on the distance was cleancut and sharp the landscape somehow harmonized with the house it was perhaps a trifle harsh but it had a peculiarly distinctive character  andrew came in while whitney was dressing and finding him not ready he went down first  there was no one in the hall when andrew reached it and he was satisfied to be alone as he stood by the hearth looking about a lamp had been lighted but the illumination did not carry far and the high roof and the corners were shadowy the hall occupied the lower story of the old central tower which had served as a fort in bygone years but had since been partly rebuilt and incorporated in the house andrew knew its history for he loved appleyard he was in some respects truer to the type of the men who had built and fought for it than dick he was not jealous of his cousin but it was hard to feel himself a mere passing guest in the old house and a vague discontent tempered his satisfaction at coming home besides he was poor and was condemned by an accident to a life of obscurity he wondered why elsie had not been there to welcome him as she had always done on previous visits he remembered her frank regret when he last went away indeed he had often pictured her as she stood by the lodge gate a slender freshfaced girl with ruffled hair and a hint of tears in her blue eyes she was as graceful as a fawn but her beauty as yet was immature  andrew heard a sound behind him and turning from the fire he saw a girl coming down the stairs she stood out against the darkpaneled walls for her pale green dress caught the light and shimmered it went well with her auburn hair emphasizing the pure white and pink of her skin and it matched her eyes which had the changing color of the sea the immature grace andrew had known had gone there was something of distinction in her carriage  while he gazed at her she came toward him with a frank smile of pleasure  its very nice to have you back she said i couldnt get home until a few minutes after you arrived roy lost a shoe as i was driving up the lockerbie road  andrew took her hand and held it for a moment but the only remark he could think of was  you have roy yet  elsie laughed as if she understood and rather liked his embarrassment  oh yes hes still going strong and when kevan reshod him he brought me home in record time but youre very brown and looking well  its good to be back at appleyard he said quietly  youre still very fond of it so am i though that may seem curious because im really an outsider  that applies to me more than to you because the old place would never be the same without you  elsie looked at him as he stood gravely quiet studying her  well she said appleyard is dicks his father was a true johnstone his mother a jardine but you make one feel that youre more at home here than he is i cant account for it can you  i might blame your imagination he answered smiling  elsie gave him a roguish look which made her seem more like the little elsie he had known two years before  you havent told me how im looking she said perhaps you dont realize that this gown was made in paris and was put on in your especial honor  youre rather wonderful andrew replied gravely but then you always were for all that i had a pleasant surprise when you came downstairs  elsies eyes twinkled and he thought they looked like the sea when the sun touched it in a breeze  a surface change she laughed munich and london account for it id run wild you know when you saw me last but theres no difference underneath youre the same too and thats what i like i want to keep my old friend you must promise you wont alter  ill try not to he answered perhaps im incapable of it im not progressive still there are times when i feel rather old  oh i know she said with understanding sympathy but after the cheerful letters you wrote from canada i hoped the lameness didnt trouble you very much  one mustnt grumble though its rather hard to feel uselessjust now  elsies face grew thoughtful  yes she said slowly that must hurt ive felt that we dont realize the seriousness of the great struggle here its easy to subscribe to funds and go on committees but that kind of service leaves you cold and we havent practised much selfdenial at appleyard i was glad dick wanted to enlist even though they wouldnt have him but hell tell you about it himself  mrs woodhouse and whitney came toward them with dick close behind dick was not unlike andrew but it was as if his cousins prominent characteristics had been watered down although the handsomer of the two he somehow looked a feeble copy of andrew when they were together he had twinkling eyes and a humorous way of regarding things but his face was weak his figure was light wellpoised and athletic but his color was unusually high and on close study he showed signs of bad health  when he had spoken a few words to andrew they went in to dinner and during the meal whitney devoted some attention to the company one of the differences between him and his comrade was that he was most capable at managing people and andrew in handling things andrew knew all about a boat and a gun and could be relied upon to deal with contrary tides and dangerous shoals but he was less acquainted with the intricacies of human nature  whitney dismissed dick as not counting elsie he reserved for future study mrs woodhouse he found interesting because baffling she was rather fat with regular features but an expressionless face eyes of light chinablue and flat flaxen hair she answered his remarks with conventional politeness but he could not as he thought of it strike a spark from her he could not tell whether she was reserved or merely dull her brother staffer was of very different stamp his face was cleancut and intellectual his manners were polished but easy and whitney had no trouble in placing him as a man who knew the world indeed since there was a hint of force and command about him whitney wondered why he was so to speak vegetating in the scottish wilds staffer clearly belonged to the busy cities and the centers of action  nothing that whitney thought worth noting occurred at dinner except that dick drank a good deal of wine and elsie watched him with halfveiled disturbance whitney thought her attitude was protective and motherly she would have interfered had it been possible this suggested that a supposition of andrews was wrong a girl like that would not marry a man whom she must guide and control  when they went back to the hall andrew found a quiet corner hoping he might get a few minutes alone for his meeting with elsie had a disturbing effect when he last went away she had told him that when he came back things would not be the same and he now recognized the truth of this the girl who had treated him as a trusted elder brother had grown into a beautiful accomplished woman indeed she had so to speak left him behind she was cleverer and more composed than he she grasped things at once while he clumsily searched for their meaning the old frank confidence and the comradeship were no longer possible but in essentials she had not changed the world could never spoil elsies freshness nor blunt her keen honesty  after a while she came and sat down near where he stood in the shadowy recess of the great hearth  i believe you were trying to hide and we must have a talk she said im half afraid i brought you home from canada  no andrew replied awkwardly anyway not altogether i felt that i ought to come back even if theres nothing i can do still of course if i can be of help here  elsies eyes were soft as she looked at him  yes i know youre a good friend andrew but i was alarmed when i wrote after what the army doctors told him dick went to see a specialist in harley street and he must have got a plain warning for he was depressed and quiet for some time things are serious when dicks cast down  do you know what the doctor said  no dick wouldnt tell me im not sure that he told uncle arnold much  ah  andrew was silent for a moment  has he been indulging in any rashness since then  no nothing fresh but im afraid hes heavily in debt his allowance is very large but he tried to borrow money a few days after he got it elsies color grew deeper as she continued ive seen him quite unsteady at luncheon and the worst is that its telling on his health  looks bad i must see what i can do but its awkward because staffers really responsible for him has he tried to pull dick up  yes in a way elsie answered with a thoughtful air still i dont think it disturbs him as it ought to when he sees that he hasnt done much good hes witty when he should be firmand ive sometimes imagined that dick feels rather flattered than ashamed after the talk  i understand what dick really needs is a good kicking for being fool enough to try to copy staffer  couldnt you take him away for a time in the boat  ill try but hes not fond of sailing then its a delicate matter if one could make staffer understand  elsie gave him a steady look  no i think youd better not uncle arnolds very kind mother and i owe him a good deal and he likes dick for all that he doesnt seem to feel its his duty to take much trouble  andrew knew she was not saying all that she thought but he did not press her  i will try to find a way he said and now tell me how things have been going since i left  while they were talking dick came up and not long afterward the two men found themselves alone in the smokingroom  andrew put his hands on dicks shoulders and held him off at arms length  you strike me as not being quite up to the mark he said  do i dick grinned youve been talking to elsie  i have and im sorry to hear the doctors didnt think you very well hadnt you better tell me about it  i suppose i must youre a persistent fellow but you dont often take the superior moral tone well as id been in the officers training corps i applied for a commission and they sent me up to a medical board one doctor asked me some catchy questions and being quite inexperienced i fell into the trap the consequence was i didnt pass  you didnt learn much about yourself from him  not much it was he who got the information but when hed finished he offered me a scrap of adviceid better see a private doctor at once  did you  dick chuckled  instead i went up to london and tried to join one of the special battalions i was wiser this time and told their medical examiner nothing i could help i thought id made a good impression but at last he looked at me pretty hard i admire your keenness but you wont do he said i told him i was a bit off color but id play golf all day and drink nothing but sodawater and then come back to him in a month it would be of no use id go to harley street now he said  i hope you did andrew remarked with a frown  dick lighted a cigarette  yes i went ill spare you technicalities for that matter ive forgotten them but after all i didnt get much of a shock it seems my hearts gone a bit rocky  go on said andrew  well if i give up everything i like and live like an ascetic i may get over the trouble though i think the fellow doubted it on the other hand i may get worse and drop off suddenly  unless you steady down  yes he hinted something of the kind  andrew said nothing for a few moments he was fond of his cousin and besides he had promised dicks father to look after the boy he felt that he had been neglectful and he wished now that he had more tact he had a duty ahead of him and he did not know how to discharge it  the proper course is obvious he began somewhat awkwardly suppose you come down the galloway coast with whitney and me its early for the black geese but there are ducks about  dick smiled  unfortunately im not keen on sailing and i must say that living on board a small damp boat gets monotonous now if you would land me where one could get a game of cards in the evening or  where they had a bar  precisely a bar with a fetching girl in it  it wouldnt work said andrew firmly i remember what happened when i landed you at douglasand a poaching escapade with some creetown quarrymen on the same cruise you have a talent for getting into trouble well if you wont come with me ill have to make appleyard my headquarters for a time  i hope you will dick replied with feeling has it ever struck you that appleyard might be yours  andrews face grew stern  appleyard belongs to you and whats more you belong to it its your duty to pull yourself together and take care of the estate to marry and bring up your children to be a credit to your name instead youre dragging it in the dirt making shabby betting men and turf sharpers your friends and im half afraid getting into speculative moneylenders hands  dick winced and andrew saw that his random shot had scored  if youre in difficulties i might raise a hundred pounds or so he went on if as i suspect that isnt half enough well go and see mackellar before you get in too deep  mackellar was the acting executor of dicks fathers will  ill think over it dick answered and there was something that puzzled andrew in his expression  very well did you tell staffer what the doctor said  i wasnt quite as frank with him as ive been with you one isnt proud of being a lame duck still i imagine he has a pretty accurate notion of how things are with me  then he ought to pull you up he has the power  thats doubtful i dont think youre quite fair to staffer i might have got a stepfather of a very different kind  it might have been better if you had andrew dryly rejoined  dick flushed  i wish youd leave staffer alone i wont have him run down  i didnt mean to run him down andrew said  well perhaps you didnt consciously youd try to conquer your prejudices but youre antagonistic  andrew gave dick a shrewd glance  i wonder how staffer feels about me he ventured  youre not likely to find out dick answered with a laugh i suppose he has his failings but he never gives himself away  when andrew went to his room that night he sat beside his window for a long time with a thoughtful frown the task he had undertaken would not be an easy one     chapter v  sweetheart abbey   soon after their arrival whitney and andrew drove back to the boat which was moored in the mouth of a stream at some distance from appleyard it was a bright morning and they sat smoking in the cockpit when they had shaken some of the canvas and laid their sea clothes and blankets out to dry  behind the white beach a strip of marish heath led back to the broad belt of cultivated land with neat farmsteads scattered about in front the narrow channel in which the shallowbodied boat lay nearly upright wound seaward through a great stretch of sand the open sea was not visible but three or four miles away a glistening streak that seemed to be in motion caught the light in the middle distance a green lagoon and two ribands of water were rapidly widening flocks of black and white oystercatchers fluttered about the banks of the channels and long rows of salmon nets ran back along the shore  this is a curious place to navigate whitney remarked you were right in insisting on shallow draught and a centerboard  the shoals are not the worst andrew replied the tide runs up these gutters very fast and as a rule you cant take out an anchor if you get aground  but thats the first thing one generally does  its dangerous here if the anchor held until she floated on the flood tide the strain on the cable would probably pull her down if it didnt hold which is much more likely it would check her while she drove across the bank sheering athwart the stream in danger of rolling over the safest plan is to keep all sail set and try to make for deep water as soon as she floats  whitney glanced at the nearest channel a small white ridge perhaps six inches high stretched from bank to bank moving forward about as fast as one could walk and as the wave passed on the riband of water changed into a lake he thought it would not be pleasant to meet the advancing tide at some distance from the land  on looking round whitney saw a man walking toward them across the bank the fellow was old and his brown face was deeply lined he wore a yellow oilskin cap an old blue jersey and rubber waders that reached to his thighs clambering on board he nodded to andrew  weel he said im glad to see ye back an its a bonny wee boat ye have got  shes not bad for work among the shoals but shes not the best type for the long seas you get in open water andrew replied and turned to whitney you might bring up the bottle in the port locker jim and the soda  ye can let the sodda bide ive nae use fort when whitney returned the fisherman filled his glass heres til ye an her ye have given her a right name he said  whys the name good what does rowan mean asked whitney  the mountainash the old mosstroopers sometimes wore a spray in their steel caps as a protection against witchcraft and bad luck were descendants of the norse pirates and the ash was the scandinavians sacred ysdragil the tree of life  youre a curious lot whitney remarked i guess our beachcombers dont know much about archæology they dont have superstitions a thousand years old  were ye thinking o making a trip to the deep water doon wast the scotsman inquired  i dont know yet we might do some shooting here is there much fowl about  yell get shellduck noo an a few teal whaups too if yere wanting them but the laggeese an the bernicle are no here yet he paused and added i wouldna say but it might be better if ye bide until they come  andrew looked hard at him  why  im thinking yere wanted here it would be an ill thing to see appleyard gang doon and it might be yours some day  its my cousins and hes younger than i am andrew answered with a frown  just that yere leal we ken weel as yere fond o the young laird it might be wiser to keep an eye on him hes overmuch under yon foreigners thumb  hows the fishing andrew asked pointedly  the old fellow broke into a slow chuckle  it might be better an it might be waur theres ower many o the boards watchers here awa for my liking an noo ill need to win ashore before the tides on the bank  he went off across the sands and whitney turned to andrew with a smile  you people leave a good deal to the imagination but so far as i could understand him he gave you a hint or two whats his business  salmonfishing with a drift net ive known jock marshall since i was a boy and i believe he takes a wellmeaning interest in me  why did he call staffer a foreigner  in a sense he is a foreigner although hes been a naturalized british subject for some time we knew nothing about him until he married dicks mother but theres reason to believe his name used to be von stauffer or something like it mrs woodhouse was born in austria but she came over young and her husband was all right  whitney was not much interested  what about tomorrow he asked  if the breeze holds well have no trouble in crossing the sands to new abbey elsie and dick will come and i expect youll enjoy the trip its an interesting place  as they stowed the sails the boat suddenly rose upright drifted a few yards and then brought up with a jar of tightening cable while the tide splashed against her planks launching the light dinghy they paddled shoreward with the stream  at highwater the next day they went back on board and the rowan stood out across the sands elsie sat at the tiller while andrew sounded with a long boathook and dick lounged in the cockpit smoking a cigarette he laughed and told humorous stories but whitney noticed that elsie was intent upon her steering he had expected this for he thought that whatever the girl undertook would be well done but she did not obtrude her earnestness now and then she glanced at andrew as he dipped the pole and a nod or a gesture was exchanged he was feeling his way across the shoals with halfinstinctive skill and the girl understood what he wished her to do their task was not an easy one there was only a foot or two of water under the boat and she forged ahead fast through the short seas the tide made as it raced across the banks  the seas began to curl as the ebb met the freshening wind and little showers of spray splashed into the straining canvas the deck got wet the water was filled with sand and streaked with foam there was no mark in all the glittering stretch but andrew knew when he reached the main channel and told whitney to let the centerboard down then they went to windward faster the sea hurrying westward with them in confused eddies while small white combers foamed about the boat she plunged through them scooping their broken crests on board and by and by the water ahead grew yellow and marked by frothy lines  elsie looked at andrew and he took out his watch  we ought to get a fathom most of the way across he said and turned to whitney you might stand by below to pull up the board  whitney crept into the lowroofed cabin where he sat on a locker holding the tackle that lifted the heavy iron centerplate he knew that it would be desirable to heave it up as soon as possible after he got the order from where he sat he could see nothing outside the boat but as he looked aft through the hatch he was offered a fascinating picture  a strip of the tanned mainsail shining rubyred cut against a patch of clear blue sky and elsie sat beneath it her gracefully lined figure swaying easily as the boat rose and fell she leaned on the long tiller and a lock of loosened hair that shone like the sail fluttered across her forehead her eyes were bright and there was a fine color in her face but it was not so much her beauty as her decision and confidence that whitney liked the girl was capable of keen enjoyment but it must be in something that was worth doing he was already conscious of a curious respect for elsie woodhouse  andrew called to him to lift the board and come up and when he reached the deck he saw close ahead of them a long humpbacked mountain that rose abruptly from a narrow strip of rolling pasture a row of very small white houses bordered a green common behind the beach and the tide swept frothstreaked down the channel in front  where do we bring up he asked  in the carsethorn gut said andrew do you think you can find it elsie  ill try give her a foot or two of sheet  the boat swung round a little edging in toward the beach and whitney saw by the ripples that they were in shallow water andrew let the staysail run down but when he stood ready with the boathook elsie smiled  sound if you like but you wont find bottom here she said  a good shot you have hit the mouth of the gut  youll touch now said elsie a few minutes later and andrew dipped the pole then threw it down and lowered the jib the boat came round head to wind and the anchor went down with a rattle of running chain  landing from the dinghy they struck across the fields and although it was autumn whitney wondered at the lush greenness of the grass close on their left hand criffells lonely ridge ran up against the sky colored purplered though the hollows in its curving side were filled with darkblue shadows the ashtrees in the hedgerows that crossed the rolling pasture obscured their view ahead and they were crossing the last rise when whitney stopped  this is worth coming a very long way to see he exclaimed  a deep glen where the light was subdued and the colors dim cleft the mountains northern flank and at its mouth a cluster of white houses stood among the trees then on a narrow green level bright in the sun the old abbey shone rosy red ancient ashtrees and crumbling granite walls straggled about it but the molding of the high east window buttress and tower still rose in lines of beauty worked in warmcolored stone  elsie gave him a quick look and he knew that she was pleased with his frank admiration when they entered the cool shadowy interior she acted as his guide for dick and andrew stayed outside in the sun presently she stopped near the east end of the building and whitney looked back down the long rows of plinths from which the pillars had fallen and up into the hollow of the great ruined tower  it must have been a wonderful place in the old days a jewel in the shape of a church and i dare say if theyd searched scotland they couldnt have found a finer setting than these rich meadows at the mountains foot  elsie led him a few yards along a wall over which a low groined roof still hung  its building was a labor of love and perhaps thats why it never leaves one cold she said i suppose you know its history  i only know its called sweetheart abbey  the countess devorgilla built it as a shrine for her husbands heart which was embalmed and buried on her breast its a moving story when one thinks of what she undertook galloway was then for the most part a savage waste skilled workmen must be brought from somewhere else perhaps from italy or france then there is only granite which could not be cut and molded on these hills and the soft red stone had to be carried down the firth and across the sands they had no mechanical transport and you can see the size of the blocks in spite of all this the abbey rose and still stands marked i often think by a tender elusive beauty thats peculiar to the north  elsie moved back to where the sun shone down into the roofless nave and whitney thought he understood why she did so her imagination was fastidiously refined she would not loiter talking by devorgillas tomb standing silent beside her he waited with a faint smile he was not a sentimentalist trying to play up to a pretty girl somehow she had stirred him he felt that she had the gift of seizing what was true in romance and missing what was false then she had the strange elusive beauty of the north which she had spoken of an ethereal tenderness that flashed out and vanished leaving the hard rock of a character steadfast as the granite upon the solway shore  elsie turned and looked east with grave steady eyes  one reaches out for something thats on the other side she said but perhaps when one knocks and the gate is opened one goes through unawares  you mean that when ones eyes are opened there may not be much difference between the land of enchantment and ours  something like that  during the short silence that followed whitney looked round the great church that was still majestic in its decay  well he said there cant be many of us nowadays whod deserve the love and labor this place must have cost  but there must be some she insisted  it seems a big thing to claim but i have met two or three who so far as my judgment goes were good enough for the kind of woman your countess seems to have been not clever men and in no way remarkable until you knew them well but you felt that whatever happened theyd do the square thing one could trust them somehow one man in particular stands out from the rest  elsie turned toward him and he saw the strange elusive tenderness shining in her eyes momentary as it was it transformed her face and he wondered whether she approved his sentiment or knew whom he meant  i imagine you are a good friend she said softly it must be nice to have somebody who believes in you like that  if the man im thinking of knew how he stood with me and others it would make him embarrassed whitney laughed but thats natural its a hard thing to feel that you must live up to your reputation  i like you best when youre serious elsie rebuked him though she smiled  she took the lead he gave her and they went back to the others engaged in careless talk when they reached an arch that opened on a sweep of sunny grass andrew looked up from the stone on which he sat  you havent hurried he remarked  no said whitney ive been learning some more of your traditions and theyre inspiring the people round here seem to have been great lovers as well as pretty hard fighters  a happy thought has struck me dick broke in it would be hot work dragging the dinghy down across a quarter of a mile of sand and i dont feel up to carrying a heavy lunch basket theres a hotel in the village where theyd give us something to eat and we could stroll up the burnside afterward its a pretty walk  whitney noticed that andrews glance rested for a second on elsies face and then passed on she made no sign but it seemed that andrew understood without it  i think not he said the place would probably be full of dumfries excursionists it would be pleasanter on the beach  and i want to see the view you talked about whitney followed him up  dick broke into a resigned grin  very well but youll drag the dinghy down yourselves  they had to carry the boat some distance and afterward they rowed lazily along the edge of the sand until they landed at the foot of a little glen here they lunched and lounged in the sun until the flood tide came softly lapping across the flats  the breeze had fallen very light when the stream swept the rowan east across the shoals and whitney sitting on the cabintop watched the galloway shore recede the western sky was a pale saffron against which criffell rose steeped in a wonderful blue the shadows were gathering fast about the rolling ground below but the hollow where the old red abbey stood still could be distinguished     chapter vi  on criffell hill   the sun burned down on the heather below in the curving glen where the heath gave place to white bentgrass a burn flashed like a silver riband among the stones above the long ridge of criffell ran up against the clear blue sky grouse were calling as they skimmed the steep downward slope and a curlews wild cry fell sharply from the summit of the hill these were sounds that delighted andrew for he loved the fellside almost as he loved the sea but his lips were set and his brows knitted as he stood waistdeep in the heather  whitney was toiling up the hill beside elsie a short distance farther on and dick was behind them but seeing andrew stop they waited until he came up  its rather steep said elsie giving andrew a sympathetic glance heres a nice flat stone well rest for a few minutes  she sat down on a slab of lichened granite and dick found a place beside her  i wonder why andrew loaded himself up with that heavy rucksack on a day like this he said i suppose theres a pair of marine glasses and a chart and a parallel rule and compass inside of it andrew thinks hed get lost if he didnt carry the lot about when he risks himself ashore  theyre all there andrew replied somewhat grimly still it wasnt the bag that stopped me  im sorry we forced the pace elsie said you were going well at the bottom  i felt all right but thats just when my weakness finds me out sometimes its the damp that brings it on and sometimes the heat but one oughtnt to grumble about not being able to climb a hill as fast as usual he broke off and resumed after a twinge of pain its thinking of our boys being rolled back on cambrai while i loaf about the solway shore that worries me  when they had rested a while they climbed up the steep face of a pointed knoll and then followed a long ridge to the massive cairn on the top of the hill where shallow pools gleamed among the green moss of a bog andrew sat down on a stone but whitney stood on the highest hillock his eyes wandering across the wide landscape that rolled away beneath him  to the south the sea glittered like silver and a bright arm wound inland up a valley to the west and north a few lemonyellow harvest fields and strips of green pasture checkered the red heath and the smoke of a little town hung about a hollow but the pictures dominant tone was wild solitude the plain rose in steplike ridges the hillsides that bordered it were washed with shades of delicate gray and in the distance lofty rounded summits cut against the sky  it looks as lonely as our western deserts whitney remarked  andrew was busy with his chart he had spread it on a flat stone then putting a compass on the middle of it he moved a notched brass ring round the instrument the tide was about half ebb and broad belts of sand rose among the glistering channels in the firth andrew took sights across them then penciled notes on the margin of the chart but at times he lay still for a minute or two with the marine glasses at his eyes the others left him alone until he rolled up the chart and lighted his pipe  ive learned something useful he said these channels change so fast that a charts of no use unless you keep it up to date  whats the country to the east like whitney asked it looks high and rough but i seem to make out a deep valley beyond your annandale  now you have set him off dick exclaimed andrews one hobby is that western road to england  andrew laughed  the road is interesting i will take you over it some day for one thing nature has provided a good route through a rugged country for most of the way the valleys are shut in by high moors and that made eskdale a natural sallyport for the old border clans  elsie and dick were walking about picking their way among the shallow pools but whitney sat down beside andrew and listened with interest to the history of the old eskdale road  i shall buy a motorcycle he declared when andrew had concluded one of those with a sidecar so that we can travel around these roads  elsie and dick joined them and for a time they sat talking and looking about there was very little wind and the murmur of the solway tide came up to them faintly across the purple slopes where the grouse were calling  suddenly as if he had sprung from the earth a young man in khaki uniform appeared picking his way across the bog he was hot and breathless and seemed surprised when he saw the party but he came toward them with a smile  so youre back he exclaimed to andrew i meant to look you up  well be glad to see you murray dick said cordially you havent been round for a long time what brings you up criffell in full uniform i must say its a better fit than some theyve been serving out lately  murray laughed  we are giving the terriers a run but business first i suppose you havent seen any turf that might have been dug over recently or stones that seemed to have been pulled up  no did you expect to find anything of the sort  to tell the truth i dont know what i did expect to find were ostensibly practising scouting but theres a batch of dumfries cyclists scouring the galloway roads and i imagine the authorities have some reason for sending us out  i suppose if you met a foreigner or anybody with an electric battery hed go into the bag dick suggested after reading the newspapers one must admit that the terriers are remarkably good shots in fact its not safe to meet them in the dark  you imagine this turnout isnt merely part of the mens training andrew asked  murray looked thoughtful  no i believe there is something going on round here weve got orders to search the country as far as screel of bengairnthough of course that cant be done in a day i heard they mean to organize scouting parties in the castle douglas neighborhood  well perhaps a wireless installation could be made small enough to carry about and hide but a good deal of galloways a wilderness of granite and heath  thats why it might prove a suitable place  yes in a way there are glens where a man could lurk for a long time without being seen but theyre hard to reach and nothing that the enemy would wish to learn is likely to happen here then the sands protect this shore the east coasts our vulnerable point any important news could best be picked up about rosyth if there are wireless installations working one would naturally look for them on the eastern slope of the lammermuirs and along the seaboard between berwick and the forth  of course agreed murray and no doubt theyve had that district searched but you must remember were dealing with remarkably clever people who wouldnt go to work in the obvious way now suppose some news was gathered about rosyth how long would it take a powerful car to bring it here  four hours and a half provided that none of your fellows or the police interfered  thats by the eskdale road id go the other waya rough country but theres nobody to bother about the speed limit  well said andrew thoughtfully id prefer the eskdale the obvious ways sometimes safest its the unusual thing that excites suspicion  theres only one road for andrew dick laughed  murray got up  i must be off he said my terriers are scattered about the mosses and khaki has its disadvantages when youre looking for your men  he turned away and when he went springing down the western slope of the hill elsie looked at the others  it was so serene up here she said and he has broken the charm the war cloud looked a long way off but it seems closer now she glanced across the ranges of sunny hills as she added what a beautiful world this might be if men were sensible and just  true replied dick but then wed miss some excitement and get fat and slack a certain amount of troubles good for us and thats why we make it  we didnt make this horrible war  no i suppose we didnt as a future landowner ive naturally no admiration for the lloyd george gang but one must admit that they were forced into the fray to do them justice theyre not the lot to fight when they can help it and theyre certainly getting on better than i expected  you were bound by the scrap of paper whitney remarked  dick chuckled  our politicians have left us nothing to say about that but ill admit theres something convenient in the other fellows theory i happen to know a little about scraps of paper and there are one or two id be glad to disown  so i thought andrew interposed dryly  oh dick laughed my frankness is always getting me into trouble  soon afterward they went down the hill talking carelessly but elsies eyes were grave when she saw in the distance small scattered figures moving across the heath there was something ominous about the soldiers presence on the quiet moors where the blackfaced sheep had long fed undisturbed     chapter vii  the gray car   it was one oclock in the morning but andrew could not sleep he sat by an open window looking at the tops of the firs which stood out in black silhouette it annoyed him to be so wakeful as he and whitney were to make an early start for edinburgh but andrew had something to think about for he realized that his friendship with elsie could not be resumed where it had broken off she had grown up while he was away and his feeling toward her had changed to be regarded as an elder brother no longer satisfied him and if he were not very careful he would find himself in love with her this was unthinkable first of all because he was lame and poor and then because it was obvious that elsie ought to marry dick she had no money dick had plenty and besides dick needed her elsie would keep him straight and his weak heart would cease to trouble him when he steadied down andrew had long cherished an affection for both of them and he knew that dick trusted him  then he reflected that elsies attitude toward dick was to a large extent protective and motherly which was not the feeling one would expect a girl to show for the man she meant to marry and while dick was obviously fond of her his attachment so far as one could judge was not passionate besides when one came to think of it the suggestion that their marriage must be taken for granted had come from staffer he had so to speak delicately warned andrew off  andrew firmly pulled himself up he was being led away by specious arguments it was easy to find excuses for indulging oneself and he had promised to look after dick if he tried to supplant his cousin in elsies affection he would be doing a dishonorable thing there was no getting around this but it cost him an effort to face the truth  a soft rattle of gravel down the drive attracted andrews attention rabbits sometimes got through the netting and one might have disturbed the stones as it sprang across but he rejected this explanation the sound was too loud although he imagined that there was something stealthy in it anybody coming toward the house across the smoothly paved bridge would have to walk on the gravel as there was a flower border between the drive and the shrubbery this had a narrow grass edging but hoops were placed along it to keep people off  andrew leaned forward cautiously and looked about him it was a calm night and not very dark although there was no moon he could see the firs near the house cutting black against the sky and the blurred outline of a shrubbery beside the drive to the bridge thin white mist rose from the ravine and beyond it a beechwood rolled down the hill the air was warm and the smell of flowers and wet soil drifted into the room there seemed to be nothing moving however and the sound was not repeated for a few moments andrew waited expecting to hear the intruder fall over one of the hoops that edged the drive when this did not happen he fixed his eyes intently upon the end of the shrubbery and then he made out a very indistinct figure moving slowly through the gloom beneath the firs  this was strange he had never heard of any housebreaking in the dale and there was nothing at appleyard to attract a burglar from the distant towns it was too late for a villager to keep tryst with one of the maids and a poacher would not cross the wellfenced grounds andrew decided that he would not give the alarm but he slipped across the room and opened his door quietly so that he could hear if anybody entered the house though he stood beside it listening closely he heard nothing then he returned to the window and saw a dark form move back into the gloom of the trees presently there was another soft rattle of gravel near the bridge and after that deep silence except for the splash of water in the ravine andrew imagined that about five minutes had elapsed since he heard the first sound but the prowler had gone and he must try to solve the puzzle in the morning  he got up early and went down to the drive before anybody was about a fresh footprint showed plainly in the flower border near the bridge close to an opening in the shrubbery by which one could reach the lawn as if the man had meant to jump across and had fallen a few inches short that he had not gone along the grass edging showed that he knew the hoops were there  andrew examined the footprint it was deep and clearly defined and he thought it looked more like the impress of a wellmade shooting boot than of the heavy boots the country people wore for one thing he could see no marks of the tackets the scottish peasant uses acting on a halfunderstood impulse he covered the footprint up and strolled toward the gardener who was just coming out with his rake  you have a big place to take care of fergus but you keep it very neat andrew said  aye replied the gardener im thinking its big enough  have you help  willie grant comes over whiles when ive mair than ordinar to do he has a club foot yell mind an is no verra active but theres jobs he saves me  andrew knew the man and knew that he could not have sprung across the flower border  i see tom is still at the stables but the man who drives the car is new how long have they had him  a year maybe watsons a quiet man an makes no unnecessar mess like some o them he leeves in the hoose  then he doesnt get up very early  hes at dumfries wi the car there was something to be sortit an he took her there yestreen mr staffers for glasgow the morn  after a few remarks about the garden andrew strolled away he had learned that the night prowler could not have been one of the men employed at appleyard the fellow had apparently not entered the house and although he had stayed long enough to deliver a message to somebody inside andrew had not heard a door or window open the matter puzzled him but he determined to say nothing about it although he was conscious of no particular reason for his reserve  an hour later whitney and he started for edinburgh with dick on the carrier of the motorcycle the machine was powerful and they meant to travel by short stages and stop at points of interest for a walk across the hills andrew was glad to have dick with them particularly as he was dubious about the visits the boy was in the habit of making to dumfries and lockerbie dick generally returned late at night and did not look his best the next morning  whitney enjoyed the journey he had understood that southern scotland was the home of scientific agriculture and in this respect the valleys came up to his expectations but when they left them on foot as they did now and then they crossed barren windswept spaces clothed with bentgrass and heather in places lonely hills rolled from horizon to horizon without sign of life except for the blackfaced sheep and the grouse that skimmed the heath  andrew knew every incident in the history of this rugged country and with a little encouragement he told tales of english invasions and fierce reprisals of stern covenanting martyrs and their followers fanatical cruelties looking down from the heights of the lammermuirs they saw where cromwell crushed his scottish pursuers they climbed the battlements of old square towers that had defied english raids and traced the line of prince charlies march  whitney found it rather bewildering there was so much romantic incident packed into two or three centuries but he felt that he understood the insular briton better than he had done and this understanding improved his conception of the nativeborn american it was here that some of the leading principles of american democracy were first proclaimed and fought for another thing was plainif the spirit of this virile people had not greatly changed deeds worthy of new ballads would be done in france and flanders  on the return journey they reached hawick one evening and stopped for an hour or two dick suggested that they stay the night but there was nothing to keep them in the smoky woolspinning town and andrew preferred to push on  the night airs bracing among the moors and i like to hear the whaups crying round the house he said to whitney theres a small hotel built right on the fellside and we should get there in an hour  they set off with andrew on the carrier and the powerful machine rolled smoothly out of the town the street lamps were beginning to twinkle as they left it and low mist crept across the fields past which they sped the cry of geese feeding among the stubble came out of the haze which lay breasthigh between the hedgerows clogging the dust but it thinned and rolled behind them as the road began to rise then the stubble fields became less frequent fewer dark squares of turnips checkered the sweep of grass and the murmur of teviot running among the willows crept out of the gathering dusk  cothouses marked by glimmering lights went by they sped through a dim white village and whitney opened out his engine as they went rocking past a line of stunted trees they were the last and highest for after them the rough ling and bentgrass rolled across the haunts of the sheep and grouse whitney changed his gear as the grade got steeper the hedges gave place to stone walls until they ran out on an open moor round which the hills lifted their black summits against the fading sky the three men made a heavy load on the long incline but the machine brought them up and the last of the light had gone when they stopped in front of a lonely hotel it looked like a swiss châlet on the breast of the fell and a dark glen dropped steeply away from it but it glowed with electric light  they seem to have some shooting people here dick said ill run across and see if they can take us in while you look at the carbureter we may have to go on to langholm and she wasnt firing very well  he went up the drive and whitney opened his tool bag the top of the pass was about half a mile behind them and the road ran straight down from it widening in front of the hotel there was a patch of loose stones on the other side and the motorcycle stood a yard or two from the gate everything was very still except for the sound of running water and it was rather dark because the hills rose steeply above the glen  dicks a long time coming back andrew said with a frown  perhaps youd better go for him whitney suggested  andrew went off but met dick in the drive  its all right theres nobody stopping here he reported they keep the lights blazing to draw motoring people  he spoke clearly but with an evident effort and andrew frowned again  theres a nut i cant get hold of whitney called to them from under the motorcycle do you think i could borrow a smaller spanner here dick  ill get it for you dick volunteered jovially and started back toward the house  andrew put a firm hand on his arm  you will not he said shortly  dick turned upon him in a moments rage and then laughed  oh all right youre a tyrant andrew but you mean well  when whitney went for the spanner dick knelt down in the road to inspect the machine  lend me your knife he requested it will be all right if i put something in the jaws  im inclined to think youd better leave it alone andrew replied meaningly  dick laughed  youre a suspicious beggar i wasnt away five minutes anyhow theres a fascination in tampering with other peoples machines wheres the knife  andrew let him have it and soon afterward dick uttered an expletive as he tore the skin from one of his knuckles  the beastly thing will slip but im not going to be beaten by a common american nut he declared if i cant screw it up ill twist the bolthead off  leave it alone said andrew  its going dick panted and threw the spanner down another knuckle skinned he added grimly  as he stopped to wipe his hand a loud humming came across the summit then four lights leaped up and their united beam rushed down the pass  that fellows driving very fast but he has plenty of room dick remarked and andrew stepping back saw that the taillamp of the motorcycle was burning well  dick got up and andrew moved out a yard or two across the road with the headlamp half dazzled by the blaze of light that filled the glen suddenly the stream of radiance wavered and andrew wondered whether the driver had lost his nerve on seeing the patch of stones which perhaps looked larger than they were then he heard the wheels skid and loose metal fly as the car lurched across the road  jump he shouted violently hurling dick back before he sprang out of the way  he struck the motorcycle with his lame leg staggered and fell on the gravel close to the gate for a moment or two he had not the courage to look up and then with keen relief he saw dick standing safe  the clumsy brute dick cried in a voice that sounded hoarse with rage  running to the bicycle he started it and jumped into the saddle the red taillight streamed away through the dark like a rocket and when it grew dim andrew standing shakily saw whitney beside him  hes gone mad whitney exclaimed  andrew did not speak and above the dying roar the big car made in the narrow hollow they heard a shrill buzzing that sounded strangely venomous  forty miles an hour anyway whitney estimated it would take a good car to get away from her is he fool enough to run into the back of it  i dont know said andrew dicks capable of anything when hes worked up the curious thing is that his head is steadier than usual then  they waited until the sound grew fainter and then died away  i am going down the glen andrew said  they had not gone far when they heard a motor panting up hill to meet them and a minute later dicks car ran past and he waved his hand  hotel gate he shouted dont want to stop  when they reached the gate dick was waiting andrew turned the light on him and started at the sight which met him dicks face was white and strained and smeared with blood and he was evidently laboring under an emotion not wholly due to anger and excitement  even in the sudden flash past them of the automobile andrew thought he had recognized the car as one belonging to appleyarda low gray car which staffer always used he had believed that the lurch which nearly cost them their lives was due to reckless driving but there was a tenseness in dicks expression which he could not quite understand  did you overtake the car he asked  no said dick with a forced grin i took the bank and im afraid the machine is something the worse for it i was gaining and close to the car when we got down to the bottom of the glen you know its very narrow there  whitney nodded there was a sharp bend where road and stream ran out side by side through the sharply contracted gap in the hills the slope on both sides was very steep and there was only a strip of grass between the road and the water seven or eight feet below  yes its not the place id care to negotiate at full speed  i meant to catch the car and ran on to the grass to get a wider sweep but she wouldnt take the curve went straight up the hillside for a dozen yards and then threw me off luckily i fell into some fern and when id pulled myself together i somehow got her down  but the car  got off dick replied in a strained tone  andrew spoke quickly  youd better come and let us see if your face is badly cut  they entered the hotel but dick stopped as they were passing the bar  weve all had a shock he said and if you feel youd like a drink dont mind me you neednt be afraid of setting me a bad examplei dont want anything  andrew smiled  nor do i sometimes youre a very thoughtful fellow dick     chapter viii  the rowans light   dicks cuts were not deep and he joined his companions at supper one of the windows was open and the smell of peat smoke came in while the noise of ewes water running down the glen mingled pleasantly with the bleating of sheep the room however was illuminated by electric light and a row of sepia drawings hung on the wall  theres something distinctive about the border whitney remarked but theres one thing that strikes me in old english citieschester for examplethere are streets that look as they did in queen elizabeths reign but the scottish towns youve shown me might have been built forty years ago  andrew smiled  the reason lies in our national character were utilitarian and dont allow sentiment to interfere with progress as soon as a building gets out of date we pull it down our past lives in the races memory and we dont need to keep it embodied in stone  he turned to dick who had been unusually quiet  its lucky you didnt get worse hurt did you see the cars number  dick hesitated a moment  noo the plate was covered with mud  but there has been no rain whitney objected i was near the gate when the driver swerved and i couldnt see any reason for his doing so  he may not have noticed the loose stones until he was close to them and then lost control of the steering because he was startled or perhaps the wheels skidded on the loose metal andrew suggested  its curious whitney persisted because if the fellows nerve had given way he would have gone over the motorcycle and into the gate anyhow he didnt lose control because he straightened her up the moment andrew threw you back  his nerve did not give way said dick  andrew looked hard at him  you know something what is it dick  i know the car dick said grimly but it isnt nice to think your own friends came near killing you  youre sure  positive i thought i recognized the hum she makes on the top gear and when i was close behind them at the bottom of the glen i saw the taillamp had a cracked glass and a dinge in the top it isnt a coincidence that our lamps like that i remember when watson dropped it  staffer certainly wouldnt lose control of his steering  no said dick hes as steady as a rock sos watson you dont often find a lowland scot of his type jumpy  whitney lighted a cigarette and leaned back watching the others  staffer was going to glasgow andrew argued  yes the hydraulic ram that pumps our water had broken down and he meant to see the makers he told me he might not be back for a few days  but would he return by edinburgh had he any business there  none that i know of we deal with glasgow i wanted him to come up to edinburgh not long ago but he wouldnt said he didnt know anybody in the place and there was nothing to do  after all you may have been mistaken about the car  oh no said dick but well talk about something else i dont like to think that staffer nearly finished meand he wouldnt feel happy about it of course he didnt recognize us and on the whole i think wed better not mention it to him  i agree with you whitney said and they planned to ship the damaged machine to hawick and to walk back across the hills  on their return to appleyard whitney watched staffer closely when dick explained that they had been delayed by an accident in the glen at teviothead he showed only a polite interest in the matter and when whitney talked about edinburgh he remarked that he found the city disappointing and seldom visited it  a few days later they all sat on the terrace one calm evening when watson came back with the car and gave dick and staffer some letters  from murray dick announced when he had opened his theyre going to search the colvend country next thursday and he suggests that we might like to join though he hints that hes not allowed to give us much information  what does he expect to find staffer asked his tone expressed indifference but whitney suspected that it covered a keen interest  he doesnt say somebody working a wireless installation i imagine  and is thursday particularly suitable for that kind of thing  its dumfries earlyclosing day they can get a lot of motorcyclists then murray states that the coast and mossroads will be watched  you ought to go elsie interposed mr whitney would enjoy a day upon the heather  an opportunity for combining a pleasant excursion with a patriotic duty staffer remarked well the high ground from bengairn to susie hill will need some searching no doubt theyll push across the moors toward black beast  murray doesnt say but its probable i dont know whether the military authorities have the spy mania but if there is any ground for suspicion it can do no harm to draw the galloway moors what do you think andrew  id try the hills farther east  about eskdale of course staffer said with ironical humor  well andrew replied i dont claim much strategical knowledge but if we take it for granted that a hostile force could be landed on our east coast  rosyths being a naval station would make that difficult but go on  beginning rather awkwardly andrew worked out a supposititious plan of campaign and to whitney who had just been over the ground it seemed a very good one the scheme he outlined certainly appeared practical and whitney saw that staffer was more interested than he pretended and that his objections were designed to draw andrew on both showed a knowledge of military needs and history and when staffer mentioned cromwells retreat on dunbar whitney thought andrews defense of his favorite route across instead of around the lammermuirs was good he noted that staffer did not claim as much local knowledge indeed he thought he was careful not to do so  im not convinced that we have much to fear but you have worked the thing out very well he said at last have you thought that the war office might find something to interest them in your views  andrew flushed  theyre probably bothered enough by amateur strategists he replied of course i may be all wrong but if there really did seem any need for it id try to get somebody with influence to put my ideas before them  staffer folded a letter he had been reading and looked at his watch  i must send off a telegram he said and left them  well andrew are we going on this spy hunt whitney asked it sounded promising to him  i could take the boat to rough firth then we might go on to wigtown bay where you could see your people will you come dick  yesas far as rough firth but i dont know about the rest small boat sailing needs an acquired taste you have to get used to eating halfcooked food and sleeping among wet sails on my last cruise drops from a deckbeam fell on my face all night when it rained andrews hardier than i am and no doubt truer to the old strain but while the annandale johnstones did many reckless things they had generally sense enough to stick to dry land  they made the necessary arrangements and a few days later the rowan went down the solway with the strong ebbtide the shoals were beginning to show above the sandfilled water when she drifted past a point fringed by low reefs and boulders at criffels southern foot whitney guessed its distance as about three miles and took a compass bearing at andrews order the coast turned sharply west at the point and the mountain sloping to meet it broke down into a wall of cliffs that rose grim and forbidding from the beach at one place a gap in the wall suggested a river mouth there was not much wind the sky was hazy and on the port hand a stretch of gray water ran back to the horizon it looked like open sea but the strong rippling in the foreground indicated that the tide was running across thinlycovered banks  i should have liked a breeze andrew said if we bring her around the ebb will sweep us past the mouth of the firth theres not much water on the sands ahead but we ought to get a fathom if i can find the barnhourie gut keep her as shes going dick with the knoll ashore on the bowspritend while i look at the chart  andrew went below and whitney turned to dick  do you know this gut he asked  i remember something about it but they keep changing see what depth there is  whitney found six feet and looked around as he heard the topsail flap the rowan was sailing upright but going very fast with the current eddying about her wreaths of sand came up to the surface and went down again  keep her full he said shes luffing off her course  its possible the tides strong and shes not steering well i dare say theres enough water everywhere but andrew must find the gut he feels he has to do the proper thing hes made like that  well take no chances whitney answered and ran to the scuttle pull up the board and come on deck he shouted to andrew  in a few moments andrews head appeared and after a glance round he swung himself up and jumping aft took the helm from dick  ready with the headsheets he ordered well come round  she began to turn and then suddenly stopped with a rush of sandy water boiling about her stern andrew seized an oar but could not push her off and she sank on one side until the water flowed along the lower deckplanks  shes fast whitney said where are we  on the barnhourie tongue of the mersehead bank replied andrew throwing down the oar i meant to run through the gut between them he turned to dick youre a hundred yards off your course  thats the tides fault shall we take the sail off her  andrew thought for a moment  yes i dont know about laying out an anchor the flood runs pretty fast here but well see when the sands are dry  they lowered the canvas and then went below to cook a meal this took them some time for the floor and lockers slanted awkwardly as the boat listed over and when they went on deck again the light had begun to fade whitney was astonished at the transformation what had looked like open water when he went below was now a waste of sloppy sand that ran back as far as he could see it was however pierced by a broad channel from which a depression filled with shallow pools cut through the bank and ended in a lagoon not far off this was evidently the gut andrew had meant to navigate the cliffs round the bay to the westward were losing their sharpness of outline but two or three blocks of houses and a tower on the rocky point showed black above the level strip behind them  thats southerness theyll light up soon andrew said i know one of the lightkeepers and ill walk across and ask him about the entrance to rough firth theres a flock of duck up the channel jim and you might get a shot at them from the dinghy when its a bit darker will you stay on board dick  not much theres nothing more melancholy than sitting alone in a stranded boat ill go with jim  andrew went below and trimmed the anchorlight then fastened it firmly to the forestay and set off across the sands half an hour later dick and whitney carried the small folding dinghy to the channel and pushed her off the current was now slack and they made progress until dick shipped his oars and kneeling down took up the small hand paddles but he let her drift for a few moments while they looked about it was dark and the shoreline had faded but some distance up the channel a small black sail was visible across the bank and a steady bright beam marked the southerness lighthouse halfseen birds were wading about the waters edge but dick said these were oystercatchers and not worth powder and shot a curlews wild whistle fell from overhead and the cry of a blackbacked gull came out of the obscurity like a hoarse laugh it was rather dreary and their clothes and the dinghy were getting damp so dipping the paddles dick drove the boat ahead  after a while they distinguished a cluster of small dark objects some distance in front and made toward them cautiously the ducks did not seem to get much plainer and whitney thought they were swimming away stopping a few minutes to allay suspicion dick paddled again but the ducks vanished as they crept on then he turned in toward the bank and pushed the craft along the bottom hoping the dark background would hide their approach presently they saw the ducks again and whitney raised his gun  there was a red flash smoke blew into his face and the air was filled with the clamor of startled wildfowl still they had heard a splash and dick got out the oars and rowed ahead as he picked up a floating mallard they heard a flutter and knew there was a crippled duck not far off rowing out into the stream they saw it rise awkwardly from the water whitney fired and missed after this they spent some time in trying to get into range before he brought down the bird then they ran the dinghy ashore and dick landed with his gun  ill walk up the bank and try the soft places about the pools he said if i dont turn up soon it will be because ive gone back to the rowan  whitney lighted his pipe while he waited to allow the birds to recover from their alarm but he had to strike several matches because his hands were wet and he was annoyed to find that he had not many left it was very dark and a cold wind was blowing whitney lay down on the floorings for shelter and to hide the glow of his pipe the birds were quiet but a dull throbbing roar came out of the distance and he supposed it was the splash of the surf on the seaward edge of the shoals when his pipe was empty he got up intending to step overboard and drag the dinghy down to the receding water but he found that this was not needful as the ebb had nearly run out paddling up the channel he heard the whistle of curlew and for a time followed the invisible birds he could not get a shot and deciding that he had had enough he laid down the paddles hitherto he had been looking ahead but when he put the oars in the crutches he was facing aft  grasping the oars firmly he looked for the twinkle of the rowans light in his surprise he almost dropped an oar the rowan had disappeared     chapter ix  in the dark   whitney frowned as he looked about he could see nothing except the black line of the bank a few yards away and the beam from the lighthouse on southerness though this had grown less distinct there was no fog but the air was filled with an obscuring moisture that wet his face and gathered upon the dinghy since the rowans canvas had been lowered she would be hard to see and she lay at some distance from the water he could not remember how long it was since he had seen the light but it must have been some time and he blamed himself for not keeping an eye on it  still he ought to find the gutter near which she lay and he knew the bearing of the southerness light from there he had guessed its distance and if he took a new bearing now the angle between it and the other would give him the length of the line he must follow to reach the neighborhood of the yacht taking out a small compass he struck a match but it went out his hands were wet and the box was damp he tried two or three more with no better success and when he got the last to burn the knifeblade he laid across the compass cast a shadow on the card this prevented his seeing the points and finding that he had no matches left he paused to think  if his friends had returned to the boat they would certainly not have put out the lamp and it was disturbing to imagine their wandering about the sands particularly as andrew might have to cross some hollows up which the tide would shortly flow whitney shouted but got no answer and after waiting a few minutes he began to row because it was plain that he must relight the lamp as soon as possible he kept out in the channel to get the help of the stream which he thought was running with him but he did not seem to be making much progress when he passed a projecting tongue of sand stopping to get his breath he saw that the dinghy began to drift slowly back and this disturbed him the tide had turned sooner than he expected  heading in toward the bank he rowed savagely but the flatbottomed craft did not pull well her main advantage was that she could be folded up and stowed on deck after a time bits of seaweed and flakes of scum drifted up to meet him and he could hear the water ripple along the edge of the sand where the channel bent the flood was beginning to run and he had not covered much distance yet sweat dripped from his face his back ached and his hands blistered but this did not matter dick should be able to follow the channel down but andrew was no doubt a long way from land with his retreat to the beach perhaps cut off moreover whitney saw that his own position was not fortunate  he had the dinghy but her side was only a foot above the water and the tide would presently sweep her up the firth he could not row against it long and the current would capsize or swamp the boat if he struck a shoal still it would be slack for about an hour and he must make good use of the time his arms got stiff but he kept up the pace and edged inshore until he touched bottom when he made a deep stroke the temptation to turn round and look ahead was strong but he resisted it he must not relax his efforts for a moment he ought to see the mouth of the gutter when he had gone far enough unfortunately however the edge of the bank began to be indented by shallow bays and as he must pull straight across in order not to lose time their ends were not always visible it was unthinkable that he should overshoot the gutter but he imagined it was still some distance off  at last he saw a bold ridge of sand that looked like the place where they had launched the dinghy but on pulling close in he could not distinguish the mark she must have made as they dragged her down he rowed on for a hundred yards and stopped there was no gutter though he believed he had come far enough the sound of the surf was ominously loud and a blackbacked gull that fluttered overhead seemed to mock him with its hoarse croaking laugh  whitney felt unnerved but he pulled himself together his friends lives and perhaps his own depended on his keeping cool he must have passed the gutter but he might see the rowan from the top of the bank running aground he pulled the dinghy out there was no grapnel but she had a few fathoms of painter and he tied it to an oar which he drove into the sand this ought to hold her if she floated before he came back  for a few minutes he walked rapidly away from the water then turned and ran along the flat but could not see the yacht and when he dared stay no longer he came down to the channel there was nothing that looked like the mouth of the gutter and the dinghy was afloat pushing off he rowed a short distance and made another unsuccessful search whitney was now getting desperate but he tried to think calmly what he should do he could fold up the dinghy and carry her toward the southerness light shouting as he went but the others would be in very grave danger if he missed them besides they would not both come the same way the plan would not serve he must try again to find the rowan progress was difficult against the current but he did his best and landing again he dragged the dinghy up she would not float for some time because the bank was steep but he dared not go far lest he should lose his way in coming back  striking shoreward he plowed breathlessly through soft sand but saw nothing for some minutes then when he was despairing a black object emerged from the gloom it might be only a hummock but after he had gone a few yards he knew it was the yacht and felt a thrill of relief that was unnerving in its keenness still he must brace himself and decide between two courses the dinghy might be needed to take his comrades off and there was a risk of her going adrift before he got back he ought not to lose a moment in returning to her on the other hand dick and andrew must be in danger of being cut off by the advancing tide and the lamp would show them where the boat lay but it might take some time to light hesitation would be fatal he must do one thing or the other at once  running to the yacht he clambered on board and unfastened the lamp from the stay and then groped about the cabin for matches at last he found some and shaking the lamp heard the oil splash inside the wick did not ignite readily and he had to rub the charred edge off but by and by the flame began to spread and he scrambled on deck striking his head against the hatch when he reached the bow he found himself shaking and scarcely able to tie the lamp to the stay but he jumped down on the sand and ran with all his speed toward the channel he could not see the dinghy and feared that she had gone but he found her safe afloat and straining at the rope  jumping on board he pulled along the edge of the bank until an eddy swept him into the mouth of the gutter this decided a point that he was anxious about the tide was flowing into the hollow from the channel and not from its seaward end which meant that there was less danger that the others would be surrounded the rising water carried him close to the yacht and when he got on board he sat down breathing hard and feeling conscious of keen nervous strain he shouted but there was no answer only the crying of wildfowl and the ripple of the tide broke the silence it was running fast up the gutter surging noisily over the uneven bottom and lapping the edge of the sand and whitney soon heard a splash against the starboard plank  he must now grapple with a fresh problem the rowan drawing little water when her centerboard was up would shortly be afloat andrew had not laid out an anchor for it might be dangerous if the anchor failed to hold she would sheer across the current before her keel was quite off the bottom and the leverage of the taut chain might help the rush of water to press her down into the sand or roll her over one could take no chances with the solway tide still if left unmoored she would drive across the flats away from his comrades  whitney could not determine what to do and while he waited in tormenting indecision the boat rose upright and the water swirled furiously round her bilge then his heart leaped as a cry came out of the dark and soon afterward two indistinct figures appeared at the side of the gut  be quick shell be off in a moment and the anchors on board he shouted pulling up the dinghy to row across  stay where you are andrew called we can wade it in with you dick  they were soon kneedeep and whitney saw the current boil about their legs when they stopped as the water got deeper but andrew encouraged dick and they went on again and reached the yacht dick was panting but andrew seemed quite cool  i dont know about the anchor yet well wait he said and stood watching the tide ripple past  it was lucky i met andrew when i lost the channel dick said to whitney in a resentful tone you might have waited for me  hold on dick interrupted andrew perhaps youd better go below and change your clothes  dick left them and soon afterward the boat began to move uneasily  the streams getting slack the water must be coming through from the other end andrew said  in another minute she slowly floated away and he threw the anchor off the bow  shell ride to it but as we neednt make sail until the flats are covered well go down and get supper  he changed his clothes while whitney lighted the stove  how did the lamp go out he asked presently  whitney related his adventures and dick turned to him with a smile  sorry i was huffed but i dare say you can make allowance for my feelings theyd got rather harrowed while i wandered about in the dark you did the right thing of course in going back  dick made some coffee and when it was on the table whitney was glad to lean back on a locker and light his pipe with two candle lamps burning the narrow cabin looked very snug and cheerful after the desolate sands and it was something to see andrew sitting opposite safe but thoughtful  did you trim the lamp properly dick asked puzzled  of course said andrew with a touch of dryness thats something i dont often neglect mixed the oil myselfcolza and a dash of paraffin and the lamps the best i could get in glasgow suppose you bring it down  dick did so and andrew took off the oilcontainer which was nearly full and examined the burner there was nothing wrong and whitney noted the good workmanship of the fittings  it couldnt go out he said decidedly  that andrew replied frowning is my opinion but as i came down to the gutter i saw only two rows of footsteps and you made those in coming and going back to the dinghy i cant say there wasnt another track because the light was faint so far from the boat but we might look about the deck and cabintop to see if anybody has been on board  im afraid i mussed that all up with sand whitney pointed out  but whod want to come on board dick asked theft could be the only object and well soon find out about that  they looked round the cabin but missed nothing  a thief wouldnt have put out the light because hed know that might bring us back before he got away dick elucidated then turned to whitney what do you think  well said whitney smiling ive only one suggestion and its rather farfetched the thing might have been a plot to make us lose the boat or perhaps make an end of us if thats so it nearly succeeded  rot exclaimed andrew nobody would be twopence the richer for putting me out of the way  and i havent an enemy in the worldunless its myself dick grinned i dont count the kaiser because the bad feelings patriotic ive nothing personal against him  andrew made a sign of impatience and whitney watching him closely thought he felt disturbed  did you see anybody on the bank  no whitney answered i saw a small sail a lugsail i think because it was long on the head it looked very black  tanned with blacklead and oil one of the annan whammel boats most likely they drag a net for salmon but wouldnt get any just now as the waters too smooth  then why were they out  after flounders perhaps but none of the annan men would meddle with our light however wed better make a start if we mean to reach rough firth this tide  now and then im glad im not much of a seaman dick laughed as id probably pull the wrong string ill stay below and smoke  a cold east wind was blowing when whitney went on deck and after hoisting sail they crept away against the tide whitney sounded with the pole until he could no longer touch bottom when andrew seemed satisfied it was very dark but two quivering beams pierced the gloom  get the topsail down andrew ordered after a while well find the stream that fills rough firth in a few minutes and it will take us up fast enough  this proved correct for shortly afterward the sea broke about them in confused eddies and the boat splashed and lurched as she crossed the troubled space that divided the tides then she forged ahead very fast and blurred hills and shadowy cliffs soon loomed out whitney used the sounding pole again the cliffs grew plainer and when the land closed in on them they dropped anchor she brought up and after helping to stow the canvas whitney climbed into his folding cot  for a time he did not sleep but lay thinking about the extinguished light it seemed impossible that the lamp should have gone out accidentally and he was not satisfied that the explanation he had humorously offered was altogether absurd his friends had had another narrow escape not long before and it might be significant that although they were together on both occasions andrew had run the greater risk whitney admitted that this might be coincidence and he must not let his imagination run away with him one must use sense and not wrap up in romantic mystery a matter that might be perfectly simple for all that he meant to seize any clue that chance might offer him  next morning they landed and joined murray at a village among the hills they spent the day upon the heather working inland across broad grassy spaces and red moors where the sheep fled before them and then climbed a line of rugged hills these were not high but whitney found them romantically interesting as he scrambled among black peathags where the wild cotton grew up marshy ravines and past great granite boulders stopping now and then to get his breath he watched the line of small figures stretched out across the waste and thought that nobody lurking among the stones and heather could escape still when the different detachments met upon a windy summit none of them had seen anything suspicious  weve drawn blank murray remarked as they ate some sandwiches behind a boulder  yes said andrew if there is anything to be found out id locate it farther east  murray looked at him keenly for a moment and then answered  on the whole i agree with you its my business however to search where i am told  they went downhill soon afterward and the next day the rowan sailed west along the coast carrying dick who had reluctantly consented to go with the others     chapter x  the young officer   it was a fine afternoon when the train ran down from the granite wilds round cairnsmuir into a broad green valley behind the red heath strewn with boulders and scarred by watercourses rolled upward into gathering clouds in front yellow stubble fields and smooth meadows lay shining in the light with a river flashing through their midst whitney watching the scene from a window thought the change was typical of southern scotland which he had found a land of contrasts  they had left the rowan where the river mouth opened into a sheltered hillgirt bay and walked up a dale that was steeped in quiet pastoral beauty it led them to a windswept tableland in which lonely ruffled lakes lay among the stones and granite outcrops ribbed the desolate heath there they had caught the train and now it was running down to welltilled levels dotted with trim white houses and marked in the distance by the blue smoke of a town andrew had chosen the route to show whitney the country and he admitted that it had its charm  the train slowed down as it approached a station and when it stopped dick jumped up  i may be able to get a paper here he said and leaped down on to the station platform where shepherds with rough collies cattledealers and quarrymen stood waiting  dick vanished among the crowd but a few moments later he returned hurriedly without his paper  i nearly ran into old mackellar he exclaimed with a chuckle but i dodged him  who is mackellar whitney asked one of your creditors  worse than that one of my trustees i thought id better not meet him he might have felt embarrassed after what he said to me not long ago  alighting at the next station they walked downhill to the narrow town beside the cree and here they arranged to be driven up the waterside to the shooting lodge where whitneys mother was staying after standing on the bridge a while they went to the little inn it was now getting late in the afternoon the hillside above the town shut out the light and the room they entered was rather dim dick stopped just inside the door  mackellar he exclaimed and turned to be off  dick yere not going before ye speak to me  i want to show my friend the town he explained with a laugh but he came forward and shook hands and presented whitney  mackellar was about fifty years of age strongly built and dressed in quiet taste he had a shrewd thoughtful face with a hint of command in it and there was a touch of formality in his manner but whitney liked his faint twinkling smile  weel said the scot after they had talked a while ye may take your friend out to see the town now dick but with mr whitneys leave ill keep your cousin here until ye come back  whitney felt amused as he saw that dick had failed in his rather obvious intention of preventing the others from enjoying a private talk  when whitney and dick had gone mackellar rang a bell that stood on the table yell join me with a glass o wine he said to andrew  the wine was brought and though andrew did not hear what mackellar said to the waitress he imagined that they would not be disturbed  i would say dicks new friend is to be trusted mackellar began when they were alone  of course said andrew if i grasp what you mean hell do the boy no harm but hes really a friend of mine  that should put the thing beyond all doubt mackellar replied and filled the glasses  andrew waited mackellar was generally deliberate but people valued his opinion he had been a lawyer and in the small scottish towns lawyers are entrusted with their clients investments and in consequence are often appointed agents by the banks  i think ye see your duty to your cousin mackellar resumed  yes said andrew simply i wish i saw how it ought to be carried out im at a loss there  mackellars nod indicated sympathetic understanding  yere young and want to see the whole road ahead its enough that ye walk cannily doing what seems needful as ye find it for a that im glad to hear ye feel that ye are responsible its some help to me  then you take a personal interest in him andrew hesitated and added i mean if you understand apart from your being a trustee  mackellar smiled  i understand were dour folk and not given to sentiment but i think we can be trusted to pay our debts and dicks father was a good friend o mine it was the appleyard business first put me on my feet then your cousin is a likable lad though hes given me trouble but well not dwell on thatthere are other things to talk about  have you paid off his debts  some there are one or two for which the holders would not give up his notes  why  they carry high interest and fall due at a future date then i have reasons for thinking the holders are agents for a principal in the background  the fellow must take a risk because dicks not of age hasnt the law something to say about a minors debts  im not sure the risk is as big as it looks would ye expect a johnstone o appleyard to repudiate his obligations  no said andrew when you come to think of it such a things impossible  weel theres another point your cousin did not tell us all he owed  andrew frowned  i must admit that i was afraid dick hadnt been quite straight with us whats to be done can we take him away from staffer  why would ye wish that mackellar asked sharply  its not easy to explain and my positions difficult dick thinks highly of the fellow and i cant see anything thats openly wrong with him still one feels he hasnt a good influence on dick  just that mackellar dryly returned dicks mother put the lad into staffers hands and i had no power to stop her if staffer abused his position it would give me a handle but i cannot find fault with anything he does a careful wellthoughtof man and exact to a penny in the estate accounts  and yet you dont trust him if you did youd tell him about those debts instead of me  weel chuckled mackellar theres maybe something in that  andrew knitted his brows  i feel that theres something going on so to speak behind the scenes but i cant tell what it is do you know that dicks heart is weak and dissipation and excitement are bad for him  i heard something about it mackellar gave andrew a steady meaning look your cousin will not be in danger until hes twentyone  what danger do you mean andrew asked uneasily  i cannot tellye have heard that loose living is bad for him hell be free from restraint when he comes of age  andrew suspected that this was not all that mackellar meant  suppose his creditors insisted on his insuring his life he asked  theres a difficultyinsurance companies are not as a rule anxious to take a man with a weak heart for a that mackellar broke off and sipped his wine in silence before he resumed ill try to follow up the matter of the notes and yell keep an eye on dick if ye remark anything suspicious ye will let me know now i think theres no more to be said  andrew agreed and lighted his pipe he was troubled by vague suspicions that mackellar seemed to share on the surface the suspicions looked somewhat ridiculous but andrew was not satisfied and mackellar had admitted the need for vigilance well he must keep the best watch he could  whitney came in while they sat there  dicks not back he said i thought id find him here  ye might try the bar mackellar replied with a twinkle mr johnstones not anxious to talk to me how did ye lose him  i rather think he lost me whitney laughed but he knows weve ordered tea and hell be along soon  when the trap they had hired was waiting dick came in his face was flushed and his eyes gleamed with amusement as he glanced at mackellar  i shant have to leave without a word or two after all  well said mackellar ye cut it very fine where have ye been  in the other hotel i found a number of people there theyd been to the creetown sheep sales and were in a convivial mood in fact they wouldnt let me go  its no doubt a matter o taste but one would not expect to find a johnstone o applegate colloging with drovers in a secondclass bar mackellar observed  dick laughed  i dont know that it makes much difference but i was playing cards he said  losing money ye could not afford  they drove away in a highwheeled trap that is locally called a machine andrew had set off in a serious mood but it was difficult to continue thoughtful in dicks society and he enlivened the way as they followed the winding river it led them up a long valley past turnipfields smooth pasture and alderfringed pools the soil was well tilled on their bank but across the stream birchwoods turning yellow straggled up the barren hill slopes and to the north rugged fells rose dark against the sky by degrees the landscape changed there was less cultivation and the woods got thinner rough heath ran down to the river which foamed and brawled among the stones and white tufts of wild cotton shone among the peat they were climbing to a desolation of moor and bog that looked strangely wild and lonely in the fading light then as the shadows closed upon the wilderness lights blinked among the firs in a glen a lodge gate was opened and a smooth drive led them to a straggling modern house  they were hospitably welcomed and andrew liked his host a genial grayhaired man who had lately retired from business to spend his wellearned leisure in outdoor sports whitneys mother and sister also impressed him favorably mrs whitney was quiet and dignified and there was a touch of stateliness in madges refined beauty at first andrew felt shy of her and left her to dick but she soon set him at his ease madge rang true and he found that she could be remarkably frank  on the evening after his arrival he strolled along the terrace talking to her a soft red glow still shone behind the firs that straggled up the western end of the glen and the air was cool and still they could hear a little burn splashing in the shadow and the river tumbling among the stones  how do you like this place andrew asked from what ive seen of your country this is a change  yes madge said its quiet when we rusticate in the wilds we take a troop of friends along the environment were used to goes with us perhaps thats why i dont harmonize with a natural background as some of your people do here for instance i feel im an exotic  exotics are generally beautiful and one likes them for their glow and color ours is a land of neutral tints and i dare say it has an effect upon our character  madge laughed  thats very nice of you but its difficult to judge your character youre not an expansive race and for another thing there are no young men aboutthough one must admit thats to their credit just now it seems theres still an answer when you send round the fiery cross  yes said andrew with a flush they were wanted somewhere else and they went  andrew paused and madge gave him a sympathetic glance  jim told me why you couldnt go she said softly after all you have something to do at home havent you  andrew saw that she was wellinformed about his affairs but he did not resent it when he took his comrade into his confidence he did not do so rashly and that whitney had told his sister only proved that she could be trusted something in her manner and her frank level glance made him sure of this  well he said hesitatingly its nice to feel that one is needed though of course theres a risk of being officious  i dont suppose elsie thinks you officious for trying to look after her cousin hes quite charming but i imagine hell keep you busy  im prepared for that andrew laughed and i dont mind the trouble dicks a very likable fellow and elsie feels more satisfied when im about i wish you could meet her little elsies worth knowing  little jim told me she was tall regal i think he said in fact hes enthusiastic about her and that makes me curious because jims taste is not often bad  it isnt but i always thought of her as little elsieshe was a girl when i left home i can understand what struck your brother i felt it myself when i first saw her after i came back  elsie had grown up  it wasnt quite that she had grown up in the way i had expected but she had somehow grown beyond it in fact though i used to be a kind of elder brother she had caught me up and left me  he broke off as their host came toward them with lieutenant rankine a brownfaced young man who had arrived on the previous afternoon  i hear youre cruising about the galloway coast rankine said to andrew if you happen to be between the isle of man and the solway i dare say we shall meet and well be glad to see you on board the tern  the tern andrew looked his surprise shes  an antiquated barge rankine laughed well she makes a handy surveying craft and the sea lords have lent me to the hydrographic department rather a come down just now but somebody must keep the charts up to date  andrew felt puzzled rankine had a capable look and being young was no doubt ambitious it was curious that he should be satisfied with the monotonous task of taking soundings when the battleships were watching for the enemys fleet he looked at rankine keenly but the young lieutenant merely smiled back at him in a quizzical manner and began to speak of shoals and tides  madge slipped off to join her brother  what do you think of my partner whitney asked her are you still pleased with him  entirely so he improves which doesnt often happen in fact hes fine if you get what i mean  well i imagine andrews unique but that doesnt quite hit it suppose we say rare in its old english sense anyhow though i dont know that hes very susceptible id rather you didnt turn his head you are attractive when you exert yourself  madge laughed  hes proof against my charms andrews earmarked for somebody else  elsie woodhouse well that struck me but i dont know he says its very probable that shell marry dick  andrew is in love with her himself madge said firmly though i dont think he knows it yet dicks delightful but the girl would never be satisfied with him  so i think but you dont know her  your partner has told me about her  whitney laughed  andrew has his talents but the delineation of characters not his strong point  a precise description isnt always needed madge rejoined when you have an image clearly stamped upon your mind its sometimes possible to make others see it without saying very much your partner can do that  perhaps youre right he has now an idea that his countrys somehow threatened from the old main road to the south on the face of it the ideas absurd and yet he makes one feel that hes not quite mistaken  madge indicated rankine who was still talking to andrew  i wonder why they sent that man to a post where ability doesnt seem to be required she questioned  its possible that rankines job is more important than hes allowed to admit  he broke off for rankine was coming toward them and he saw his sisters face flush prettily     chapter xi  the signal   a light breeze was blowing when the rowan ran into a confused tide eddy in the mouth of wigtown bay there had been more wind and the swell it left was broken by the current into short splashing seas amid which the yacht lurched uneasily it was four oclock in the afternoon and about two hours before highwater and when the breeze fell very light a stream that ran north from the disturbed patch swept the rowan up the bay  andrew frowned as he looked about  shes right off her course but its too deep to anchor and the bottoms foul near the beach he said we must let her drift until the ebb sets in and carries her down along the opposite shore we ought to make ramsey on the next flood  at four or five oclock in the morning dick grumbled well im glad im no use at the helm in the dark and we may get a few hours smooth water before we round the burrow head at present im wondering why i came  theres some water in the bilge and its your turn to pump whitney remarked  if she was half full i wouldnt pump until this rolling stops dick said firmly  the sea got smoother as they drifted along the coast and presently ran in faint undulations that gleamed like oil where their surface caught the light the days however were getting short and soon the long tongue of land across the bay cut low and black against the sunset the hills to the eastward were gray and dim a heavy dew began to fall and a pale halfmoon came out now and then a puff of wind from the south rippled the glassy water and drove the yacht farther up the bay  when an inlet began to open out ahead dick took up the glasses  we ought to find water enough across the sands to gatehouse he said id a good deal rather sleep ashore and wed get a much better meal at the murray arms than whitney can cook  we cant get ashore without a breeze andrew replied  theres somebody going up i can see a lugsail boat beyond the point  andrew took the glasses from him the light had nearly gone and mist hung about the shore but a belt of water shone with a pale gleam against which a distant boat stood out sharply  she looks like one of the annan whammelers they use a sail with a shorter head in the west but i cant see what an annan man would be doing here  putting up the glasses he thoughtfully filled his pipe  the night our lamp went out on mersehead sands whitney said i saw a lugsail boat what kind of fellows are the whammelers  unusually good seamen the boats are small but they turn out in very wild weather when the salmon are about  that was not what i meant  oh theyre a sturdy honest lot but you dont often find a set of men that doesnt include a wastrel  soon a white light and a green one twinkled some distance behind the yacht and dick called attention to it  that steamers moving slowly he said  a trawler i expect shes probably waiting until its dark when shell put her lights out and drop her net i understand the fishery board forbid trawling here  they said nothing further and the rowan drifted shoreward with an eddy of the tide which had begun to turn the moon was half obscured by haze but they could see a wall of cliff to starboard with a narrow line of surf at its foot part of the wall seemed detached from the rest and andrew explained it to whitney  thats barennan island this strip of coast was a favorite haunt of dirk hatteraiks but tradition locates his cove at ravenshall across the inlet yonder it might have been convenient for running contraband up the cree and fleet but the shore abreast of us has better hidingplaces besides being nearer open sea  dirks been dead a long time and has no successors in the business dick interposed his men probably were more ruffianly than romantic but they must have given the neighborhood an interest with their signal fires their vessels running in at dark and their packhorses winding through the moors the trawlers gone  impossible andrew said quietly she hasnt had time to steam farther than we could see her lights  then shes put them out perhaps the nets over  whats that light ashore whitney asked  a twinkling flash appeared on the high black cliff behind the island and went out but after a moment or two flickered up again and growing brighter burned for a time  it looks as if the smugglers werent quite extinct whitney remarked  andrew made no comment but when a cool breeze came off the land he edged the boat closer to the beach it showed as a gray blur beneath the crag hardly distinguishable except for the white fringe of surf  im curious about that light he admitted id have said it was somebody baiting a longline or looking for lobsters only that the fellow wouldnt have waited for highwater then it was too brilliant for a lantern  lets go ashore whitney suggested dick anticipating adventure of some kind  all right andrew replied scull in instead of rowing its quieter and take the small cask and ask if theres a spring about if you meet anybody  whitney launched the light dinghy and put an oar in the sculling notch when dick joined him the swell looked higher than it had appeared from the yacht and as he heard it tumbling among the stones he wondered how they were to land besides it was difficult to keep the lurching craft on a straight course he stopped sculling when a weedy ledge of rock with a white wash running over it appeared in the gloom  go on said dick keep the reef to starboard theres a cove ive been here before  swinging past the ledge as an undulation rolled in they were met by its broken recoil but whitney drove the craft through this and a few moments later ran her on to a narrow beach quietly lifting the boat beyond the reach of the water they made for the cliff after a few yards they came to large rough stones and dick stopped everything was quiet except for the splash of the surf and the wall of rock rose above them black and mysterious  we couldnt see anybody against that background he said in a low voice and its difficult to move quietly among these stones i think well try the crag  it took them longer to reach it than whitney expected but presently dick stopped in front of a mass of fallen rock  follow me close the path isnt good he said  they went up carefully feeling for a foothold among the stones until they came to a ledge that ran upward across the face of the cliff whitney could see nothing below him but he followed dick and after a while they reached a ravine filled with tangled grass and heath which led them to the summit here they lay down behind a whinn bush and then whitney understood why his companion had chosen the position the moon was hidden but the sea reflected an elusive light that distinguished it from the blackness of the land anybody moving along the beach would show against the glimmer of the water whitney could not see the rowan but andrew had no doubt steered a course that would bring the island behind her canvas it was of course possible that their landing had been noticed but the dinghy was very small and the dull roar of the surf would have drowned the noise they made  turning quietly whitney looked inland across high rolling ground it was all obscure but in the hollows there were gray patches which he supposed were belts of mist and two or three dim lights twinkled in the distance now and then a bleating of sheep and the whistle of a curlew came down the cold wind there was nothing to rouse suspicion and whitney began to think of going back just then dick touched him  a shadowy figure showed against the water a short distance from where they had landed and then a flickering beam of light fell upon the sea it was too bright for an ordinary lantern and whitney could not see where it came from but after a moment or two it was abruptly cut off  theres another cove behind the point and i think i know a way down dick whispered come on as quickly as you can  the figure vanished but as the light was obviously a signal it was worth an effort to learn something about the men who had made it when whitney got on his feet dick had already started they turned down the landward slope of the crag where they stumbled among prickly whinns and long heather in a few minutes dick was breathing hard but he kept up the pace and they presently came to a ravine that seamed the front of the cliff it looked dangerously steep and there was no evidence of a path but dick went down following a runlet of water and now and again catching at the grass and stones to check his descent whitney following as closely as he could hoped that the ravine did not end in a precipice  they came to one steep drop and at the bottom of it whitney stumbled into a hole among the stones when he got up dick was some distance below him but he could distinguish his figure against the sea no sound but the growl of the surf reached them but this was loud enough to drown any footsteps on the beach and cover their rather noisy descent whitney reached the edge of the pool where the runlet of water widened and was looking for a way across it when he saw dick stagger he swayed in a curious way as if trying to recover his balance and then suddenly disappeared whitney splashed through the water and came to the edge of a very steep slope he could not see the bottom but he scrambled down clinging to the stones and after sliding the last few yards he found himself on the beach dick lay motionless on a slab of rock near by  are you badly hurt he asked breathlessly  no dick said faintly leave me alone a while  whitney sat down beside him feeling alarmed the dinghy was some distance off and he did not know whether it could be reached by the beach it would be impossible to carry dick across the rough stones without help the rowan was too far off for andrew to hear a call and he did not want to leave the boy who might be seriously injured  do you feel better whitney asked presently  dont talk said dick ill be all right presently  whitney waited anxiously and five minutes later dick held out his hand  give me a lift ill try to get up  he got upon his feet with whitneys help but leaned on him heavily for a minute  i can move along slowly he said theres a way across the point  they were some time in crossing the slippery rocks but at last whitney helped the lad down to the sand and felt keen satisfaction when they came to the dinghy  im much better dick said as whitney pushed off i must have been half stunnedguess i knocked my head as i fell down the last bit  is it cut  dont fuss dick answered irritably shell wash back up the beach if you dont pull  whitney occupied himself with the oars but he felt puzzled dick seemed to have turned dizzy before he fell and although it was possible that he struck his head his statement that he had done so looked like an afterthought it was however his business now to find the rowan and he could see by the way the cliff slid past that the tide was running down he had to pull hard to get near the island and the wind was rising but soon he distinguished a patch of dark canvas and a few minutes later he ran the dinghy alongside the yacht  lash the helm and come below he called to andrew after helping dick on board  andrew stopped to throw a sail over the skylight when whitney lighted the lamps and then went down and looked at dick who lay on a locker his face was very white his lips had a blue tint and the veins showed dark on the back of his colorless hands  i think you had better have a drink he said taking out a whisky bottle  dick drained the glass  thats good ill soon be all right i slipped when we were coming down the crag and pitched over the edge of the steep bottom part  he thinks he hit his head whitney added  andrew felt dicks head in spite of his objections  there is a lump but not large it doesnt account for the shock you seem to have got  if you had fallen down that rock i dont suppose youd feel very fit but give me a cigarette and ask jim to tell you what we saw  andrew gave him the cigarette and then looked out the scuttle a breeze had got up blowing off the land and the yacht was drifting seaward with her loose mainsail flapping and her jib aback she would need no attention so he closed the hatch and sat down to listen to whitneys story  do you think they heard dick fall he asked  i cant say its possible though the swell was breaking noisily on the beach  its a curious affair said andrew i saw the light and was glad id kept the boat in the gloom of the island it certainly looks as if the steamer that put her lights out and the whammel boat that crept in to the land at dusk had some connection with each other then i thought i heard oars shortly before you came off  suppose the boatmen had meant to signal the vessel why should they land when they could have lighted a flare on board  it would have shone all round said andrew by coming ashore they got the crag for a screen and a high platform the light could be seen farther off but only from the sea  but what would they want to signal from a place like this and whom would they signal to  i dont pretend to know its a long distance from a main line but a fast car would cover a good deal of ground in an hour or two  andrew stopped and taking a chart from a rack pointed to the narrow channel between scotland and ireland  you see how close fair head is to kintyre he resumed well all the shipping from the clyde and a good deal from liverpool passes through that gap you can imagine what would happen if it were filled with mines  the difficulty is that the minesowers would be seen the lighthouses on rathlin and kintyre command the channel  its hard to see a vessel that carries no lights and a minesower wouldnt proclaim his intentions theres a big fleet of trawlers working in the irish sea and a stranger would excite no remark by slipping in among them it wouldnt take long to paint on a registered number and copy the funnel of a steam fishing company  so rankine has another duty besides taking soundings a small survey vessel could cruise about among the shoals without attracting much notice her business would be obvious but that neednt stop her crew from watching out  well said andrew it isnt difficult to form a theory to fit the few things we know however  it would probably be all wrong when youd made it dick broke in  im glad youre feeling better andrew smiled ill go up and look after the boat  he left the scuttle open and they heard blocks rattle as he hauled the main sheet and the soft splashing at the bows as the yacht gathered speed  im not sure it was the blow on your head that knocked you out dick whitney said you reeled as if you were getting faint before you fell  well suppose i did i may have been running harder than was good for me but cant you understand that one shrinks from making a fuss about ones weaknesses  of course this means you want to keep the real explanation from your cousin  id very much rather nobody knew falling on your head is a good enough reason for feeling faint and as a matter of fact i hit it hard enough  very well agreed whitney i suppose i must say nothing since you have taken me into your confidence  you might let my cot down and pull out the blankets im not quite right yet to tell the truth i think ill go to sleep  whitney arranged the cot for him and then going up on deck sat in the cockpit while the rowan stretched across the bay before a fresh easterly breeze     chapter xii  a false alarm   heavy rains lashed the windows at appleyard and a wild west wind buffeted the house between the gusts one could hear the wail of stormtossed trees and the distant roar of the flood tide foaming across the solway sands it was however warm and bright within the thick granite walls and andrew lounged in a corner of the billiardroom after dinner watching elsie knit she was making a soldiers woolen belt and he noted the precise neatness of the work elsie was conscientious in all she did but he thought this view of the matter did not go far enough the care with which she linked up the stitches was deepened by love  it will be a lucky man who gets the belt he remarked we must hope he isnt by any chance one of our enemies  elsie looked up with a smile  after all i wouldnt mind that very much so long as he needed it it must be dreadful to lie out cold and hungry in the snow  it is said andrew ive done something of the kind of course youre right but ordinary people would rather help their own side particularly when the other seems to be singularly unchivalrous  he stopped as he saw a tinge of color creep into her face but she quietly met his apologetic glance  i know you didnt mean to hurt i do remember sometimes that in a sense i belong to the other side  you cant help that and youre scottish to the backbone in all that matters  elsies eyes twinkled  youre not making it much better but perhaps youd lose something if you were not so frank one distrusts people who always say the proper thing  andrew glanced at a welldressed handsome man who was playing billiards with dick he came to appleyard for a day or two now and then and had been there when andrew arrived from canada  does that mean you dont quite trust williamson ive sometimes wondered whether its his right name  elsie looked thoughtful and answered with some hesitation  i dont think it is he hasnt a trace of foreign accent and his ways are ours but i cant help feeling that he does not belong to us then ive noticed that he never talks to mother much but of course its only changing his name that matters not where he was born our enemies are not all treacherous and cruel you have seen the portraits mother has of her own people and three or four were soldiers they have kind true faces i think they were men with an unusual sense of duty  you see whats best in everybody andrew replied but if there are good fellows on the other side why do they behave like savages  ah said elsie and was silent for a few moments  andrew glanced at his cousin who had soon recovered from his fall he was now chalking his cue and his eyes had an excited glitter a syphon and a whisky bottle stood on a table near by and andrew wondered whether elsie had noticed that dicks glass was full again  ill beat you if i can make that cannon dick was saying  half a sovereign you dont but you had better not take me williamson replied it would need a professionals stroke  andrew surmised that they were not playing for mere amusement  you cant do it dick whitney said and his tone was restraining while andrew imagined that williamsons was meant to be provocative  dick raised his glass and put it down again half empty before he poised his cue  watch me  he made the cannon but something in his hot face suggested that it had been a nervous strain and he turned to the table at once to refill his glass  now he said i think the game is mine  his play was clever but andrew watching closely imagined that williamson was not doing quite his best it was difficult to say what gave him the impression but he was a judge of matters that needed accurate judgment and steadiness of hand williamson was cool and skilful but he missed a cannon he ought to have made and there was a break he bungled it looked as if he did not want to win that was curious for andrew did not think he felt any hesitation about taking dicks money  dick reached out for his glass without turning round and whitney standing behind him neatly struck the bottle with his elbow in stepping back it rolled across the table upsetting the glass and fell upon the floor  im sorry he apologized simply  dick regarded him with an ironical grin ill have to ring for another he said  andrew wondered how much elsie understood and he was not deceived by her unchanged expression elsie was quick and did not always show her feelings  you made some brilliant strokes but your plays a bit erratic williamson said to dick it might be worth your while to study some of the good professionals that reminds me theres an interesting semiprivate match next thursday and ive friends at the club  he mentioned two players whom andrew had heard of and the door opened while he added something about the match andrew was watching his cousin and did not look up and it was a few moments later when he saw that staffer had come in  ive been suggesting that dick should come to town tomorrow williamson said i can show him some good billiards  i cant stop him although i imagine hed better stay at home staffer answered with a smile as he has been warned to keep regular hours and that sort of thing its possible that the excursion might not be good for him dicks rather too keen a sportsman  andrew could find no obvious fault with staffers reply on the surface it was tactful but something in his manner made it inciting instead of deterrent  you arranged to take us snipeshooting on wednesday he reminded his cousin  so i did dick admitted still we could fix another day we might get a woodcock if we waited a bit  im keen on snipe whitney interposed besides were going down the coast again at the end of the week  staffer gave him a quick glance and dick seemed to hesitate  that makes a difference but you could go without me im not a crack shot  you know all about snipe and where to find a cock andrew insisted they ought to be here now and its a long time since i bagged one  oh well said dick you mustnt be disappointed and well try to show whitney the best sport we can  elsie looked at andrew and he saw that she was grateful but staffer came across to where he sat  i met marshall the salmon fisher in annan and he mentioned that they had run the burnfoot boats up this afternoon he said there was a big surf last highwater and he asked if you had been down to the yacht it looked as if he thought you ought to go  andrew turned to whitney  is the motorcycle all right jim  take the car suggested staffer watson wont have housed her yet  they started in three or four minutes but it was not the rowan that andrew thought about as the big car throbbed at full speed through the dark he had kept dick at appleyard and williamson would be gone tomorrow which was something to the good because dick was apt to get out of hand when the man was there andrew thought he made rash bets with him and he certainly drank more than usual it was his duty to look after dick but it was getting harder to do so for elsies sake and at times when he thought of his task in this light he had to master a feeling of bitterness dick was not good enough for elsie still if she really loved him she would be able to keep him straight he knew the protective tenderness she felt for him this might be different from the love she could give a lover but andrew would not follow up that line of thought it might lead to false hopes and to shabby conduct of which he would always be ashamed  it was near highwater when they left the car at the end of a miry road and struggled across a common to the beach the roar of the sea filled the air and driving sand stung their faces but they carried the dinghy down and wading out some distance through the surf got on board after a few minutes hard pulling they reached the yacht and andrew looked about while he felt the cable  the anchors holding but perhaps wed better take the kedge farther out he said  it cost them half an hours hard work for they had to follow up the heavy warp while angry broken waves splashed into the dinghy and then after tearing the anchor out of the sand they had to row some distance against the drag of the rope at last however andrew was satisfied  im not sure all that was necessary but it was wiser to make things safe he said when they carried the dinghy up on the shore  whitney did not answer and as they passed a sod cabin on the common a man came out  is that you jock andrew asked its a wild night and when mr staffer told me what you said i thought id come down to see how the boat was riding  its wild enough agreed the fisherman and whitney recognized him as the man who had come on board on the morning after their arrival what was it mr staffer said  i cant remember exactly but i understood you thought the boat might drag  weel i wouldna say that was impossible but ye hae good ground tackle  whitney looked hard at him but he could not see the scots face well  and mr staffer sent ye off in his car to see if she was a right marshall chuckled  i dont know that he sent us he said we could use the car  hes a thoughtful man but i wouldna say watson would be pleasedhed be wanting to wash her onyway ye needna fash about the boat ill be here until the tide rins doon and if onything needs doing ill see til it  thanks said andrew do you know if one of the whammel boats has gone west  yins gone i dinna ken where a shooting man frae edinbro bought tarn grahames nance him and another took her off soon after ye came  how do you know he was an edinburgh man  there was a waverley label on his portmanteau and he didna speak like us still i alloo it might have been inverness  and the man who was with him  ye canna tell where a man comes frae when he keeps his mouth shut but he was a sailor by the way he handilt the gear  andrew asked no more questions and they went back to the car when they reached appleyard dick met them in the hall  ive found a way of letting you have your shooting he said in an apologetic tone young ross will go with you there isnt a snipe in the mosses he doesnt know about if theres any sport to be had hell see you get it  i suppose this means youre going with williamson  i really want to go if you dont mind very much i may be back before you leave and youll only be away a week  thats so said andrew well youd better bear in mind what the doctor told you  he moved on frowning and presently found elsie in the drawingroom  i did my best but dicks going with williamson he said you didnt want him to  no she answered frankly but with some embarrassment of course theres no obvious reason for our interfering  that was my difficulty dick will soon be master here im only his guest and williamson is a friend of staffers nobody knows anything against the man  and yet elsie stopped  im vexed you can take it that i dont like to be beaten particularly by my youthful cousin andrew answered with a smile wishing to allay her uneasiness  staffer and mrs woodhouse came in then and when the party broke up for the night whitney went with andrew to his room  i guess you noticed the coincidences that happened this evening he said sitting on the broad windowseat and lighting a cigarette  i feel rather annoyed by dick if that is what you mean andrew replied in a discouraging tone  whitney smiled  not altogether that oneenumerating them on his fingersyou try to stop his going with the fellow and just about put it over two staffer mentions the boat and rushes us off in his car three marshall says the boats all right and hints staffer may have mistaken his remarks four we return and find that dick has changed his plans five  oh ill admit that staffer is a clever fellow andrew interrupted ive known that for some time  ive an idea that mackellars on his trail andwell if you need me im ready youre playing a straight game and i want you to win it would be a fine thing for you to save dick and elsie expects it of you then staffer knows hes up against you keep it at that its quite enough for the present  you mean theres something else going on andrew said in a curiously quiet voice  of course but you want to let staffer think youre only fighting him for your cousin he can understand that and wont suspect you of guessing hes engaged in another game ill play up to you as much as i can staffer doesnt take much stock in me  but what object can he have  cant say whitney answered noncommittally but he may be forced to show his hand well ill get along to bed  dick started for london with williamson the next morning and he let himself go when he got there with his companions help he spent several days and the greater part of several nights in exciting amusements and adventures it was not often the sparkling cup of pleasure was held out to him full and he drained it to the dregs as one result of this he did not feel quite up to the mark but dick was something of a philosopher and knew that one cannot get anything without payment besides if quietness was good for him it was to be had in abundance at appleyard  for all that when he left euston at midnight a reaction had begun and he wondered whether he had made the pace too hot on reflection however he suspected that it had rather been made for him and he had tactfully been encouraged to fall into his companions stride well he had had a glorious time but he wished his head did not ache so badly and he could get rid of the unpleasant shaky feeling that troubled him because there was some business he must talk over with williamson before they reached rugby  we had better get things settled now he said your friend marsden has my note for thirty pounds but you paid the other fellows as well as for that supper and the hotel bill how much am i in  williamson took out his notebook and dick got a shock  forty pounds in an evening he exclaimed i knew i was going it but this is a bit of a facer with all the other things its a pretty hot pace especially as i have just half a sovereign left  you neednt be disturbed about it your promise is good enough i can wait  we cant leave it at that dick objected and added with a forced grin besides you might have to wait some time  then what do you propose  dick wished his head were clearer for he was getting dizzy  i thought you might see craven and arrange the thing with him of course hes holding a good lot of my paper but he gets good interest  williamson produced a fountain pen and a sheet of paper  very well as it happens i expect to meet him tomorrow  it struck dick that the man was suspiciously prompt indeed he seemed to have been waiting for the request  dick suddenly felt as if he were suffocating he could not breathe and his dizziness was turning to blackness he threw up the window and leaned his head on the sill gasping once or twice it was a dark night and the express was traveling fast its lights sped smoothly along the black hedgerows beside the line and flashed across water lying on swampy fields blurred trees raced past twinkling points were suddenly pricked in the obscurity a mile away and then rushed back and vanished and a faint glimmer flickered in the sky ahead dick thought this marked rugby and sitting back again he tried to pull himself together  ill make it enough to cover everything and put us straight he said as he took the pen  he found writing difficult for the bracing effect of the cold wind was wearing off but the note was written and williamson carefully put it into his pocketbook before looking at his watch  were due in a few minutes he said will you get down and have a drink you dont look very fit  no dick answered if id had fewer drinks in town id probably feel better now  the speed began to slacken and williamson collected his belongings dick handed him his coat as the train stopped but did not shake hands with him somehow he felt he would rather not after a careless goodby williamson jumped down and dick sat in a corner struggling against the faintness that was overcoming him he would feel better when the train started but he must be alone he could not have people looking at him while he felt as he did  nobody else got in he heard the guards whistle and then the engine begin to pant there was a jerk and the lights on the platform drifted past but his head was reeling and he could not get his breath falling away from the corner he made a halfconscious effort to keep on the seat and for some time afterward he remembered nothing  he was roused by a rattle that swelled into a roar and getting up shakily he saw the lights of a station flash past there were other lights all around running back into the distance in rows while the red glow of fires that streamed above the roofs seemed to indicate a manufacturing town dick noted this vacantly for he felt weak and cold they must be in lancashire and he had lain in a dead faint for a long time with difficulty he pulled up the window and got back to his corner  if this kind of thing happens often the fellows who hold my notes will get a painful shock he thought with a wry smile and closed his eyes     chapter xiii  the wreck   pale moonlight trembled across the foaming sea and faded again as the rowan rolling hard bore up for the solway whitney held the helm his lips set and his brows knitted for with the savage wind astern the yacht was hard to steer the small stormjib ran water as it swung above the seas and the black closereefed mainsail lurched to and fro lifting its heavy boom high above whitneys head at the risk of carrying away the mast if he let it jibe across andrew stood in the cockpit with the spray rattling like shot on his oilskins his night glasses steadied on the cabin top as he searched the sea ahead he saw enough to daunt a stranger to the firth  the hills along the western shore were indicated by a vague blackness devoid of outline but andrew could distinguish a belt of broken water that stretched across his course and faded into the gloom the backs of the seas were toward him and he noted how their crests were cut off by the wind as they curled against the tide which was running down the firth in some places their length and regularity indicated depth of water but for the most part they boiled in frothy confusion across the shoals a steady beam of light stretched out from the shore but this was not much guide to the intricate channel through the sands while he watched the moon came out and as its light widened smooth bright patches became visible amidst the turmoil these were the tops of the banks that the tide was leaving  andrew put down the glasses and stooping under the cabin hatch lighted his pipe  its rather late to try for rough firth but im not sure i could find the barbara deep if we let her run if we missed it and went ashore shed soon break up  that is not to be thought of said whitney  well i suppose the proper thing would be to set the trysail and try to beat her out but with the tide knocking up the sea shed nearly wash us off when she came on the wind  shes wet enough running before it and i dont feel like pumping hard all night cant you think of another plan  andrew occupied himself with the bearing of the light while whitney braced his aching arms against the tiller he was tired for they had spent several nights pushing the dinghy across the flats at the head of a distant bay and a couple of bernicle geese and some mallards lay in the forecastle the last night had been passed rolling violently at anchor on a disturbed swell and they had been at sea since dawn in weather that made cooking impossible and demanded constant watchfulness  i think andrew said presently i could find the horseshoe spit and wed get shelter behind it in fact the sea shouldnt get in at all after half ebb and daylight wont be far off when the tide covers the flats again  he took the helm and whitney got down out of the wind and spray andrew would tell him when he was wanted and in the meantime the sight of the wet sands that broke out from the welter of surf was not encouraging it was reassuring to feel that andrew knew his business for if he made a mistake now the rowan would probably be hammered to pieces in the next half hour  fortunately the moonlight got brighter and when andrew called whitney they were running up a channel with a strip of glistening sand astern and a wild turmoil of foaming water close on their port hand this no doubt marked the horseshoe spit with the tide streaming across it to meet the surf whitney could not see how they had avoided the bank astern but he was not given much time to look about  stand by the big anchor andrew called to him drop it when i tell you and let the kedge go after she sheers  the rowan came up head to wind and whitney was hard at work for the next few minutes handling heavy chain that ran out furiously and then stopped until he dragged more up from below paying out the thick kedgewarp that coiled all about the deck and lashing the thrashing jib to the bowsprit then he and andrew got the mainsail down and the boat rode to her moorings though she was not at rest sometimes the wind drove her up against the tide and the short waves washed on deck sometimes the current swept her back while the tightening cable rang and it looked as if she must drag her anchors and ground upon the surfswept bank  after watching her for a few minutes andrew seemed satisfied and they went below where whitney lighted the stove  ive eaten nothing but a lump of wet bread and a bit of canned beef since morning and now i want a meal he said  then youll have to hold the fryingpan on and trim the table cleverly if you want to keep the food off the floor  ill try theres a charm in small boat sailing but its a charm that only gets you by degrees and one finds it hard to say what it consists of on nights like this i dont like being wet and hungry and i hate to feel cold and yet here i am in a gale of wind behind the horseshoe spit  its curious said andrew smiling i dare say there are instincts in human nature that neither of us understands but youd better watch your job youre running the ham fat all over the stove  whitney dished the ham and made some coffee cut a loaf that was not very wet and took out a sticky jar of marmalade leaning forward from the lockers they began to eat but care was needed in taking things from the table which swiveled above the centerboardtrunk for a rash movement would precipitate all it held upon the sloppy floorings  whitney got rather knocked about as he put the things away for a time afterward he contrived to lie on the locker then he knocked out his pipe and sat listening the chain cable jarred across the stem the halyards slapped the mast and through the shrill scream of wind came in deep undertone the roar of the sea  it sounds pretty bad but ive been banged about for the last twelve hours and nobody could sleep while this racket goes on he said is that sand hard and could one get on to it  i think so and id like to see the channel we might have some trouble in pulling across but it will be smoother coming back  very well said whitney things will be a bit more comfortable then and ive had enough  they went on deck but he half regretted his suggestion as they launched the dinghy the moon was covered by driving clouds and in the darkness the sea raged about the yacht it was not high because the tide was falling and the water shoaling fast but it broke angrily and the air was thick with spray as soon as the dinghy was overboard they jumped into her and while whitney got out the oars andrew pushed her clear of the rolling yacht the current swept them away but a furious gust whipped the channel throwing up a haze of spindrift and they were blown back past the rowan in spite of whitneys efforts it was a minute or two before he could control the craft but he fought his way to windward until a ridge of wet sand began to shelter them when this was reached they dragged her up and set off across the bank  it was hardly possible to see a dozen yards and they struggled on with lowered heads sinking in oozy patches and splashing into pools then the sand got firmer and although it had been under water an hour before it drove past them in whistling streams the surf roared in the darkness with a rising and falling cadence like the roll of giant drums but every now and then its deep tone was drowned by the scream of the savage wind the men wore oilskins seaboots and souwesters but the spray that swept the bank in a thin mist found out the openings in their clothing which the gale distended it was difficult to keep ones feet and whitney wondered rather anxiously whether andrew knew where he was going still there was something that braced and exhilarated one in the struggle  they had gone about a mile and a half and were near the other side of the bank when the moon suddenly shone out the wet sand flashed into brightness and whitney distinguished a belt of tossing white that was blurred and confused in the foreground but grew into regular foaming lines farther off this must be an inlet that pierced the sands and on looking round a little he saw a dark mass with a pole rising from it some distance away he touched andrew and they made for the object  whitney imagined it to be a perch a spar built into a pile of stones for a beacon he did not expect to find anything of interest there but the pole had been raised by human hands and made a landmark in the stormswept waste it brought him into touch with his fellow men in a spot where the strife of wind and sea was daunting as they got nearer however he saw that he had been mistaken the pole was too thick for a perch and the black mass below did not consist of stones jagged timbers stuck out from the sand like the ribs of a skeleton but in one place they were clothed with planks and supported a mast it was obviously a wreck they were approaching  they stopped to lee of the vessel and whitney was glad to get his breath as he studied her she appeared to have been a schooner of about two hundred tons but her after part and mainmast were gone the fore end however had escaped destruction and although the foremast slanted ominously and the topmast and yards had fallen it still defied the storms standing beneath the swell of the bows the men were out of the wind and could make their voices heard  now i see why i didnt notice a perch on the chart though i once saw the spar as we came down this side of the firth whitney said its curious they didnt mark the wreck  she wasnt here when the last survey was made a coaster loaded with coal somebody tried to get her cargo out but i understand had to give it up  whitney had got his breath but was silent for a time he had camped in the silent canadian forests and by frozen lakes on the vast snowy plains but he did not think he ever had seen anything so savage and desolate as this strip of surfbeaten sand with the wreck in its midst men had hewn her timbers with skilful toil but the sea had shattered them and now seemed to challenge all attempts to dispute its power whitney was not unduly imaginative but he felt depressed and somewhat daunted it was an eerie spot to linger in at midnight in a gale of wind  the focastle doesnt seem broken up can we get on board he said  well try andrew replied  climbing up by the fragments of planking attached to a rib they reached a strip of deck it sloped sharply but andrew grasping the ragged bulwark looked up  the iron forestays holding the mast and theres a couple of blocks slung round the top he said if it wasnt blowing quite so hard id go up for them then he caught a thin rope that ran down from the blocks good signalhalyard id like to take it back but i didnt bring my knife  whitney felt amused andrew could seldom resist the temptation of picking up anything that might be of use on board his yacht indeed her forecastle was cumbered with what whitney called truck  they moved forward a few paces and stopped by two curved beams that rose above a black hole  the remains of the focastle hatch i wonder what its like below andrew said  kneeling on the wet deck he struck a match which blew out but the next burned for a moment or two and whitney saw the light flicker on dripping planks and bulging beams it was obvious that the water flowed into the vessel and he wondered at andrews curiosity the dark hole did not look inviting and he was anxious to return to the yacht in good time still it was bitterly cold standing in the wind  well go and see but ill let you drop down first he said  andrew seized the carlinebeam and vanished through the gap there was a splash below and he called to whitney to be careful how he came down as this was impossible whitney let go the beam and touching the vessels keelson with his foot fell against her planking it jarred him but he got up and andrew struck another match and stooping down picked something out of the water that lay among the timbers  a bit of candle he exclaimed its going to burn  it did so after he had scraped off some smoldering wick and stuck it on a massive oak knee the wrecked bulwarks broke the wind for only draughts came down and the light spread about the forecastle there was some sand in the vessels bottom and the floor and ceilings had gone nothing remained but the heavy timbers and the planks bolted fast to them a few shrimps sped up and down a pool and a small crab that made a crackling noise crawled into a corner andrew examined the beams and knees with interest  these old vessels were very well built he said they used picked material cutting out the sapwood and seeing that the grain followed the curve where there was any shape she broke up aft in pounding with the coal on board but now that its gone this part of her may stand a long time good salted oak will last for many years under water  how did they get the coal away whitney asked  they didnt get much i wasnt here when they tried to salve it but i believe they used carts  then you can reach land at low water  they must have been able to reach it then though im not sure you could do so now because the channels are continually changing its possible they had to drive through water that may have got deeper since and the tide would not allow them much time for work i dare say that stopped the undertaking and haulage would be expensive because its two or three miles from the beach  how long is it since they let up  about two years i cant say exactly andrew stopped to light his pipe and then asked with a smile do you think of trying for the coal  i was wondering whether the men who quit the business left that candle would a candle burn after rolling about for two years in salt water  i dont know its an interesting point andrew replied thoughtfully and moved toward a timber from which he scraped a patch of grease it was stuck on here when it was used and that must have been after she took the sharp list if shed been upright the flame would have scorched the knee and i see no sign of that  would she list over when she struck the bank  andrew knitted his brows as if the question were an important one  im not sure shed have a full cargo and these vessels are built with flat floors to lie on the ground its only westerly breezes that drive much broken water up the firth and though she lists to the east she hasnt gone very far over yet  in short the chances are that she stood nearly upright when they were working at the coal  yes said andrew gravely i think she did  whitney was silent for a moment or two listening to the turmoil of the sea and the uproar of the gale that filled the shadowy hold with confused sound through which came the steady trickle of water running out on the sand he felt that the wreck had a secret  you must see what im getting after he said it looks as if somebody had been here since the salvers gave her up  andrew nodded  the blocks on the masthead are not the kind theyd use for heaving cargo out besides theyd want a gaff then the signalhalyard felt quite sound  if you wanted to get on board would you take a whammel boat  it depends a whammeler couldnt get alongside if it was blowing from the west and since the tide runs out fast shed have to leave early on the ebb if she came on the flood the wreck would soon be covered  then anybody who meant to get on board would if possible walk across the sands which narrows things down now we come to another point why would anybody wish to board her  andrew said nothing for a minute and then answered thoughtfully  of course ive seen where you were leading the signalhalyard would lift the steel triangle they use with a wireless installation and theyd get some height at the masthead besides messages travel farthest at night and the operator wouldnt be seen crossing the sands i dont know whether he could carry the necessary apparatus but he might hide it in a watertight box the candle will be out in a minute so we cant look  you dont know yet if he could cross the sands  thats true im going to find out you had better climb up while the light lasts  whitney reached the deck with some difficulty and it was dark below when andrew joined him  we havent much time to lose if were to see whether its possible to get here from the beach  they dropped over the side and set off across the bank the wind buffeted them and driving sand rattled on their oilskins whitney hoped that andrew was going straight because the moon was obscured again and the solway tide rises remarkably fast for a time they saw nothing but shallow pools in winding hollows and balls of foam that seemed half solidified as they blew along the ground whitney thought it must be past lowwater but andrew trudged quietly on and he made no protest at last they came to a broad stream of water and he noted with mixed feelings that there was no way of getting round he was not sorry that it threatened to stop their advance but his comrade was not easily daunted and might try to wade across  as theres not likely to be another big gutter between us and the beach it would be a pity to turn back now andrew shouted  ill wait and see how you get on whitney replied  andrew plunged in and was soon kneedeep when he had gone a few yards farther the water splashed about the skirts of his oilskin jacket and he came out  we might have crossed but the bottoms soft and theres some stream he said  which way is it running  up but not very fast yet  then were going back at once whitney said firmly  they started and whitney did his best as he heard the growl of the surf grow louder it would be remarkably unpleasant to find themselves cut off from the dinghy and there were several gutters to be crossed with the tide steadily running up andrew seemed to realize this for he went on a quick trot the water pumping into his seaboots it was easier to make progress with the gale behind them and whitney felt relieved when they passed the wreck at some distance andrew was heading straight across the sands though whitney could not tell what he was steering by after a time they came to a stretch of water that widened as they splashed through but when they had floundered across the soft sand at its edge and reached a higher level they were comparatively safe breathing hard they made their way across firmer ground and whitney was conscious of keen satisfaction when he saw the dinghy lying a few yards from the glistening water  when they had launched her the wind blew them towards the rowan and they were soon on board she was riding easier and would continue to do so for a while  have you decided whether its possible to wade out to the wreck whitney asked as they took off their wet oilskins  i think it is said andrew there was about three feet of water in the gutter that turned us back but the tides are low now and dont run out very far as they get higher the gutter would dry toward the last of the ebb  the last of the ebb on a big tide would be between five and seven oclock and it would be dark then night and morning whitney remarked this means that supposing there was a wireless installation it could be used only at fixed intervals roughly speaking it wouldnt be available one week out of two  yes said andrew it rather upsets the supposition but we may find out something more     chapter xiv  a fair ally   it was bright afternoon and elsie sat beside a teatable on the lawn at appleyard with williamson standing beside her the days were getting short but the screen of stiff silverfirs kept off the light wind and strong sunshine warmed the air it was what the scot calls a pet day one borrowed from a finer season and to be made the most of when winter was close at hand madge whitney lay in a canvas lounge nearer the shelter of the trees talking to andrew and several young men and women stood about the tennis net across the lawn they seemed to be engaged in a goodhumored dispute and their laughter followed a remark of dicks  williamson glanced at his companion and saw that her eyes were fixed upon the boy they were grave and her expression was preoccupied but he did not see the softness he had expected indeed her interest in dick was puzzling because he did not think it was altogether accounted for by the hints staffer had given him and this was a point upon which he wished to be enlightened williamson knew something about women but for the most part they were not women of very high character with these he was not a favorite although he was a clever talker and his manners were good  you do play tennis sometimes elsie said after a silence  williamson smiled her meaning was obvious  oh yes but one feels lazy now and then and i imagined you let me stay because you wanted to talk to me was i wrong  no answered elsie and he noted her unmoved calm  she was young but he had not expected shy hesitation or forced boldness from her he was however surprised when she said nothing for the next minute for he had usually found that an inexperienced antagonist shirks the strain of silence then he indicated dick who had just returned a difficult ball  he plays a good game  dick does a number of things pretty well although theres none at which he really excels i dont know which is the more useful  you like a man to have some salient point of skill or character that those who know him can rely upon  he noticed her glance wander and did not know that she was half instinctively looking for andrew but it rested again on dick brooding but calm williamson saw that she felt no keen animosity against himself she knew or suspected that they were in some respects opponents but this did not make her vindictive she would take the course she had determined on without hating him this indicated strength of character but it was too detached an attitude for a young girl fighting for her lover  dick looks better than he did he remarked to give her an opening  yes said elsie fixing her eyes quietly on his face very much better than he did when he came home from town  williamson admired her courage  for which you held me to blame he said  partly to blame  well i see youre trying to be fair though im half afraid you failed but since you meant to raise this point i must warn you against looking at things out of their right perspective it makes those in the foreground appear too big  you mean one should not exaggerate their relative importance  exactly you must for example allow for the exhilarating effect a change of air has on a young man fresh from the country who spends a few days in town remember that dick leads a very quiet and monotonous life at appleyard  a sober life is much the best for him  williamson wondered whether she spoke with naïve girlish prudery if not there was something he ought to know  perhaps its best for everybody but we dont all like it and a change is bracing he answered with a smile i suppose you are looking at the thing from the moral standpoint  not exclusively dick will soon be master at appleyard and that will bring him duties he ought to be fitting himself for then you may not know that he is not very strong  i guessed something of the kind but a few late nights and a little excitement cant do much harm  elsie looked at him with thoughtful eyes  possibly not in most cases but they are bad for dick  if you would be quite frank it would help williamson was anxious to learn why quietness was necessary for the lad we might get on better if we understood each other  have i not been frank you could hardly have expected me to say as much as i have even but i am not dicks doctor  williamson felt baffled but he would not show it  you feel that i ought to have looked after dick better i think thats hardly just because i have of course no control over him  you are an older man and he is easily led a hint would have gone a long way and he doesnt resent goodhumored firmness from those he likes  you suggest that he likes me  one cant tell said elsie in a quiet voice  well you must see how awkwardly im placed i cant defend myself without attacking dick and you wouldnt like that suppose i hinted that he insisted on following his bent although i tried to restrain him  did you  williamson hesitated which was an unusual thing he had no sentimental respect for girlish inexperience but he could not make the direct statement that would have cleared him he reflected with a touch of ironical amusement that elsie would not be deceived  it was really difficult to interfere but i did try a tactful hint he said with an indulgent air perhaps the way you regard the thing is natural and deserves some sympathy but i must say i feel a little hurt it looks as if you thought i had some object in encouraging dick to be extravagant and rash  no i cant see what you would gain elsie replied thoughtfully  well thats some relief but what do you want now a promise that at the risk of offending him ill be very firm in future  elsie was silent for a moment and then looked at him calmly  i dont think i will ask you for this she said  she rose and williamson turned away feeling somewhat annoyed with himself elsie had not asked for his promise because she thought it would not be kept he had failed to convince her and her opposition must be reckoned with then what she had said about excitement being bad for dick had roused his keen curiosity the girl was inexperienced and had used no artifice but he did not think she could have played her part better staffer apparently believed that she and andrew johnstone were not important but williamson thought him mistaken while he crossed the lawn madge whitney watched him with a smile  that man she remarked to andrew has just got a set down but i imagine elsie has been wasting her time  it looks as if you knew what they had been talking about andrew replied  madges eyes twinkled  why of course i do you must remember that ive been here a week noticing things elsie doesnt like the man and the only reason she could have for talking to him confidentially is that she wanted to warn him to keep his hands off dick but i dont think he will  ah andrew said sharply its curious that you  shall i finish what you meant to say its curious that although i havent had much opportunity for seeing what is going on i should agree with the conclusion you have come to after mature deliberation well if youre afraid of complimenting me on my cleverness you can account for it by remembering that im an american of course this doesnt make me anything the less of an outsider  i didnt mean that you were an outsider  perhaps you didnt it was your scottish reserve that made you hate to talk about your family affairs but jim who counts you as his partner has told me something then i dont mind telling you that i like you and admire what you are trying to do however well keep to the point williamson is leading your cousin into extravagance with some object  i believe thats true andrew agreed quietly after all you were right to some extent about my reserve but now if you can help me ill be very glad it isnt an easy job i have undertaken  very well ill begin by telling you something the evening williamson arrived i was coming down to dinner before the resti afterward found my watch was fast when i got to the gallery at the top of the stairs i stopped its rather dark where you come out of the passage you know dick was standing by the fire in the hall and his manner indicated that he was waiting for somebody as i hesitated williamson came out of the opposite passage and went downstairs but his quick glance around showed he wanted to be sure there was nobody but dick about i saw dicks face and it was eager williamson gave him two or three bits of paper that looked like banknotes  if dick had given them to williamson i could have understood it better andrew interrupted  yes the explanation would then have been obvious but what i saw suggests something graver dick went away looking relieved but williamson moved toward the stairs and then turned back and a few moments afterward staffer came in he said so you have seen him  andrew made an abrupt movement but said nothing  i suppose you see the significance of this madge said  it was plain to andrew that staffer had known and no doubt approved of the transaction between williamson and dick  yes and i feel disturbed about it  well continued madge i went back quietly and didnt come down for some time but i watched the three men at dinner williamson spoke to dick as if he had not seen him since he came and dick said he was sorry he wasnt able to meet him at the station in fact they rather overdid it and staffer seemed to think so because he stopped them then perhaps because he felt relieved dick  drank more than usual andrew suggested grimly when she hesitated i noticed that well since you have seen so much im glad to have you on my side particularly if you can tell me what i ought to do ill admit that i dont know  i think you should watch and do what seems plainly needful but nothing more dont try to make clever plans but take mackellar into your confidence  you havent met him andrew said in surprise  jim has and i know what he thinks of him  andrew took her advice and soon afterward left appleyard in the sidecar whitney let the highpowered bicycle go when they turned into the main western road which runs straight and level along the solway and they reached dumfries in an hour mackellar had not left his office and in five minutes andrew had made the situation plain mackellar pondered it silently for a time and then looked up  weel he said it gets interesting and i must set to work ill let ye know when i have anything to report  andrew knowing his man was satisfied with this he and whitney drove home at full speed and arrived before their absence had been noticed williamson left the next morning and madge whitney a few days afterward and nothing of importance happened during the following week but mackellar had in the meantime been carrying out a plan that was to have some influence upon williamsons affairs     chapter xv  a bargain   there was no sunday delivery of letters and one monday morning williamson sat rather anxiously watching the road outside a small country house beside the tweed one of the tall gateposts at the end of the drive had sunk to a slant and the gravel had not been rolled or raked for some time the borders round the lawn hinted at economy in bedding out and gardeners hire and the old house had a dilapidated look these things were significant and explained why williamson had been received there as a paying guest with the privilege of some rough shooting and salmonfishing  he could have found cheaper quarters but the place suited him for one thing his residence there gave him a certain standing in the country and his host a decayed scottish gentleman was getting old and left him alone he could go and come as he liked without exciting remark and the people he met were well bred and not imaginative since he had been received by his host they took it for granted that he was a man one could be friendly with  the postman at last dismounted from his bicycle at the gate it is customary in that neighborhood to meet the post but williamson sat still as if he did not expect any letters the man gave him three before he went on to the house and williamson put them down and carelessly lighted his pipe he had learned to exercise caution in such details though he felt disturbed as he recognized the writing  the first curtly reminded him that payment for the hire of a motor car was two months overdue the second enclosed a statement of a fashionable tailors account which included an expensive fur coat but there was no difference in the hand williamson knew it well indeed he had two or three similar demands in his pocket each ended with an intimation that unless payment were made within a specified time proceedings would be taken to enforce it  williamson put down the notes and vacantly looked about not far away the tweed sparkling in the sunshine ran through a wooded hollow where beeches gleamed ruddybrown among somber firs two men with guns upon their shoulders were crossing the steep stubble that glittered with melting hoar frost on the breast of a neighboring hill and a keeper with a couple of setters stood at the gate williamson was to have gone shooting with his host but now he must excuse himself for he had something of importance to think about  his expenses were heavy for it was important that he should pass for a sporting man of means and he was a good shot and skilful with the salmon rod as a rule he had money enough for his needs but his supplies had been irregular since the war began and as he had luxurious tastes his debts had mounted up of late his creditors had grown impatient but it was curious they should all have asked the same lawyer to enforce their claims this could not have happened by coincidence it looked as if somebody who must have taken a good deal of trouble to investigate his affairs meant to put some pressure on him this was alarming for several reasons and as he could not pay his debts in the time allowed he determined to call upon the lawyer and see what he could find out  there was however another matter that demanded attention and as he took up a letter with the newcastle postmark the tweed drew his eyes again it reminded him of a wider river with older associations a river where terraced vineyards rose steeply from the waterside instead of the rounded scottish hills and barges slowly floating past ancient towns his expression changed and grew resolute as he thought of it  opening the envelope he found as he expected a short note folded round a letter the note said that he would no doubt like to hear how jack was getting on in holland and ended with a few references to mutual acquaintances the letter was of some length and narrated in gossiping style its writers business journey to several dutch towns williamson however knew that there was more in it than met the eye and he went to excuse himself from joining the shooting party after this he spent some time studying the letter in his room and when he had burned it he went at once to the station  leaving the train at an old country town he called at the lawyers office and was received by a suave elderly gentleman  it was my unpleasant duty to send you these notices the lawyer said with an apologetic air i appreciate your prompt response and expect the little matter will now be put right you must admit that the creditors have exercised some patience  but dont mean to do so any longer eh that is really what i came to see about  of course you understand that the war has made money tight my clients inform me that they find themselves compelled to press for outstanding accounts and to take a course that in a happier state of things they would not employ  then i am to understand that these notices will be acted upon  i think you can take that for granted the lawyer answered in a deprecatory tone however there is a way in which you can obviate all trouble to yourself and mei mean by paying what is due at once  williamson looked at him with a grim smile  it sounds simple but there are difficulties now i can pay these bills but not in the time mentioned have you power to extend it  no but if you will make me an offer i will consult my clients  that would cause some delay as i want the matter settled i would prefer to call upon the man who has brought it to a head will you tell me his name  williamson had hoped to catch the lawyer off his guard but his amused expression showed him that he had failed  there are several names you know the people  of course but suppose you admit that i have some intelligence and try to look at the matter from my point of view  it would be difficult for the want of practise the lawyer answered dryly i have no debts  still if you had several creditors who lived in different places and simultaneously put their claims into the hands of one particular lawyer what would you think  it might be accounted for very simply i believe i am known as a businesslike trustworthy man  i dont doubt it but i suspect another explanation there is somebody behind these people who has persuaded them to stop my credit or has bought up the debts he must have a reason for this and if i could talk it over privately with him it would simplify things  im not so sure that follows said the lawyer all i can tell you is that the bills have been sent to me for collection and unless they are met i shall reluctantly be forced to  just so williamson interrupted at present i cannot say whether they will be met or not im afraid we must leave it at that and now good day  a clerk politely showed him out and he reached the station in time to catch an edinburgh train there was no one else in the compartment he entered and he sat in a corner thinking hard though he had not learned much he felt that he was right in his surmise some one was trying to put pressure on him through his creditors his first guess at his unknown antagonists object caused him serious alarm but after some reflection he dismissed it with relief as improbable and sought for another explanation  to begin with he must first discover the identity of his enemy his suspicions centered on appleyard andrew johnstone was certainly hostile on his cousins account and it was possible that he had been helped by mackellar whom williamson had met at appleyard he determined to see mackellar but he could not do so until next day for a more important matter demanded attention first  getting out at the waverley station he took a cable tram and leaving it on the outskirts of the city walked on to leith here at dusk he met a man dressed like a sailor and spent an hour with him in the back room of a public house when they came out the sailor disappeared in the darkness and williamson returned to edinburgh where he dined and slept at a fashionable hotel the next morning he went to glasgow and left it shortly after his arrival by a train which took him to dumfries it was not without a reason he had traveled by three different railways williamson generally tried to cover his tracks  after lunch at the station hotel he walked down the narrow high street and stopped at a garage to order a motorcycle to be ready in half an hour then by an indirect route he went to mackellars offices  as it happened mackellar was then talking to andrew and whitney in his private room and he smiled as he showed them williamsons card  maybe ye had better ask mr davies to let ye out by the back he said if ye call again in half an hour i may have some news  i wonder how williamson got here andrew said when they reached the street theres no train that connects with the north british  came in a car perhaps whitney suggested somehow id like to know lets try our garage everybody puts up there  they went to the garage and whitney began to make an unnecessary adjustment to the engine of his sidecar  i suppose mr williamson comes here when hes in town he said to a man at work near by  yes the man answered hes in town the noo  did mr staffer bring him in his car  shes no in the yard and mr williamsons for castle douglas the man indicated the motorcycle on which he was working im tightening her up for the run no that she needs it much mr williamson kens a good machine and always asks for her  is there anything doing at castle douglas today  no that ive heard of hes for the moors im thinking theres a guncase to be strapped on the carrier but if yere wanting to see him ye must leave word at the office ill be away at another job before he comes in  it doesnt matter we may meet him whitney answered carelessly and he and andrew strolled away  well he said we have learned something it seems williamsons in the habit of hiring a motorcycle here has he any friends in galloway who might give him some shooting  none that i know of andrew replied with a puzzled look  i guess you noted that he makes a curious choice of a machine shes goodi know that makebut i cant see why he picks a singlecylinder lightweight when theyve several fullpowered machines on the stand looks as if he expected hed have to wheel her whats the castle douglas road like  its the highway to the west and we keep our main roads in good order  you certainly do whitney agreed but i stick to my opinion that he has some particular reason for choosing a light machine he hesitated a moment i dont want to butt in and as the fellows a family friend its delicate ground but if you feel youd like a run through galloway  perhaps wed better go but well see first what mackellar has to say  they walked down to the bridge foot to pass the time and in the meanwhile mackellar received williamson  you wished to see me he said  williamson took out the bills and the lawyers letters and put them on mackellars desk  i wonder whether you know anything about these  i know the gentleman who seems to have charge of the matter why do you ask  because i prefer to deal with the principal instead of an agent it saves time and one arrives at an understanding easier  in this case theres no great difficulty ye have only to pay the bills  precisely agreed williamson they can be paidthats worth notingbut not just yet  mackellar understood this as a hint that the power williamsons debts gave his antagonist was only temporary  in the meantime ye might be put to some inconvenience he replied one cannot proceed against a man for debt without publicity which is apt to be damaging and unpleasant to his friends  exactly that is what i want to avoid  and yet ye cannot pay the bills weel ye are doubtless aware that one gets nothing for nothing and since ye must ask for some delay what could ye offer by way of consideration  to begin with i should like to hear what the principal the man who stands behind my creditors wants williamson paused and added meaningly i think you know  mackellar was silent for a few moments  ill no deny it he then said would ye be willing to produce the notes of hand and the longdate bills dick johnstone has given ye and cancel them on payment of the money lent with current interest up to date if ye insist we might allow a little more interest because ye took some risk  id be willing to give up one or two williamson answered with some hesitation  but no the rest which are no in your hands  i suppose i must admit that but what did you mean by saying i took a risk  well talk of that again are ye willing to give your word that yell lend mr johnstone no more money make no fresh bet with him and no help him to negotiate a loan  is that all williamson asked with a touch of sarcasm  i think the matter could be arranged on the terms i have laid down  on the whole williamson was conscious of relief to do as mackellar asked would place him in an embarrassing position but he had been afraid of something much worse  it needs thought he said  then i will give ye five minutes but it may help ye to decide if i explain why ye took a risk yere maybe aware that theres legislation about a minors debts  dick johnstone would not make that excuse for disowning his obligations  im no sure ye would have to deal with him said mackellar meaningly dick has no doubt been borrowing money on promises to pay when appleyard is his weel its no certain that hell live until he gets possession  nor may the lenders for that matter  verra true mackellar agreed for a that the chances against dicks reaching twentyone are greater than usual it seems ye do not know that two doctors would not pass him for the army  on what grounds williamson asked with some sharpness  a weak heart that might stop the first time he was overexcited or overexerted himself  williamson was silent for some moments he knew dick was not strong but staffer who must have known the truth had not told him how grave the danger was  still suppose the worst happened the new owner would not repudiate his kinsmans debts  who do ye take the heir to be  staffer  mackellar looked at him with dry amusement  did he tell ye so  no williamson said thoughtfully i cant remember that he ever did say that exactly but i was led to understand from the beginning that  appleyard would be his weel perhaps i may tell ye something about the familys affairs dicks father left the house and land to the lad with a reversion to the next o kin in case he died before inheriting mistress johnstone got a separate portion and power to manage the estate for her sons benefit until he came of age subject to the approval of the executors she could appoint a guardian for the lad to superintend his education but she could not alienate a yard of land it was not a will that i approved of but mr johnstone was very ill when he made it and did not listen to my objections maybe he hardly expected his widow to marry again mr staffer who acted as steward for his wife now acts for dick but there his interest ends  then in the event of dicks death who gets the estate  andrew johnstone  williamson got a double shock staffer whom he had regarded as the next heir had not been straight with him and he knew that andrew would be difficult to deal with besides if dick did reach twentyone staffers influence would cease mackellar was right a serious risk attended the discounting of bills by which dick raised money for gambling and similar extravagances since staffer had played him a shabby trick in leaving him in ignorance williamson need not consider him and could look after his own interests  very well he said im ready to give you the promise you want if we can come to terms  then ill pay off any notes of dicks that ye may bring me with interest at two per cent above the bank rate if this will not enable ye to satisfy your creditors ill engage that they will give ye another six months  its enough said williamson but of course you see that when i have satisfied them your hold on me has gone  mackellar smiled  verra true but i believe ive shown ye that it would be wiser to leave dick alone im thinking ye have sense enough to take a hint and keep your word  youll find that i mean to do so williamson replied  soon after he went out andrew and whitney returned mackellar told them what williamson had promised and added  the man might have been dangerous but we need not fear any further trouble from him there are two points worth noting though i cannot tell whether they concern us or not hes anxious to avoid anything that might damage his credit and make him leave this part of the country and he expects some money before long can ye account for this  they discussed the matter for a few minutes and then andrew and whitney hurried back to the garage  our man must be some distance ahead whitney said we may even lose him     chapter xvi  trailing the motorcycle   for a few minutes whitneys machine turned in and out of narrow streets between rows of tall old houses and then went cautiously down the dip to the nith there was some traffic on the bridge and when they had crossed carts encumbered the road on the galloway side whitney fumed at the delay but he opened out his engine as they entered a stretch of open road and the wind began to fan andrews face  for a mile in front of them the riverplain ran level the stubble shining yellow among squares of pasture and the dark green of turnipfields then a ridge of hills rose steeply across their way the sun that flooded the valley with mellow light was getting low and while the trees upon the summit of the ridge stood out sharply distinct the wooded slopes were steeped in soft blue shadow  looks like a climb whitney remarked i suppose we go right up there  maxwellton braes said andrew i expect you have heard of then its an easy gradient up a long glen  then sit tight and well rush her up on the top gear  the dust whirled behind them and the cropped hedgerows spun past they swung giddily round a curve at a bridge and the throb of the engine grew louder as they breasted the hill dark firs streamed down to meet them here and there a leafless birch and an oak that gleamed like burnished copper swept by there was a tinkle of running water in the wood and now that they were out of the sunshine the air felt keen ahead the ascending road unrolled like a white riband through faint shifting lights and lilac shadow  soon the glen ran out into a wide hollow that led westward across a tableland low green hills with gently rounded tops shut off the rugged moors beyond the shallow vale was cultivated and tame but the road was good and andrew felt the thrill of speed long fields and stone dykes swept behind into the trail of dust the sun sank toward a bank of slatecolored cloud its rays raked the valley throwing the black shadows of the scattered ashtrees far across the fields  andrew kept his eyes fixed steadily upon the road this ran for the most part straight and level but though they were traveling very fast there was no speeding streak of dust ahead  after a time a long white village rose from the rolling pasture and when they ran in among the low houses whitney pulled up there was a smiths shop by the roadside and a man stood outside holding a cartwheel while another moved a glowing iron hoop amid the flame of a circular fire  you have been watching that tire heat for a while i guess said whitney  lang enough the other answered shes no stretching weel  then have you seen a small black motorcycle pass  no there was a big gray yin an anither with a sidecar  how long have you been outside  maybe twenty minutes maybe a few mair  thanks said whitney and started the motorcycle  its curious hes traveling light but i dont think a singlecylinder engine could beat the machine im driving by a quarter of an hour anyhow ill try to speed her up  the sunlight faded off the grass as they raced away the slaty clouds rolled higher up the sky and the wind that whipped their faces bit keen andrew was swung to and fro in the rocking car and sometimes felt uneasy when his comrade dashed furiously round the bends but for most of the way the road ran straight and they could see nothing on the long white streak ahead after a time they came to a narrow loch ruffled by the wind that lay in a lonely grassy waste and as they ran past the thin wood on its edge andrew asked whitney to stop  a motor scout he said indicating a man in uniform who rode leisurely toward them on a bicycle  the scout dismounted when they called to him and said he had left castle douglas an hour before and had kept to the main road but had not seen a singlecylinder motorcycle they let him go and whitney lighted a cigarette  now he said we have to think our man pulled out for castle douglas but hasnt gone there my notion is that he didnt mean to wheres he likely to have headed  its hard to tell a road runs northwest to new galloway but i cant see what would take him there its a small place on the edge of the moors  and right away from the eskdale road whitney ejaculated looking hard at him  well said andrew quietly ill admit i thought of that  as a matter of fact youve been thinking of something like it for quite a time  andrew was silent for a moment or two  there was a chance of my being mistaken he said slowly however i now feel that its my duty to get upon the fellows track if i can  would you rather i dropped out  andrew knew that the suggestion was prompted by delicacy but he made a negative sign  after all you know something and may as well know the restif there is anything more to learn besides youre quicker than i am in several ways and i might want you  when you do youll find me ready whitney answered but well get back to business which way do you suppose hes gone  on the whole i think south toward dalbeattie its nearer the solway as it might be better to follow the road hed take well have to run back nearly to dumfries  thats all right said whitney get in she seems to be feeling particularly good today and im going to let her hum  they raced back eastward while the distant hills turned gray in front of them then they turned sharply to the south and soon the road skirted a railway line whitney got down when they reached a station  have you seen a small black motorcycle he asked a lounging porter  yes i mind her because i thought she was running verra hard for a wee machine if yon mans a friend o yours yell no catch him easy  when did he pass  it would be about five minutes after the stranraer goods cam through and thats an hour ago  whitney ran back to his machine and jumped into the saddle  were on his trail but he must have come straight and fast from dumfries well well get after him  the car leaped forward as the clutch took hold dykes and trees swept down the road and criffells bold ridge rose higher against the eastern sky here and there a loch gleamed palely in the desolate tableland and in the distance a river caught the fading light but the cloudbank was spreading fast and the west getting dim at last they saw from the top of a rise a gray haze stretched across a hollow and andrew told his comrade that it was the smoke of dalbeattie then a man with a spade and barrow came into view on the slope of another hill and andrew asked whitney to stop the man was cutting back the grass edges on the roadside he had not seen a bicycle of the kind they described  how long have you been here andrew asked  since seven oclock this morning  whitney started the car slowly and pulled up when the roadmender was hidden behind the hill  we want to talk this over he said williamson left the road between the station and where we met the man we know he hasnt gone west or farther south what about the east  andrew glanced at criffell which rose between them and the sea its summit cut sharply against the sky but its slopes were blurred and gray and the stone dykes that ran toward its foot had lost their continuity of outline two or three miles away to the southeast the mountain ran down in a long ridge  its obvious that he hasnt gone over the top he could cross the shoulder yonder but hed have some trouble  hed have to leave the motorcycle  thats so said andrew thoughtfully theres an old road between here and the station and he might reach the moors by what we call a loaninga green track that sometimes leads to a farm or cothouse and sometimes ends in a bog of course if he found one and crossed the hill on foot hed cut the main road from dumfries round the coast before he reached the solway beach  youre taking it for granted that hed try to make the beachwhich means the wreck  yes said andrew quietly i believe its what hed do  well there are two things to note he could have gone straight from dumfries by a good road on the other side of the mountain but he preferred this way and a rough climb across then he started for castle douglas when he might as well have told the garage people he was going to dalbeattie this implies that hed a pretty good reason for covering his trail whitney paused and looked hard at andrew before we go any farther you have to decide whether you really want to find out that reason you can quit the business now but you may not be able to do so afterward  id rather stop but i must go on said andrew grimly  very well well try to follow him  they drove back passing the roadmender who leaned upon his spade looking after them and a little while later whitney pulled up at a broken gate that hung open a rough track grown with grass led away from it between loose stone walls  not intended for automobiles whitney remarked as he cautiously steered between the ruts williamson must have found it easier than we do  andrew nodded his comrades eyes were keen for only a crushed tuft of grass here and there suggested the track of a bicycle tire farther along they stopped at a gate where the loaning forked one branch ran on the other turned off and in the distance a lonely white house showed amidst a clump of bare windbent trees  he would not have gone to the farm said whitney jump down and open the gate  they went on again carefully but after a time the loaning got very rough and rushes grew across it where the ground was soft after narrowly escaping an upset into the ditch on one side whitney stopped  i guess this is as far as shell take us and i see a peatstack where we could leave her  lifting down a small fir that closed a gap in the wall they pushed the motorcycle across a strip of heath and against a pile of turf and then they stopped to look about  the light was rapidly going and the wind was falling in front lay a stretch of moor seamed by black peathags in some of which water glistened beyond the moor rough heathercovered slopes ran up to the black hillcrest a curlew whistled overhead and the sharp cry of a grouse rose from the darkening heath except for this it was very still and the landscape looked strangely desolate not far ahead a patch of roof showed faintly among some stunted ashtrees  a cothouse said andrew in surprise  well look at it whitney answered and started for the building  one end had fallen down but half the thatch remained upon the bending rafters the rest had gone and it was plain that the cot had been abandoned for a long time crossing a ditch by a rotten plank they stood kneedeep among withered nettles at the door and the ruined walls struck a mournful note in the gathering dark  theres a track here said whitney i guess the sheep go in  he struck a match as they entered and avoiding stones and fallen beams they made for the door of an inner room when they reached it whitney struck another match and smiled as he held it up for the light fell upon a singlecylinder motorcycle with a guncase strapped to the carrier  well he said i expected this if we cross the end of the hill going southeast we would strike the sands somewhere abreast of the wreck  yes  hows the tide  highwaters about one oclock that means its a big tide and of course runs out a long way on the ebb  then the sands will be dry and therell be no gutters to cross well i guess its a long walk but weve got to make it take your overalls off  three or four minutes later they left the cothouse and struck across the heath there was no track but andrew headed for a knoll on the mountains sloping shoulder after they left the level the heather grew tall and strong brushing about their knees and entangling their feet then there were awkward rabbitholes and granite boulders scattered about and they bruised their shins as they laboriously plodded upward the light had almost gone and there was nothing visible but the stretch of shadowy hillside in front  whitney heard andrew breathing hard and imagined that his injured leg was giving him trouble  are we rushing it too much he asked  i can hold out until we get to the top and ill be all right then its gripping the brae with the side of my foot that bothers me  he went on without slackening speed and the slope grew easier and the light breeze keener then the stretch of heather which had shut off their view suddenly fell away and they looked down through the soft darkness on to a vast black plain there was nothing to distinguish land from sea but a faint cluster of lights that pricked the gloom like pinpoints marked the englishshore and farther off the flickering glare of blastfurnaces was reflected in the sky in the middle distance a twinkle showed where the solway lightship guarded the fairway through the shoals but there was no light near them nor any sound except the distant murmur of the sea they stood remote from the homes of men in the mountain solitude  andrew stooping behind a mass of granite struck a match and took out his watch  we havent much time to spare i wish i knew if the lightship yonder was still riding to the ebb he said theres a burn somewhere below us and running water is generally a good guide down  they went on floundering through tangled heather and falling into rabbitburrows until the tinkle of water reached them softly after that they wound downhill beside the growing burn past brakes of thorn and hazel and over banks of stones until a long wood led them to the road following the wood for a time they went down again through smooth pasture and turnipfields and came to a wall that ran along the beach the empty space beyond it looked black and lonely and the mournful crying of wildfowl came out of the gloom but at some distance a beam from a lighthouse cast its reflection upon the sloppy sand  can you hit the wreck from here whitney asked  ill try said andrew its a long way and the tide must be on the turn  they took off their boots and as they launched out across the dark level the sand felt sharply cold here and there they splashed through pools but for the most part the bank was ribbed with hard ridges the shore soon vanished criffells black bulk grew blurred and shapeless against the sky and they had only the misty beam from the lighthouse for guide whitney however imagined that andrew was going straight which was comforting when they came to a wide depression where water glimmered he thought this was the channel that had stopped them before and he felt somewhat uneasy as he waded in there was now no boat they could retreat to on the other side of the wreck  the water however hardly covered their ankles and some time afterward andrew touched whitneys arm as a dim formless mass rose from the sand it got plainer as they cautiously approached it their bare feet falling noiselessly and in a minute or two they stopped and listened beside the wreck there was no sound but the drip of water and andrew grasping a broken beam swung himself up whitney followed his nerves tense his muscles braced and he held his breath when he dropped into the forecastle the next moment a pale light sprang up and he saw andrew holding out a match the feeble glow spread along the wet planks and filled the forecastle before the match went out and whitney was more relieved than disappointed to see that nobody else was there  we have missed him he said take my box theyre wax and burn better than the wooden kind  andrew struck another light and it burned clearer the candle they had used and replaced on the last visit had gone but two or three matches floated in a pool he picked them up and whitney examined them closely  these are quite fresh he said looks as if theyd just been struck though we cant be sure of that extra thick wax same make as mine i got the best i could because i wanted them to light the bicycle lamp  then the match burned low and andrew threw it down  it proves nothing except that the man who used them wanted a good article the make is well known but in this part of the country you couldnt find it except at a tobacconists  thats a point anything is good enough for a fisherman or a sailor to get a light with the fellow who came here must have meant to have the best  after all the matches dont tell us who he is andrew said slowly  they dont but they may help us later and now well hustle for the beach it would be awkward if we found the tide running up the gutter  they set off across the sands and waded through the channel without trouble reaching land they put on their boots and laboriously struggled up the dark hill both were tired when they floundered down through the heather on the other side but they found the boggy heath and came at last to the cothouse as they expected the motorcycle was no longer there they trudged on to the peatstack and shortly afterward whitney started his machine and with some difficulty kept out of the ruts and ditches until he turned into the highroad     chapter xvii  the matchbox   the dead leaves were driving round appleyard before a boisterous wind that lashed the granite walls with bitter rain a fire had been lighted in the drawingroom and staffer sat talking to his sister mrs woodhouse was a quiet woman generally content to remain in the background and the influence she exercised at appleyard was as a rule negative she rarely claimed authority even over her daughter or openly interfered but the things she disapproved of were seldom done now her usually placid face was firm  the drawingroom door was open and she watched williamson who stood near elsie in the hall his pose was gracefully easy as he smiled at a remark of the girls he looked suave and wellbred but mrs woodhouses expression hardened  will that man be here long she asked when williamson and elsie moved away  staffer gave her a quick glance it was desirable that his relations with williamson should be cordial but of late his guest had shown some reserve it was so slight that staffer knowing of no cause for their disagreement felt it instinctively rather than noticed it by any particular sign for all that something had come between them and he wondered whether his sister was to blame for this  it looks as if you didnt wish him to stay he said  i dont his society is not good for dick  staffer smiled though he was puzzled on his last visit williamson had rather avoided dick  he cant do him much harm and after all it does not look as if dick would marry elsie as we once thought was possible  no elsie will not marry him and i would not wish it if she were willing  staffer was somewhat surprised  then why need you bother about him he said if he indulges in foolish extravagances its his affair  she looked at staffer with a listless expression  i dont think you would understand but i do not want him to come to harm  well theres something else to talk about it wont be long before dick is his own master and we must leave appleyard this will make a big difference because our means are small and elsie has been taught no profession what will she do then unless she marries somebody  i do not know mrs woodhouse answered in a placid tone  staffer mastered his impatience for his sister sometimes baffled him and there was a matter of importance about which he wished to sound her  im sorry you seem to have a prejudice against williamson is it only on dicks account  no i feel that he may bring trouble to us all we were happier before his visits began there is a difference now at appleyard and i dont like mystery why does he call himself williamson  ah you imagine it is not his name  i have known for some time that it is not  staffer felt disturbed his sister had been shrewder than he expected and he wondered whether anybody else shared her suspicions but her statement gave him the lead he wanted  well he said i dare say you can see that to use his proper name just now might make things unpleasant for him  he did not use it when he first came here and nobody would have minded it then  im not certain these scots are prejudiced against foreigners but its hard to see why you should dislike the man because he is one of us he paused and looked at her reproachfully have you forgotten the people you belong to gretchen and where you were born  mrs woodhouses face was troubled but there was a hint of firmness in her voice as she answered  i have not forgotten but when i married i knew i must choose between my country and my husbands one could not belong to both i chose his his people became mine he was a good mani think there are not many like himand i was happy when he died i tried to bring up his daughter as he would have her  you succeeded elsie is a scot staffer remarked with a sneer  something in her face warned him that his sister was not to be moved it was seldom she had shown him her deeper feelings but she had a mothers heart against which he could not prevail she might have made him a useful if not altogether conscious ally but that idea must be dropped he had been beaten by a fundamental quality in human nature and he was half afraid he had said too much  well he added ill be content if you treat williamson as you would any other guest you neednt go beyond this if youd rather not  she turned and gave him a steady glance  i wish you had nothing to do with him arnoldi feel hes dangerous but i will be polite to him so long as he does not harm dick  thats all i want said staffer turning away  he entered the billiardroom where the others had gathered elsie was knitting dick and andrew were playing and williamson stood looking on staffer thought this strange because andrew did not play well and williamson had generally engaged dick in a game for a stake  making stockings now staffer said to elsie whom is this lot for  the border regiment  the men whore lucky enough to get them ought to feel flattered williamson interposed  the brave soldiers are entitled to the best we can send them elsie said staunchly  williamson carelessly examined the work  this is very neat knittings an essentially scottish accomplishment its useful which no doubt appeals to a race of utilitarian character  thats why i like it elsie declared i am scottish in all my habits and feelings you know  whitney thought there was something defiant in her voice but he could not tell whether williamson noticed it  when the game was finished whitney took out a cigarette and walked to a matchholder which he knew was empty  will you give me a light he asked williamson  certainly said williamson producing a wellmade gunmetal case which he immediately returned to his pocket i think i used the last there but i have a box somewhere  he handed whitney an ordinary card box containing pine matches  thank you  as whitney returned the box he noticed that andrew was watching them then he glanced quickly at elsie but she was quietly knitting with her eyes on the stitches  a few minutes afterward a servant brought in the afternoon edition of a glasgow newspaper staffer glanced at the front page and then sat down near one of the lamps there was a certain deliberation in his movements that whitney noticed though he admitted that he might not have done so had not the matchbox incident roused him to suspicious vigilance he thought staffer was waiting for something and in a moment or two williamson left dick and turned toward him  then staffer folded back the newspaper  the a  p liner centaur has gone down in the north channel he announced calmly  whitney started dick abruptly put down his cue and andrews face grew hard  do you mean that she was blown up elsie asked with a note of horror in her voice  it looks so but theres not much news yet  staffer began to read        the captain of the clyde coaster gannet reports       that when he was off the skerries near dark one of the       big a  p liners passed him at some distance to the       north it was blowing fresh and hazy but when the       vessel was almost out of sight he noticed a dense       cloud of smoke he ran to the box on the bridgerail       where he kept his glasses but when he got them out       the liner had disappeared he steered for the spot       where he had last seen her but it was dark when he       reached it and after steaming about for some time       and seeing nothing but a quantity of wreckage he made       for rathlin and megaphoned the lighthousekeepers       before proceeding an unconfirmed report from larne       states that a fishing craft passed a steamers       lifeboat but lost her in the dark the centaur a       large and nearly new steamer left montreal with wheat       and a number of passengers eight days ago  nobody spoke for a minute after he put down the newspaper and whitney lighted a cigarette to cover his excitement the news was startling but he thought it did not take staffer or williamson by surprise there was something curious in their expression andrews face however had grown very stern and elsies was angrily flushed  this is not war but murder she exclaimed the men who blow up unarmed vessels ought to be severely punished  when you catch them staffer answered i expect that it will prove difficult and im afraid we must be prepared for some nasty knocks  its rather exasperating to be hit hard where you flatter yourself youre secure against attack williamson remarked the admiralty must have thought the north channel safe  it is except against treachery elsie declared dont you think so andrew  i do said andrew quietly its narrow and commanded by lighthouses and coastguard stations though perhaps in a way its narrowness is a danger but we must see that this kind of thing doesnt happen again  how would you try to prevent it staffer asked with a calmness that was somewhat overdone  whitney gave andrew a careless glance and was relieved to note that his grim look had vanished andrews views on this subject would be worth having but it was obvious that he did not mean to state them  im not a navy officer he answered and turned to elsie one feels that it wont bear talking about  yes she agreed with a flash in her eyes theres no use in giving way to rage when one is hurt the best one can do after a treacherous blow is to keep very quiet and wait until the time comes to strike back  theres a true scot laughed staffer youre a stubborn unemotional race i wouldnt like to fall into your hands if id wronged your friends  the scots are just they repay both injuries and favors  then by general consent they talked about something else and after a time the others went out and whitney and elsie were left alone he suspected that she had meant this to happen but he was surprised by her first question  have you a bad memory  i like to think that its as good as my neighbors  then its strange you lighted a cigarette with a match from your own box after asking mr williamson for his  well by jove whitney exclaimed do you think he noticed it  elsies eyes twinkled  no he had his back toward you when you began the next cigarette but why did you ask for a match when you had some  whitney looked at her frankly  id rather you didnt press me for an answer he said  why do you mean you wouldnt tell me  yes and i shouldnt like to refuse  elsie smiled  youre not a good plotter it was easy to catch you out  so it seems but if im not as smart as i ought to be i mean well  i dont doubt it and i have some reason for trusting you i think youre a good friend of dicks and andrews and their friends are mine  thank you but williamsons by way of being a friend of dicks  oh no he only pretends he is you must know this  suppose we admit it dont you think andrews able to take care of his cousin  im glad he has your help  perhaps its more important that he has yours were three to one and that ought to be enough  elsies face was calm but she was silent for a moment and whitney thought she was trying to hide some embarrassment  tell me she said was it on dicks account you asked williamson for a match  no that is not directly i cant tell you anything more but since we are friends can you arrange that there are no matches put beside the bedroom candles  the man is our guest elsie said with some hesitation still perhaps one mustnt be fastidious when  when theres a good deal at stakedicks welfare for one thing  very well elsie promised  an hour later the party broke up they used oillamps at appleyard and at night a row of candles in oldfashioned brass holders were placed upon a table on the bedroom landing as a rule a few matchboxes were put beside them but sometimes this was overlooked  williamson went upstairs first and stopped on reaching the table  matches run out here too he said to whitney who was close behind him shall i light your candle  whitneys hand moved toward his pocket but he remembered in time  thanks he answered carelessly perhaps you had better light the lot  williamson took out the gunmetal box and struck a small pine match  i filled it up again he remarked i always like to have matches handy in an oldfashioned house  its a good plan whitney agreed and went away with his candle  five minutes later he opened andrews door and found him standing by the window  come in im thinking about that canadian boat  so i expected whitney answered meaningly but well take the other matter first seems to me theyre connected  the matchbox matter i dont know whether it was a clever trick or not but id like to hear your views  well whitney laughed im not so smart as i thought elsie soon tripped me up  andrew frowned  then she saw you she understands  something i dont know how much but im free to admit that shes cleverer than either of us however one things obvious williamson took care to have a box that would hold a good many matches and keep them dry its curious that he didnt shake it before he said it was empty anyhow he overdid the thing if he had given me a thick wax match like those we found on board the wreck it wouldnt have proved much while his anxiety to show he used the small pine kind strikes me as significant  elsie must be kept out of all this andrew said firmly  then i guess youll have to keep her out im not up to miss woodhouses mark did you notice staffers attempt to learn if you knew much about the north channel  yes but well let that go for the present the a  p boat was mined or torpedoed what are we to do  whitney hesitated  to begin with he said you must make up your mind right now how far you are willing to go youre proud of being a johnstone and put the good name of the family pretty high  yes answered andrew slowly that is true these however are personal reasons and dont come first you can take it for granted that im ready to go as far as is needful for the good of my country regardless ofof any one at appleyard  then we must try to find rankine and tell him what we suspect  very well said andrew well sail on the ebb in the morning  whitney made a sign of agreement and went away andrew had not hesitated about his decision but whitney knew it had cost him something     chapter xviii  a conference at sea   north barrules blunt cone and the range of manx hills beyond it cut harshly blue against an angry blaze of saffron that had broken out when the rain stopped and was now beginning to fade the sun had sunk behind the island and the sky to the northwest was black as ink but the tall cliffs of the mull of galloway were traced across the stormcloud in a neutraltinted smear between them and the rowan stretched a belt of leadcolored sea which in the foreground rose in hollowfronted walls with livid white summits that overweighted them until they curled and broke in cataracts of foam  it was blowing hard and threatened to blow harder soon but andrews wet face was tranquil as he sat on the weather coaming braced against the strain of the helm whitney was in the cockpit where he could avoid the worst of the spray but he was cold and sore from twentyfour hours of savage lurching clouds of spray drove across the boat striking the canvas and blowing out to lee under the boom but some fell short and splashed upon whitneys lowered head the rowan beating to windward progressed in jerks and plunges nearly stopping with a shock now and then as her bows sank into a comber whitney thought she could not carry her shortened canvas long but their port was to windward and they could not ease her much if they wished to reach it  shes ramming them pretty badly he remarked as a white sea boiled across the deck i suppose youd find her hard to steer if i lowered the staysail  yes she makes my arms ache now still if it doesnt blow much worse in the next two hours well find smoother water to lee of the island something on the horizon caught andrews eye get me the glasses he added  whitney went below to look for them and lighted the cabin lamp the floor and beams were steeply inclined and he had to brace his feet against the centerboard trunk the narrow cabin throbbed with a muffled uproar and water trickled in there was a pool that splashed about where the floor boards met the locker the leather case of the glasses had swollen and he spent a minute or two in opening it though he made the best speed he could they had been searching for rankines vessel in weather that had tried their nerve and skill once or twice it had looked as if they must run for shelter but the breeze had moderated a trifle and andrew had held on now however he was making for ramsey to whitneys keen satisfaction  andrew wound the tillerline round one hand as he put the glasses to his eyes he saw what he had expected two slender spars and a funnel both sharply slanted that rose above the back of a distant sea then a patch of dark hull swung into sight and vanished again  the survey boat he said giving whitney the glasses she must be near the edge of king williams bank and well find an ugly sea running there youd better start the pump  it was hard work for when whitney unscrewed the plug on deck the sea poured down the pipe to meet the water he forced out and the boats wild plunges threw him against the coaming but he persevered as they were likely to find the sea worse she must be cleared of water before more came on board it was some time before the pump sucked and only froth came up then whitney precariously balanced himself on the cabintop with his hand upon the boom while he looked about  every now and then the straining stormjib plunged into a sea that curled in foam across the bows throwing showers of spray into the hollow of the staysail then the bowsprit swung high above the turmoil and the water blew away in streams from the canvas while a frothy cataract poured aft down the uplifted deck when he glanced to windward the spray lashed his face but he distinguished a rolling steamer some distance off there was no smoke about her funnel and after watching her for a few moments he did not think she moved  lying head to sea he said to andrew rankine might as well run into the harbor he wont do much sounding tonight  thats plain it doesnt look as if he thought sounding his most important job haul down the staysail  whitney scrambled forward and when he let go the halyard he dropped on hands and knees the straining sail would not run down the wire to which it was fastened and he must cross the narrow deck to free it he did not want to go for the rowan buried her bows as she plunged and the foam boiled over them a foot in depth but the whitening of the sea to windward showed that a savage squall was on its way he reached the inboard end of the bowsprit and held fast while a comber washed across the rail and then rising half upright he seized the line that hung from the head of the sail the loosened canvas thrashed him he was swung to and fro in danger of going overboard but he held on until the sail came down with a run and fell on to his knees  the plunges were not quite so vicious when he got back to the cockpit but the alteration in the sailspread made steering difficult and andrew strained against the pull of the tillerline as he drove her through the squall  in the meantime the rowan had drawn nearer to the steamer which now lay close ahead rolling until her deck sloped like a roof and then lurching back with her streaming side lifted high above the sea andrew went about and then ran close to leeward where they checked the rowan by hauling her jib aback a man in oilskins leaned out from the steamers bridge and the fading light touched his wet face  its rankine said andrew we must try to make him hear  the next moment a shout came down across the broken seas that rolled between the vessels  yacht ahoy what dyou want  to see you andrew answered throwing his voice to windward with all his force important  rankine steadied himself against the rail with his glasses at his eyes  the rowan mr johnstone could you jump on board our gig  cant leave the boat shouted andrew letting her forge ahead a few yards nearer  rankine made a sign of comprehension  very well follow us into shelter  andrew waved his arm and trimming the jib over drove the rowan ahead as he did so the steamers screw splashed round half out of water and she slowly turned toward the north  thats not the way to ramsey whitney grumbled  no said andrew i guess he has some reason for not going there he means to run in behind the mull though its farther off  whitney frowned as he glanced across the wild stretch of foaming water toward a twinkling stream of light he was numbed and wet it was now getting dark and the bitter wind seemed freshening to a gale but andrew meant to follow the steamer and there was nothing to be said the only comfort was that their change of course brought the wind farther aft and the rowan would sail fast  rankines crew hung out a stern light as their vessel left the yacht and whitney getting down in the cockpit tried to dodge the spray while she rolled and tumbled across the high beamsea he was sorry for andrew who must sit on the coaming amid the spray though he imagined that his comrade would be sufficiently occupied to make him careless of the wet and cold  as a matter of fact andrew mechanically avoided the rush of the foaming combers for he was thinking hard he shrank from the meeting he had sought because he knew he was badly equipped for the difficult part he must play he suspected williamson of practises which must at any cost be stopped since it was unthinkable that a traitor should make use of appleyard this was bad but it was worse to know that staffer was acting as williamsons confederate  the trouble was that if andrew exposed the men the innocent would suffer staffer was mrs woodhouses brother and andrew pitied the quiet woman then there was elsie whom staffer had certainly treated well she would be crushed by shame if she learned his share in the plot andrew knew her well enough to feel sure of this elsie was true as steel if he told her his suspicions she would urge him to do his duty still she would suffer and part of staffers punishment would fall on her it would not be forgotten that she was the niece of a foreign spy and her mother might be suspected of complicity  it was a painful situation for andrew gladly would have made any personal sacrifice that might save the girl a pang he must try to find a way of doing his duty without involving her in some way he must warn rankine and yet keep back part of what he knew this was a repugnant course and he frowned as he drove the dripping boat across the foaming sea  at times the steamers stern light almost faded out but it grew brighter again and andrew knew that rankine was waiting for him it was now blowing hard and the combers looked very steep and angry though he could no longer distinguish them until they broke close to the yacht he imagined that they were stirred up by a strong tide and several pinnacles of rock rose from deep water in the neighborhood he hoped rankine knew their position as he followed the steamers light  at last the sea got smoother and instead of breaking ran in a long disturbed swell the wind no longer hove the boat down with a steady pressure but lightened until she swung nearly upright and then fell upon her in furious squalls that sent her staggering along with her lee deck deep in the foam a lofty black ridge towered above her port side and andrew knew they were behind the mull of galloway the water however was too deep and the tide too strong for them to bring up there and he supposed rankine knew of a safe anchorage  after a time he heard a whistle and the light ahead stopped then there was a roar of running chain and as he luffed up a shout reached him  let go and give her plenty scope  the chain was nearly all out before andrew thought she had enough and while she rolled and tumbled on the swell a splash of oars came out of the dark then a white gig loomed up alongside and he and whitney jumped on board as the crew backed away they had to wait a minute or two close to the steamers side until a smooth undulation lapped the lurching hull when they seized the ladder and scrambled up  rankine took them into a small teakpaneled room with a brass stove in a corner it was remarkably neat though a cushioned locker a small table and two campchairs comprised the furniture nautical instruments occupied a rack and a large chart of the irish sea was spread upon the table rankine put a bottle of wine and some cigarettes on the chart and then hung up his wet oilskins  were safe here so long as the wind keeps to the west and i can give you a berth if your cabins wet he said  no thanks replied andrew its an exposed coast  he tasted the wine rankine poured out and lighted a cigarette whitney said nothing and there was silence for a time rankine waited with a polite smile  what are you doing near king williams bank andrew asked presently and the others knew that his question was more to the purpose than appeared  taking bearings and sounding until the sea got up ive made one or two interesting discoveries about that shoal  although he sympathized with andrew whitney felt amused for he saw that rankine would do nothing to help him  you gave us a long run andrew said we would have got better shelter in ramsey bay  thats true i preferred this place  andrew frowned at the chart as if he did not know how to go on and whitney came to his rescue  i guess it suits you better to keep away from port you dont want to be seen and talked about  rankine smiled  am i mistaken in suggesting that we dont make much progress now after meeting you at craigwhinnie and inviting you to come on board its a satisfaction to find you have taken me at my word but if you have any other reason for the visit im at your command i understood this was so  the matter is important and we want to feel were justified in talking about it whitney replied in fact if your works confined to surveying wed rather you regarded us as casual guests  then i think you can take it that my job doesnt end there im still a navy officer though im now assisting the trinity house  whitney laughed  well i guess thats as much as one could expect you to admit british official caution is a remarkable thing he turned to andrew youd better tell him what weve seen  andrew began with their adventures on the sands when the lamp went out and then mentioned the signal lights on barennan crag and what they had discovered on board the wreck he told the story well adding particulars that had escaped whitneys observation and rankine followed him closely on the chart  he looked up with frank appreciation when andrew had finished  i dont think ive ever heard as clear and concise a report before may i suggest that youre rather wasting your talents you ought to be in the navy  i had to leave the army andrew replied coloring but thats not what we have to talk about  no agreed rankine and was silent for a while  whitney watched him with tranquil interest the teakpaneled room was warm and bright and after long exposure to numbing cold it was soothing to feel himself getting warm and drowsy though the men still held his attention the navy officer was no doubt the cleverer of the two but whitney thought he recognized a strong similarity in their characters they were resolute quiet and capable and he felt sure of their honesty rankines face was now gravely thoughtful but andrews wore a troubled frown and whitney imagined he recognized that the difficult part of the interview had not yet been reached  what you have discovered seems to have one of two meanings rankine said it may indicate a signaling of military and political news which strictly speaking is not my business or it may have some bearing on the loss of the a  p liner and perhaps lead to similar attacks  which would be your business whitney drawled  i cant talk about that but mr johnstone did right in telling me rankine answered and turned to andrew have you told any one else  no there was a curious quietness in andrews voice which showed whitney that he had decided on his course  why not if my first surmise is correct its a matter for the military authorities  it seems to me the things not ripe i have nothing but vague suspicions to go upon  then you suspect somebody  yes  rankine looked at him in silence for a few moments  i suppose you mean to follow up the clue youve got he then asked  you may take that for granted andrew answered  and if you find your suspicions right  when im certain of that ill act but not before  well you no doubt recognize the responsibility youre taking there are people appointed to investigate these things who could act with greater skill and force  i see that andrew replied quietly and when i think the time has come ill go to them or you  but you mean to decide for yourself whether it has come or not  exactly i must decide  rankine looked hard at him knitting his brows  i cannot tell you what my orders are he said but you put me in an awkward position i may do wrong in not reporting our conversation  even if you did report it i should stick to the line ive taken if it led to my arrest that would of course prevent my watching the coastand i can do that as well as you  better for you wouldnt be suspected well as i see you must be indulged ill tell you how to find me when you have something more to say you must be careful to follow my instructions  then write them down  i think not im rather straining my authority in giving them to you at all and secrecy is important  whitney got up  perhaps i ought to remind you that im not a british subject he said  rankine smiled  since you are in mr johnstones confidence you may remain he wont mind my saying that so far as strictly nautical matters go hes well qualified to deal with them but there are touches about what he told me that seem to show he has had your help now you must exactly follow these directions  he told them how they could learn his movements and send him word  that is all he concluded if you think the weather permits it ill be glad to keep you on board over night  andrew opened the door and the bitter draught that swept in lifted the chart on the table and swirled about the room they heard the surf beat upon a rocky beach and the wind scream in the shrouds  no thanks he said its not a night to leave the boat  rankine went out with them and gave an order halfseen men ran aft and dropped into the dark from the vessels rail and presently the gig lay tossing abreast of the gangway whitney looked at the warm welllighted deckhouse with regret and then buttoning his oilskins followed andrew down into the boat     chapter xix  a warning   staffer and williamson sat in the library at appleyard it was getting late and the rest of the household were in bed williamson had gone to his room with the others but afterward had crept down again quietly he had arrived that evening but had found it difficult to get any private conversation with his host without making his wish to do so rather marked for he imagined that miss woodhouse was watching him and whitney was constantly about now however he had said all he thought needful and he wondered why staffer did not let him go  the library was spacious and was lighted only by a shaded lamp on a table near them the polished floor gleamed like ice in the illuminated circle but everything outside this was dim and staffers face was in the shadow the fire in the big hearth had sunk and a paleblue flame that gave no light played about the embers of the hardwood logs the room was very quiet and getting cold  youll be in town next week staffer said can you find a good excuse for taking dick a boxing or billiard match for example  i dont know of anything of the kind  then you surprise me you belong to one or two smart sporting clubs  sporting events are not popular just now  theres always something going on and if its semiprivate so much the better when one is as young as dick a little mystery is inciting and its flattering to feel oneself a privileged person  no doubt for all that i havent heard of any attractive fixture and if i invented one that didnt come off it would make the game obvious even to dick  i suppose this means you dont want to take him staffer suggested lets be frank  then you are anxious that he should go  for one thing it looks as if you had rather held dick off lately this is against our plans then if dicks away andrew and his american friend will leave it would be safer not to have them about  your last reasons good in fact its better than the other williamson said dryly im going to take no further part in exploiting dick  staffer frowned  that resolve will cost you something what has led you to make it  the thing is getting dangerous we cant afford to run an unnecessary risk you know  thats true but i dont see where the danger lies  williamson pondered he had acted as staffers tool in leading dick into extravagance but staffer had not been straight with him besides if he now explained that mackellar was suspicious it would look as if he had turned against his confederate and tried to make terms with the bank agent  dick has friends who would carefully investigate matters if he had to admit his debts and they might find out enough to cause us trouble then were engaged in another business of first importance that cant be neglected while we make plans for our private benefit if we fail the consequences would be unpleasantto say the least  staffer laughed williamson wished he could see his face for his amusement had a hint of a threat  remarkably unpleasant as it happens you havent met with much success of late another man whom i neednt mention brought off the last big stroke  it was not my fault things have been dead against me as you know  so it seems but our employers expect results not excuses staffer paused and resumed as you have been unlucky i thought you might find some advantage in helping me with dick  williamson saw that staffers remarks were connected he was being warned and asked to think over his refusal but he stood his ground  the advantage doesnt counterbalance the danger he said  well i suppose that is for you to decide perhaps you are wise in concentrating on your particular business our employers are liberal when theyre served well but not as a rule indulgent when a post is unsatisfactorily filled  williamson was silent for a moment staffer was in a sense his superior officer but for all that he was expected to use his judgment and he foresaw danger for both if he meddled with dick still staffer was powerful and had given him a significant hint  i dont think our employers have much to complain of williamson said and we must try to work together as far as possible  just so staffer answered getting up  they separated apparently on good terms but they were conscious of mutual distrust  the next morning whitney after trying to get into range of a flock of curlew feeding among the sands threw his gun upon his shoulder and set out for the rowan the sun was bright and the breeze fresh and after opening the skylights to ventilate the boat he went below to see if their blankets were damp while he was busy he heard a foot on deck and marshall the fisherman came down the ladder he visited the yacht now and then and whitney at once got out the whisky bottle  help yourself but youll excuse my not joining you he said its rather early in the morning and i reckon my nerves arent as good as yours  marshall poured out a liberal portion and regarded him with a twinkle  im thinking they canna be bad since yere shipmate with mr andrew hes no the man id sail with if i was fleyt o the sea  well he is pretty daring but hes cautious too and knows exactly what hes doing that makes a difference  ay agreed marshall andrew johnstones a byordinar good seaman but ye may run a risk ye canna see tiderips and sudden blows are bad but theyre no the only dangers  whitney lighted a cigarette it was plain that the old fellow had a warm liking for andrew and whitney imagined he meant to give him a hint of some kind  i wish youd tell me what you mean he said you want to remember that im an american and not used to dark remarks in fact its more or less my habit to say what i think  yell find it expensive whiles marshall rejoined with a chuckle onyway yere a friend o mr johnstones  i believe so its a sure thing that i like him  then hell maybe need ye its no an easy job he has yon two at appleyard are kittlecattle and would be better for watching  why dont you tell me what theyre after  for yea thing i dinna ken but im certain its naething good  whitney made a gesture of resignation  this is a pretty hard country for a stranger to get along in youre such a blamed cautious people that nobody can guess what you think why dont you give my partner or dick a hint if you believe theres something wrong  theres aye a rizzon marshall replied with a grin mr andrew mightna believe me and mr dick would let it oot to staffer its no wise to offend the gentry mair particularly your landlord when a salmon noo and then comes by accident into your flounder net or ye chance upon a hare sitting ower close in her form  but dick would not be hard on you and hell be your landlord soon  thats no what mr staffers thinking said marshall meaningly  whitney gave him a steady glance knitting his brows  my partner will get appleyard if dick dies  ay thats supposed to be the way o it but mr dick has debts that would have to be paid then mr staffers acting baillie for the estate and it wouldna suit him weel to see mr andrew get it  you mean hes a dangerous man  ye should ken im thinking yere intelligent and yere mr andrews friend  i suppose thats a compliment and i must try to deserve it whitney smiled  marshall poured out another drink and then went away leaving whitney in a thoughtful mood  the old fellows remarks were not clear but two points appeared he thought andrew was running some personal risk and that staffer might put an obstacle in the way of his inheriting appleyard it was difficult to see how staffer could do so even if he could take advantage of dicks extravagance in such a way as to give him a claim on the estate but suppose andrew did not live to demand his rights whitney remembered that his comrade had been in grave danger when the gray car swerved in the glen and again when the light went out on mersehead sands that dick shared the danger on both occasions might of course be coincidence but it might have a very sinister meaning whitney felt disturbed about it but he decided that as his suspicions might be unfounded and the matter was delicate he would not warn his friends and must be satisfied with keeping a keen watch on staffer  one morning shortly after this williamson picked his way across the moss at the foot of criffell as day was breaking he was tired and hungry but even at the risk of missing his breakfast he did not want to arrive at dumfries too soon dawn was late now and he must not give the hotel people cause to wonder why he had set out long before it was light  the black mass of the mountain rose between him and the east with a flush of pink above its sloping shoulder the rolling country to the west was shadowy and dry tufts of wild cotton glimmered a ghostly white among the darkpeathags there had been light frost for a few days but it had gone and a raw wind blew in williamsons face the ground was getting soft the rushes he brushed through were beaded with moisture and now and then halfthawed ice crackled beneath his wet boots still as he did not wish to loiter about dumfries he went on leisurely  when he got over the fence he found the loaning softer than he expected and on reaching the cothouse he decided that it would not be safe to ride the motorcycle the machine however was light and he was glad of a chance to warm himself by pushing it to the main road there was nobody in the wet fields but the light was getting clear and a thin streak of smoke rose from the farm among the trees everything looked gray and cold and desolate but as williamson splashed into a pool a jolt of the bicycle warned him that he had better fix his attention on the ruts  while he did so he noticed a sinuous line running to meet him at first he supposed it was the track he had made in going down the lane then he thought it looked rather deep and with sudden suspicion he placed the back wheel of his bicycle beside it the pattern the tire left in the mud was different and now he saw another line run out from the grass this seemed to indicate the track of a sidecar and williamson leaning his wheel against the wall followed the marks back over the ground he had traversed  they led him to a gap in the dyke and after taking down the pole that closed it he traced them to a peatstack they were lighter here which showed that the men had dismounted he knew that it would take some trouble to push a heavy motorcycle with a car attached over the soft ground but this had been done and the machine dragged close behind the stack after examining the ground carefully williamson returned to the loaning and made his way to the highroad as fast as possible it was now important that nobody should see him coming from the moss  reaching the road where he would excite no curiosity he sat down in the shelter of a bank and lighted a cigarette for he had received a decided shock some one had driven a motorcycle down the loaning but had not gone to the farm this was strange and it was significant that the man had taken a good deal of trouble to hide the machine which suggested that he must have meant to leave it for some time and wished to prevent its being seen there was nothing on the moss to repay a visit and the owner of a motorcycle would have no reason for taking a short cut across the mountain on foot when he could drive round as soon by road that there was probably another man in the sidecar made the puzzle worse and williamsons face hardened as he admitted the possibility of their having tried to follow him  looking back at the rugged fellside anxiously he saw that as he crossed its summit he would have been visible against the sky though any one coming up could not be seen against the dark heath it was unfortunate that he had not looked back as he went down the other side or hidden behind a boulder and waited but he had no ground for believing that anybody knew of his journeys across the hill  he was engaged in a dangerous business and the consequences would be serious if the military authorities found him out but this was not the worst he feared they might be baffled but staffer had hinted that his employers were not satisfied and it was a dangerous thing to disappoint them their rewards were liberal but their servants must perform their task williamson shivered as he remembered what he had heard about the fate of one or two who had not succeeded in this  cowering behind the bank while the cold wind whistled past he carefully thought out the situation he saw that he had to face one of two dangers either he had by some carelessness excited suspicion and was being watched or he was distrusted by his friends in the latter case flight to america was the only means of escape because he knew enough to make his employers uneasy and if they failed in one plan to put him out of the way they would try another he would certainly not be left free to save himself by telling what he knew but if he had only the british authorities to fear there was less cause for alarm they could be thrown off the track indeed this must be done for he dare not now abandon the work he had undertaken  williamson was getting very cold and a searching drizzle had begun to fall but he scarcely noticed it as he sat weighing the arguments for and against each supposition eventually he decided that he must blame some incautiousness of his own and he began to wonder whose suspicions he had aroused whitney had a motorcycle and its tires would leave just such a mark as he had noticed but this did not prove much because the make was in common use the american was shrewd and was a friend of andrews but while both were antagonistic williamson thought they opposed him only on dicks account well he had promised to leave dick alone that ought to satisfy them and if he were very careful he would be able to elude any other enemies  feeling that his scare had been needless he set off for dumfries although he had not yet reached an explanation of the motorcycle tracks     chapter xx  the whammel boat   thin fog drifted down the firth when with whitneys help andrew pulled the dinghy up the bank and then stopped to look about it was nine oclock in the evening when they left the rowan at anchor in the channel a hundred yards away and he knew the tide was beginning to flow which meant that he had an hour and a half in which to reach and return from the wreck everything was obscured to the east but to the west the sky was clear and a thin bright moon shone in a patch of dusky blue the sand felt harder than usual for the night air was frosty but the melancholy calling of the wild fowl told that the salt ooze in the gutters was still unfrozen there was no other sound except the ripple of the current across the shoals  i suppose well let up for a bit if we see nobody tonight whitney suggested  yes said andrew the tides getting late  whitney nodded agreement they had sailed from the burnfoot three days before and after standing out to sea on the ebb had returned to the outer end of the channel in the dark as soon as they could stem the slackening stream then landing in the dinghy they hung about the wreck until the advancing tide drove them back they had done this for two nights without seeing anything suspicious and they could now abandon the search because as the time of highwater approached six oclock the tides did not run out far enough to enable anybody to reach the wreck from land  striking across the flats they stopped on the edge of a hollow running through the highest part the mist was driving nearer before a cold wind and the moon was dim but they could see for some distance toward the west across the level stretch of sand nothing broke its smooth expanse but the sound of the sea had grown louder and the wild fowl noisier  after a few moments andrew struck into the hollow and began to follow it up the sand was softer here though there were spears of ice on the muddy pools but the mens figures no longer cut against the sky and whitney knew the need for caution the gutter got deeper as they went on until they could not see beyond its banks and soon it began to wind off to one side when andrew stopped at the turning a wild cry that was like a hoarse laugh came out of the dark  whats that whitney asked  a blackbacked gull said andrew thoughtfully theyre suspicious brutes and a nuisance when youre trying to crawl up to a flock of duck in fact it often looks as if they laughed because youd lost your shot  do you think something has disturbed the bird  well know in a minute  a mournful wail that ended in a quavering tremolo fell from the air as the harsh laughter died away  thats a curlew going over andrew said  then a shrill screaming broke out and andrew turned toward the bank and began to climb out of the hollow  oystercatchers now theyre all off he said  when they reached the level whitney looked round quickly the haze was crawling close up in long lowlying belts but it had not reached them yet and as his eyes turned seaward he saw a black triangle projecting above the edge of the flats  a lugsail isnt it he asked  yes a whammel boat  andrew seized whitneys arm and moving back a few steps dropped upon his knees and dragged his companion down whitney understood the reason when he saw a faint dark figure on the bank some distance off  after all it may be a fisherman he said  its possible but i dont know what hes doing here and well follow up the gutter until were abreast of the wreck the fog will come down thick before we reach her  i dont know that im fond of fog whitney replied however if you think you can find the dinghy  moving back into the bed of the channel they went on as fast as possible they were out of sight but the winding hollow lengthened the distance it got darker as they splashed among the pools and when at last andrew thought they had gone far enough and they climbed the bank everything was hidden by drifting fog whitney was frankly uneasy andrew knew the sands well but for all that it would not be difficult to lose their way and they had purposely left no light on board the yacht still it was unthinkable that they should turn back when the man they had been trying to mark down seemed almost in their hands banishing his misgivings he plunged into the clammy mist following closely behind andrew  the birds had gone nothing broke the silence and there was nothing to be seen whitney imagined that andrew was going straight but this was not certain and he recognized that the man they hoped to surprise might have turned back andrew went a few yards in front a dim ghostly figure in the fog but it was a relief to see that he showed no hesitation though they tried to move quietly they made some noise where the bank was hard their footsteps rang through the haze now and then shells crunched beneath their boots and there were spots where they splashed through halffrozen mud  at last they saw the blurred outline of the wreck  go straight on and then wait until i creep up on the other side andrew whispered  they separated and whitney braced himself for a struggle as he moved softly forward the man would no doubt be armed but he must not get away until they learned who he was whitney set his lips as he neared the wreck andrews footsteps had died away and there was something that daunted him in the look of the dark mass of timber but he went on and presently stopped at the edge of a pool beside the vessel he did not think anybody had left her as he approached the man must be on board but he must wait until andrew came up there was no sound but the drip of water and the wail of the cold wind it was eerie and depressing to stand there in the fog but at last he heard a cautious step and knew that his comrade had reached the opposite side of the hulk  go ahead he said softly and scrambled up with a feeling of relief that the waiting was over  he heard andrews heavy boots rasp upon the planks but he reached the forecastle hatch first and his nerves tingled as he dropped through it in the dark he came down safely but he did not hear the clatter of feet among the timbers he had expected while he felt about for fear an unseen enemy might seize him at a disadvantage andrew sprang down and the light of an electric torch flashed round the hold it showed broken timbers sand and glistening pools but that was all they had wasted their efforts nobody was there andrew moved about holding up the torch and then extinguished it as he came back to the spot beneath the hatch  well he said were no farther forward  could the fellow have seen us and slipped away  not on my side the fog wasnt very thick and i could see the wreck i suppose you kept a good lookout  of course perhaps he saw us when we noticed him on the bank  its possible but not likely we had only just left the gutter and he was going the other way  andrew was silent for a minute  it would help us he said if we knew whether he could carry a wireless apparatus across the sands i dont think it could be hidden on board  it might be buried outside in a watertight box shall we go dig  no wed be seen from the shore and a good glass would show what we were doing in the dark we would have to use a lantern  thats so whitney agreed well as theres nothing doing here lets get back  they reached the dinghy before the tide flowed round her and shortly afterward got on board the rowan the fog was thick and the wind blowing against them down the firth but andrew decided to hoist no sail when they hove the anchor  its early yet to find deep water and i can steer her with an oar he said well let the tide take her up  he sounded now and then as the current carried her away and whitney wondered whether it would strand them on a thinly covered bank andrew had no guide except the depth and the hoarse murmur the stream made as it rippled across the shoals  suddenly andrew began to scull vigorously  not much water i think were too near the middle sand he said  the next minute the boat stopped with a jar and listed down on her side while the ripples splashed angrily against her planks whitney seized the boathook to push her off but andrew stopped him  shell soon float and the tides not running very fast  they sat in the cockpit to wait and the noise the current made as it swirled round her died away she was not quite afloat however and whitney was picking up the boathook when a flicker of light shone through the fog he raised his hand in warning to andrew and both saw the faint gleam go out  then a splashing sound grew louder and a dim gray object drove toward them whitney knew it was a lugsail boat beating up the firth and he saw that she would pass at a few yards distance if she stood on so far he did not think they had been seen for the rowans hull was low and she had no sail set while he waited in suspense he heard the splash of an oar as somebody sounded  no quite a fathom doon helm jock said a hoarse voice  there was a flutter of canvas and the boat swinging round vanished on the other tack  what are we going to do whitney asked  anchor as soon as theyre far enough off not to hear our chain  andrew sculled the rowan into the channel and presently dropped the anchor when she brought up he went below and lighted the lamp  they didnt see us but i wont want to follow them up the firth he explained their boat can cross the flats before we can and when we landed theyd all have gone besides it might look suspicious if we came up soon afterward i think well wait for daylight  whitney put the kettle on the stove and lighted his pipe  well he said i guess its puzzling but theres certainly something going on and it may be something that will mean the loss of another big liner i expect you see that it ought to be stopped at once  yes said andrew firmly i mean to stop it  whitney nodded and thought for a few moments  so far he contended we havent scored much it looks as if the opposition were pretty smart the point you have to answer is thissuppose they do some serious damage before we can stop them  you mean that in trying to keep the thing in my own hands i take a dangerous risk  yes but i cant tell you what you ought to do youre awkwardly fixed  andrew leaned back on the locker and grappled with a problem that had troubled him much of late he was quietly proud of the johnstones traditions and the honor of the family which had long stood high was threatened it was painful to admit that a traitor was making use of appleyard but had there been no other obstacle andrew would not have hesitated about denouncing him the trouble was that if he did so elsie must suffer with her guilty relative to keep silent might enable the plotter to carry out designs which andrew with his limited powers could not thwart and his duty to the state was obvious  he did not want to shirk that duty he was willing to bear any personal loss and even bring discredit upon appleyard but it did not seem his duty to involve the girl he loved elsie had done no wrong but she was staffers niece and that would be enough to condemn her besides he might be mistaken and it was unthinkable that he should bring suspicion upon appleyard until his last doubts had vanished if staffer were proved guilty nobody would believe that mrs woodhouse and dick were free from blame and yet andrew saw that his country must not be left unprotected from the plots of its enemies  he set his lips as he tried to balance contending claims using arguments on both sides that had led him into a maze before and each time he was forced back upon the decision he had already made something must be risked and in the meanwhile he would follow up his clues alone it would be time enough to warn the authorities when he had found out what was to be feared  his face was tense as he turned to whitney  i think well have to work out this thing in our own way but as the tides wont suit for the next few days well take a run north along the eskdale road  very well if you think thats somehow in the plot whitney agreed its possible youre right about the other matter youd put the load on the proper shoulders if you warned your authorities but if they didnt get to work very quietly theyd scare the fellows off before they found out much the trails certainly not plain but i guess we can follow it without showing what were after  see if the anchors holding said andrew im going to lie down  he lowered his folding cot but the flood tide had covered the flats and the yacht was rolling gently on the swell it brought in before he went to sleep  farther up the narrowing firth the wind was faint and elsie lying awake toward highwater heard the murmur of the sea it throbbed in a deep monotone through the stillness that brooded over the fogwrapped countryside elsie listened to it for a time wondering what andrew was doing as she glanced at the obscurity outside her window for the firth was dangerous to navigate in thick weather he had promised to return the next day and she wanted him back at appleyard she felt safer when andrew was about he was not clever but he was practical and one could trust him to do the right thing in a difficulty  elsie was glad to remember this because she had difficulties to contend with dick had been restless and depressed and his occasional efforts at rather boisterous gaiety had emphasized his general moodiness he was obviously not well but elsie thought this did not account for everything then her mother had been quieter than usual and her manner seemed to indicate secret anxiety  elsie felt that things were going very wrong at appleyard something mysterious and sinister threatened the household but she could not combat the danger because she did not know what it was even now when every one was probably asleep she had an instinctive feeling that there was mischief on foot she told herself that she was highly strung and imaginative but her uneasiness would not be banished anyway she could not sleep seeing that the fire had not quite gone out she got up finally and putting on her slippers and kimono lighted a small reading lamp she drew a thick curtain across the window and then opened a book but she found that her thoughts would dwell on andrew somewhere out in the fog  with a gesture of impatience elsie closed the book and threw it down it had not made her sleepy and the room was getting cold but she did not want to go back to bed and lie awake sitting still she mused and listened the wind always moaned round appleyard and when the nights were still one could hear the hoarse murmur of the solway tide then there were the mysterious sounds that occur in old houses creaking floors boards cracking and now and then the rattle of a door elsie was used to these noises but for no obvious reason her senses were alert  suddenly she sat upright somewhere downstairs a door was being opened cautiously her clock showed that it was just halfpast two     chapter xxi  the lost paper   the sound of the opening door did not startle elsie because of her curious feeling that something unusual was going to happen with a quick glance at the window she decided not to put out the light the thick curtain would probably hide it and if not to darken the window suddenly would show that some one was watching then it struck her that she had not heard a key being turned or a bolt drawn but the door fastenings were carefully oiled staffer had had this seen to after having had difficulty with his latchkey one night  elsie was curious and highly strung but not alarmed for there were no burglars in annandale prompted by the suspicions that had filled her mind lately she determined to find out who had come in so slipping quietly out of her room she pulled her door to softly and walked to the top of the stairs the cold draught that came up from the hall showed that the door was open and she stopped when she had gone down a few steps so far she had not paused to reflect but she recognized now that she had not acted altogether on an unreasoning impulse dick and staffer were at home but she did not wish to warn staffer and she felt it might be better if dick did not go down  leaning over the banister she heard a low voice in the darkness and it gave her a strange disturbing thrill she could catch no words but the accent reminded her of munich then a ray of light flickered about the hall and elsie shrank back her heart beating fast as the beam ran up the wall some one was using an electric torch she began to feel that she was in danger but the light stopped and streamed back again leaving her in the shadow after that it flashed round and fell upon two men near the door they had made no noise and there was something startling in the way their figures sprang out of the gloom both were dressed in oilskins and rubber seaboots  one was williamson the other a stranger who in spite of his dress did not look like a fisherman he had blue eyes and a stiff red mustache but he vanished as the light traveled past him to rest on the door of the library which opened out of the hall then though elsie heard no sound she knew the men had gone in what was more she knew that staffer carried the torch this was the most disturbing thing and she leaned upon the banister while she tried to think  she had frankly distrusted williamson feeling that he threatened dick and she knew now that she had never really trusted staffer he had treated her well but she imagined this was for her mothers sake and instead of affection she felt a curious halfinstinctive antagonism for him after all she had really not been his guest but dicks appleyard which she had come to love belonged to the johnstones and not to her uncle she felt that its peace was threatened and she determined to find out what the men were doing  moving noiselessly she crept down to the hall and as she reached it a faint but steady light streamed out of the library door this was not the torch staffer had lighted one of the lamps for a few moments she stopped and hesitated trying to master her fears she knew that she must not be discovered though it was not williamson but her uncle she dreaded most this however was not all of her trouble the strangers accent had awakened a flood of disturbing memories she had been kindly treated in munich where she had learned her mothers native tongue and the sound of it had stirred strong deeprooted feelings the man with the red mustache had a look of command in spite of his rough clothes she knew the stamp for she had seen it on officers whose wives had for a time been her friends some were men she had admired but now they were her countrys enemies  that was the trouble one could not belong to two nations and she was scotch appleyard was her home and dick and andrew although not her kin were dearer than any one except her mother yet her mothers blood was in her veins and she felt it stirring now but this must not be allowed she was her fathers daughter too and belonged by adoption to the johnstones she had accepted their traditions and now she must side with the men she loved she felt that they were hers  having reached this decision she realized that she must find a hidingplace from which she could see into the library she crept across the hall feeling her way to a tall old clock that stood against the wall its oak case did not project far but by standing straight behind it she would be in the gloom and the halfopened halldoor would help to conceal her  leaning forward from the corner she found her view commanded the end of the library table where staffer sat beside a shaded lamp with some documents spread out in front of him the men bent over the table examining the papers with eager attention  for a few moments no one spoke and then the stranger with the red mustache said something which elsie did not catch  yes staffer returned gruffly rankine is an obstacle but he doesnt interfere with my part of the business  elsie could not hear what followed but williamson and the stranger spoke in quiet earnest tones that suggested that what they had to say was important being accustomed to staffers voice she could more easily catch his remarks presently he stopped the stranger with an impatient movement of his hand  no you must get into the habit of calling him sanders  the mans face was hidden but elsie thought his pose stiffened as if he resented staffers tone this seemed to indicate that he was a man of rank which something in his bearing had already hinted  well he said in english speaking a trifle louder if he is watched as he suspects you may have some trouble in getting his instructions to visit him in edinburgh might lead  elsie could not hear the rest but she could see staffers smile as he answered  we have a suitable messenger he turned to williamson nobody would suspect dick and hed be safe because hed have no idea of what he was doing hes going up with me in the car tomorrow  im not sure williamson began but they had gradually ceased to lower their voices and staffer stopped him with a warning sign  elsie caught her breath as staffer suddenly turned in his chair but he was only looking for a map which was buried beneath the other papers when he opened it he spoke quietly and the others listened with close attention at first elsie could not catch a word but as their caution lessened with their intense interest an occasional word or phrase reached her     submarine    coast of    this line marks     staffers voice dropped to a murmur again until finally he folded the papers and handed them to the stranger  now its up to you he said quite distinctly you know what will happen to you if you fail  elsie crouched back as the men straightened up she knew the interview was over but she did not dare risk crossing the hall to the staircase a clink of glass reached her and then she stood straight against the wall pressed close against the old clock for she knew the men were coming out  williamson entered the hall first and as he pushed the door back the light touched the clock its tall case was shallow and when williamson turned partly round elsies heart beat fast he went on however and the stranger followed putting the papers staffer had given him into a pocket under his oilskin coat he wore thick woolen gloves but perhaps his hands were cold for an envelope dropped out at the bottom of the oilskin it fell a foot or two from where elsie stood and she thought she could not escape discovery if he stooped to pick it up but the next moment the library went suddenly dark the man passed on and staffer flashed on the electric torch as he came out but its light did not fall near the corner he extinguished it when the men reached the house door and elsie stood very still with tingling nerves  she had escaped but the envelope lay on the floor and she felt that appleyard was threatened by some plot in which dick was to be involved both must be protected she must get the paper its loss would no doubt embarrass the conspirators and would probably not be discovered for some time but she must be quick their footsteps were almost noiseless but she heard them go down the steps stooping swiftly she drew her hand across the floor found the envelope and thrust it inside her kimono then she darted across to the stairs and when she reached the landing she stopped to listen it was possible that the stranger might feel if he had all the papers before he left  no sound reached her and she breathed a sigh of relief but she forgot that the others had moved silently and a flash of light swept up the stairs and struck her face she was dazzled and alarmed but with an effort she kept her selfcontrol it would be dangerous to be seen trying to steal away but if she remained looking down over the banisters her presence might be accounted for  whos there she asked in a sharp voice  for a moment or two the light rested on her face and she was glad to remember that she would not be expected to look composed  staffer laughed as he turned the beam on williamson  our friend and i he answered im sorry we startled you perhaps id better get a candle  he looked cool that was comforting for it suggested that he did not know she had been in the hall but she thought it wiser to wait a minute staffer struck a match then he put out the torch and gave the lighted candle to williamson  if you dont want supper we may as well go upstairs the room you generally use is ready  elsie imagined that williamson had not meant to stay but he came up in front of staffer carrying the candle she noted that he wore rubber kneeboots and that staffer had only his stockings on his feet when they reached the landing williamson looked rather keenly at her but his face was inscrutable she could not be sure that he had not seen her behind the clock and staffers attitude might be intended to hide some plan for her embarrassment but she must keep cool  i think we could find mr williamson some cold meat if he is hungry she said  hed rather have sleep staffer answered he meant to stay at langholm so as to get home early tomorrow but you can never rely on a motorcycle he turned to williamson how far did you have to walk when it broke down  four or five miles after id spent some time trying to put it right williamson answered and made his excuses for disturbing them but elsie thought he was taking staffers cue and she knew that they were both watching her for all that she smiled as she replied with conventional politeness  well resumed staffer its getting cold and ill look after williamson if you hear a door open another time youd better call me instead of going down he paused a moment and there was a slight change in his tone we know your pluck but i cant allow you to run a risk  elsie turned away with keen relief and on reaching her room she locked the door before she took out the envelope the name thorkelsen was written across it that suggested a norwegian or a dane and was not what she had expected but she sat for a time with the envelope in her hand she had no doubt that it contained some dangerous secret a plausible excuse had been made for williamsons visit but she had noticed his clothes and deckboots which were not what one generally wore when motorcycling then why had the man in oilskins come to appleyard when he might have expected every one to be asleep it looked as if her uncle had a part and a leading part in some plot in which williamson was engaged but she could not reason the matter out now that the strain had gone she suddenly felt limp  with an effort she roused herself and threw the envelope into the fire she could not betray her uncle to whom she owed much but he should not lead dick into trouble and appleyard must not be used by her countrys enemies the situation however was embarrassing and she felt that she could not ask andrews help she longed to do so because she instinctively turned to him when she was in a difficulty and he had never failed her but it was impossible now she must wait and trust to finding some way of baffling the conspirators without staining the family honor  at last she went to bed and presently fell asleep but she got up early in the morning and found dick outside watching watson clean the car  are you going to edinburgh today she asked as they turned back to the house  yes said dick a bit of a change is bracing  but andrew and mr whitney are coming back  i suppose that means you dont want me to go cant trust me up in town dick said lightly  it isnt that elsie hesitated i imagine they want to make some use of you  dick gave her a curious glance  i suppose you mean williamson does  no said elsie with a touch of color in her face i mean both  ah dick looked at her keenly for a moment youre generally frank elsie open as the sunshine in fact and im not clever at hiding what i think suppose you tell me what you really do mean  i cant dick but i want you to be careful in edinburgh for my sake  very well ill promise that and i think i can manage not to let others see ive had a hint its a funny thing but although i am a bit of a fool i really have more sense than people imagine  elsie was puzzled by his manner the hardness in his tone was not like dick but she let the matter drop  who is rankine do you know him she asked  yes hes a friend of whitneys people a navy officer struck me as a remarkably good type  where is he now  i dont know somewhere between here and ireland surveying for charts  perhaps mr whitney will bring him to appleyard when his ships in port  ill ask him to if you like but i dont know you as a plotter whats the scheme  i cant tell you elsie answered with a careless smile youll have to trust me dick  thats easy he said in a different tone anybody who knew you well would trust you with his life  elsie gave him a quick affectionate glance and they went into the house     chapter xxii  staffers messenger   dick spent several exhilarating days in edinburgh although on the whole he conducted himself with a sobriety that surprised his companions who were thus encouraged to leave him alone  as they were getting breakfast on the morning they left edinburgh staffer said to dick  we must start back as soon as we can but theres an adjustment to be made on the car that may keep me half an hour at the garage i dont suppose youll mind doing an errand for me in the meantime  certainly not said dick  then you might go to the caledonian hotel and see a man called sanders ill give you his room number so you neednt bother them at the office go straight up in the elevator and ask if he has any message for me then you can come back to the garage where well be waiting  he doesnt know me but perhaps that wont matter  i dont suppose so the things not important staffer answered carelessly however since you mention it if he should hesitate you can show him this  he gave dick a handsome silver cigarettecase engraved with a rather unusual pattern round the crest  be back in half an hour he said  it was a fine morning with bright sunshine and a keen east wind and dick walked along carelessly looking at the shops at one he bought some gloves for mrs woodhouse and at another some delicate quilled chrysanthemums caught his eye he bought a larger bunch than he could conveniently hold imagining that they might please elsie and farther on he purchased an enameled locket  with a box of gloves sticking awkwardly out of his pocket and a wrappedup jewel case dangling by a loop from a finger of the hand with which he clutched the great bunch of chrysanthemums dick entered the hotel none of the pages or porters asked him what he wanted when he strode through the entrance hall for his twinkling smile and easy manner banished suspicion there were very few people who ever distrusted dick staffer had chosen his messenger well  dick found sanders reading a letter in his room and thought the fellow had been surprised when he entered unannounced the paper in his hand was crumpled as if he had meant to put it out of sight but he turned to dick with a quiet movement his face was expressionless but his glance was very keen  perhaps i ought to apologize for breaking in on you like this dick said  its not quite usual sanders replied the general custom is to send in a card  well i was told to go straight up and as i was thinking of something else im afraid i forgot to knock  im afraid you did returned sanders who told you to come up  staffer i understand you have a message for him were just starting home  ah sanders voice was quiet but dick imagined that he felt some surprise you will excuse my remarking that as a rule one likes to know something about a messenger  of course i forgot dick took out the cigarettecase staffer is my stepfather and he said youd know this  then youre mr johnstone of appleyard  dick nodded and felt that he was being quietly studied it was obvious that sanders knew something about him  how long have you been in edinburgh he asked and looked thoughtful when dick told him  well i have no message for mr staffer as a matter of fact i was expecting some news from him and have not received it you might tell him so  i see you cant reply to a message you didnt get but ill send him round when i reach the garage if you likeand theres the telephone  you seem to understand the situation sanders smiled i wont trouble mr staffer as it is not important will you come down and smoke a cigarette  no thanks staffers waiting dick said  sanders picked up the cigarettecase which he had left on the table  this is mr staffers and perhaps you had better return it as soon as you see him the thing is valuable  dick left the hotel but took out the case and examined it as he walked back up the street it was heavily gilded inside and he thought the engraving round the small gold crest remarkably good the case was beautifully made and must have been expensive but he suspected that this did not altogether account for sanders warning him to take care of it dicks face grew thoughtful as he remembered the crumpled letter which the man had not had time to thrust into his pocket then it was strange that he had been unwilling to use the telephone and when one came to think of it staffer could have avoided some delay by ringing him up moreover elsie had told him that he might be made use of in edinburgh  as he remembered this dick smiled after all he was not so simple as he looked and people who misunderstood his character sometimes suffered for their mistake his mind was occupied as he went on to the garage where he found the car waiting at the door with williamson inside they had not brought watson and when dick appeared staffer started the engine  i suppose you saw sanders he said carelessly  yes replied dick hope i havent kept you i wasnt with him long  jump up staffer said as he threw in the clutch and the big car rolled away down the street  the traffic was thick when they crossed the railway bridge and staffer was forced to drive cautiously and when they ran between tall houses along the narrow highway out of the town there seemed to be an unusual number of carts about and tramcars on the line it was not until they were speeding past the last of the small villas on the outskirts that staffer could relax his watchfulness and then he did not speak to dick staffer and sanders had given him to understand that the message was of no importance and dick knew that staffer would accordingly show no haste to ask about it  they ran under a lofty railway viaduct and through a colliery village then the road led upward across open country toward a high blue ridge that rose between them and the south as the car sped on the careful cultivation that marks the lothian levels became less evident there were fewer broad belts of stubble and the darkgreen turnip fields were left behind no copses and patches of woodland lined the winding road rushy pastures rolled away from it the hedgerows were made of ragged windstunted thorns which presently gave place to dry stone dykes round hilltops began to rise above the high tableland where the white bentgrass grew and a keen wind from the north sea stung their faces as they climbed the last ascent here dicks eyes swept the landscape  the forth had dwindled to a thin glittering streak edinburgh was hidden by a haze of smoke and the craigs and arthurs seat were fading into the background of the highland hills ahead across the divide a long gently sloping hollow opened up where gala water wound among the fields and woods the road however ran straight along the hillside which gradually rose above it while the valley melted through deepening shades of gray into a gulf of blue shadow as the car rushed down the incline a faint white line was drawn across the distance and dick glancing at his watch imagined it was an edinburgh express  then staffer turned to him  by the way what about the message sanders gave you  oh said dick he didnt give it to me  staffer looked round as far as he was able but dared not neglect his driving and so missed dicks grin  but you saw him he exclaimed  oh yes but he had nothing to say he didnt know what you wanted because he hadnt heard from you anyway thats what i understood  the car had swung toward the edge of the road and staffer was occupied by the wheel for the next few moments but dick imagined that he and williamson exchanged glances  can you remember his exact remarks staffer asked when he could turn again  im afraid not still i think he expected you to send him something that hadnt come  staffer said nothing more but williamson put his hand into his pocket and took out what appeared to be a timetable a thin spire with a few white houses below it now stood out from the hillside two or three miles away but dick thought williamson would not get out there it would look significant after hearing his report and he could get a train to edinburgh farther on staffer said something that dick could not hear and the car raced through the village without slackening speed  for a time the road ran southward beside the sparkling stream and then wound round wide curves where woods rolled down the hollows of the hills until as they turned a corner galashields factory chimneys rose about the waterside and a haze of smoke floated across the valley staffer reduced speed as they ran in among the houses and drove very slowly when they reached a sharp bend near the station  i want some oil he said well stop here and get a tin  he pulled up in front of a big red hotel and they went into the smokingroom  williamson walked over to the fire  its a cold day for driving and i dont think ill go any farther he remarked i want a few things that i can buy in the town and ill go on by the afternoon train  as you like said staffer your place is off our way  when williamson left them dick turned to staffer  i wonder if you would lend me a pound or two he asked  i might take the risk but why do you want it  well dick said apologetically its difficult to bring much money back when you go to edinburgh and if you dont mind ill stop here if andrew and whitney arent in the neighborhood ill come on by train but i expect to find them at melrose or abbotsford you see i felt rather shabby about leaving on the day they were coming home  staffer did not object but dick thought his compliance was accounted for by the whistle of a stopping train that was then starting for edinburgh  andrew has eccentric tastes but allowing for that its hard to see what satisfaction he and his american friend can get from cruising about the galloway coast in winter staffer said  theyre fond of a shot at the black geese  they can get snipe and partridges at appleyard without much trouble  they can dick agreed smiling that partly accounts for it if you knew andrew as i do youd understand why he prefers the geese anything he can get easily doesnt appeal to him no doubt its a matter of temperament but i imagine he goes punting after geese because its a remarkably good way of getting cold and wet  then its only the shooting that takes him along the coast  of course i cant think of anything else can you  no staffer said with a quick laugh but ill admit that i dont understand your cousins type of character  they left the hotel soon afterward but dicks face grew thoughtful when staffer drove off in the car he had known for some time that williamson derived an advantage from exploiting his extravagance but he had not minded this of late however williamson had left him alone but dick did not think this was because staffer had interfered on his behalf he had admired and trusted his stepfather who had always treated him indulgently and he now retained some liking for him though he was beginning to know him better  leaving the town he took the road to abbotsford lost in gloomy thought but presently he braced himself to ponder the line he ought now to take after all he was the heir to appleyard and although he had recklessly ignored his responsibilities he loved the old house now all was not well there something mysterious was going on dick held williamson mainly accountable for this but it looked as if staffer had a part in the plot this complicated things because staffer was his stepfather and elsies uncle and dick cherished the honor of his house  he looked up as he heard the hoot of a motor horn and his tense face relaxed into a smile andrew in the sidecar of whitneys bicycle waved his hand and dicks troubles began to vanish one could rely on andrew who after all was a much better johnstone than himself somehow andrew would stand between them and whatever threatened the honor of appleyard     chapter xxiii  an evening at appleyard   rankine had got a few days leave and was spending it at appleyard he sat beside elsie in a corner of the billiardroom where the party had gathered after dinner he had arrived during the afternoon and andrew was not altogether pleased to see him although he liked the man elsie had suggested that dick should invite him and had added that he might as well come when madge whitney was there since elsie had not seen rankine until he arrived andrew wondered what she meant but he admitted that she generally had a reason for what she did  nobody had been playing billiards or wanted to begin elsie and mrs woodhouse were knitting and the others were talking quietly while they waited for the evening newspaper  presently staffer made a remark about the navy and madge whitney looked at rankine with a smile  dont you feel that you must answer that  i dont know that i can rankine answered goodnaturedly to some extent mr staffers right the navy certainly occupies the background of the stage just now  it strikes me as being out of sight altogether staffer said  well perhaps thats its proper place but i expect it will emerge from obscurity when its wanted  we must hope so staffer returned no doubt your commanders are waiting for the right moment to make a dramatic entry on the scene but one imagines that ambitious young officers must find being kept in the background rather galling  andrew caught whitneys glance and understood it as a warning not to speak it had been blowing hard for the past week and he thought of the great battleships rolling until it was scarcely possible to keep a footing on their stripped decks while anxious men slept beside the guns and bitter seas foamed across the ponderous lowsided hulls it would be worse on the swift destroyers driving half submerged through the gale and trembling when the combers struck them until their thin steel skin and beams racked and bent with the strain no man could really keep a lookout in the blinding clouds of spray and their decks would be swept from end to end with icy water rankine knew this but he smiled tranquilly as he turned to staffer  oh i dont think they mindso long as they feel theyre useful  is that what you feel  something of the kind surveyings not the work one would prefer just now but its necessary the banks and channels shift and our commerce must go on  there have been interruptions staffer said dryly  andrew felt puzzled staffers manners were generally good but now while there was nothing offensive in his tone he had gone farther than was altogether tactful it looked as if he wanted to sting the young navy officer into an indignant protest though andrew could not see what he expected to gain rankine however agreed with staffer  thats so and its possible we may hear of another interruption or two our men will do their best but while our cruisers are pretty active they cant be everywhere at once  the newspaper was brought in and staffer handed it to dick  you can read it to us i cant see very well where i am  dick took the thin sheet  nothing of importance on the western front a trench or two carried another lost  he stopped with an exclamation and the others leaned forward eagerly  what is it dick elsie asked in a hushed voice  theyve sunk another ship in the north channela wheat ship from canada  read it andrew said tensely  dick gave a quick look at staffer before beginning but staffer at that instant was lighting a cigar so his face was masked        a telegram from londonderry reports that the british       cargo steamer meridian with grain from canada was       beached in a sinking state near greencastle last       night full particulars have not yet been received       but a violent shock was felt when the vessel was off       malin head and soon afterward she began to settle       down the water rose rapidly in two of her holds but       the bulkheads stood the strain and the captain was       able to reach the mouth of lough foyle whether she       struck a mine or was torpedoed is not at present       known but some light is thrown on the subject by the       crew of the concords experience the latter a       steamer of 6000 tons bound from montreal to glasgow       passed tory island yesterday steering east a high       confused sea was running and it was getting dark when       she was abreast of portrush where the lookout forward       reported a submarine        the captain immediately altered his course and the       vessel which was rolling wildly listed over as she       obeyed her helm the lookout running across the       forecastle after he hailed the bridge as if to see       the submarine better was thrown down the ladder and       picked up unconscious on the iron deck the captain       steamed out to sea and returned an hour or two       afterward nearer the kintyre side the injured seaman       had not recovered consciousness when he was landed in       the clyde  there was silence for a few moments when dick put down the newspaper andrews face was hard for rankine had given him a meaning glance elsie was very quiet but she was lightly flushed  i suppose it wouldnt be difficult to recognize a submarine she asked presently  no said rankine not if it were at the surface one might however mistake a spar or batten floating upright for a periscope  no one followed up his explanation but the party seemed to find the pause trying  they burn gasolene dont they madge asked  either that or oil when theyre running on the surface the engines are driven by electricity when theyre submerged  can they carry much gasolene  not very much rankine answered guardedly  can they carry enough to take them from germany and back madge persisted  i believe some can do so but they wouldnt have much to spare and theyd run a serious risk if they remained any time as far away from their base as the north channel  you must see that the points important said elsie  its importance is obvious rankine agreed  if the boat couldnt carry enough fuel shed have to get some while she was out on a trip  there was another long pause and then mrs woodhouse spoke  you must mean somewhere in scotland she said  disagreeable conclusion isnt it but we dont know yet that it was a submarine rankine answered  but suppose there should be an enemy submarine in the north channel that hadnt much fuel left how could she renew her supply staffer asked  rankine seemed unwilling to talk about the subject but he smiled  oh he said its hard to tell one could form plausible theories but theyd probably be wrong perhaps wed better leave the matter to the people whose business it is  he began to talk about something else and the curious tension that all had felt gradually slackened soon afterward a servant announced that mackellar had arrived staffer had been expecting him and when he left the room madge and dick went to the drawingroom with elsie and mrs woodhouse and rankine found himself alone with andrew and whitney  have you made any progress with your investigations he asked  no andrew answered quietly nothing very marked  and you are still resolved to keep them in your own hands after the news we got tonight  do you know that the loss of the cargo boat has any connection with the matter  no but it looks suspicious rankine answered with a touch of grimness if i did know my course would be clear  so would mine said andrew we found some matches and a candle on board the wreck and followed a man across criffell to the beach abreast of heror rather we followed his tracks then we saw another fellow on the sands at night but thats all i have to tell  could you see either of the men clearly  no i didnt see the first at all and the other was some distance off and a thick fog was coming on  that means it was impossible for you to recognize him  quite andrew said firmly besides i didnt expect to recognize him there was nothing to indicate it was anybody id ever met have you learned anything  rankine smiled  ive examined the wreck and dug up the sand besides watching the flats for several nights the place might be used for a wireless installation but lying in a hollow with hills on both sides its not particularly suitable he paused and looked at andrew that had some influence with me  andrew thought rankine meant that if he felt certain that messages were sent from the wreck he would have brought some pressure to bear on him  how did you get there he asked  we ran in behind ross island when it was too rough for surveying and afterward brought up near abbey head you get some shelter there so long as the winds not south  but its a long way from abbey head to the wreck whitney interposed  i shipped a steam launch at belfast  and went to the wreck and back at night wasnt it blowing hard  hard enough smiled rankine we had some trouble to keep the fire from being swamped but shes a powerful boat and has a good big pump then we traveled most of the distance shortly before and after lowwater when the sea was not so bad but ill confess that i couldnt have found my way among the shoals except for mr johnstones directions we made three trips and got back before daylight without noting anything suspicious  they looked at him in surprise a steam launch voyage along that dangerous coast on a wild winter night was a bold undertaking particularly when one must cross surfswept sands with only a few feet of water under the boat and rankine had safely accomplished it thrice  what about the digging whitney asked mightnt it alarm our man  the surf would level the sand in a tide andrew said and turned to rankine what do you think of doing now  i dont know but im afraid i cant stay here as long as i expected the steamers in loch ryan we went in to make some repairs after a hammering we got now perhaps we had better join the others  andrew left them in the drawingroom and found mackellar alone in the library  ill have finished with these in a few minutes he remarked indicating the papers before him mr staffers accounts dont give much trouble hes a man o parts  yes agreed andrew the estate is managed well  we must give him all the credit he deserves but theres another matter im anxious about we have not got to the bottom o your cousins debts  andrew frowned  do you mean that williamson has got hold of him again  no im thinking hes out of the game and the borrowed moneys none o his but dick has incurred some fresh liabilities heres a bit statement ye can study it  andrew felt disturbed but he waited until mackellar put the papers into his pocket  i cant see how dick has spent so much money but how did he get it  on notes that will mature when hes twentyone i found the man who cashed them but he parted with the paper and i canno tell who holds it now  ive no doubt you tried to find out  mackellars eyes twinkled  ye may take that for granted if there had been a weak spot in the mans affairs id have made him tell  there was silence for a minute andrew suspected that it was staffer but he did not think it was time to speak and he knew that mackellar would take him into his confidence when he saw fit  the fellow who really made the loan has some courage he said presently  im thinking he kens the johnstone character dick would no disown his debts on the ground that he was under age nor would ye if your cousin died before he inherited  no said andrew dicks debts must be met but i would pay what he borrowed with reasonable interest and nothing more  yere a true johnstone mackellar remarked with dry approval my opinion is that the lenders no expecting ye to inherit  well its most unlikely and im glad it is so i suppose you have nothing more to say but youll tell me when i can help  i will mackellar promised  andrew did not feel inclined to join the others he strolled into the hall and found elsie sitting in a corner with her knitting  i stole away to finish this belt she said its the last of a dozen i promised to let the committee have tomorrow  you keep your promises andrew replied it must be a comfort to feel youre useful because somebody in the snow and mud will be glad of that warm belt i begin to wish id been taught to knit  elsie gave him a sympathetic glance for there was a hint of bitterness in his tone  what is troubling you tonight andrew she asked gently  it is rather hard to explain a general sense of futility i think he answered with a smile did you ever feel that you had come up against a dead wall that you could neither break through nor get over  yes i know the feeling well there is so much that ought to be done and it seems impossible but what did you want to do  andrew stood beside the hearth silently watching her for a minute her face was quiet but faintly troubled and although she was looking at the fire and not her knitting the needles flashed steadily through the wool elsie had beautiful hands but they were capable and strong and it was not often that she allowed her feelings to interfere with her work  to tell what you meant to do and couldnt sounds pretty weak but i had two objects when i came home he said i wanted to help dick and keep him out of trouble but the proper kind of help needs tact and i havent much besides theres something peculiarly elusive about dick you think you have him so to speak in a corner and the next moment he slips away from you sometimes i suspect hes a good deal more clever than we imagine  elsie nodded  yes i know what you mean but youre a very good friend of his and it wouldnt be like you to give him up  i dont mean to give him up but just now it looks as if i could get no farther thats the trouble  you mean part of it said elsie quietly what was your other object  andrew hesitated  it was rather vague but i thought i might somehow be usefulto the country im lame and cant enlist i cant give much money but i might perhaps help to watch the coast then there was the eskdale road you know my hobby  elsie stopped her knitting and gave him a steady look  and after a time you thought you saw a way to be of use you found out something  yes he said in a disturbed voice still it looked as if i couldnt go on with the thing some of the clues broke off and those i tried to follow led me into difficulties you cant act on faint suspicion it might lead to unnecessary complications  one must take a risk now and then elsie answered i mean do ones duty and face the consequences  andrew did not reply and she picked up her knitting  well peace must come sometime she said have you thought what you will do then  yes if i could see dick starting well as the owner of appleyard and better still safely married id go away again  what do you mean by safely married  i think you know hes such a good sort and a girl who understood him and was patient with his failings would soon help him to get rid of them shed make the most of his good points and dick has talents  are there girls like that  yes said andrew firmly i am quite sure that i know one  elsie gave him a curious glance  but youre only thinking of dick what about yourself  oh he said with a brave effort to be cheerful i dont count for much ive no money and no particular ability beyond being able to sail a boat still i have the sea and im fond of wandering its a pretty good old world after all and if you keep an open mind you make friends wherever you go  but it must hurt to leave the old ones  yes he agreed with a hint of strain it hurts very much but you never leave them altogether things change of course but you can come back if you are wanted  he left her rather abruptly and elsie dropped her work and sat looking into the fire a curious gentle smile on her face andrew was true to the core he would never seek his own advantage when it conflicted with his loyalty to his friends now he was willing to sacrifice himself for dick though perhaps his poverty influenced him too still he should seeelsie resolutely picked up her knitting she must not indulge in disturbing thoughts like theseand the belts must be finished shivering men worn with stern fighting in flanders needed them     chapter xxiv  the buoyed channel   a bitter east wind was blowing through light mist though the moon was in the sky when andrew came out of a little shop in a lonely village near the galloway coast he carried a basket of provisions and wore a thick jersey and oilskins but he shivered as he looked down the street it was empty and dark except for a faint yellow glow here and there in the windows of the small white houses that rose abruptly from the rough pavement  dicks a long time in getting the eggs he said to whitney  thats so weve been most half an hour buying the few things you wanted hes probably talking to somebody making friends with strangers is a way he has particularly when he knows were waiting  i could suggest another explanation andrew replied  he looked round at a clatter of heavy boots and saw two dark figures against a square of light then a door was shut and dick came up with a man who wore an oilskin cap and jersey dick was awkwardly holding a big paper bag  its no a good night said the seaman i wouldna say but we might have a shift o wind before long theyre telling me ye have brought up in the west bay  for the night said andrew its an exposed place  its a that if the wind comes from the southard it will take good groundtackle to hold ye  what about the burnfoot gutter  its snug enough but ye might have to stop a week ye canna beat oot when theres any sea running on the sands  are there any geese about  weel i did see two or three bernicle a week ago but if its shooting ye want yell have to gang doon west the geese have moved on but i hear the duck are throng on the flats roon deefoot behind the ross  andrew said nothing he had picked up dick at kirkcudbright on the dee but had not seen a duck about the river mouth it seemed that the man had learned that they came from the head of solway but did not know they were then returning from the west he left them at the end of the village and andrew then asked dick what had kept him  the eggs dick grinned jim insisted on them and i didnt want to disappoint him though theyre scarce just now i should advise him to take them before they smash im not clever at carrying eggs in a paper bag  where did you get them whitney asked as he took the bag  where do you think when youre in doubt in a scotch clachan its safe to try the changehouse  i suppose that means the saloon said whitney well i suspected something of the kind  leaving the road outside the village they struck across some wet fields and came to a marsh through which a muddy creek wound crookedly after jumping deep drains and floundering through rushes they reached a steep bank of gravel with a cut where the creek made its way to the sea a mooring buoy floated in the channel and across the channel lay a waste of sand dotted with shallow pools this ran seaward until it was lost in the haze  an old shooting punt that andrew had repaired lay upon the gravel and they dragged her down as she was larger than usual and the big gun had been unshipped for the voyage she would carry them all though her shallow hull was deep in the water and the yacht some distance off they had brought their ordinary shoulder guns on the chance of getting a shot at geese or duck the village was about a mile away and the spot looked strangely desolate although a raised causeway lined by stunted thorns that ran back into the mist seemed to suggest that a road came down to the sands across the creek  andrew took the long paddle when they pushed off and the tide carried them away between muddy banks veined with tiny rivulets of water in coming soon after high tide they had crossed the sands following the line of beach but now they must head seaward until they could round the end of the projecting shoal soon the banks got lower and the riband of water widened and then a tall upright branch rose ahead of them  that perch is new since i was here last andrew remarked who was the fellow you were talking to dick  i dont know he told me he had a boat at the burnfoot but the fishing wasnt good  they drifted on until a strong ripple broke the surface ahead a small black object tossed in the disturbed patch  whats that asked whitney looks like a lobster trap  lobsters prefer stones said andrew i dont think there are any here but well see if you get hold of the buoy anyhow it will let me stop paddling and throw some water out  he headed across the channel and whitney crouching on deck seized the ring of corks the punt swung round sharply with her bow to the stream and there was an angry splash against her planks whitney was glad to ease the strain on his arms by making fast the wet line  the tides running strong he said  andrew nodded  the buoys not on a lobster creel or wed have pulled it up i wonder what depth there is  he pushed down the doubleended paddle which as used in shooting punts is about nine feet long and touched bottom when it was wet halfway up then he held the blade against the stream until the punt sheered across the channel dragging the line with her when he tried again this time he could not find bottom  it looks as if the corks are meant to mark a corner of the bank he said in a way thats curious because fishermen dont often bother about a buoy they know the ground and are satisfied with sounding with an oar  andrew began to bail her out and whitney and dick sat on the after deck while he caught the water which ran toward them in the bailing can  what about the geese whitney asked  the man mentioned bernicle and id expect to find them on the outer end of the flat because its soft ground and bernicle get their food in the mud besides id like to see how this channel runs as the sands dry theres more water than i thought suppose we leave the punt and walk down the edge as its lower than the top of the bank wed be out of sight  ill stay in the punt said dick im not fond of crawling through soft mud then if you put up some birds theyll probably fly over me  they paddled ashore and left him with the punt andrew showing him two small rollers which would help him to launch her if he wished to come after them the sand was soft and made a sucking noise about their seaboots but this was the only sound except the faint ripple of the tide the shore was hidden and there was nothing visible beyond the stretch of sloppy flat that vanished into the mist the haze however was not thick and faint moonlight filtered through  what do you expect to find here whitney asked  i dont know im curious about the buoy and i imagine that the fellow dick was with wanted us to clear out he was right in saying that wed brought up in an exposed place but why did he tell us ducks were plentiful down west  whitney made a sign of agreement  its certainly suspicious  they went on while the sand got softer but they saw nothing except a few small wading birds and a blackbacked gull then andrew stopped near the outer end of the bank something black floated in the midst of a tideripple about forty yards away  another buoy and a bigger one marking the fairway to the gut he said thoughtfully with that and the compass course to the corks we saw id take a boat drawing eight feet up to the burnfoot at five hours flood on an average tide  eight feet draught would give you a pretty big boat a vessel of about a hundred tons would float on that but what would bring her here  thats the point said andrew i believe old wooden schooners sometimes take cargoes of coal up these gutters and dump it into carts on the beach but im not quite satisfied  he turned suddenly as he heard a flapping of canvas and a few moments later a tall dark shape emerged from the haze at first it had no clear outline but andrew knew it was the topsail of a cutterrigged boat beating in against the tide she grew in distinctness until they could see her black hull washed by a streak of foam and the straining mainsail slanted away from them the iron shoe of a trawlbeam projected between her shrouds and the net hung in a dark festoon over her weather side the wind was abeam just there and she passed them sailing fast but they waited knowing that it would draw ahead where the channel curved presently there was a banging of canvas that suddenly swung upright and then filled and vanished on the other tack  smart work andrew commented theyll have about twenty yards of deep water to gather way in before they bring her round again against the stream the fellows who can beat her round that bend dont need buoys id like to take some bearings this gutters very sketchily indicated on the chart  shore bearings wouldnt be of much use to anybody who wanted to come up in the dark  thats true andrew agreed thoughtfully but we came for geese and we may as well make our way back across the middle of the sand  after a while they found a nearly dry gutter and moved up it cautiously until andrew stopped out of the dark came a clear high note the clanging cry of the bernicle geese it was answered from one side and behind and then a measured fanning became audible this swelled into a rhythmic creak as the broad wings beat the air  the men crouched low with tingling nerves clenching their guns and straining for the first glimpse of the approaching birds  flying low and right over andrew whispered fire when you see the first  whitney got down on one knee while the ooze soaked through his trousers and ran into his seaboot but this did not matter it was worth sinking waistdeep to hear the wild call break out close ahead a dark object planing downward on extended wings shot out of the mist another came close behind and the gunbutt jarred whitneys shoulder while smoke blew into his eyes he swung the gun as he pulled the second trigger and saw a red flash leap out and then the dark was filled with a harsh clamor and the furious beat of wings andrew jerked his gun open and the burnt cartridges shot out while smoke curled about the breach  two i think he said yours is up the bank  whitney found it presently a small blackbreasted goose  my first bernicle he said with a thrill of pride theyre more like a big duck than the heavy lag birds weve already bagged do you think dick will get a shot  he ought to they were flying straight up the bank  they waited a few minutes but no gunshot came out of the mist and when everything was silent they turned back down the gutter  the geese wont alight again andrew said as dick knows that hell probably launch the punt and come to meet us  when they reached the edge of the water whitney stopped and lighted his pipe  its pretty soft farther on lets wait here for the punt he suggested  he had nearly smoked his pipe out when they heard the splash of a paddle and presently the punt crept out of the mist its low graypainted hull was hard to see but dicks form was more distinct and andrew made an abrupt movement as he watched him he sat facing forward on the after deck and he lurched clumsily from side to side as he dipped the paddle the punt was not going straight but sheered about and dick did not seem to be making for the bank this projected in a short cape not far away and then the sand ran back toward the east leaving a stretch of rippling water that vanished in the haze the tide was rapidly running seaward and the wind blew off the flat  dip to leeward andrew shouted head her up for the point  dick stopped and flourished his paddle  im not coming ashore he answered with a chuckle do you good to walk back jims getting fat  whitney looked at andrew in alarm  yes hes drunk andrew said with an impatient sign  it was plain to both that the situation was not free from danger a shooting punt with its sides only from six to eight inches high is essentially a smoothwater craft and is easily swamped in spite of her deck there was a good breeze and if dick passed the short point he would risk being blown out to sea the tide did not follow the sweep of bank but ran straight out  dont be a fool andrew shouted run her in at once  dick sat hunched up with the paddle on the deck and they heard him laugh  its quite oll ri he answered neednt bother about me im going to look for submarinesh  andrew ran toward the point and whitney following tore two buttons off his oilskin jacket as he tried to unfasten them with numbed fingers he wore ordinary serge trousers and heavy seaboots but the punt must be stopped before she drifted past the little cape afterward it would be too late  andrew reached the spot first while the punt was still upstream of it and at once plunged in but whitney who had now got rid of his oilskin stopped and tried to pull off his long wet boots he hardly thought andrew could wade out far enough and one of them might have to swim he was furious with dick but the boy must be rescued he got his boots off and went in up to his knees but then he stopped for he would not be needed if his comrade could reach the punt andrew was waistdeep but still floundering on when dick laughing hoarsely threw something at him it fell into the water but the next shot was better aimed for whitney saw an egg smash on andrews oilskin cap  another struck him in the face but the punt was near now and after a few more floundering strides andrew threw himself forward the craft lurched as he fell across her deck and whitney thought she would capsize but the next moment andrew flung dick into the well and then kneeling on the deck brought the craft ashore with a few strokes of the paddle  whitney felt very cold and he was getting stiffly on board when andrew asked  hadnt you better bring your coat and boots  whitney found it a relief to laugh as he went back for the things and andrew pushed the punt off when he got on board  ill paddle while you keep the young ass in the well he said knock him down if he tries to get up  dont want to get up dick remarked quite snug down here only trouble is im sitting in the eggs  i think thats correct said whitney in is the proper word theres rather a mess on your face too  good shot ole man dick observed with a grin  andrew said nothing as he swung the long paddle for the ripples were getting larger as they left the sand and the breeze was freshening but at last the yachts light twinkled in the mist getting on board they hustled dick below where andrew stripped off his wet clothes and put him into his berth while whitney got the stove to burn  after a time dick put out his head  feel id like some supper before i go to sleep  you can go to sleep without it andrew said sternly i suppose theres no use in talking about it now but youve been warned that this kind of thing may kill you  im shured dick rejoined good big policy and i dont pay the premiums  who does pay them andrew asked in a quiet insistent voice but dick only grinned  thatsh secret ole man youre very good fellow but dont know everything dont bother me any more im sleepy  he was silent after this but whitney waited until he thought dick was really asleep  he looked sober when he joined us at the village he said  i think he was andrew agreed perhaps hed drunk enough to make him want more and brought a bottle away no doubt well find it when we clean up the punt then he forced a smile youll have to go without your eggs  thats obvious but what did he mean about his being insured and somebody elses paying the premiums  i dont know and dont expect to get any more information when hes sober but ill see what mackellar thinks sometimes i feel like giving up the whole business dicks too clever for me and when i turn to the other matter im brought to a full stop  whitney nodded sympathetically  its an awkward job but you wont let up youre not a quitter and luck or mackellar may help you through  he got into his cot and the regular splash of ripples against the boats side and the soft slapping of the halyards on the mast soon made him drowsy but the last thing he saw was andrew sitting on the opposite locker with a stern thoughtful face     chapter xxv  a clue   there was a touch of frost in the still air and the light was fading a yellow glow lingered in the southwest beyond criffells sloping shoulder which ran up against it tinged a deep violet masses of soft gray cloud floated above the mountains summit but the sky was clear overhead and a thin new moon grew brighter in the east this was why the murmur of the sea came out of the distance in a muffled roar for the tides run fast when the moon is young  elsie walking homeward vacantly noticed how bright the crescent gleamed above the dusky firs as she entered the gloom of a straggling wood at the foot of the hill on which appleyard was built she had been out all the afternoon and now she shrank from going home for she felt that a shadow rested upon the house dick had returned from a cruise with andrew looking dejected and unwell and she was glad that whitney had taken both away again on his motorcycle because dick had lately had fits of moody restlessness when he was at home still she missed them badly for her mother was silent and preoccupied and when andrew was away she found it hard to banish the troubles that seemed to be gathering round they were worse for being very vaguely defined but she felt convinced that something sinister was going on  as she thought of andrew her face grew gentle and she smiled she knew his worth and his limitations and loved him for both he had his suspicions too and would follow where they led andrew was not the man to shirk a painful duty but she could not openly help him yet that might come and in the meanwhile she would at least put no obstacle in his way still if her fears were justified the situation was daunting and she might need all her courage  as she neared the lodge she saw a man loitering in the shadow  are you waiting for somebody jock she asked  marshall the fisherman turned and looked at her thoughtfully  weel he said they telt me mr andrews no at home  did you want to see him about the yacht  it wasna that athegither  no  ye see ive missed him twice and im for stranraer the morn were gaun west to try the herring fishing  and you wanted to tell mr johnstone something before you left can i give him a message when he comes back  marshall hesitated  weel he said ye can tell him that the nance cam up the firth the night before he started for edinbro thats a while ago ye mind last night she cam up again wi the same crew the edinbro man i telt him o anither wha keeps a trawl boat doon the colvend shore and yin who has a reid mustache  elsie started and then wondered whether she had betrayed her surprise  ill try to remember i suppose this is for mr johnstone alone  just that said marshall im thinking it would be better that ye telt naebody else  he moved off and elsie looking round a moment afterward saw that he had vanished it was nearly dark among the trees but she knew that she could have seen him had he kept on the road besides his heavy tacketed boots would have made some noise and she had heard nothing then she saw a figure coming from the lodge and her brain acted quickly because she recognized staffer  marshall had hinted it was important that his message should be kept secret and fishermen had good sight he must have noticed staffer before she did and did not want to be seen talking to her then she remembered that the night before andrew started for edinburgh was when williamson and the man with the red mustache had entered the house the stranger had come up the firth in one of the salmon boats shortly before his visit to appleyard and had been there again without her seeing him  she felt a thrill that was half apprehension and half excitement as she went on slowly the lodge was about a hundred yards away when she met staffer  theres something i want to ask you he said have you any reason to doubt the honesty of our servants  elsie saw at once where his question led and tried to nerve herself he was a clever man and she was young and inexperienced  no she said i have none and mothers quite satisfied with them why do you ask  youll remember the night williamson arrived rather late he lost a paper in an envelope and it looks as if somebody in the house had picked it up  have you inquired about it elsie asked remembering that it was the man with the red mustache who had dropped the envelope  no staffer said carelessly i didnt want to make the thing look more important than it was and i thought the envelope might turn up  but it must be of some consequence or you wouldnt bother about it now  thats obviously true it has become important since we lost it it gave us some particulars that we find we cant remember  staffer gave her a scrutinizing look  it was dropped in the house he said slowly somebody must have found it  elsie wondered whether he suspected her he had seen her looking down from the landing and might not have been satisfied that she had come to see who was in the house the men had been careful to make no noise  staffer frowned when she did not answer  if the thing doesnt turn up he declared ill dismiss everybody about the place we cant have people round us whom its impossible to trust  none of the servants found it elsie said with forced quietness  you seem strangely sure of it  elsie hesitated she could not allow innocent people to suffer for what she had done but the matter had greater issues though much was dark it was clear that she and andrew were on one side and staffer and his friends on the other andrew could be trusted but staffer could not for all that she felt the tie of kinship and could not act treacherously to him  i am sure she said slowly because i found the envelope myself  although the light was bad she saw his face change and she grew suddenly afraid there was a fury in his eyes that made her quail but he kept his selfcontrol  so you were downstairs that night  yes she said and waited with tingling nerves though she thought the worst was past for a moment or two she had perhaps been in danger  what did you do with the thing he asked harshly did you give it to andrew johnstone  why do you think i did that  staffer saw he had blundered by hinting that the paper related to matters which might concern andrew  never mind answer me  i burned it at once without opening it  he looked at her as if he found this impossible to believe  it is quite true she said with forced calm  but why you steal a letter belonging to my guest which you must have thought important and then burn it unread do you expect me to understand your action the thing seems purposeless  it isnt easy to explain but i must try she answered nerving herself for an effort  thats obvious  she hesitated a moment and then spoke bravely  i knew that something not right was going on at appleyard  ah did you know what it was  elsie made a negative sign  i really didnt want to know but i believed that the letter was dangerous if i had read it i might have felt forced to tell what i found out so i put it straight into the fire  knowing that its loss might embarrass williamson or me  yes she said i thought of that but i felt it would be safer for us all if i burned the paper  i suppose you understand that what you have admitted must make a difference you have set yourself deliberately against me  if i had meant to injure you i would have kept the letter but i wont urge this if appleyard were yours i would go away at once but it is dicks and he could not get on without my mother  then you mean to stay and continue spying on my guests  so long as no harm comes to dick or andrew i shall leave you and your friends alone  staffer laughed  im afraid youre letting your imagination run away with you what harm could come to either of them through me but well say no more about it just now  he left her at the door and she went to her room and threw herself down on her couch feeling rather limp for the strain had told on her besides her suspicions now were no longer vague she had found a clue and she began to see where it led andrew was obviously watching the mouth of the firth while rankine had some mysterious business farther west marshall thought it well that andrew should know that the man with the red mustache had come from the suspected neighborhood late at night in a salmon boat the man had been at appleyard where he dropped an important letter and williamson and staffer were in league with him from all this it looked as if their business were treasonable  this filled her with alarm but she was glad she had told staffer that she found the envelope after all he was her uncle and to have kept silence would have been treacherous but the struggle between family obligations and her duty to the state got keener it was unthinkable that she should spy upon a kinsman to whom she owed much but would she not in a sense be an accomplice if she allowed him and the others to carry on their plots this question however was dismissed for a time there were other points to think about  did staffer imagine she was in andrews confidence and secretly helping him and had he believed her statement that she had destroyed the letter if not she was perhaps in some danger because his laughing remark about her imagination had not been convincing but after all what could he do she could hardly be kidnapped and smuggled out of the country and it was of course absurd to think of his attempting anything worse  after a while she began to see her way she would not watch her uncle but if chance brought her clear proof that he was helping her countrys enemies she would see that he was stopped this was a compromise that she suspected could hardly be justified but the next decision was easier because it had to do with those she loved if staffer or his friends plotted any harm to dick or andrew she would remorselessly use every weapon she had against him  then she roused herself and bathed her face and hands for she had felt some physical strain while she thrashed out the painful matter she would need calm and courage to meet staffer as if nothing had happened so that her mother might not suspect trouble the part she had chosen was difficult but she must play it out when she went in to dinner she did not know whether she was relieved or not by staffers smile but he talked to her with the suave goodhumor he generally showed  two days after elsies talk with jock marshall andrew and whitney were sitting in a melrose hotel when a postcard from stranraer was brought to andrew there was a tarry fingermark at the bottom alongside of the straggling signature j marshall andrew read it aloud        as im away at the fishing it might be weel if ye       cam home and lookit after the boat miss elsie will       give ye a bit message i would not leave her until the       tides get low  whitney smiled  you scots are a remarkably cautious and capable lot he said i can imagine the wrinkled old image writing this with a wooden face and a chuckle inside the meaning of the last sentence is cleverly ambiguous i suppose the boat is quite all right  of course no tide could hurt her  its plain then that marshall thinks youre wanted on miss woodhouses account i can have the motorcycle ready in five minutes and if we pull out now we can be home soon after dark will you tell dick  no well put him on the train if there is one get that railway guide  whitney opened it  if you mean to see him off youll have to wait an hour and on the whole i think youd better he seems to have made a number of acquaintances in the bar anyway with this light frost the roads will be good and hard  dick showed some unwillingness to leave the town but andrew was firm and put him on the train when it started he joined whitney who was waiting with the motorcycle  the light was getting dim as they ran down the long dip to hawick though pale saffron barred with leaden gray shone above the western hills when they swept down the last hill frosty mist hung about the woolen mills in the hollow and whitney throttled his engine as they jolted past glimmering lights and halfseen houses  it doesnt look very cheerful for a fiftymile run but i suppose you want to get on he remarked  yes said andrew i hope dick wont miss the train at one of the junctions but hell be all right if he reaches carlisle he cant well get into trouble at the place we stay at there  the mist melted into the keen brightness of a frosty night as they climbed beside teviot to the snowsprinkled moors whitneys eyes were watering and his hands numb as they crossed the high watershed  we havent lost much time so far but i suppose id better let her go her best he said there oughtnt to be much traffic on the road  andrew nodded and pulled the rug tighter round him as the motorcycle leaped forward down the hill he was eager to get back for he felt anxious it was not for nothing that marshall had warned him that he was wanted  there was moonlight in the shallow depression that led down from the summit but soon the hilltops rose higher and they plunged into a dark glen a glimmer of light flashed up to meet them and as the sidecar rocking wildly raced past the mosspaul hotel andrew remembered what had happened there a few months previously he had seen since then that dick had not been in much danger when staffers car swerved the risk of being struck down had been run by him only well that did not matter much if any one was threatened now it was neither himself nor dick and it was horrible to feel that elsie might be in some danger whitney was driving recklessly fast but andrew frowned impatiently as he watched the hillsides unfold out of the dark and rush by while the throbbing of the engine filled the narrow glen  they swung out at ewes doors leaning over hard as the car took the curve with an inch or two between the wheel and the drop to the burn then the widening valley grew bright again and they raced up and down rolling hillsides past scattered farms and white cothouses until the lights of langholm stretched across the hollow whitney slowed his engine here but they narrowly escaped the wall as they took the bridge below the town and then sped on again furiously through the woods that line the brawling esk  appleyard was reached in time for dinner and andrew was relieved to find that staffer was not at home everything was as usual it was difficult to imagine any cause for alarm and he wondered whether he had been needlessly disturbed after dinner mrs woodhouse took whitney into the drawingroom and andrew found elsie knitting in a corner of the hall  she looked up with a smile when he sat down near her  havent you come home earlier than you planned she asked  andrew studied her face it was quiet and undisturbed but he suspected a thoughtfulness that she meant to hide  yes he said i got a postcard from marshall hes at stranraer and seemed to think i ought to look after the boat  the boat but its fine weather isnt she quite safe  oh the tides are pretty high and run up the gutter fast  elsie counted her stitches and then gave him a quiet look  dick was with you she said so it couldnt have been on his account that you came back  andrew smiled  thats obvious  elsie was silent for a moment while a faint touch of color crept into her face his explanation about the boat had not deceived her and she had noted his searching glance when he first came in marshall must have been hiding near by when she was talking to staffer and have given andrew a hint it was for her sake he had hurried back she knew that he had hurried because she had tactfully led whitney into making some admissions about their speed she hardly thought she had been in actual danger but she knew that she was quite safe now and her heart went out to the man who had come to help if only she could confide in him but it was impossible his very loyalty to her made her feel more strongly that she could not betray her uncle and bring disgrace upon her mother  marshall gave me a message for you she said ill deliver it as nearly as i can  she watched him as she repeated the fishermans words andrew was a bad actor and she was not misled by his clumsy indifference it looked as if he knew that the man with the red mustache had dealings with williamson and staffer  thank you he said im afraid well have to go west again before long  elsie put down her knitting  youll be careful andrew i want you to keep out of danger  his heart beat fast for he saw that she was anxious about him elsie knew something and would be sorry if he got hurt but he must not alarm her or show where his suspicions led  of course i will he answered cheerfully as a matter of fact im not running much risk  id rather you didnt think so it leads to carelessness you wont be rash  certainly not tell me why you are anxious  elsie hesitated and the color in her face grew deeper  somehow i seem to feel that trouble is hanging over us andher voice dropped to a caressi want to have you near  andrew caught his breath  elsie mrs woodhouse interrupted i think mr whitney would like to have some music     chapter xxvi  tightening the meshes   andrew spent a week at appleyard without noticing anything that caused him uneasiness and then he got a letter from rankine asking him to meet him in the pool behind the ross near kirkcudbright he did not want to go but he thought that he could get back in three or four days and staffer was to be away from home besides dick would be there to take care of elsie  sailing at hightide with a keen east wind blowing down the firth he found water across the sands to the mouth of the nith where he left the boat and drove to dumfries here he and whitney called upon mackellar and were taken into his private office  i have some news that may surprise ye the banker said dicks principal creditor is his stepfather heres a list o his obligations though im no sure its complete  ah exclaimed andrew i dont know whether im surprised or not but i begin to see a light he frowned as he noted the figures it wont be an easy matter to pay this off the estate will feel the strain for some time but how has the young idiot got rid of the money  betting  but he doesnt go to many races and turf accountants wouldnt deal with a boy under age  verra true mackellar agreed dryly dick would get somebody else to put the money on for himor at least thats no doubt what he thought he did williamson or one o his friends would be willing  why do you say its what dick thought  i have my doubts whether his gobetween made the bets at all where was the need the fellow had only to take the money when dick lost  but dicks not a fool he wouldnt back the wrong horse every time he reads the sporting papers and i suppose their forecasts are right now and then  mackellar smiled  if hes no a fool hes near it a tip anybody can buy for a penny is no of much account but its flattering to feel ye ken the secrets o the inside ring staffers friends would see he had that satisfaction in other words theyd tell him how he ought to bet with them and although theyd let him win at times i imagine they found it a profitable game  it must be stopped said andrew  just so but ye would prefer it to be stopped quietly theres another thing i learned and ye put me on the track when ye told me what dick said about his being insured a policy has been taken out for a large sum  andrew made an abrupt movement and whitney looked puzzled  thats pretty hard to understand his is not the kind of life theyd take except at a big premium  it gave me something to think about and i have no come to the bottom o it yet its possible the insurance was effected some time ago before dicks weakness had developed his parents were sound and it was long before we suspected there was anything wrong with him however i had an interview with the companys local agent and afterward with the edinburgh manager  what did you learn andrew asked  nothing much in fact im thinking i met my match the heads o that office are men o some ability and i had no good ground for interference for a that they know something and if it was offered the bank in the way o business i would not make a big advance against the policy  in whose favor is it drawn whitney asked  i canno tell ye they were verra reserved gentlemen but the name would no be staffers though the transaction would be ultimately to his benefit mr staffers a man o retiring habits  andrew was silent for a minute and then looked up  i see now that i have suspected something like this from the beginning he said what are we to do  mackellars face hardened  i think well see mr staffer and tell him what we know its possible hell fight but thats no what i would expect im most concerned about dicks attitude we canno do much if hes against us  dick has been rather a puzzle lately ill be away for a few days but well interview staffer as soon as im back  mackellar said that he expected to call at appleyard shortly and would make an appointment then and andrew and whitney drove back to the yacht getting under way at once they sailed downchannel with the last of the ebb between wastes of drying sand and dusk found them slowly forging out to sea against the incoming flood they met rankine where he had arranged and carrying out his instructions sailed east again one evening late they landed from the dinghy at the mouth of the buoyed gutter it was near lowwater and the tide had run far out fine rain was falling and it was very dark but as they waded ashore through the fringe of splashing ripples an indistinct figure appeared at the edge of the bank  is that you jock andrew called and marshall came up  i startit when yere letter came and mistress wilson at the wee shop in the clachan has taen me in he said  did you keep the letter  na said marshall i pit it in the fire  andrew nodded  then i suppose you understand what you are to do  im to try the netfishing for flounders and keep my een open though its no just the season the flatfish come up on the banks they telt me at the clachan there were verra few to be had but i allooed they couldna be scarcer than loch ryan herring  hes got it right whitney laughed come along and take your net youll have to carry it up the bank the dinghys loaded deep and the tides still running out  when they had dragged the net ashore marshall lighted a lantern and examined it carefully whitney picking up the light turned it on the fishermans wrinkled face and was not surprised to see a twinkle in his eyes  what do you think of it he asked  its gran gear but maybe a bit heavy for flounders i wouldna say but the heidrope would haud a shark  its better to be on the safe side whitney said with a laugh when you set a net you cant tell what youre going to catch thats why we brought you some iron pipes for the posts now youd better show us where you want the net put up  they went back and pushed off the dinghy while marshall plodded up the bank abreast of them with the net on his shoulder at a bend of the narrowing channel he hailed them  shell do herethough i dinna ken aboot the fishery board he said when they landed and gave him the iron posts yere no allooed to stop a throughrunning watter  ill be responsible for that andrew told him  then it would be a kind o pity to leave yon gutter open suggested marshall turning to whitney a floundernet in a runway only fishes on the ebb ye haul her up to the heidrope when the fish come in with the flood and let her doon when highwatters past then a thats gone by her canna get back onyway yons the usual plan but shed maybe fish better here if we keepit her doon with lead and pulled her up afterwards wi a heidrope tackle  i was going to suggest something of the kind andrew said youll want a boat but there are two or three old punts on the beach hire whichever you like and ill be accountable but what about the trawler fellow who keeps the boat at the point  they telt me hes awa doon west  good you can begin to put up your stakes using the pipe we have another job to look after but well come back when its done  whitney shoved the dinghy off and they paddled up the channel it was very dark and the rain made the obscurity worse but andrew searched one bank carefully as the dinghy crept along its edge everything was quiet for there seemed to be no birds about but they could hear the thud of marshalls hammer as he drove in the pipes whitney sitting aft felt damp and cold as the water trickled down his oilskins  how much do you think the old fellow suspects he asked  i cant tell he suspects something and i didnt try to put him off the track there were one or two reasons for thinking id better not anyway hes to be trusted wheres that corner buoy  whitney laughed  if you were anybody else id wager you wouldnt find it on a night like this you dont know it was on a corner to begin with  well andrew said im pretty confident about hitting it in the next few minutes  he pulled on steadily while the rain ran down his face and trickled from the dinghys thwarts the bank was scarcely distinguishable a few yards away but the water had not the opaque blackness of the sand and whitney scanned its surface narrowly there was not a ripple for the stream was slackening and the channel was smooth as oil except for the disturbance the dinghy made the water she displaced lapped upon the sand astern but there was nothing on the narrow dark strip ahead  you havent made a center shot this time he said presently  andrew laughed and pulling hard on one oar swung the dinghy round  the buoys certainly not in the water well try the bank the tide hadnt ebbed so far when we were here last  they landed and plowed through slushy sand at last whitney caught his foot in a rope  youve struck it after all he laughed as he followed up the rope to a ring of large netcorks now well get to work  returning to the spot where the rope came out of the sand he began to dig with a spade they had brought but he did not make much progress water and soft ooze ran back into the hole almost as fast as he could throw them out his heavy boots sank into the yielding ground and his oilskins hampered him greatly when he was hot and breathless andrew took the spade  the fellow who moored the buoy here didnt mean it to go adrift he remarked as he flung the wet sand about  the spade jarred upon something hard and andrew worked its edge under the object while whitney seized the rope for a time they tugged and wrenched at it and then when they were gasping and splashed all over a heavy stone slowly rolled out of its muddy bed andrew let it lie and walked back a short distance toward higher ground  the next step needs care he said we mustnt move the stone far because that would show that its position had been changed but the bank is steep and a few yards will make a difference if i can shorten the depth by half a fathom it will satisfy me  whitney chuckled  that ought to be enough when your draughts pretty deep its embarrassing to find half a fathom less water than you expect  andrew carefully estimated the difference of level along the bank  i think well put it here he decided  it took them some time to move and bury the heavy stone  what about the fairway buoy whitney asked when they had finished  well let that stay i want our man to get in and his troubles had better not begin until hes going back the flood would soon float the vessel off if she grounded going up but it will be a different matter coming down when the tides on the ebb  they pushed the dinghy off and whitney pulled away against the stream which was beginning to run up the channel the rain had got heavier but they could hear marshalls hammer as he drove down the stakes when they were abreast of him whitney stopped rowing for a few minutes the fisherman stood beside the dinghy while andrew gave him instructions and then he vanished into the gloom as whitney pulled away andrew lighted a small lantern and putting it beside a compass in the bottom of the craft kept his comrade on his course  harder with your left the tides on our port bow he said steady at that were round the point pull as even as you can  the sharper rise and fall and the splashing about the craft showed whitney that they had reached open water but he had no other guide they had left no light on the rowan and black darkness enveloped the dinghy the faint glow from the lantern in her bottom made it worse and all that whitney could see was andrews face and the wet front of his souwester as he bent over the compass the rest of his figure melted into the surrounding gloom whitney was tired and wet and gritty sand scraped the backs of his hands as the oilskin sleeves rubbed across them there was some risk of andrews not finding the yacht and he must pull hard to reach her before the tide got too strong  this was very different from yachting in hot weather on the canadian lakes and long island sound but it had a fascination he would not have thought possible a few months ago andrew and he were playing a bold and somewhat dangerous game the end of which he thought could not be long delayed as an american he had no stake on it except perhaps his life but he understood his comrades patriotic keenness and meant to see him through then he had read enough about the sinking of unarmed merchant ships and the drowning of the crews to fire his blood he thought this was excuse enough for not observing a strict neutrality then as he felt the dinghy lurch across the swell and heard the hoarse murmur of the surf upon the shoals he knew that the sport was in itself engrossing  he had caught the big gray trout of the lone northwest the bass and the fighting tarpon but he was now angling for fiercer prey and he hoped the murderous steel monsters that lurked in the dark water would rise to the bait they were handled with a relentless cunning that struck him as devilish and rankine had hinted that two of the largest and fastest were not far away lying in wait for a huge new battleship that was coming from the clyde whitney could not think calmly of her lurching under shattered by a torpedo with her swarming crew besides his partner had resolved that this should not happen  pull with your right said andrew shes sagging to leeard now  they crept on against the tide whitney panting as he tugged at the oars for he had enough and it was with keen satisfaction that he heard andrew call out presently  hard with your left let her swing i see the boat  whitney got a glimpse of a rocking mast as the dinghy came round and a few moments afterward he put out his hand to ease the shock as they ran alongside a quarter of an hour later the anchor was on deck and they went eastward with the flood under easy sail  you might put on the kettle it will be high water before were up the firth andrew said if we can get our business with staffer done tomorrow well sail again for the wreck as soon as it gets dark  whitney hesitated a moment  no doubt you see the consequences if we catch our man at work  theyre obvious but they must be faced andrew said in a hard voice ive held back longer than i should but it wasnt for my own sake and i cant shirk my duty now     chapter xxvii  the reckoning day   it was getting dark in the library at appleyard and mackellar stopped speaking when a servant entered to light the lamps staffer leaned back in his chair as if the interruption were a relief but mackellar sat grim and upright watching him irvine the other executor of dicks fathers will nervously fingered his goldrimmed eyeglasses and andrew found the servants deliberate movements exasperating he wanted the matter settled the situation was painful and galling to his family pride and the cautious way that mackellar had led up to the climax had tried his patience so far staffer had made no reply  at last the servant withdrew and the feeling of tension grew keener after the soft snap of the closing door they could now see one anothers faces and all looked somewhat strained no one spoke for a few moments and irvine began to polish his eyeglasses with his handkerchief  it might now be well if mr staffer would tell us his views he said i think mr mackellar has made ours plain  staffer seemed to rouse himself  its obvious that you want to get rid of me your suggestion is that i should relinquish control of dick and leave appleyard at once  precisely said irvine i see no other way  does your demand extend to my sister and niece  certainly not mackellar replied we all think it would be an advantage if mrs woodhouse stayed at appleyard and with dicks consent we would make her a suitable allowance the management of the household could not be in better hands  thats some relief said staffer now in the ordinary course of things my authority here would terminate very soon when dick is twentyone and i should be willing to go then is it worth while to make a drastic change which would inconvenience everybody for so short a time  andrew was somewhat surprised by staffers half conciliatory attitude but he thought he saw anxiety in the mans face it looked as if he had some strong reason for not wanting to leave appleyard just yet  our opinion is that it would be well worth while irvine said dryly  suppose i refuse to go how do you propose to turn me out  well apply for the necessary powers mackellar answered  do you mind telling me what grounds you mean to urge  mackellar sorted the papers in his hand and andrew marked his quiet deliberation indeed in spite of a certain feeling of tension the proceedings had so far been characterized by a curious calm perhaps this was because three of the actors were scotch but andrew felt that the calm was deceptive the situation had strong dramatic force  i cannot see why ye should not know mackellar replied i would begin by proving undue and dangerous influence on a young man of extravagant habits who had been placed in your charge  can you prove it  weel these figures relating to money lent and bills discounted would go some length particularly when it was shown that ye concealed the part ye took by acting through agents  he read out particulars of the money borrowed with the high rate of interest charged and traced the transactions back to staffer through other hands it was a telling accusation and andrew thought staffer was surprised and alarmed by mackellars knowledge  im not sure that we could not establish a charge o conspiracy mackellar concluded  there is no fraud staffer declared hotly the terms were stated dick knew what he would have to pay  he did not know to whom he would have to pay it irvine interposed  staffer was silent for a moment  you can do nothing without dicks consent he said slowly why did you not let him speak for himself are you afraid of him  we found ye had sent him to dumfries and we thought ye would prefer that he was not consulted yet but theres another matter the insurance policy by which we have ground for believing ye would ultimately benefit  what do you know about that  at present we do not know everything but theres much that we suspect considering the state o dicks health  staffer looked at him keenly  do you imply that dicks health is very bad he asked  ye should ken  andrew thought staffer looked puzzled as if he suspected the other of knowing more than he did himself  well is it your intention to dispute my claim or disown dicks debts  mackellar took up a paper  no at all heres a memorandum of our terms which ye would be wise in agreeing to ill read them out  staffer smiled  then if threats prove useless you mean to bribe me to go very well give me another three months here and ill accept  our offer is made on the understanding that you leave at once  then im afraid youll have to turn me outand you may find it rather hard but you havent answered a point i raised suppose dick takes my side and insists upon my staying  our being executors would warrant our interference and theres another party on whose behalf we could make a plea mr andrew johnstone could claim the protection o his interest as the next heir on the grounds o the direct inheritors dangerous health  would you urge this in court  if we were forced mackellar said dryly  staffers selfcontrol gave way and he turned to andrew with a savage sneering laugh  so you are responsible for the extraordinary line these gentlemen have taken you have been counting on your cousins death  andrew flushed  as you well know i came home from canada to take care of him still i agree with the executors if you can still persuade dick to believe in you he must be saved in spite of himself  staffer gave him a curious look it was plain that andrew was his most troublesome antagonist there was something in staffers expression that disturbed the others  very well he said you must do what you think fit i shall remain at appleyard  he rose as if to intimate that there was no more to be said and andrew accompanied the others to the car that was waiting at the door and afterward found whitney and told him what they had done  youll have to be careful partner whitney cautioned he might be dangerous now  well andrew replied thoughtfully i must try to avoid risks but we must get down the firth tonight and youd better bring the motorcycle round as soon as you can  a quarter of an hour later andrew came downstairs dressed in a thick jersey and his old boating clothes and met elsie in the hall she thought his face looked unusually stern  are you going to sea again tonight she asked in surprise  yes i didnt know beforehand whether i could get away until tomorrow as a matter of fact i dont want to go at all but i must  she put her hand gently on his arm  if you feel its your duty you must go but im anxious andrew and youll be careful for my sake you see i have come to depend on you and i feel that something is threatening us all  he thrilled at her touch and it cost him a stern effort to stand as if unmoved while he noted the tenderness in her eyes and the flicker of color in her face  you mustnt imagine things  tell me the truth andrew am i mistaken  well he said quietly perhaps appleyard has so to speak been under a cloud for a little while but i see the light breaking in fact the shadow may be gone in the next few days but you may need some courageand i know you have it  ah she said you mean that something may happen here  im sorry i cant tell you anything now andrew replied with an embarrassed air i may be able to do so when i come back  she gave him her hand with a gentle look  then i must wait but you wont be rash remember that i shall be anxious about you  he left her and for a while she sat quietly in the hall andrew was not going on a shooting cruise it was some more serious business she had already connected it with rankine and the sinking of the merchant ships the reasons that led her to this conclusion were not very clear but she felt that williamson and the man with the red mustache had something to do with the matter she wondered whether she ought to warn andrew but she felt that she could not betray her uncle unless she was certain that andrew was in danger  she roused herself when she heard the car outside madge whitney was coming to spend a week with them shortly after madges arrival dick returned from dumfries looking ill and when the party gathered in the drawingroom after dinner conversation dragged it was a relief when mrs woodhouse suggested that they go to bed elsie went with madge to her room and they sat together on a low divan before the fire  now madge said whats the matter with you all  i dont know said elsie i dont feel very gay but you didnt cheer us much im sorry your head aches  the trip was pretty bad but i had a little adventure  madge smiled charmingly  what elsie asked indifferently  when we stopped at dumfries i got out to get a paper and as i ran along the platform i bumped into a man whod come from the cars across the track he had his hands full of things and said a kind of swear in german when he dropped them all about  in german elsie exclaimed  sure well i didnt want him to miss the train so i picked up the nearest thing it was a nice little box that flew open and i thought it had a clock in it he got into my car and began to apologize in very good english and then i asked him what was in the box i thought he hesitated but he showed me that it was a compass with a brass thing that turned around its top and had two little slits for looking through  an azimuth andrew has one theyre used when you want to be accurate in taking bearings but go on  theres not much more he was rather a charming man and had been in america we talked all the way to annan where he got out  what was he like  tall and big with a sunburned face very light blue eyes hair between red and brown he looked like a sailora captain or something of the kind though he was dressed plainly in thick blue clothes and had a bundle of oil slickers  had he a red mustache  he had none at all but i guess it would be red if he let it grow do you know him  no elsie said quietly at least im not sure  madge gave her a keen look  you make me curious i went into detail because you are more interested than you want to show of course i thought it strange that a man who spoke good english should relieve his feelings in german when he felt annoyed and afterward try to convince me that he wasnt a foreigner i think he did try and that was the reason he talked so much  i was thinking about the compass you said it was in a nice little box they use things like that on small yachts and boats  this one was about as long as your hand where does the other track that runs into dumfries come from  from glasgow  oh said madge you build warships there dont you  she opened her traveling bag and took out a timetable which contained a map of scotland  look at this she said indicating stranraer portpatrick and ramsey rankines been at these places because ive had notes from him and you see how they command the way out from the clyde his business doesnt stop at making charts  has he told you so  no madge blushed prettily still hes admitted something you see we are friends besides hes a smart officer they wouldnt waste a man like him on taking soundings that would be quite absurd  elsies smile was sympathetic for she thought she understood her friends belief in rankines talents  hes here on guard in the west madge went on andrews there about half way between him and annan and now we have a german sailor who speaks english and has a boatcompass at the head of the solway firth  elsie made an abrupt movement for madge had found the missing link and the chain was complete men were working night and day at armaments and warships on the clyde her face was troubled but her lips set firm for she began to see that she could no longer keep her secret the time when she must act had come  i think you have guessed right she said after a moment or two  then you understand that we have some responsibility  i dont see yours  the color crept into madges face  oh well for one thing my brothers with andrew then she put her arm impulsively round elsies waist weve got to see this through dear  elsies reserve gave way  yes she answered steadily we must the man you met has been at appleyard when they thought we were all asleepand im afraid hell be here again  madge showed no surprise  i know how youre fixed but think andrew and jim may be in danger we cant let them get hurt  thats impossible but what must we do  watch for the german sailor first of all madge advised try to find out what he has come for and spoil the plot im glad you gave me the room next to yours i can reach you by that inner door if its necessary she leaned forward and kissed elsie now you must go to bed dear you look anxious and tired     chapter xxviii  a wild ride   elsie went to sleep at last but her rest was broken and once or twice she awoke with a start she was uneasy and highly strung but she heard nothing unusual the wind moaned about the house and the splash of the little burn rose from the glen staffer had gone out before dinner and as he had not come back when she went to bed she did not think any stranger would visit appleyard telling herself that she must not indulge in nerves she went to sleep again some time later when lying half awake she heard a soft rattle and her heart beat fast for she knew that the handle of her door was being gently turned she was glad that she had locked it though this was the first time she had ever done so  the sound stopped a board in the passage creaked and as the shock of alarm began to pass elsie guessed that it was staffer trying to make sure that she was in her room this implied that he was going downstairs to meet some one but she waited until she got calmer wondering if after all she had been mistaken staffer could not have returned until late and it was strange he had allowed his visitor to risk coming to the house when he might be out she tried to believe he had not done so but when she heard a faint tap on the other door which opened into madges room there was no longer any doubt nerving herself for a painful effort she got up and hastily put on some clothes then she went into the other room and saw madges shadowy figure standing by the window  you heard it madge whispered somebodys gone down do you know who it is  yes    it is my uncle  madge put out her hand in the darkness and squeezed elsies cold little fingers sympathetically  you have to choose between him and andrew dear she said  yes elsie agreed in a strange toneless way  then we must find out whats going on my brothers on board the rowan too you must rememberand theres the survey ship i was thinking of them all and i couldnt sleep  are you ready to come down elsie asked  madge shivered as she opened the door it was very dark and cold in the passage and she shrank from the adventure but she followed elsie when the girl quietly locked the door taking out the key elsie had better cause to hesitate than madge but her resolution was fixed andrew might be threatened and that was enough she loved him and he loved her though he had tried to hide it he was hers and with a womans deeprooted instincts she was ready to fight for him the choice she had made was no longer hard her uncle had now no claim on her he was her lovers enemy for the time all complexities had vanished elsie was driven by primitive impulses she would protect andrew as a mother protects her child  as they approached the top of the stairs she put out her hand and stopped madge  not this way she whispered follow me close well go down by the back  they turned into a passage that led through the servants part of the house it was dark and narrow but elsie moved down the middle and madge kept behind her when they reached a small back landing elsie guided her to a hole in the floor and putting down her foot cautiously madge felt a step they were newel stairs and the stone struck cold through her stockings as she tried to find the broader side when she reached level ground she crept forward behind elsie across a large empty space which seemed to be the kitchen the next moment madge struck something that jarred noisily on the floor and she and elsie stopped with frightened gasps the sound seemed to echo through the house  they waited listening with tingling nerves but all was silent and they crept on until they came to a closed door elsie putting both hands on the knob turned it cautiously the latch clicked and they stopped again but heard nothing the gloom in front was impenetrable but a draught of cold air touched their faces and madge thought they were looking into the hall after a few moments she heard a sound that suggested a chair being moved and then a halfdistinguishable murmur it seemed to come from somewhere near by  theyre in the drawingroom wait here elsie whispered and the next moment madge was alone  it was very cold and the darkness was daunting but she tried to brace herself her brother was engaged in dangerous work and the secret conference that was being held in the room across the hall might threaten him then rankine had some part in the business she felt a thrill that brought the blood to her face and gave her courage as she determined that no harm should come to him  the murmur in the drawingroom grew louder and madge wondered if she could get nearer to it advancing cautiously into the hall she tried to remember where the furniture was but her outstretched hand struck something that rattled and she stopped alarmed she had been on the point of knocking down a vase and it was plain to her that further progress would involve risk elsie had some plan and a noise would spoil it madge went back to her post and waited there in the darkness highly strung and shivering  elsie in the meantime had left the house and crept round it on the grass until she reached a greenhouse built against one side of the drawingroom the door was open as she had expected and feeling for the edge of a flowerstand she followed it up until she could crouch down beside the steps leading to a french window it was closed but not latched for when she ran her fingers along the joint she felt an aperture but she dared not try to pull it open still she could see in the lamps had not been lighted but an electric torch lay on the table and threw a ring of light on the opposite wall two or three feet from the ground the rest of the room was in darkness but a dim illumination which spread beyond the bright beam showed two figures faintly  the men sat at the table elsie could not hear what they said for their voices were low and they spoke in curt sentences as soon as they had finished their business one of them would get up and go and she might not be able to steal away in time besides another man might come in by the door behind her she must risk trying to open the window she got her fingernails into the crack but the hinges began to grate and she let her hand drop the voices however were now a trifle more distinct and she recognized one as her uncles only a word or two was audible here and there and she could not connect them with what she missed but after a time she heard staffer say  all falls through unless williamson gets into touch     he must    should be there now    low water said the other man  elsie missed staffers answer but soon she caught  andrew johnstone and the american     must be stopped    know too much    no scruples    cant hesitate  staffer laughed and elsie shuddered at his halfheard voice  i dont    do what you like    but make sure    know too much    both dangerous  elsie shrank down as staffer rose and the light traveled along the wall but the men crossed the floor and she heard a cupboard being opened they were now near the hall door and she missed what they said but she had heard enough and must escape before the stranger left by the window  stealing out of the greenhouse she ran back with her brain busily at work madge was waiting where she had left her together they crept up the back stairs and into madges room  elsie was very calm when at last she felt it safe to speak  they came to the door once what did you hear she asked in a whisper  the wreck about three hours there before high water it wasnt staffers voice  elsie pressed her arm and listening eagerly they heard a stealthy footstep in the passage then the handle of elsies door shook as if it had been touched and there was silence  they waited for a few minutes while elsie thought quickly the situation though still obscure was getting clearer andrew was interfering with something it was necessary that williamson should do and staffer had told his visitor that he could stop him as he liked but must make sure there had been something horribly threatening in his laugh as he said that andrew and whitney knew too much the visitor was to do what he had undertaken about low water near a wreck  the question was what had he undertaken  what is that madge whispered turning to the open window  a faint throbbing came out of the dark it was some distance off but elsie recognized it as a motor running down the valley  its the man going to annan she said listen while i explain  her conclusions grew clearer and more logical as she put them into words and she got up resolutely when she had finished  we can do nothing more dick must help us now  stealing down the passage she entered his room and shook him gently he awoke and she put her hand on his face to check the exclamation she half expected  its elsie you mustnt make a noise she whispered do you know anything about a wreck  i know where it is he answered drowsily  andrews there tonight isnt he  its possible said dick lifting himself on his elbow why do you ask  she told him what she had overheard and he was silent for a moment though she knew that he was now wide awake  andrew must be warned he said and the other fellows got a start i couldnt get the car out without bringing staffer down and whitneys motorcycle is at the burnfoot ill have to take my bicycle  elsie noted that he had shown no surprise which was curious and that he was very cool then she remembered that he had not been looking well for some days  cant you get a fisherman to go she suggested you could give him a guarded message or a note  dick smiled  ill have to take a fisherman but im going andrews a very good sort and i owe him something his tone changed strangely will you give me a kiss elsie you havent done so since we were kiddiesbut id like you to  elsie stooped and kissed his cheek and he put his hand on hers  thank you dear now youll have to go i must start as soon as possible  she left him wondering at something unusual in his manner and five minutes afterward dick crept down the back stairs when he wheeled out his bicycle the lamp would not burn and he had no time to look for fresh carbide it was difficult to keep on the drive and he feared that staffer might hear the crash if he ran into the border and fell but he avoided this and opened the gate at the lodge without wakening its occupants  the valley was dark the road wet and dick could scarcely see the clipped hedgerows indeed at first he ran on to the grass but by degrees his eyes got used to the gloom and he let the bicycle coast down a long hill it gave him a good start but when he came to the bottom the hill in front was steep and he knew a stern effort would be needed as he changed to the low gear he was distressed and panting hard when he was halfway up and as he forced the cranks round the tires slipped and skidded in the mud the trees that stretched their bare branches overhead kept the road soft but it seemed to him that they also shut out the air he could not breathe in the thick gloom beneath them and his heart was throbbing painfully  this was the kind of thing he had been especially warned against but he could not stop the wind was light and allowing for some loss of time in waking a fisherman and getting his boat away it would be past lowwater when they approached the wreck remembering what had happened the night the lamp went out dick saw that andrews danger would begin when the floodtide raced across the sands  the breeze met him in the face when the road turned toward the coast at the summit of the hill he found it refreshing but it threatened to increase his labor and the mud got worse as he ran down to the seaboard plain light mist thickened the gloom and the bicycle skidded badly when he struck the boggy strip along the halfseen hedgerows still he toiled on while the perspiration dripped from his forehead and he got dizzy the exertion he was making was not sufficient cause for this but he had paid for rashly running upstairs at a lockerbie hotel a few days before something the doctor had warned him of had happened and he had not recovered from it yet for all that he must reach the lower end of the channel before the tide began to flow  he knew the road well but he could not distinguish where he was and was half afraid he had taken a wrong turning until a few faint lights shone out ahead these must mark the outskirts of annan five minutes later he ran down the main street the houses were dark and he had some trouble to find the narrow lane that turned off to the waterside there were no lights here but the road was paved and when he passed under a railway bridge tall black buildings rose between him and the river a sour smell came from the wet mudbanks behind them and the splash of running water warned him that the tide was falling fast he must lose no time if he meant to get away before the boats were left aground  he passed a silent factory and a long shadowy mill a schooners masts rose out of the gloom and he was in the open when the road stopped near a wharfshed dick pushed the bicycle through a gap in a hedge and across a field until he reached a very muddy lane he would rather have left the machine but time did not permit and for the next five minutes he jolted furiously among the pools and ruts somehow he saved himself from falling and jumped down when a dark row of houses on rising ground cut against the sky throwing the bicycle against a fence he climbed the hill breathing hard while his head swam and he felt the heavy thumping of his heart  when he knocked at the door a man came down and took him into a small plainly furnished room he was a big fellow with keen blue eyes and a brown face covered with fine wrinkles  noo ye can tell me what ye want he said  dick gave him a rather inadequate explanation and the fisherman looked thoughtful  weel he said i dinna understand it athegither but its enough if ye think mr andrews in trouble he paused for a moment as if pondering and then resumed the big shrimpboat would take us doon faster but she draws four feet and wed want a punt to get ashore im thinking well take the whammeler shes a smart bit craft and we could pull her if there was need  he gave dick a bundle of black oilskins  pit these on yell need them  dick thought this probable for he was wearing only his thin ordinary clothes  thanks he said as he got into the oilskins which were softer and more pliable than any he had seen in shops you see i left in rather a hurry  i ken an noo well start  his curtness was reassuring for dick knew his countrymen the fellows immediate business was to take him to the wreck and he would fix his mind on doing so it was obvious that there was something mysterious about their errand but although the scot is as curious as other people he seldom asks unnecessary questions when there is work to be done his habit is to concentrate upon the main issue  they left the house and a few minutes later crept along a slippery plank to a boat lying against a timber framework on which nets were dried she was sharp at both ends halfdecked and about twenty feet long with a short thick mast now that the tide had ebbed the river mouth was about a dozen yards across and a row of larger craft sheering to and fro in the eddies nearly filled the channel behind these a cluster of white buildings and a low promontory loomed out of the dark on the opposite side a high gravel bank seemed to close the narrow entrance  lowse the sternmooring said the fisherman and there was a harsh rattle of chain as the boat slid out into the stream  he threw an oar into the sculling notch and they drifted away slipping between the trawlboats that rose out of the gloom and vanished astern a minute later the stream boiled noisily along the gravel bank the white buildings faded and they were swept into the darkness that brooded over the firth the fisherman hoisted a small black lugsail and jib and took the tiller as the boat listed gently down to a biting wind  maybe yell find it warmer in the forad den he said ye can light the bit stove and set the kettle on  dick was shivering and he was glad to crawl through a hatch into a narrow dark hole where he lay down after feeling for and lighting the stove there was no room between floor and deckbeams to sit comfortably but an old sail and some ropes made a couch on which he could rest he felt shaky and an unpleasant faintness threatened to overcome him  he heard the water splash against the planks and felt the boat list that was comforting because he thought it was fourteen miles to the wreck still the ebb would run nearly four miles an hour there was some wind and the whammel boats sailed fast if his companion could keep her off the ground as the banks dried and the channel narrowed they ought to arrive by lowwater     chapter xxix  when the tide turned   the wind fell as the tide drained out and belts of mist hung motionless about the sands when the whammel boat crept slowly down to the mouth of the channel the sail lay on deck and dick panted as he pulled an oar while his companion sculled astern he felt faint and the heavily ballasted boat was hard to move but he thought the tide was turning now and he knew that he must hold out occasionally he turned and looked ahead but saw nothing except the mist there were no birds about the water was smooth and everything was very quiet at length a tall mast grew out of the haze and dick stopped rowing  the rowan scull her in to the bank he said i want to see where the dinghy is  they could not find her but presently came upon a whammel boat lying near the edge of the sand  its the nance that tam grahame selt awa the fisherman remarked i canna see what shes doing here with naebody on board  well pull off to the yacht dick replied  the dinghy was not astern when they boarded the rowan and when dick went below and lighted a lamp his companion looked puzzled  its queer theres seeven feet o watter and mr andrew wouldna swim ashore  not when he had the dinghy  but shes no on the bank  i imagine shes out at sea by now dick said grimly how long do you think the nance has been here  maybe half an hour her keels weel in the ground and the tide doesna fall much on the last o the ebb theyre no expecting to be back until the flood makes because her anchors up the bank  thats what i thought said dick now i will tell you that andrew is in danger i had meant to find him but i dont feel well enough i suppose you can use a gun  we get a shot at a whaup or shellduck whiles yere no looking weel  dick lifted a big 10bore gun from a rack and searched a locker for cartridges  fours he said putting down a packet i think youd better have bs here they are  the fisherman looked at him curiously as he took the cartridges which were loaded with large shot and dick smiled  you may meet the man who set the punt adrift he explained i want you to go to the wreck and find my cousin tell him to be careful because one of the gang has come down the channel after him if theres trouble going on when you get there do what you think best but bring andrew back the police wont blame you afterward if you have to use the gun  the man nodded quietly and dick knew that he could be trusted  yell be for staying here will i light the stove  no said dick i imagine it would be safer if i waited in your boat shell be needed when the tide flows and i can make myself comfortable in the den  the fisherman sculled the boat ashore and put out an anchor and then he went away across the bank and dick crept into the forecastle the stove was still burning and the small dark place was warm it had been a strain to hold out until all that was necessary had been done and now he was glad to lie down among the ropes and sails there was a weight on his chest his breathing was hard and his pulse seemed to be getting sluggish he wished he had some brandy or there was somebody about but he must not give in yet the boat would be needed when andrew came back and it might be tampered with  while the fisherman and dick had been hurrying to them andrew and whitney well armed crossed the bank toward the wreck and then separated at a short distance from her andrew went straight forward while his comrade made a round so as to approach her from the other side hitherto their visits had led to nothing but rankine seemed to think it would be different this time  when he got near the wreck andrew found that the tide had scoured out a pool round her after part and this threatened to make things difficult his figure would be visible against the pale gleam of the water and he could not get across without splashing he must go round but this would take him away from the place where it was easiest to get on board for all that he must not make a noise and he moved cautiously across the wet sand until he reached the broken timbers on the edge of the pool  he heard the water trickle through the vessels seams and the murmur of the languid surf in the distance but presently he thought there was something else the sound seemed to come from inside the wreck he moved a few yards nearer and then stopped with his feet in the pool listening hard there was a curious snap and crackle like the striking of matches and looking up andrew saw that something was sticking out from the masthead his lips set in a hard line a wireless installation was at work perhaps giving a message that would send another ship to its doom but it looked as if he could surprise and seize the operator and he meant to do so though he realized what the consequences might be  it was however impossible to climb up with the gun in his hand and he was sorry that he had brought it leaning it against the wreck he found a rest for his hand and lifted himself to a stringer his head and shoulders were now above the top of the vessels ribs but he did not see how he was to reach the deck which had fallen in abreast of where he was while he looked about there was a sharp report behind him and a tremor in the wood it had been struck by a bullet a few inches from his side letting go quickly he fell back with a splash  andrew was afterward uncertain whether he lost his hold in alarm or dropped back with instinctive caution he came down in the water and did not get up because a dark figure stood on the other side of the pool and he feared that a movement would draw a bullet his gun was some yards away but andrew thought he would be nearly invisible against the side of the wreck so long as he kept still and the shot would bring whitney to his help  there was a shout from the deck and andrew recognized williamsons voice he was obviously alarmed but the other man called out sharply in german ordering him back andrew imagined from this that the message he was transmitting was of urgent importance or perhaps the newcomer had another to send  it was plain that the men must not be allowed to finish their work and andrew wondered whether he could creep back to where his gun lay while the fellows attention was diverted he was getting up cautiously when the enemys pistol flashed and a spurt of water splashed into his face then there was a streak of light and a heavier report farther back on the sands and his antagonist turned and ran a few yards along the beach  andrew knew that whitney could not have fired the shot but at the moment this was not important he must get his gun while the man was occupied as he felt for it he heard whitney run round the stern of the wreck he was safe now but that crackling sound had begun again and at all costs williamson must be stopped besides andrew had a signal of his own to make leaving the gun he climbed up a timber and had just reached the deck when an indistinct figure rushed across it and vanished over the broken bulwarks on the opposite side then a patter of feet on the sand indicated that williamson was escaping  for all that andrew stopped and dragging a tin from his pocket put it on the rail and struck a match as he dropped it into the tin a bright blaze sprang up then he jumped down to the sand and seized his gun the fellow who had shot at him had disappeared and there was nobody in sight but he could hear men running on the other side of the wreck  come on whitneys voice reached him out of the darkness  as he splashed through the water around the vessels stern he saw two figures on the sand one he took to be whitney and the other was evidently a friend making an effort he caught them up and whitney began to talk in breathless gasps  an annan mandick sent him think coastguards will see your flare  wheres williamson and the other fellow andrew asked quickly  close ahead they were going back to the channel but couldnt get past us what about the tide  andrew began to understand the situation while he was trying to surprise williamson his assailant had quietly come up behind him and he in turn had been followed by the man dick had sent the fugitives must now make for the scotch shore or risk being shot at if they tried to go around his partys flank in order to prevent this he must extend his line  spread out he cried tides flowing now and the water will be in the gut when we get there  whitney and the fisherman moved off left and right and andrew glancing round saw that his flare was burning the men they followed could not see it because they faced the other way and although there was some mist he thought the signal would warn the coastpatrol whom rankine had told to keep a good lookout they ran on splashing across wet sand and into pools sometimes they caught a glimpse of two figures ahead and sometimes lost them in the haze it was hard to tell whether they were gaming or not andrew dared not stop to take off his long boots and the annan man hampered by his oilskins was falling back but whitney was running well and drawing in front  the sound of the advancing tide steadily grew louder and a breeze was getting up as the three men came panting out of a belt of mist a streak of water glimmered among the sands and beyond it a black hillside rose from the dusky beach the fugitives were plainer now and it looked as if they could not escape but the men held on steadily and andrew wondered what depth there was in the gutter glancing to one side he thought he saw something moving along the edge of the channel but he could not be sure because there was mist about the spot and he could not stop to get a better view for he was determined to follow williamson  a few minutes later he saw the men in front stop at the edge of the water and he wondered why they did so the channel was rapidly widening and they must cross at once or surrender instead they ran along the bank for some distance and stopped again and andrew now saw that a white boat was moving along the opposite side changing his course he ran on panting hard and saw that the men in front were waiting a moment later one plunged into the channel while his comrade stood still  as andrew got nearer there were two or three quick bright flashes and he heard a bullet pass his head and saw the sand spurt up at whitneys feet the fellow meant to stop them while his partner got a start or perhaps he imagined that the water was too deep to cross  whitney stopped a puff of smoke blew about him and there was a heavy report the man on the bank staggered fired his pistol again and splashed awkwardly into the water a moment later andrew plunged in he was close to the fellow now but he had dropped his gun because he did not mean to shoot the man turned and raised his pistol but his arm fell back and andrew sprang upon him  they went down and the stream boiled about them but andrew held on and a minute later whitney was at his side they dragged their prisoner out  my arm he said breathlessly there is also some shot in my leg  wheres your pistol andrew asked  in the sea  well said whitney as the fisherman joined them i wish i knew what we ought to do with him we cant stay here  this was obvious for the tide was already flowing past their feet as they stood a moment puzzling they heard a hail and saw the white boat pulling slowly toward them against the stream she struck the sand and a man in uniform jumped out  i see you have got one of them he said do you know him  i never saw him before andrew answered wheres the other  gone down i think we saw him trying to swim but the tide swept him up the gut and when we were getting close he disappeared we pulled round the spot but saw nothing no doubt hed have on his oilskins and seaboots  well this fellows hurt will you take him  certainly and youd better come with us youre mr johnstone i suppose we were told to look out for you we launched our gig as soon as we saw your flare  andrew said that he must get back to his boat and barely would have time enough to do so and after a hurried account of the affair he set off across the sands with his companions though they lost sight of the water presently they made the best pace they could and the annan man whom andrew had recognized related dicks attempt to join him  its as weel mr johnstone stayed behind he concluded im thinking it was the fellow ye caught who set your dinghy adrift and hed maybe have a mate hanging roon the nance  when they came down to the channel the tide was rising fast and the nance had gone the other boat was floating but was held by the anchor the fisherman had carried up the bank there was no answer to their hail and andrew plunged into the water  mr johnstones nae doot in the den he wasna looking weel said the fisherman  andrew was on board in a few moments and as he looked into the forecastle while the others pulled the boat ashore it was with relief that he heard dicks voice  got back all right old man  yes we owe that to you  im glad said dick you might help me out im not sure i could get through the hatch  andrew noted that his voice was faint and strained and he felt disturbed when he saw how helpless the boy was when with some trouble they lifted him through the narrow scuttle and put him down on the floorings  dont talk any more andrew said and turned to the fisherman scull her off to the yacht as fast as possible  they were alongside in a few minutes and soon had dick on a locker in the cabin  give me some whisky he gasped i think im pretty bad  well soon run up the firth and put you in a doctors hands andrew replied as he held a glass to his lips  dick drained it and then was silent for a minute or two  andrew he said finally theres something to talk about you see im not sure ill get over this  rot andrew exclaimed gruffly trying to hide his alarm youve been as bad before  no not quite but wait  dick closed his eyes and andrew saw his fears reflected in whitneys look dicks face was chalkywhite and haggard and they noted his labored breathing  the tide splashed against the yachts planks the halyards had begun to tap against the mast and there was a sharp rattle of blocks as the fisherman hoisted sail they let him go and sat watching dick from the opposite locker presently he looked up  think i can talk a bit now youll have appleyard andrew if i dont get well theres nothing to be said about that because youll look after it much better than i should have done still youll keep the old hands until you can pension them and theres bob my old ponyi shouldnt like him sold  youre taking too much for granted dick andrew replied you knocked yourself out in hurrying down here to warn me but youll be all right again in a few days  i know you hope so its possible too but well get things straightened up of course appleyard is mrs woodhouses homeshes not responsible for her brother you know elsie will keep everything right unless she marries dick paused and looked at andrew with a feeble smile she may you know  andrew turned his head and after a minute dick went on  id like my debts paid off but the estate must not be robbed if you open my desk youll find an old pocketbook it will show you what i actually got pin them down to that now give me a little more whisky  dick rested for a short while before he continued  you see i did get their money though not all that the notes called forand theyll have some trouble about the insurance  ah andrew interrupted hows that but youd better not bother about it now  i may not be able to bother later dick smiled when i got the doctors warning i was very hard up so i went to the insurance people and asked how much theyd let me have if i surrendered the policy well though they asked a lot of questions we didnt come to terms it seemed the other fellows were entitled to benefit but something wasnt straight and i think the office will dispute their claim i felt amused about it now and then but they mustnt lose what they really lent  ill see to that said andrew now you lie quiet and whitney will look after you while i take her up the firth a doctor must see you as soon as possible perhaps it will help things if you can go to sleep  andrew went on deck and after weighing anchor and making sail he sat at the helm lost in disturbing thought while the rowan stood upchannel     chapter xxx  the net   it was a calm dark night and the trawlers engines ran at half speed as she closed with the land the badge of a british steamfishing company was painted on her funnel and a correct registration number appeared in bold white figures on her bows but she carried no lights and her crew were not englishmen ahead formless black hillsides faded into the gloom but the skipper provided with the latest admiralty chart knew his bearings and the leadsman had found the depth of water he expected  a plume of vapor trailed away from her escapepipe for as she moved slowly shoreward with the flood the engines could not take all the steam it was prudent to raise after a time a light twinkled upon the unseen beach went out and shone again and the skipper ordering another cast of the lead made a quick calculation the tide would rise for an hour yet and there was already two feet more water than his vessel drew in the channel he must enter then the lookout reported a buoy ahead and he rang his telegraph for more speed he was in the channel now and another buoy farther on would warn him of the only dangerous bend he was anxious to pick up his cargo and get to sea again  moving shoreward faster the vessel faded into the gloom of the land but the beat of engines and the splash of displaced water travel far on a calm night and men with keen ears were listening for these sounds on board a powerful steamlaunch two miles away she traveled at a moderate speed towing a big white gig filled with coastguards but her crew were navy men a smart young lieutenant held the wheel trying to remember the soundings bearings and courses he had studied so carefully they were hard to check particularly as the floodtide swept him along but he was glad to remember that three feet of water was enough for him  presently he stopped the engine and listened at first he could hear only the ripple of the tide across some hidden shoal and the wash of the languid swell upon the invisible beach but after a time a measured thud came out of the distance and he knew that it was the beat of a steamers screw  between us and the land i think he said  yes sir about two miles off agreed the second officer  then she must be going up the gutter because theres not a fathom on the banks well go ahead theres enough water anywhere for us  the launch swung round on a different course when her engines began to clank and a man sounded now and then as they ran for the shoals the lieutenant hardly expected to follow the channel his object was to keep within hearing of the other vessel and if he were lucky his work would be finished before the tide ebbed much suddenly a sharp pulsatory roar came out of the dark  it looks as if she were on the ground and carrying plenty steam he said when he had ordered the engines to be stopped as theyll no doubt back her off well wait a while to give them time to ship their cargo  for the next few minutes the crews of launch and gig listened eagerly they knew that when the vessel ran aground the steam her stopped engines could not use had blown off the roar died away as was to be expected when the machinery was restarted hardastern but now that the immobility of the stranded craft increased the resistance the thud of the screw was louder presently it changed to a steady beat that drew away from them and they knew she had got afloat and was steaming upchannel  easy all for half an hour said the lieutenant looking at his watch  the boats lay close together rolling gently on the languid swell while the men sat in relaxed attitudes and talked in low voices still there was a feeling of suppressed excitement and it was a relief when their officer grasped the wheel  let her go at half speed he ordered  the towrope tightened as the gig swung into line astern and they moved steadily toward the land for some time then they heard a roar of steam again louder than before and continuous and the lieutenant signed to the engineer  full speed we have her now  the water hissed along the planks the gig lifted her bows on a surging wave and the wash of the screw ran far astern a blurred object grew out of the darkness in front of them and then the officer called to the coastguards  cast off and get to your work burn a flare if you want us  a rope fell into the water the engines stopped and there was a rattle of oars as the gig drove by they fell with a simultaneous splash and their regular thud receded as she swept upchannel while the launchs crew waited  in a few minutes the sound stopped there were alarmed shouts and hoarse orders while the roar of steam continued then the beat of oars began again the boat came back slowly with two men pulling and ran alongside the launch  you dont seem to have had much trouble the lieutenant remarked  we hadnt sir answered a coastguard officer they were busy and didnt hear us until wed got our boathook on her rail only one of them drew a pistol and he was knocked down well land them and leave a guard on board when shes moored  very well if we cant take her to barrow this tide  the coastguard laughed  so far as i could see theres a big piece of floundernet wrapped round her propeller and trailing about her aft it has an unusually thick headrope and some lengths of iron pipe are jambed between the blades and the rudder the fellow who set the net made a good job well have trouble in cutting it loose when she dries  did you find much oil  about a boatload of heavy drums which had just been thrown on deck we got the boat and i guess our fellows ashore have seized another lot however here are your two men i dont think youll do much with the skipper but the other seems less obstinate  two handcuffed men were put on board and the boat dropped back as the launch leaped ahead the water rose about her bows in a white curling wave her stern sank down in a hollow ridged with foam and she shook with the fierce throb of harddriven machinery dark hills slid past to starboard bold cliffs that stood out from their dim background rolled by and after a time a flash from a lantern was answered by a gleam of light ahead then the blurred outline of a steamer grew into distinct form in another minute the launch was alongside and the winches strained and clanked as she was hoisted in  everything went as we expected and ive brought you the two prisoners the lieutenant reported to rankine who sat in his room before a big chart  send them in one at a time and clear the guns and get under way the course is west by south  rankine spent some time examining his prisoners one preserved an obstinate silence but when he had been taken away the other seemed to see the force of rankines arguments when the second prisoner had been dismissed rankine went up to the bridge and changed the course a few points  the fellow bears out what we have been told he said to the young officer on watch i rather think hell deal straight with us in order to save his skin anyhow he has given me their supplyboat signal the craft were after is the latest and biggest thing of her kind  we ought to bag her the officer replied thoughtfully ive got the searchlight rigged and wilsons the best shot we had on the battleship still the little guns are awkwardly mounted and we havent a clear field of fire  it wont need more than one shot a perforated submarine isnt much use under water and the games ours if she stays on top ill give you the callup signal and you can get things ready  an hour later rankine pressed a button and the engines stopped the clang of a steamers bridgetelegraph can be heard some distance off but rankine had substituted an electric signal having undertaken a dangerous piece of work he had carefully made his plans so that he need not announce his movements to the enemy two guns had been put on board the vessel but as it was thought advisable to conceal them and the deckhouse and the masts were in the way their fire commanded only a limited strip of horizon  rankine searched the water with his nightglasses  the coast was out of sight mist drifted across the sea and the night was dark on the whole this was an advantage for his antagonist was expecting a trawler and the darkness would prevent him from noticing the vessels size and rig until they were close together there was some swell though the surface of the water was smooth and the vessel rolled languidly a feather of steam eddied about her funnel and there was a soft splashing as her slanted side sank into the sea no gleam of light pierced the darkness everything was still and rankine stood waiting eagerly  presently he gave an order and one of the prisoners was brought to the bridge then the steamer slowly moved ahead while a petty officer standing behind a canvas windscreen alternately held up and lowered red and green pyrotechnic flares the streams of colored light showed shadowy figures waiting motionless at their stations and drove a radiant track across the water then they died away and men whose eyes had been held by the glitter felt relief now they could see about the ship and they knew watchfulness was needed  for five minutes nothing happened and rankine conscious of keen tension began to wonder whether he should signal again it was possible that he had overshot or fallen short of his distance then a sharp hail came from a lookout and he saw the sea break not far ahead a confused white ripple spread away from something that moved amidst it and drew out in a long wavering line a lantern flashed between regular intervals of darkness and presently a low black object grew out of the advancing foam rankine pressed the button and the throb of engines slackened then he gave an order to his prisoner  the man hailed in german the submarine swerved and slowed and the two vessels drew abreast perhaps fifty yards apart while rankines quarter boat swung out from the davits  tell them to jump into the water and ill pick them up he ordered the prisoner  as the man called out a dazzling beam from the searchlight played upon the submarines hull and her wet steel skin glittered like silver the next moment there was another flash streaked with a vein of red and a cloud of thin acrid smoke whirled up the steamer quivered with the heavy concussion the submarine reeled and listed over indistinct figures plunged into the foam that lapped about her side and then the bright beam showed an empty stretch of seething water rankine was watching his boat which moved into the lighted track on her work of rescue when a lookout shouted a hoarse warning  swinging round rankine saw a feathery streak of foam on the opposite side of the vessel it was heading toward her at tremendous speed and he knew the wash of a torpedo  starboard hard he called to the helmsman and set his lips as he pressed the button for full speed  two submarines had answered his signal instead of one and the last had crept up to attack him while he was sinking her consort  the steamer however answered her helm slowly but enough the swift white streak drove past her stern with a few feet to spare and she began to shake as her engines quickened  port rankine shouted in a harsh voice steady that  a flash blazed out of the darkness a panel of the wheelhouse was shattered and the canvas bridgescreen fell apart in rags but rankine had seen a long dark shape on the water close ahead it might vanish in a moment before his guns could be swung and trained indeed he doubted if the submarine were within their field of fire and he meant to use a surer means one end of the black hull tilted up and the other began to sink his enemy was going under but would she be quick enough the steamers sharp steel stem was only a dozen yards away now  shouting an order to the crew rankine gripped the bridgerails hard  the water ahead boiled and rose in a tumbling ridge there was a heavy shock and the steamer trembled violently one could feel her forge through something that crumpled up beneath her bows but the jarring and grinding passed aft and she leaped forward when she was once over the obstacle rankine saw a curious disturbance down the screwtorn wake but it subsided and he stopped the engines  sound the forward well swing your light aft and lower the gig he ordered  the stream of radiance flashed astern and spread about the vessel but there was nothing on the water except their own boat which made toward them then a man came up to report that the well was nearly dry  shes a strong old ship rankine remarked and turned to another man wheres that prisoner evans  i havent seen him sir since the torpedo missed us  ask on deck said rankine why isnt the gig away  as the man went down the ladder a splash of oars began and the searchlights moving beam swept the sea it picked out the larger boat and then passed on leaving black darkness and followed the gig ten minutes later the boats returned and rankine received the young lieutenant in his cabin  we have six men all from the first craft so far as we can make out the lieutenant reported with rather strained quietness  then the rest have gone rankine said we have lost one prisoner too its pretty obvious that he jumped over he must have known there were two submarines and expected the last to sink us  he was not in the boats do you want to see the men we picked up  not just yet let them have dry clothes and anything else they need i wish wed got some of the others i dont know that one ought to think they deserved their fate but after all when one remembers the torpedoed merchant ships however well land them in loch ryan let her go west by north until you make the mull of galloway light  the lieutenant went out and rankine lying back on the locker lighted his pipe it was his first battle and he wanted to recover his normal calm he had won but he did not quite feel the exhilarating flush of victory he had expected instead he rather shrank from dwelling upon the fight     chapter xxxi  unexpected happiness   elsie lying half awake raised herself on her pillow as she heard a clock strike the anxiety she had half forgotten returned to her with double force although she had not been quite asleep she had lost count of the time and it was now nearly three hours after lowwater the danger that had threatened andrew must be past but she did not know how long she must wait for news of him besides some mischance might have befallen dick he had looked ill when she sent him on an errand that would severely try his strength  after a long time she heard a sharp throbbing coming up the valley it sounded like a motorcycle and she jumped out of bed and began to dress wondering whether dick had borrowed the machine at annan and was returning the sound grew louder the motorcycle had passed the lodge and was nearing the house when elsie quietly entered madges room  i heard it madge said i havent been asleep shall i get up  no elsie touched her in warning as a door opened  there were steps in the passage and they waited until the sound died away  are you going down madge asked  yes i feel that i must but it might be better if you didnt come  she heard the hall door open as she descended the stairs but she kept on and waited at the bottom the machine had stopped and she thought it significant that its driver had boldly ridden up to the house if dick had done so he would have come in but nobody had entered and staffer had gone out after a few minutes she heard the sliding door of the garage run back elsie knew the sound of the small wheels as they grated upon the iron carrier  the motorcycle sped away noisily down the drive and soon afterward staffer came in carrying a lantern he did not see elsie as he put the light on a table and locked a traveling bag she thought it curious that the bag was ready packed and since he had taken no precautions against being heard it looked as if speed were more important than secrecy the message that had been brought him must deal with some urgent matter still dick had not returned and she was horribly anxious she could not wait to learn what had happened at the wreck  as she moved forward to speak to staffer he looked up his expression was tense but she thought he was calm  so you have spied on me again he said  wheres dick  dick repeated staffer ah now i begin to understand you sent him down the firth  yes i did and where is he  on board andrews yacht i imagine  elsie was sensible of keen satisfaction but only part of her fears were set at rest  and andrew is he on the yacht  staffer looked hard at her she was trembling with excitement and cold but she did not flinch and he surprised her by a curious bitter laugh it carried a hint of understanding that brought the blood to her face  i dont know where he is but theres reason to think he has come to no harm that ought to satisfy you  elsie was silent her relief was great but now that andrew was safe her mind could fix itself on other matters staffer had guessed her secret and knew that she had spoiled his plans but his manner was more ironical than revengeful for all that it disturbed and frightened her she thought something that had hit him hard had happened and his coldblooded calm was daunting  well he said theres a touch of grim humor in the situation i found you a home and gave you the advantages you enjoy and now you have baffled me and ruined the work of cleverer brains than mine its humiliating to see ones schemes brought to nothing by a raw girls devotion to her stupid lover  im sorry the course of things made us enemies it was unavoidable she said quietly  staffer made an impatient sign  im going away and its very doubtful if ill ever return but id rather you didnt mention the matter until breakfast tomorrow then you can say ive gone to edinburgh perhaps you can promise me that  yes dont you want to see mother before you go  no staffer answered thoughtfully it might be better if i didnt  he broke off as the car came throbbing to the door and elsie followed him across the hall  if things had only been different she said we might have been friends  staffer did not seem to hear for he jumped into the car and it rolled away elsie stood looking out into the darkness for a long time then she shut the door and went slowly upstairs she felt limp and bewildered now that the strain had gone the one thing she realized clearly was that andrew was safe  madge turned to her eagerly as she entered her room but elsie did not stop  they are all right but i cant talk about it now she said and passed on into her room closing the door  while staffer was leaving appleyard andrew was picking his way toward the burnfoot across a boggy heath he had landed about an hour earlier and gone to a farm to ask for a horse and trap and had sent a man to annan for a doctor now he was returning as fast as possible because he felt anxious about dick but caution was needed for many deep drains crossed the heath the mist had closed in again and as he stopped at the last drain to look for a narrow spot he heard the languid splash of the surf and the wild cry of a blackbacked gull for some reason the harsh sound disturbed him and jumping the drain where he stood he went on as fast as he could the splash of the sea grew louder and at last he saw an indistinct figure waiting near the waters edge andrew was used to the sands at night but the motionless dark form seemed to strike a deeper note of desolation his steps slackened as he approached it  is that you jim he called  whitney waited until he came up and then put his hand on his arm  im afraid you must brace yourself against a shock he said gently  ah you mean dicks worse  whitney pressed his arm sympathetically  hes dead  there was silence for the next minute except for the mournful murmur of the sea  it wasnt long after you went ashore whitney added he looked up and beckoned me to sit on the locker by his cot tell andrew im glad hell have appleyard he said  whitney paused for a moment  he lay still afterward and i thought hed gone to sleep then the cabin seemed to grow strangely quiet and when i got up to look at him i saw that he was dead  the hurried trip downchannel killed him and he made it for my sake andrew said in a tense hoarse voice  you mustnt take that for granted but if true he certainly wouldnt grudge the risk he might have died at any time from some trifling exertion  andrew indicated the dinghy in which he had rowed off from the yacht alone  how did you get ashore  the banks steep and i sheered her in until i could jump from the bowsprit end i didnt want you to come on board without knowing  thanks said andrew im going off to her now try to get into marshalls hut and make a fire well have to wait some time for the doctor  he launched the dinghy and when he returned whitney had lighted a few sticks and peats in the fishermans sod hut andrews face was grave as he sat down on an empty box  if you dont mind id rather not talk he said  he let whitney row the doctor off when he arrived and day was breaking when they reached annan an hour later andrew feeling limp and cold got down from a trap at appleyard and walked stiffly into the hall elsie came to meet him with a glow in her eyes but she stopped abruptly when she saw his face  whats the matter she asked  he looked at her compassionately and she gasped  oh is dick  he put his arm around her and led her to an oak bench near the big fireplace  dicks dead he said quietly on board the rowan heart failure the doctor thinks  i sent him when i knew he was ill she cried in distress  you didnt know it would do him much harm dear  but i did elsie moaned with a shiver turning her head  andrew was puzzled but he answered soothingly  i know what you feel because i felt it toodick might have got better and lived a long time if he hadnt gone downchannel to warn me in fact i spoke to the doctor about it but he didnt altogether take this view  he didnt want you to blame yourself  no i dont think that was it but its a blow to us both and the worst is i can do nothing to soften it for you  you loved him she said with a look of pain you came home from canada and fought williamson for his sake i was often impatient with him and he always bore it well he was generous and forgivingand we know he was brave he must have known the risk he ranbut he didnt hesitate i knew itand i sent him  her voice trailed off and she broke into stormy sobbing while andrew with his arm around her awkwardly tried to comfort her his touch seemed to have a soothing influence for elsie got calmer  you were always a help andrew one turns to you in trouble she said but i mustnt give way like this  she rose as she spoke and when she left him andrew went up to whitneys room  i expect miss woodhouse feels the thing keenly whitney said  yes in fact she feels much as i do in spite of what the doctor said if dick hadnt gone to our rescue hed have been with us yet still i dont quite understand  you dont see why she let him go when she thought it might be dangerous  yes thats what bothers me andrew said with some hesitation  whitney gave him a keen glance he saw that andrew had no suspicion of the truth but it was not his business to enlighten him  well she may have thought there were two lives that could be saved against one that must be risked it would be desperately hard for a young girl to face the responsibility of deciding right miss woodhouse probably feels the strainand no doubt shes rather overcome by the consequences of the line she took but when she gets calmer shell see that she cant blame herself but you had better change your clothes and get some breakfast  it was a relief to andrew to find his time occupied at noon he was surprised by a request for an interview with a man he did not know the stranger was shown into the library and gave andrew a letter  my card may convey nothing to you but here are my credentials  the letter was from the home secretarys office and was countersigned by an eminent military authority  im at your command andrew said what is it you want to know  perhaps id better state that my visit is made in a friendly spirit we recognize the patriotic line you and your cousin have taken i met him once and its rather curious he invited me to appleyard  ah exclaimed andrew i never thought that dick  shared your suspicions i cant tell you how far his went but he may have known more than you imagine he certainly once did us an important service but well let that go did mr staffer offer any explanation for leaving here early this morning  he said he was going to edinburgh that was all  well he got to hawick where we lost trace of him but i think its impossible that he went farther north have you any ground for suspecting who brought him the warning  none said andrew shortly  im glad i can take your word mr johnstone now i must ask you to tell me about your recent adventures on the sands you see im in touch with lieutenant rankine and the coastguards  andrew related what had happened and his companion looked satisfied  you dont seem to know that williamsons body was washed up on the colvend shore a few hours ago  oh  the man who could have told us most has gone our hope now is to catch staffer  youd better make appleyard your headquarters while youre looking into things andrew said we have nothing to hide  thanks ill be glad to do so it may be some satisfaction for you to learn that no unnecessary publicity will be allowed to attend this matter  the next day the officer told andrew that staffers car had been found on the roadside near a small fishing village on the northumberland coast  he doubled back into england by norham he added when our men got upon his track they found hed covered the distances between the points at which they heard of him extraordinarily fast in consequence he had a number of hours start when he left the car and as a fishing boat sailed soon afterward im afraid he got away across the north sea  i cant say that i am sorry he escaped andrew replied but i wont complain if his friends on the other side keep him there for good  dick was buried two days later in a lonely kirkyard where many of his race had been laid to rest the kirk had long crumbled down except for one tottering arch but as usual in the country the funeral service was held at appleyard and andrews heart stirred as he saw the long stream of mourners coming up the drive dick had not died unlamented but even those who knew him best were astonished at the number of his friends none of his tenantry was missing his neighbors had come from far and near but there were othersfishermen shepherds men who lived by horsecouping and other devious means and innkeepers from dumfries and lockerbie the respectability of some was doubtful but their grief was obvious so far as the scottish character allowed it to be seen and andrew gave them all his thanks and hand this was an ancient custom and he was now the head of the family but as he looked at the rows of solemn faces he wondered whether he could win the love his predecessor had won  that night when the others had gone to bed andrew sat talking to rankine by the fire in the hall  has the fellow we caught on the sands made any admissions he asked i understand you have seen him  none so far he declined to talk and if im a judge of character its the line hell stick to until the end he sees that he has no defense im rather curious about his rank but hes obviously a navy man  hell be courtmartialed  yes it will be kept quiet for one or two reasons and i dont think youll be wanted  thats a relief whats your private opinion about the matter was the plot confined to supplying the submarines  rankine lighted a cigarette before he answered  on the whole i dont think so in fact its possible there was some foundation for your theory about the eskdale road  then you know something  something rankine agreed with a smile now that my business on the coast is finished and im going to join a battleship i may perhaps tell you that my rank is not lieutenant  well now that you are here i hope you can spare us a few days  thanks ill be glad to my new ship needs some refitting and they dont want me at portsmouth yet  the next few months passed uneventfully at appleyard for the most part andrew was kept occupied investigating dicks affairs and making new arrangements for the improvement of the estate it was a relief to be busy for his loss still weighed on him and he had another trouble every day he grew deeper in love with elsie and she seemed to try purposely to avoid him when they met she was friendly but he noticed a hint of reserve in her manner at last he began to think he would better go to canada for a while when he had put everything straight  then one cold spring evening when he came back from a visit to a moorland farm he found her sitting by the fire in the hall the light was getting dim but the glow from the logs fell on her and he noted her quick nervous movement as she saw him  im afraid i startled you he said stopping beside her ive been walking about a wet bog all afternoon examining drains and it looks very cozy here i wont disturb you if i sit down  of course not  andrew took a chair near her and stretched his hands to the fire neither spoke for a few minutes and their silence seemed the deeper because of the loud ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner  ive always loved appleyard andrew said slowly looking about the big hall but somehow it doesnt seem homey to me now theres something wanting its too big or im better used to a boat  you miss dick elsie answered softly with a touch of color in her face though he was often ill its wonderful how bright he was  yes i miss him all the timebut perhaps not as you do  andrews voice was full of sympathy and elsie gave him a quick glance  you must know the truth andrew she said impulsively at first i did feel miserably guilty for having sent dick on a dangerous errand when i knew he was ill  dick went because he wanted to go andrew interrupted he never shirked a risk and least of all when he could help his friends  but if i had loved dick in the way you seem to think i loved himperhaps i would not have been brave enough to let him goi cant be sure  you didnt love him in that way  elsie looked down at the book which lay in her lap her face was flooded with color but a smile played about her lips  i would never have married dick she said in a voice so low that andrew had to lean toward her to catch her words  there was some one else he asked tensely  she looked up at him then and he gasped at the deepening glow in her eyes  what a stupid thing you are andrew you ought to  he waited  elsie  his voice was a mingling of incredulity and joy and she answered his unspoken question with a shy smile  of coursedear   the end
