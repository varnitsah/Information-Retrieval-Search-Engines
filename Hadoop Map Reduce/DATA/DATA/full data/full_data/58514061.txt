were subsequently republished in two volumes one called the bab ballads the other more bab ballads  the period during which they were written extended over some three or four years many however were composed hastily and under the discomforting necessity of having to turn out a quantity of lively verse by a certain day in every week  as it seemed to me and to others that the volumes were disfigured by the presence of these hastily written impostors i thought it better to withdraw from both volumes such ballads as seemed to show evidence of carelessness or undue haste and to publish the remainder in the compact form under which they are now presented to the reader  it may interest some to know that the first of the series the yarn of the nancy bell was originally offered to punchto which i was at that time an occasional contributor  it was however declined by the then editor on the ground that it was too cannibalistic for his readers tastes  w s gilbert  24 the boltons

bishops cannot go you may express surprise at finding bishops deal in pride  but if that trick i ever tried i should appear undignified in rumtifoozles eyes  the islanders of rumtifoo are

caused anxiety and strife resulting in his getting penal servitude for life  he was a kindly goodly man and naturally prone instead of taking others gold to give away his own but he had heard of vice and longed for only once to strike  to plan one little wickednessto see what it was like  he argued with himself and said a spotless man am i i cant be more respectable however hard i try for six and thirty years ive always been as good as gold and now for half an hour ill plan infamy untold  a baby who is wicked at the early age of one and then reformsand dies at thirtysix a spotless son is never never saddled with his babyhoods defect but earns from worthy men consideration and respect  so one who never revelled in discreditable tricks until he reached the comfortable age of thirtysix may then for half an hour perpetrate a deed of shame without incurring permanent disgrace or even blame  that babies dont commit such crimes as forgery is true but little sins develop if you leave em to accrue and he who shuns all vices as successive seasons roll should reap at length the benefit of so much selfcontrol  the common sin of babyhoodobjecting to be drest  if you leave it to accumulate at compound interest for anything you know may represent if youre alive a burglary or murder at the age of thirtyfive  still i wouldnt take advantage of this fact but be content with some pardonable follyits a mere experiment the greater the temptation to go wrong the less the sin so with something thats particularly tempting ill begin  i would not steal a penny for my incomes very fair  i do not want a pennyi have pennies and to spare  and if i stole a penny from a moneybag or till the sin would be enormousthe temptation being nil  but if i broke asunder all such pettifogging bounds and forged a partys will for say five hundred thousand pounds with such an irresistible temptation to a haul of course the sin must be infinitesimally small  theres wilson who is dyinghe has wealth from stock and rent  if i divert his riches from their natural descent im placed in a position to indulge each little whim so he diverted themand they in turn diverted him  unfortunately though by some unpardonable flaw temptation isnt recognized by britains common law men found him out by some peculiarity of touch and william got a lifer which annoyed him very much  for ah he never reconciled himself to life in gaol he fretted and he pined and grew dispirited and pale he was numbered like a cabman too which told upon him so that his spirits once so buoyant grew uncomfortably low  and sympathetic gaolers would remark its very true he aint been brought up common like the likes of me and you so they took him into hospital and gave him mutton chops and chocolate and arrowroot and buns and malt and hops  kind clergymen besides grew interested in his fate affected by the details of his pitiable state they waited on the secretary somewhere in whitehall who said he would receive them any day they liked to call  consider sir the hardship of this interesting case a prison life brings with it something very like disgrace its telling on young william whos reduced to skin and bone  remember hes a gentleman with money of his own  he had an ample income and of course he stands in need of sherry with his dinner and his customary weed no delicacies now can pass his gentlemanly lips  he misses his seabathing and his continental trips  he says the other prisoners are commonplace and rude he says he cannot relish uncongenial prison food when quite a boy they taught him to distinguish good from bad and other educational advantages hes had  a burglar or garotter or indeed a common thief is very glad to batten on potatoes and on beef or anything in short that prison kitchens can afford  a cut above the diet in a common workhouse ward  but beef and muttonbroth dont seem to suit our williams whim a boon to other prisonersa punishment to him it never was intended that the discipline of gaol should dash a convicts spirits sir or make him thin or pale  good gracious me that sympathetic secretary cried suppose in prison fetters mister william should have died dear me of course  imprisonment for life his sentence saith im very glad you mentioned itit might have been for death  release him with a tickethell be better then no doubt and tell him i apologize

suspected me and i entered myself as a chap as wanted to go to sea  we sailed that afternoon at the mystic hour of one  remarkably nice young men were the crew of the hot cross bun im sorry to say that ive heard that sailors sometimes swear but i never yet heard a bun say anything wrong i declare  when jack tars meet they meet with a messmate ho  what cheer but here on the hot cross bun it was how do you do my dear when jack tars growl i believe they growl with a big big d but the strongest oath of the hot cross buns was a mild dear me  yet though they were all wellbred you could scarcely call them slick whenever a sea was on they were all extremely sick and whenever the weather was calm and the wind was light and fair they spent more time than a sailor should on his back back hair  they certainly shivered and shook when ordered aloft to run and they screamed when lieutenant belaye discharged his only gun and as he was proud of his gunsuch pride is hardly wrong  the lieutenant was blazing away at intervals all day long  they all agreed very well though at times you heard it said that bill had a way of his own of making his lips look red  that joe looked quite his ageor somebody might declare that barnacles long pigtail was never his own own hair  belaye would admit that his men were of no great use to him but then he would say there is little to do on a gunboat trim i can hand and reef and steer and fire my big gun too  and it is such a treat to sail with a gentle wellbred crew  i saw him every day  how the happy moments sped reef topsails  make all taut  theres dirty weather ahead i do not mean that tempests threatened the hot cross bun in that case i dont know whatever we should have done  after a fortnights cruise we put into port one day and off on leave for a week went kind lieutenant belaye and after a long long week had passed and it seemed like a life lieutenant belaye returned to his ship with a fair young wife  he up and he says says he o crew of the hot cross bun here is the wife of my heart for the church has made us one and as he uttered the word the crew went out of their wits and all fell down in so many separate faintingfits  and then their hair came down or off as the case might be and lo the rest of the crew were simple girls like me who all had fled from their homes in a sailors blue array to follow the shifting fate of kind lieutenant belaye           its strange to think that i should ever have loved young men but im speaking of ten years pasti was barely sixty then and now my cheeks are furrowed with grief and age i trow and poor poll pineapples eyes have lost their lustre now    ballad  lost mr blake    mr blake was a regular outandout hardened sinner who was quite out of the pale of christianity so to speak he was in the habit of smoking a long pipe and drinking a glass of grog on a sunday after dinner and seldom thought of going to church more than twice orif good friday or christmas day happened to come in itthree times a week  he was quite indifferent as to the particular kinds of dresses that the clergyman wore at church where he used to go to pray and whatever he did in the way of relieving a chaps distresses he always did in a nasty sneaking underhanded holeandcorner sort of way  i have known him indulge in profane ungentlemanly emphatics when the protestant church has been divided on the subject of the proper width of a chasubles hem i have even known him to sneer at albsand as for dalmatics words cant convey an idea of the contempt he expressed for them  he didnt believe in persons who not being well off themselves are obliged to confine their charitable exertions to collecting money from wealthier people and looked upon individuals of the former class as ecclesiastical hawks he used to say that he would no more think of interfering with his priests robes than with his church or his steeple and that he did not consider his soul imperilled because somebody over whom he had no influence whatever chose to dress himself up like an exaggerated guy fawkes  this shocking old vagabond was so unutterably shameless that he actually went acourting a very respectable and pious middleaged sister by the name of biggs she was a rather attractive widow whose life as such had always been particularly blameless her first husband had left her a secure but moderate competence owing to some fortunate speculations in the matter of figs  she was an excellent person in every wayand won the respect even of mrs grundy she was a good housewife too and wouldnt have wasted a penny if she had owned the kohinoor she was just as strict as he was lax in her observance of sunday and being a good economist and charitable besides she took all the bones and cold potatoes and broken piecrusts and candleends when she had quite done with them and made them into an excellent soup for the deserving poor  i am sorry to say that she rather took to blakethat outcast of society and when respectable brothers who were fond of her began to look dubious and to cough she would say oh my friends its because i hope to bring this poor benighted soul back to virtue and propriety and besides the poor benighted soul with all his faults was uncommonly well off  and when mr blakes dissipated friends called his attention to the frown or the pout of her whenever he did anything which appeared to her to savour of an unmentionable place he would say that she would be a very decent old girl when all that nonsense was knocked out of her and his method of knocking it out of her is one that covered him with disgrace  she was fond of going to church services four times every sunday and four or five times in the week and never seemed to pall of them so he hunted out all the churches within a convenient distance that had services at different hours so to speak and when he had married her he positively insisted upon their going to all of them so they contrived to do about twelve churches every sunday and if they had luck from twentytwo to twentythree in the course of the week  she was fond of dropping his sovereigns ostentatiously into the plate and she liked to see them stand out rather conspicuously against the commonplace halfcrowns and shillings so he took her to all the charity sermons and if by any extraordinary chance there wasnt a charity sermon anywhere he would drop a couple of sovereigns one for him and one for her into the poorbox at the door and as he always deducted the sums thus given in charity from the housekeeping money and the money he allowed her for her bonnets and frillings she soon began to find that even charity if you allow it to interfere with your personal luxuries becomes an intolerable bore  on sundays she was always melancholy and anything but good society for that day in her household was a day of sighings and sobbings and wringing of hands and shaking of heads she wouldnt hear of a button being sewn on a glove because it was a work neither of necessity nor of piety and strictly prohibited her servants from amusing themselves or indeed doing anything at all except dusting the drawingrooms cleaning the boots and shoes cooking the parlour dinner waiting generally on the family and making the beds but blake even went further than that and said that people should do their own works of necessity and not delegate them to persons in a menial situation so he wouldnt allow his servants to do so much as even answer a bell here he is making his wife carry up the water for her bath to the second floor much against her inclination  and why in the world the gentleman who illustrates these ballads has put him in a cocked hat is more than i can tell  after about three months of this sort of thing taking the smooth with the rough of it blacking her own boots and peeling her own potatoes was not her notion of connubial bliss mrs blake began to find that she had pretty nearly had enough of it and came in course of time to think that blakes own original line of conduct wasnt so much amiss  and now that wicked personthat detestable sinner belial blake his friends and wellwishers call him for his atrocities and his poor deluded victim whom all her christian brothers dislike and pity so go to the parish church only on sunday morning and afternoon and occasionally on a weekday and spend their evenings in connubial fondlings and affectionate reciprocities and i should like to know where in the world or rather out of it they expect to go    ballad  the babys vengeance    weary at heart and extremely ill was paley vollaire

a ship on starboard tack shes bound upon a private cruise  this is the kind of spice i use to give a saltsea smack  behold on every afternoon save in a gale or strong monsoon great captain capel cleggs great morally though rather short sat at an open weatherport and aired his shapely legs  and mermaids hung around in flocks on cable chains and distant rocks to gaze upon those limbs for legs like those of flesh and bone are things not generally known to any merman timbs  but mermen didnt seem to care much time as far as im aware with cleggss legs to spend though mermaids swam around all day and gazed exclaiming thats the way a gentleman should end  a pair of legs with wellcut knees and calves and ankles such as these which we in rapture hail are far more eloquent its clear when clothed in silk and kerseymere than any nasty tail  and cleggsa worthy kind old boy  rejoiced to add to others joy and when the day was dry because it pleased the lookerson he sat from morn till nightthough con stitutionally shy  at first the mermen laughed pooh pooh but finally they jealous grew and sounded loud recalls but vainly  so these fishy males declared they too would clothe their tails in silken hose and smalls  they set to work these watermen and made their nether robesbut when they drew with dainty touch the kerseymere upon their tails they found it scraped against their scales and hurt them very much  the silk besides with which they chose to deck their tails by way of hose they never thought of shoon for such a use was much too thin  it tore against the caudal fin and went in ladders soon  so they designed another plan they sent their most seductive man this note to him to show  our monarch sends to captain cleggs his humble compliments and begs hell join him down below  weve pleasant homes below the sea  besides if captain cleggs should be as our advices say a judge of mermaids he will find our ladyfish of every kind inspection will repay  good capel sent a kind reply for capel thought he could descry an admirable plan to study all their ways and laws  but not their ladyfish because he was a married man  the merman sankthe captain too jumped overboard and dropped from view like stone from catapult and when he reached the mermans lair he certainly was welcomed there but ah with what result  they didnt let him learn their law or make a note of what he saw or interesting mem the ladyfish he couldnt find but that of course he didnt mind  he didnt come for them  for though when captain capel sank the mermen drawn in double rank gave him a hearty hail yet when secure of captain cleggs they cut off both his lovely legs and gave him such a tail  when captain cleggs returned aboard his blithesome crew convulsive roard to see him altered so the admiralty did insist that he upon the halfpay list immediately should go  in vain declared the poor old salt its my misfortunenot my fault with tear and trembling lip  in vain poor capel begged and begged a man must be completely legged who rules a british ship  so spake the stern first lord aloud  he was a wag though very proud and much rejoiced to say youre only half a captain now  and so my worthy friend i vow youll only get halfpay    ballad  annie protheroe  a legend of stratfordlebow    oh listen to the tale of little annie protheroe she kept a small postoffice in the neighbourhood of bow she loved a skilled mechanic who was famous in his day  a gentle executioner whose name was gilbert clay  i think i hear you say a dreadful subject for your rhymes o reader do not shrinkhe didnt live in modern times he lived so long ago the sketch will show it at a glance that all his actions glitter with the limelight of romance  in busy times he laboured at his gentle craft all day  no doubt you mean his calcraft you amusingly will say  but nohe didnt operate with common bits of string he was a public headsman which is quite another thing  and when his work was over they would ramble oer the lea and sit beneath the frondage of an elderberry tree and annies simple prattle entertained him on his walk for public executions formed the subject of her talk  and sometimes hed explain to her which charmed her very much how famous operators vary very much in touch and then perhaps hed show how he himself performed the trick and illustrate his meaning with a poppy and a stick  or if it rained the little maid would stop at home and look at his favourable notices all pasted in a book and then her cheek would flushher swimming eyes would dance with joy in a glow of admiration at the prowess of her boy  one summer eve at suppertime the gentle gilbert said as he helped his pretty annie to a slice of collared head this reminds me i must settle on the next ensuing day the hash of that unmitigated villain peter gray  he saw his annie tremble and he saw his annie start her changing colour trumpeted the flutter at her heart young gilberts manly bosom rose and sank with jealous fear and he said o gentle annie whats the meaning of this here  and annie answered blushing in an interesting way you think no doubt im sighing for that felon peter gray that i was his young woman is unquestionably true but not since i began akeeping company with you  then gilbert who was irritable rose and loudly swore hed know the reason why if she refused to tell him more and she answered all the woman in her flashing from her eyes you mustnt ask no questions and you wont be told no lies  few lovers have the privilege enjoyed my dear by you of chopping off a rivals head and quartering him too of vengeance dear tomorrow you will surely take your fill and gilbert ground his molars as he answered her i will  young gilbert rose from table with a stern determined look and frowning took an inexpensive hatchet from its hook and annie watched his movements with an interested air  for the morrowfor the morrow he was going to prepare  he chipped it with a hammer and he chopped it with a bill he poured sulphuric acid on the edge of it until this terrible avenger of the majesty of law was far less like a hatchet than a dissipated saw  and annie said o gilbert dear i do not understand why ever you are injuring that hatchet in your hand he said it is intended for to lacerate and flay the neck of that unmitigated villain peter gray  now gilbert annie answered wicked headsman just beware  i wont have peter tortured with that horrible affair if you appear with that you may depend youll rue the day but gilbert said oh shall i which was just his nasty way  he saw a look of anger from her eyes distinctly dart for annie was a woman and had pity in her heart she wished him a good eveninghe answered with a glare she only said remember for your annie will be there           the morrow gilbert boldly on the scaffold took his stand with a vizor on his face and with a hatchet in his hand and all the people noticed that the engine of the law was far less like a hatchet than a dissipated saw  the felon very coolly loosed his collar and his stock and placed his wicked head upon the handy little block the hatchet was uplifted for to settle peter gray when gilbert plainly heard a womans voice exclaiming stay  twas annie gentle annie as youll easily believe o gilbert you must spare him for i bring him a reprieve it came from our home secretary many weeks ago and passed through that postoffice which i used to keep at bow  i loved you loved you madly and you know it gilbert clay and as id quite surrendered all idea of peter gray i quietly suppressed it as youll clearly understand for i thought it might be awkward if he came and claimed my hand  in anger at my secret which i could not tell before to lacerate poor peter gray vindictively you swore i told you if you used that blunted axe youd rue the day and so you will young gilbert for ill marry peter gray  and so she did    ballad  an unfortunate likeness    ive painted shakespeare all my life  an

topsyturveydom   where vice is virtuevirtue vice where nice is nastynasty nice where right is wrong and wrong is right  where white is black and black is white  where babies much to their surprise are born astonishingly wise with every science on their lips and art at all their fingertips  for as their nurses dandle them they crow binomial theorem with views it seems absurd to us on differential calculus  but though a babe as i have said is born with learning in his head he must forget it if he can before he calls himself a man  for that which we call folly here is wisdom in that favoured sphere the wisdom we so highly prize is blatant folly in their eyes  a boy if he would push his way must learn some nonsense every day and cut to carry out this view his wisdom teeth and wisdom too  historians burn their midnight oils intent on giantkillers toils and sages close their aged eyes to other sages lullabies  our magistrates in duty bound commit all robbers who are found but there the beaks so people said commit all robberies instead  our judges pure and wise in tone know crime from theory alone and glean the motives of a thief from books and popular belief  but there a judge who wants to prime his mind with true ideas of crime derives them from the common sense of practical experience  policemen march all folks away who practise virtue every day  of course i mean to say you know what we call virtue here below  for only scoundrels dare to do what we consider just and true and only good men do in fact what we should think a dirty act  but strangest of these social twirls the girls are boysthe boys are girls the men are women toobut then per contra women all are men  to one who to tradition clings this seems an awkward state of things but if to think it out you try it doesnt really signify  with them as surely as can be a sailor should be sick at sea and not a passenger may sail who cannot smoke right through a gale  a soldier save by rarest luck is always shot for showing pluck that is if others can be found with pluck enough to fire a round  how strange i said to one i saw you quite upset our every law however can you get along so systematically wrong  dear me my mad informant said have you no eyes within your head you sneer when you your hat should doff why we begin where you leave off  your wisest men are very far less learned than our babies are i mused awhileand then oh me i framed this brilliant repartee  although your babes are wiser far than our most valued sages are your sages with their toys and cots are duller than our idiots  but this remark i grieve to state came just a little bit too late for as i framed it in my head i woke and found myself in bed  still i could wish that stead of here my lot were in that favoured sphere  where greatest fools bear off the bell i ought to do extremely well    ballad  the bishop of rumtifoo again    i often wonder whether you think sometimes of that bishop who from black but balmy rumtifoo last summer twelvemonth came unto your mind i praps may bring remembrance of the man i sing today by simply mentioning that peter was his name  remember how that holy man came with the great colonial clan to synod called pananglican and kindly recollect how having crossed the ocean wide to please his flock all means he tried consistent with a proper pride and manly selfrespect  he only of the reverend pack who minister to christians black brought any useful knowledge back to his colonial fold in consequence a place i claim for peter on the scroll of fame for peter was that bishops name as ive already told  he carried art he often said to places where that timid maid save by colonial bishops aid could never hope to roam the paynecumlauri feat he taught as he had learnt it for he thought the choicest fruits of progress ought to bless the negros home  and he had other work to do for while he tossed upon the blue the islanders of rumtifoo forgot their kindly friend their decent clothes they learnt to tear  they learnt to say i do not care though they of course were well aware how folks who say so end  some sailors whom he did not know had landed there not long ago and taught them bother also blow of wickedness the germs no need to use a casuists pen to prove that they were merchantmen no sailor of the royal n would use such awful terms  and so when bishop peter came that was the kindly bishops name he heard these dreadful oaths with shame and chid their want of dress except a shella bangle rare  a feather herea feather there the south pacific negroes wear their native nothingness  he taught them that a bishop loathes to listen to disgraceful oaths he gave them all his leftoff clothes  they bent them to his will the bishops gift spreads quickly round in peters leftoff clothes they bound his threeandtwenty suits they found in fair condition still  the bishops eyes with water fill quite overjoyed to find them still obedient to his sovereign will and said good rumtifoo halfway ill meet you i declare ill dress myself in cowries rare and fasten feathers in my hair and dance the cutchchiboo 13  and to conciliate his see he married piccadillillee the youngest of his twentythree tallneither fat nor thin and though the dress he made her don looks awkwardly a girl upon it was a great improvement on the one he found her in  the bishop in his gay canoe his wife of course went with him too to some adjacent island flew to spend his honeymoon some day in sunny rumtifoo a little peterll be on view and that if people tell me true is like to happen soon    ballad  the haughty actor    an actorgibbs of drury lane  of very decent station once happened in a part to gain excessive approbation it sometimes turns a fellows brain and makes him singularly vain when he believes that he receives tremendous approbation  his great success half drove him mad but no one seemed to mind him well in another piece he had another part assigned him this part was smaller by a bit than that in which he made a hit so much illused he straight refused to play the part assigned him           that night that actor slept and ill attempt to tell you of the vivid dream he dreamt   the dream   in fighting with a robber band a thing he loved sincerely a sword struck gibbs upon the hand and wounded it severely at first he didnt heed it much he thought it was a simple touch but soon he found the weapons bound had wounded him severely  to surgeon cobb he made a trip whod just effected featly an amputation at the hip particularly neatly a rising man was surgeon cobb but this extremely ticklish job he had achieved as he believed particularly neatly  the actor rang the surgeons bell observe my wounded finger be good enough to strap it well and prithee do not linger that i dear sir may fill again the theatre royal drury lane this very night i have to fight  so prithee do not linger  i dont strap fingers up for doles replied the haughty surgeon to use your cant i dont play roles utility that verge on first amputationnothing less  that is my line of business we surgeon nobs despise all jobs utility that verge on  when in your hip there lurks disease so dreamt this lively dreamer or devastating caries in humerus or femur if you can pay a handsome fee oh then you may remember me  with joy elate ill amputate your humerus or femur  the disconcerted actor ceased the haughty leech to pester but when the wound in size increased and then began to fester he sought a learned counsels lair and told that counsel then and there how cobbs neglect of his defect had made his finger fester  oh bring my action if you please the case i pray you urge on and win me thumping damages from cobb that haughty surgeon he culpably neglected me although i proffered him his fee so pray come down in wig and gown on cobb that haughty surgeon  that counsel learned in the laws with passion almost trembled he just had gained a mighty cause before the peers assembled said he how dare you have the face to come with common jury case to one who wings rhetoric flings before the peers assembled  dispirited became our friend  depressed his moral pecker  but stay a thoughtill gain my end

error  too bad said gibbs my case to shirk you must be bad innately to save your skill for mighty work because its valued greatly but here he woke with sudden start           he wrote to say hed play the part ive but to tell he played it well  the authors wordshis native wit combined achieved a perfect hit  the papers praised him greatly    ballad  the two majors    an excellent soldier whos worthy the name loves officers dashing and strict when good hes content with escaping all blame when naughty he likes to be licked  he likes for a fault to be bullied and stormed or imprisoned for several days and hates for a duty correctly performed to be slavered with sickening praise  no officer sickened with praises his corps so little as major la guerre  no officer swore at his warriors more than major makredi prepere  their soldiers adored them and every grade delighted to hear their abuse though whenever these officers came on parade they shivered and shook in their shoes  for oh if la guerre could all praises withhold why so could makredi prepere and oh if makredi could bluster and scold why so could the mighty la guerre  no doubt we deserve itno mercy we crave  go onyoure conferring a boon we would rather be slanged by a warrior brave than praised by a wretched poltroon  makredi would say that in battles fierce rage true happiness only was met poor major makredi though fifty his age had never known happiness yet  la guerre would declare with the blood of a foe no tipple is worthy to clink poor fellow he hadnt though sixty or so yet tasted his favourite drink  they agreed at their messthey agreed in the glass  they agreed in the choice of their set and they also agreed in adoring alas the vivandiere pretty fillette  agreement you see may be carried too far and after agreeing all round for yearsin this soldierly maid of the bar a bone of contention they found  it may seem improper to call such a pet  by a metaphor evena bone but though they agreed in adoring her yet each wanted to make her his own  on the day that you marry her muttered prepere with a pistol he quietly played ill scatter the brains in your noddle i swear all over the stony parade  i cannot do that to you answered la guerre whatever events may befall but this i can doif you wed her mon cher ill eat you moustachios and all  the rivals although they would never engage yet quarrelled whenever they met they met in a fury and left in a rage but neither took pretty fillette  i am not afraid thought makredi prepere for country im ready to fall but nobody wants for a mere vivandiere to be eaten moustachios and all  besides though la guerre has his faults ill allow hes one of the bravest of men my goodness if i disagree with him now i might disagree with him then  no coward am i said la guerre as you guess  i sneer at an enemys blade but i dont want prepere to get into a mess for splashing the stony parade  one day on parade to prepere and la guerre came corporal jacot debette and trembling all over he prayed of them there to give him the pretty fillette  you see i am willing to marry my bride until youve arranged this affair i will blow out my brains when your honours decide which marries the sweet vivandiere  well take her said both of them in a duet a favourite form of reply but when i am ready to marry fillette remember youve promised to die  he married her then  from the flowery plains of existence the roses they cull he lived and he died with his wife and his brains are reposing in peace in his skull    ballad  emily john james and i  a derby legend    emily jane

had a narrow escape  he noticed his emily jane with jim and envied the wellmade elf and people remarked that he muttered oh dim i often say dim myself  john dogged them all day without asking their leaves for his sergeant he told aside that jimmy and jane were notorious thieves and i think he was justified  but james wouldnt dream of abstracting a fork and jenny would blush with shame at stealing so much as a bottle or cork a bottle i think fair game  but ah theres another more serious crime they wickedly strayed upon the course at a critical moment of time i pointed them out to john  the constable fell on the pair in a crack  and then with a demon smile let jenny cross over but sent jimmy back i played on my harp the while  stern johnny their agony loud derides with a very triumphant sneer  they weep and they wail from the opposite sides and i shed a silent tear  and jenny is crying away like mad and jimmy is swearing hard and johnny is looking uncommonly glad and i am

sublieutenant of chassoores met mahry daubigny the village rose under the wizards oakold trystingplace of those who loved in rosy aquitaine  they thought themselves unwatched but they were not for hongree sublieutenant of chassoores found in lieutenantcolonel jooles dubosc a rival envious and unscrupulous who thought it not foul scorn to dodge his steps and listen unperceived to all that passed between the simple little village rose and hongree sublieutenant of chassoores  a clumsy barrackbully was dubosc quite unfamiliar with the wellbred tact that animates a proper gentleman in dealing with a girl of humble rank youll understand his coarseness when i say he would have married mahry daubigny and dragged the unsophisticated girl into the whirl of fashionable life for which her singularly rustic ways her breeding moral but extremely rude her language chaste but ungrammatical would absolutely have unfitted her how different to this unreflecting boor was hongree sublieutenant of chassoores  contemporary with the incident related in our opening paragraph was that sad war twixt gallia and ourselves that followed on the treaty signed at troyes and so lieutenantcolonel jooles dubosc brave soldier he with all his faults of style and hongree sublieutenant of chassoores were sent by charles of france against the lines of our sixth henry fourteen twentynine to drive his legions out of aquitaine  when hongree sublieutenant of chassoores returned suspecting nothing to his camp after his meeting with the village rose he found inside his barrack letterbox a note from the

forlorn hope yoursyoull lead it sir and lead it too with credit ive no doubt as every man must certainly be killed for you are twenty gainst two thousand men it is not likely that you will return but what of that youll have the benefit of knowing that you die a soldiers death  obedience was young hongrees strongest point but he imagined that he only owed allegiance to his mahry and his king if mahry bade me lead these fated men id lead thembut i do not think she would if charles my king said go my son and die id go of coursemy duty would be clear but mahry is in bed asleep i hope and charles my king a hundred leagues from this as for lieutenantcolonel jooles dubosc how know i that our monarch would approve the order he has given me tonight my king ive sworn in all things to obey  ill only take my orders from my king thus hongree sublieutenant of chassoores interpreted the terms of his commission  and hongree who was wise as he was good disguised himself that night in ample cloak round flapping hat and vizor mask of black and made unnoticed for the english camp he passed the unsuspecting sentinels who little thought a man in this disguise could be a proper object of suspicion and ere the curfew bell had boomed lights out he found in audience bedfords haughty duke  your grace he said start notbe not alarmed although a frenchman stands before your eyes im hongree sublieutenant of chassoores my colonel will attack your camp tonight and orders me to lead the hope forlorn now i am sure our excellent king charles would not approve of this but hes away a hundred leagues and rather more than that so utterly devoted to my king blinded by my attachment to the throne and having but its interest at heart i feel it is my duty to disclose all schemes that emanate from colonel jooles if i believe that they are not the kind of schemes that our good monarch would approve  but how said bedfords duke do you propose that we should overthrow your colonels scheme and hongree sublieutenant of chassoores replied at once with neverfailing tact oh sir i know this cursed country well entrust yourself and all your host to me ill lead you safely by a secret path into the heart of colonel jooles array and you can then attack them unprepared and slay my fellowcountrymen unarmed  the thing was done  the duke of bedford gave the order and two thousand fighting men crept silently into the gallic camp and slew the frenchmen as they lay asleep and bedfords haughty duke slew colonel jooles and gave fair mahry pride of aquitaine to hongree sublieutenant of chassoores

starting tear for they were heavily insured  besides the captain and the mate the owners and the crew the passengers were also drowned excepting only two young peter gray who tasted teas for baker croop and co and somers who from eastern shores imported indigo  these passengers by reason of their clinging to a mast upon a desert island were eventually cast they hunted for their meals as alexander selkirk used but they couldnt chat togetherthey had not been introduced  for peter gray and somers too though certainly in trade were properly particular about the friends they made and somehow thus they settled it without a word of mouth  that gray should take the northern half while somers took the south  on peters portion oysters grewa delicacy rare but oysters were a delicacy peter couldnt bear on somers side was turtle on the shingle lying thick which somers couldnt eat because it always made him sick  gray gnashed his teeth with envy as he saw a mighty store of turtle unmolested on his fellowcreatures shore the oysters at his feet aside impatiently he shoved for turtle and his mother were the only things he loved  and somers sighed in sorrow as he settled in the south for the thought of peters oysters brought the water to his mouth he longed to lay him down upon the shelly bed and stuff he had often eaten oysters but had never had enough  how they wished an introduction to each other they had had when on board the ballyshannon  and it drove them nearly mad to think how very friendly with each other they might get if it wasnt for the arbitrary rule of etiquette  one day when out ahunting for the mus ridiculus gray overheard his fellowman soliloquizing thus i wonder how the playmates of my youth are getting on mconnell s b walters paddy byles and robinson  these simple words made peter as delighted as could be old chummies at the charterhouse were robinson and he he walked straight up to somers then he turned extremely red hesitated hummed and hawed a bit then cleared his throat and said  i beg your pardonpray forgive me if i seem too bold but you have breathed a name i knew familiarly of old you spoke aloud of robinsoni happened to be by you know him  yes extremely well  allow me so do i  it was enough  they felt they could more pleasantly get on for ah the magic of the fact they each knew robinson and mr somers turtle was at peters service quite and mr somers punished peters oysterbeds all night  they soon became like brothers from community of wrongs they wrote each other little odes and sang each other songs they told each other anecdotes disparaging their wives on several occasions too they saved each others lives  they felt quite melancholy when they parted for the night and got up in the morning soon as ever it was light each others pleasant company they reckoned so upon and all because it happened that they both knew robinson  they lived for many years on that inhospitable shore and day by day they learned to love each other more and more at last to their astonishment on getting up one day they saw a frigate anchored in the offing of the bay  to peter an idea occurred  suppose we cross the main so good an opportunity may not be found again and somers thought a minute then ejaculated done i wonder how my business in the citys getting on  but stay said mr peter  when in england as you know i earned a living tasting teas for baker croop and co i may be supersededmy employers think me dead then come with me said somers and taste indigo instead  but all their plans were scattered in a moment when they found the vessel was a convict ship from portland outward bound when a boat came off to fetch them though they felt it very kind to go on board they firmly but respectfully declined  as both the happy settlers roared with laughter at the joke they recognized a gentlemanly fellow pulling stroke twas robinsona convict in an unbecoming frock condemned to seven years for misappropriating stock  they laughed no more for somers thought he had been rather rash in knowing one whose friend had misappropriated cash and peter thought a foolish tack he must have gone upon in making the acquaintance of a friend of robinson  at first they didnt quarrel very openly ive heard they nodded when they met and now and then exchanged a word the word grew rare and rarer still the nodding of the head and when they meet each other now they cut each other dead  to allocate the island they agreed by word of mouth and peter takes the north again and somers takes the south and peter has the oysters which he hates in layers thick and somers has the turtleturtle always makes him sick    ballad  at a pantomime  by a bilious one    an actor sits in doubtful gloom his stockintrade unfurled in a damp funereal dressingroom in the theatre royal world  he comes to town at christmastime and braves its icy breath to play in that favourite pantomime harlequin life and death  a hoary flowing wig his weird unearthly cranium caps he hangs a long benevolent beard on a pair of empty chaps  to smooth his ghastly features down the actors art he cribs  a long and a flowing padded gown bedecks his rattling ribs  he cries go onbegin begin turn on the light of lime  im dressed for jolly old christmas in a favourite pantomime  the curtains upthe stage all black  time and the year nigh sped  time as an advertising quack  the old year nearly dead  the wand of time is waved and lo revealed old christmas stands and little children chuckle and crow and laugh and clap their hands  the cruel old scoundrel brightens up at the death of the olden year and he waves a gorgeous golden cup and bids the world good cheer  the little ones hail the festive king  no thought can make them sad their laughter comes with a sounding ring they clap and crow like mad  they only see in the humbug old a holiday every year and handsome gifts and joys untold and unaccustomed cheer  the old ones palsied blear and hoar their breasts in anguish beat  theyve seen him seventy times before how well they know the cheat  theyve seen that ghastly pantomime theyve felt its blighting breath they know that rollicking christmastime meant cold and want and death   starvationpoor law union fare  and deadly cramps and chills and illnessillness everywhere and crime and christmas bills  they know old christmas well i ween those men of ripened age theyve often often often seen that actor off the stage  they see in his gay rotundity a clumsy stuffedout dress  they see in the cup he waves on high a tinselled emptiness  those aged men so lean and wan theyve seen it all before they know theyll see the charlatan but twice or three times more  and so they bear with dance and song and crimson foil and green they wearily sit and grimly long for the transformation scene    ballad  haunted    haunted  ay in a social way by a body of ghosts in dread array but no conventional spectres they  appalling grim and tricky i quail at mine as id never quail at a fine traditional spectre pale with a turnip head and a ghostly wail and a splash of blood on the dickey  mine are horrible social ghosts  speeches and women and guests and hosts weddings and morning calls and toasts in every bad variety ghosts who hover about the grave of all thats manly free and brave youll find their names on the architrave of that charnelhouse society  black mondayblack as its schoolroom ink  with its dismal boys that snivel and think of its nauseous messes to eat and drink and its frozen tank to wash in that was the first that brought me grief and made me weep till i sought relief in an emblematical handkerchief to choke such baby bosh in  first and worst in the grim array ghosts of ghosts that have gone their way which i wouldnt revive for a single day for all the wealth of plutus  are the horrible ghosts that schooldays scared if the classical ghost that brutus dared was the ghost of his caesar unprepared im sure i pity brutus  i pass to critical seventeen the ghost of that terrible wedding scene when an elderly colonel stole my queen and woke my dream of heaven no schoolgirl decked in her nurseroom curls was my gushing innocent queen of pearls if she wasnt a girl of a thousand girls she was one of fortyseven  i see the ghost of my first cigar of the thencearising family jar  of my maiden brief i was at the bar and i called the judge your wushup of reckless days and reckless nights with wrenchedoff knockers extinguished lights unholy songs and tipsy fights which i strove in vain to hush up  ghosts of fraudulent jointstock banks ghosts of copy declined with thanks of novels returned in endless ranks and thousands more i suffer the only line to fitly grace my humble tomb when ive run my race is reader this is the restingplace of an unsuccessful duffer  ive fought them all these ghosts of mine but the weapons ive used are sighs and brine and now that im nearly fortynine old age is my chiefest bogy for my hair is thinning away at the crown and the silver fights with the wornout brown and a general verdict sets me down as an irreclaimable fogy    footnotes  1  a version of
