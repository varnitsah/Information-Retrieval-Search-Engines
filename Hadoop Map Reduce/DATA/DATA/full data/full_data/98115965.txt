98115965	the little nugget    by p g wodehouse       part one   in which the little nugget is introduced to the reader and plans are made for his future by several interested parties in which also the future mr peter burns is touched upon the whole concluding with a momentous telephonecall    the little nugget     i   if the management of the hotel guelph that london landmark could have been present at three oclock one afternoon in early january in the sittingroom of the suite which they had assigned to mrs elmer ford late of new york they might well have felt a little aggrieved philosophers among them would possibly have meditated on the limitations of human effort for they had done their best for mrs ford they had housed her well they had fed her well they had caused inspired servants to anticipate her every need yet here she was in the midst of all these aids to a contented mind exhibiting a restlessness and impatience of her surroundings that would have been noticeable in a caged tigress or a prisoner of the bastille she paced the room she sat down picked up a novel dropped it and rising resumed her patrol the clock striking she compared it with her watch which she had consulted two minutes before she opened the locket that hung by a gold chain from her neck looked at its contents and sighed finally going quickly into the bedroom she took from a suitcase a framed oilpainting and returning with it to the sittingroom placed it on a chair and stepped back gazing at it hungrily her large brown eyes normally hard and imperious were strangely softened her mouth quivered  ogden she whispered  the picture which had inspired this exhibition of feeling would probably not have affected the casual spectator to quite the same degree he would have seen merely a very faulty and amateurish portrait of a singularly repellent little boy of about eleven who stared out from the canvas with an expression half stolid half querulous a bulgy overfed little boy a little boy who looked exactly what he was the spoiled child of parents who had far more money than was good for them  as mrs ford gazed at the picture and the picture stared back at her the telephone bell rang she ran to it eagerly it was the office of the hotel announcing a caller  yes yes who her voice fell as if the name was not the one she had expected oh yes she said yes ask lord mountry to come to me here please  she returned to the portrait the look of impatience which had left her face as the bell sounded was back now she suppressed it with an effort as her visitor entered  lord mountry was a blond pinkfaced fairmoustached young man of about twentyeighta thickset solemn young man he winced as he caught sight of the picture which fixed him with a stony eye immediately on his entry and quickly looked away  i say its all right mrs ford he was of the type which wastes no time on preliminary greetings ive got him  got him  mrs fords voice was startled  stanborough you know  oh ii was thinking of something else wont you sit down  lord mountry sat down  the artist you know you remember you said at lunch the other day you wanted your little boys portrait painted as you only had one of him aged eleven  this is ogden lord mountry i painted this myself  his lordship who had selected a chair that enabled him to present a shoulder to the painting and was wearing a slightly dogged look suggestive of one who turns no more his head because he knows a frightful fiend doth close behind him tread forced himself round and met his gaze with as much nonchalance as he could summon up  er yes he said  he paused  fine manly little fellowwhat he continued  yes isnt he  his lordship stealthily resumed his former position  i recommended this fellow stanborough if you remember hes a great pal of mine and id like to give him a leg up if i could they tell me hes a topping artist dont know much about it myself you told me to bring him round here this afternoon you remember to talk things over hes waiting downstairs  oh yes yes of course ive not forgotten thank you so much lord mountry  rather a good scheme occurred to me that is if you havent thought over the idea of that trip on my yacht and decided it would bore you to death you still feel like making one of the partywhat  mrs ford shot a swift glance at the clock  im looking forward to it she said  well then why shouldnt we kill two birds with one stone combine the voyage and the portrait dont you know you could bring your little boy alonghed love the tripand id bring stanboroughwhat  this offer was not the outcome of a sudden spasm of warmheartedness on his lordships part he had pondered the matter deeply and had come to the conclusion that though it had flaws it was the best plan he was alive to the fact that a small boy was not an absolute essential to the success of a yachting trip and since seeing ogdens portrait he had realized still more clearly that the scheme had drawbacks but he badly wanted stanborough to make one of the party whatever ogden might be there was no doubt that billy stanborough that fellow of infinite jest was the ideal companion for a voyage it would make just all the difference having him the trouble was that stanborough flatly refused to take an indefinite holiday on the plea that he could not afford the time upon which his lordship seldom blessed with great ideas had surprised himself by producing the scheme he had just sketched out to mrs ford  he looked at her expectantly as he finished speaking and was surprised to see a swift cloud of distress pass over her face he rapidly reviewed his last speech no nothing to upset anyone in that he was puzzled  she looked past him at the portrait there was pain in her eyes  im afraid you dont quite understand the position of affairs she said her voice was harsh and strained  eh  you seei have not she stopped my little boy is notogden is not living with me just now  at school eh  no not at school let me tell you the whole position mr ford and i did not get on very well together and a year ago we were divorced in washington on the ground of incompatibility andand  she choked his lordship a young man with a shrinking horror of the deeper emotions whether exhibited in woman or man writhed silently that was the worst of these americans always getting divorced and causing unpleasantness how was a fellow to know why hadnt whoever it was who first introduced themhe couldnt remember who the dickens it wastold him about this he had supposed she was just the ordinary american woman doing europe with an affectionate dollardispensing husband in the background somewhere  er he said it was all he could find to say  andand the court said mrs ford between her teeth gave him the custody of ogden  lord mountry pink with embarrassment gurgled sympathetically  since then i have not seen ogden that was why i was interested when you mentioned your friend mr stanborough it struck me that mr ford could hardly object to my having a portrait of my son painted at my own expense nor do i suppose that he will whenif the matter is put to him but well you see it would be premature to make any arrangements at present for having the picture painted on our yacht trip  im afraid it knocks that scheme on the head said lord mountry mournfully  not necessarily  eh  i dont want to make plans yet butit is possible that ogden may be with us after all something may bearranged  you think you may be able to bring him along on the yacht after all  i am hoping so  lord mountry however willing to emit sympathetic gurgles was too plain and straightforward a young man to approve of wilful blindness to obvious facts  i dont see how you are going to override the decision of the court it holds good in england i suppose  i am hoping something may bearranged  oh same here same here certainly having done his duty by not allowing plain facts to be ignored his lordship was ready to become sympathetic again by the way where is ogden  he is down at mr fords house in the country but  she was interrupted by the ringing of the telephone bell she was out of her seat and across the room at the receiver with what appeared to lord mountrys startled gaze one bound as she put the instrument to her ear a wave of joy swept over her face she gave a little cry of delight and excitement  send them right up at once she said and turned to lord mountry transformed  lord mountry she said quickly please dont think me impossibly rude if i turn you out somesome people are coming to see me i must  his lordship rose hurriedly  of course of course certainly where did i put myah here he seized his hat and by way of economizing effort knocked his stick on to the floor with the same movement mrs ford watched his bendings and gropings with growing impatience till finally he rose a little flushed but with a full handstick gloves and hat all present and correct  goodbye then mrs ford for the present youll let me know if your little boy will be able to make one of our party on the yacht  yes yes thank you ever so much goodbye  goodbye  he reached the door and opened it  by jove he said springing roundstanborough what about stanborough shall i tell him to wait hes down below you know  yes yes tell mr stanborough im dreadfully sorry to have to keep him waiting and ask him if he wont stay for a few minutes in the palm room  inspiration came to lord mountry  ill give him a drink he said  yes yes anything lord mountry you really must go i know im rude i dont know what im saying butmy boy is returning to me  the accumulated chivalry of generations of chivalrous ancestors acted like a spur on his lordship he understood but dimly yet enough to enable him to realize that a scene was about to take place in which he was most emphatically not on a mothers meeting with her longlost child this is a sacred thing this was quite clear to him so turning like a flash he bounded through the doorway and as somebody happened to be coming in at the same time there was a collision which left him breathing apologies in his familiar attitude of stooping to pick up his hat  the newcomers were a tall strikingly handsome girl with a rather hard and cynical cast of countenance she was leading by the hand a small fat boy of about fourteen years of age whose likeness to the portrait on the chair proclaimed his identity he had escaped the collision but seemed offended by it for eyeing the bending peer with cold distaste he summed up his opinion of him in the one word chump  lord mountry rose  i beg your pardon he said for perhaps the seventh time he was thoroughly unstrung always excessively shy he was embarrassed now by quite a variety of causes the world was full of eyesmrs fords saying go ogdens saying fool the portrait saying idiot and finally the eyes of this wonderfully handsome girl large grey cool amused and contemptuous sayingso it seemed to him in that feverish momentwho is this curious pink person who cumbers the ground before me  ii beg your pardon he repeated  ought to look where youre going said ogden severely  not at all said the girl wont you introduce me nesta  lord mountrymiss drassilis said mrs ford  im afraid were driving lord mountry away said the girl her eyes seemed to his lordship larger greyer cooler more amused and more contemptuous than ever he floundered in them like an unskilful swimmer in deep waters  no no he stammered give you my word just going goodbye you wont forget to let me know about the yacht mrs fordwhat itll be an awfully jolly party goodbye goodbye miss drassilis  he looked at ogden for an instant as if undecided whether to take the liberty of addressing him too and then his heart apparently failing him turned and bolted from down the corridor came the clatter of a dropped stick  cynthia drassilis closed the door and smiled  a nervous young person she said what was he saying about a yacht nesta  mrs ford roused herself from her fascinated contemplation of ogden  oh nothing some of us are going to the south of france in his yacht next week  what a delightful idea  there was a certain pensive note in cynthias voice  a splendid idea she murmured  mrs ford swooped she descended on ogden in a swirl and rustle of expensive millinery and clasped him to her  my boy  it is not given to everybody to glide neatly into a scene of tense emotion ogden failed to do so he wriggled roughly from the embrace  got a cigarette he said  he was an extraordinarily unpleasant little boy physically the portrait standing on the chair did him more than justice painted by a mothers loving hand it flattered him it was bulgy he was more bulgy it was sullen he scowled and art having its limitations particularly amateur art the portrait gave no hint of his very repellent manner he was an intensely sophisticated child he had the air of one who has seen all life has to offer and is now permanently bored his speech and bearing were those of a young man and a distinctly unlovable young man  even mrs ford was momentarily chilled she laughed shakily  how very matteroffact you are darling she said  cynthia was regarding the heir to the ford millions with her usual steady halfcontemptuous gaze  he has been that all day she said you have no notion what a help it was to me  mrs ford turned to her effusively  oh cynthia dear i havent thanked you  no interpolated the girl dryly  youre a wonder darling you really are ive been repeating that ever since i got your telegram from eastnor she broke off ogden come near me my little son  he lurched towards her sullenly  dont muss a fellow now he stipulated before allowing himself to be enfolded in the outstretched arms  tell me cynthia resumed mrs ford how did you do it i was telling lord mountry that i hoped i might see my ogden again soon but i never really hoped it seemed too impossible that you should succeed  this lord mountry of yours said cynthia how did you get to know him why have i not seen him before  i met him in paris in the fall he has been out of london for a long time looking after his father who was ill  i see  he has been most kind making arrangements about getting ogdens portrait painted but bother lord mountry how did we get sidetracked on to him tell me how you got ogden away  cynthia yawned  it was extraordinarily easy as it turned out you see  ogden darling observed mrs ford dont go away i want you near me  oh all right  then stay by me angelface  oh slush muttered angelface beneath his breath say im darned hungry he added  it was if an electric shock had been applied to mrs ford she sprang to her feet  my poor child of course you must have some lunch ring the bell cynthia ill have them send up some here  ill have mine here said cynthia  oh youve had no lunch either i was forgetting that  i thought you were  you must both lunch here  really said cynthia i think it would be better if ogden had his downstairs in the restaurant  want to talk scandal eh  ogden dearest said mrs ford very well cynthia go ogden you will order yourself something substantial marvelchild  bet your life said the son and heir tersely  there was a brief silence as the door closed cynthia gazed at her friend with a peculiar expression  well i did it dear she said  yes its splendid youre a wonder darling  yes said cynthia  there was another silence  by the way said mrs ford didnt you say there was a little thing a small bill that was worrying you  did i mention it yes there is its rather pressing in fact its taking up most of the horizon at present here it is  is it a large sum mrs ford took the slip of paper and gave a slight gasp then coming to the bureau she took out her chequebook  its very kind of you nesta said cynthia they were beginning to show quite a vindictive spirit about it  she folded the cheque calmly and put it in her purse  and now tell me how you did it said mrs ford  she dropped into a chair and leaned back her hands behind her head for the first time she seemed to enjoy perfect peace of mind her eyes half closed as if she had been making ready to listen to some favourite music  tell me from the very beginning she said softly  cynthia checked a yawn  very well dear she said i caught the 1020 to eastnor which isnt a bad train if you ever want to go down there i arrived at a quarter past twelve and went straight up to the houseyouve never seen the house of course its quite charmingand told the butler that i wanted to see mr ford on business i had taken the precaution to find out that he was not there he is at droitwich  rheumatism murmured mrs ford he has it sometimes  the man told me he was away and then he seemed to think that i ought to go i stuck like a limpet i sent him to fetch ogdens tutor his name is brosterreggie broster he is a very nice young man big broad shoulders and such a kind face  yes dear yes  i told him i was doing a series of drawings for a magazine of the interiors of wellknown country houses  he believed you  he believed everything hes that kind of man he believed me when i told him that my editor particularly wanted me to sketch the staircase they had told me about the staircase at the inn i forget what it is exactly but its something rather special in staircases  so you got in  so i got in  and saw ogden  only for a momentthen reggie  who  mr broster i always think of him as reggie hes one of natures reggies such a kind honest face well as i was saying reggie discovered that it was time for lessons and sent ogden upstairs  by himself  by himself reggie and i chatted for a while  mrs fords eyes opened brown and bright and hard  mr broster is not a proper tutor for my boy she said coldly  i suppose it was wrong of reggie said cynthia buti was wearing this hat  go on  well after a time i said i must be starting my work he wanted me to start with the room we were in i said no i was going out into the grounds to sketch the house from the east i chose the east because it happens to be nearest the railway station i added that i supposed he sometimes took ogden for a little walk in the grounds he said yes he did and it was just about due he said possibly he might come round my way he said ogden would be interested in my sketch he seemed to think a lot of ogdens fondness for art  mr broster is not a proper tutor for my boy  well he isnt your boys tutor now is he dear  what happened then  i strolled off with my sketching things after a while reggie and ogden came up i said i hadnt been able to work because i had been frightened by a bull  did he believe that  certainly he believed it he was most kind and sympathetic we had a nice chat he told me all about himself he used to be very good at football he doesnt play now but he often thinks of the past  but he must have seen that you couldnt sketch then what became of your magazine commission story  well somehow the sketch seemed to get shelved i didnt even have to start it we were having our chat you see reggie was telling me how good he had been at football when he was at oxford and he wanted me to see a newspaper clipping of a varsity match he had played in i said id love to see it he said it was in his suitcase in the house so i promised to look after ogden while he fetched it i sent him off to get it just in time for us to catch the train off he went and here we are and now wont you order that lunch you mentioned im starving  mrs ford rose halfway to the telephone she stopped suddenly  my dear child it has only just struck me we must leave here at once he will have followed you he will guess that ogden has been kidnapped  cynthia smiled  believe me it takes reggie quite a long time to guess anything besides there are no trains for hours we are quite safe  are you sure  absolutely i made certain of that before i left  mrs ford kissed her impulsively  oh cynthia you really are wonderful  she started back with a cry as the bell rang sharply  for goodness sake nesta said cynthia with irritation do keep control of yourself theres nothing to be frightened about i tell you mr broster cant possibly have got here in the time even if he knew where to go to which i dont see how he could its probably ogden  the colour came back into mrs fords cheeks  why of course  cynthia opened the door  come in darling said mrs ford fondly and a wiry little man with grey hair and spectacles entered  good afternoon mrs ford he said i have come to take ogden back     ii   there are some situations in life so unexpected so trying that as far as concerns our opinion of those subjected to them we agree as it were not to count them we refuse to allow the victims behaviour in circumstances so exacting to weigh with us in our estimate of his or her character we permit the great general confronted suddenly with a mad bull to turn and run without forfeiting his reputation for courage the bishop who stepping on a concealed slide in winter entertains passersby with momentary ragtime steps loses none of his dignity once the performance is concluded  in the same way we must condone the behaviour of cynthia drassilis on opening the door of mrs fords sittingroom and admitting not ogden but this total stranger who accompanied his entry with the remarkable speech recorded at the close of the last section  she was a girl who prided herself on her carefully blase and supercilious attitude towards life but this changeling was too much for her she released the handle tottered back and having uttered a discordant squeak of amazement stood staring eyes and mouth wide open  on mrs ford the apparition had a different effect the rather foolish smile of welcome vanished from her face as if wiped away with a sponge her eyes fixed and frightened like those of a trapped animal glared at the intruder she took a step forward choking  whatwhat do you mean by daring to enter my room she cried  the man held his ground unmoved his bearing was a curious blend of diffidence and aggressiveness he was determined but apologetic a hired assassin of the middle ages resolved to do his job loyally yet conscious of causing inconvenience to his victim might have looked the same  i am sorry he said but i must ask you to let me have the boy mrs ford  cynthia was herself again now she raked the intruder with the cool stare which had so disconcerted lord mountry  who is this gentleman she asked languidly  the intruder was made of tougher stuff than his lordship he met her eye with quiet firmness  my name is mennick he said i am mr elmer fords private secretary  what do you want said mrs ford  i have already explained what i want mrs ford i want ogden  cynthia raised her eyebrows  what does he mean nesta ogden is not here  mr mennick produced from his breastpocket a telegraph form and in his quiet businesslike way proceeded to straighten it out  i have here he said a telegram from mr broster ogdens tutor it was one of the conditions of his engagement that if ever he was not certain of ogdens whereabouts he should let me know at once he tells me that early this afternoon he left ogden in the company of a strange young ladymr mennicks spectacles flashed for a moment at cynthiaand that when he returned both of them had disappeared he made inquiries and discovered that this young lady caught the 115 express to london ogden with her on receipt of this information i at once wired to mr ford for instructions i have his replyhe fished for and produced a second telegramhere  i still fail to see what brings you here said mrs ford owing to the gross carelessness of his fathers employees my son appears to have been kidnapped that is no reason  i will read mr fords telegram proceeded mr mennick unmoved it is rather long i think mr ford is somewhat annoyed the boy has obviously been stolen by some hireling of his mothers i am reading mr fords actual words he said addressing cynthia with that touch of diffidence which had marked his manner since his entrance  dont apologize said cynthia with a short laugh youre not responsible for mr fords rudeness  mr mennick bowed  he continued remove him from her illegal restraint if necessary call in police and employ force  charming said mrs ford  practical said mr mennick there is more before doing anything else sack that fool of a tutor then go to agency and have them recommend good private school for boy on no account engage another tutor they make me tired fix all this today send ogden back to eastnor with mrs sheridan she will stay there with him till further notice that is mr fords message  mr mennick folded both documents carefully and replaced them in his pocket  mrs ford looked at the clock  and now would you mind going mr mennick  i am sorry to appear discourteous mrs ford but i cannot go without ogden  i shall telephone to the office to send up a porter to remove you  i shall take advantage of his presence to ask him to fetch a policeman  in the excitement of combat the veneer of apologetic diffidence was beginning to wear off mr mennick he spoke irritably cynthia appealed to his reason with the air of a bored princess descending to argument with a groom  cant you see for yourself that hes not here she said do you think we are hiding him  perhaps you would like to search my bedroom said mrs ford flinging the door open  mr mennick remained uncrushed  quite unnecessary mrs ford i take it from the fact that he does not appear to be in this suite that he is downstairs making a late luncheon in the restaurant  i shall telephone  and tell them to send him up believe me mrs ford it is the only thing to do you have my deepest sympathy but i am employed by mr ford and must act solely in his interests the law is on my side i am here to fetch ogden away and i am going to have him  you shant  i may add that when i came up here i left mrs sheridanshe is a fellowsecretary of mine you may remember mr ford mentioning her in his telegrami left her to search the restaurant and grillroom with instructions to bring ogden if found to me in this room  the doorbell rang he went to the door and opened it  come in mrs sheridan ah  a girl in a plain neat blue dress entered the room she was a small graceful girl of about twentyfive pretty and brisk with the air of one accustomed to look after herself in a difficult world her eyes were clear and steady her mouth sensitive but firm her chin the chin of one who has met trouble and faced it bravely a little soldier  she was shepherding ogden before her a gorged but still sullen ogden he sighted mr mennick and stopped  hello he said what have you blown in for  he was just in the middle of his lunch said the girl i thought you wouldnt mind if i let him finish  say whats it all about anyway demanded ogden crossly cant a fellow have a bit of grub in peace you give me a pain  mr mennick explained  your father wishes you to return to eastnor ogden  oh all right i guess id better go then goodbye ma  mrs ford choked  kiss me ogden  ogden submitted to the embrace in sulky silence the others comported themselves each after his or her own fashion mr mennick fingered his chin uncomfortably cynthia turned to the table and picked up an illustrated paper mrs sheridans eyes filled with tears she took a halfstep towards mrs ford as if about to speak then drew back  come ogden said mr mennick gruffly necessary this hired assassin work but painfuldevilish painful he breathed a sigh of relief as he passed into the corridor with his prize  at the door mrs sheridan hesitated stopped and turned  im sorry she said impulsively  mrs ford turned away without speaking and went into the bedroom  cynthia laid down her paper  one moment mrs sheridan  the girl had turned to go she stopped  can you give me a minute come in and shut the door wont you sit down very well you seemed sorry for mrs ford just now  i am very sorry for mrs ford very sorry i hate to see her suffering i wish mr mennick had not brought me into this  nestas mad about that boy said cynthia heaven knows why i never saw such a repulsive child in my life however there it is i am sorry for you i gathered from what mr mennick said that you were to have a good deal of ogdens society for some time to come how do you feel about it  mrs sheridan moved towards the door  i must be going she said mr mennick will be waiting for me  one moment tell me dont you think after what you saw just now that mrs ford is the proper person to have charge of ogden you see how devoted she is to him  may i be quite frank with you  please  well then i think that mrs fords influence is the worst possible for ogden i am sorry for her but that does not alter my opinion it is entirely owing to mrs ford that ogden is what he is she spoiled him indulged him in every way never checked himtill he has becomewell what you yourself called him repulsive  cynthia laughed  oh well she said i only talked that mothers love stuff because you looked the sort of girl who would like it we can drop all that now and come down to business  i dont understand you  you will i dont know if you think that i kidnapped ogden from sheer affection for mrs ford i like nesta but not as much as that no im one of the getrichquickwallingfords and im looking out for myself all the time theres no one else to do it for me ive a beastly home my fathers dead my mothers a cat so  please stop said mrs sheridan i dont know why you are telling me all this  yes you do i dont know what salary mr ford pays you but i dont suppose its anything princely why dont you come over to us mrs ford would give you the earth if you smuggled ogden back to her  you seem to be trying to bribe me said mrs sheridan  in this case said cynthia appearances arent deceptive i am  good afternoon  dont be a little fool  the door slammed  come back cried cynthia she took a step as if to follow but gave up the idea with a laugh she sat down and began to read her illustrated paper again presently the bedroom door opened mrs ford came in she touched her eyes with a handkerchief as she entered cynthia looked up  im very sorry nesta she said  mrs ford went to the window and looked out  im not going to break down if thats what you mean she said i dont care and anyhow it shows that it can be done  cynthia turned a page of her paper  ive just been trying my hand at bribery and corruption  what do you mean  oh i promised and vowed many things in your name to that secretary person the female onenot mennickif she would help us nothing doing i told her to let us have ogden as soon as possible cod and she withered me with a glance and went  mrs ford shrugged her shoulders impatiently  oh let her go im sick of amateurs  thank you dear said cynthia  oh i know you did your best for an amateur you did wonderfully well but amateurs never really succeed there were a dozen little easy precautions which we neglected to take what we want is a professional a man whose business is kidnapping the sort of man who kidnaps as a matter of course someone like smooth sam fisher  my dear nesta who i dont think i know the gentleman  he tried to kidnap ogden in 1906 when we were in new york at least the police put it down to him though they could prove nothing then there was a horrible man the police said he was called buck macginnis he tried in 1907 that was in chicago  good gracious kidnapping ogden seems to be as popular as football and i thought i was a pioneer  something approaching pride came into mrs fords voice  i dont suppose theres a child in america she said who has had to be so carefully guarded why the kidnappers had a special name for himthey called him the little nugget for years we never allowed him out of our sight without a detective to watch him  well mr ford seems to have changed all that now i saw no detectives i suppose he thinks they arent necessary in england or perhaps he relied on mr broster poor reggie  it was criminally careless of him this will be a lesson to him he will be more careful in future how he leaves ogden at the mercy of anybody who cares to come along and snap him up  which incidentally does not make your chance of getting him away any lighter  oh ive given up hope now said mrs ford resignedly  i havent said cynthia  there was something in her voice which made her companion turn sharply and look at her mrs ford might affect to be resigned but she was a woman of determination and if the recent reverse had left her bruised it had by no means crushed her  cynthia what do you mean what are you hinting  you despise amateurs nesta but for all that it seems that your professionals who kidnap as a matter of course and all the rest of it have not been a bit more successful it was not my want of experience that made me fail it was my sex this is mans work if i had been a man i should at least have had brute force to fall back upon when mr mennick arrived  mrs ford nodded  yes but  and continued cynthia as all these smooth sam fishers of yours have failed too it is obvious that the only way to kidnap ogden is from within we must have some man working for us in the enemys camp  which is impossible said mrs ford dejectedly  not at all  you know a man  i know the man  cynthia what do you mean who is he  his name is peter burns  mrs ford shook her head  i dont know him  ill introduce you youll like him  but cynthia how do you know he would be willing to help us  he would do it for me cynthia paused you see she went on we are engaged to be married  my dear cynthia why did you not tell me when did it happen  last night at the fletchers dance  mrs fords eyes opened  last night were you at a dance last night and two railway journeys today you must be tired to death  oh im all right thanks i suppose i shall be a wreck and not fit to be seen tomorrow but just at present i feel as if nothing could tire me its the effect of being engaged perhaps  tell me about him  well hes rich and goodlooking and amiablecynthia ticked off these qualities on her fingersand i think hes brave and hes certainly not so stupid as mr broster  and youre very much in love with him  i like him theres no harm in peter  you certainly arent wildly enthusiastic  oh we shall hit it off quite well together i neednt pose to you nesta thank goodness thats one reason why im fond of you you know how i am situated ive got to marry some one rich and peters quite the nicest rich man ive ever met hes really wonderfully unselfish i cant understand it with his money you would expect him to be a perfect horror  a thought seemed to strike mrs ford  but if hes so rich she began i forget what i was going to say she broke off  dear nesta i know what you were going to say if hes so rich why should he be marrying me when he could take his pick of half london well ill tell you hes marrying me for one reason because hes sorry for me for another because i had the sense to make him he didnt think he was going to marry anyone a few years ago he had a disappointment a girl jilted him she must have been a fool he thought he was going to live the rest of his life alone with his broken heart i didnt mean to allow that its taken a long timeover two years from start to finishbut ive done it hes a sentimentalist i worked on his sympathy and last night i made him propose to me at the fletchers dance  mrs ford had not listened to these confidences unmoved several times she had tried to interrupt but had been brushed aside now she spoke sharply  you know i was not going to say anything of the kind and i dont think you should speak in this horrible cynical way ofof  she stopped flushing there were moments when she hated cynthia these occurred for the most part when the latter as now stirred her to an exhibition of honest feeling which she looked on as rather unbecoming mrs ford had spent twenty years trying to forget that her husband had married her from behind the counter of a general store in an illinois village and these lapses into the uncultivated genuineness of her girlhood made her uncomfortable  i wasnt going to say anything of the kind she repeated  cynthia was all smiling goodhumour  i know i was only teasing you stringing they call it in your country dont they  mrs ford was mollified  im sorry cynthia i didnt mean to snap at you all the same  she hesitated what she wanted to ask smacked so dreadfully of mechanicsville illinois yet she put the question bravely for she was somehow feeling quite troubled about this unknown mr burns arent you really fond of him at all cynthia  cynthia beamed  of course i am hes a dear nothing would make me give him up im devoted to old peter i only told you all that about him because it shows you how kindhearted he is hell do anything for me well shall i sound him about ogden  the magic word took mrs fords mind off the matrimonial future of mr burns and brought him into prominence in his capacity of knighterrant she laughed happily the contemplation of mr burns as knighterrant healed the sting of defeat the affair of mr mennick began to appear in the light of a mere skirmish  you take my breath away she said how do you propose that mr burns shall help us  its perfectly simple you heard mr mennick read that telegram ogden is to be sent to a private school peter shall go there too  but how i dont understand we dont know which school mr mennick will choose  we can very soon find out  but how can mr burns go there  nothing easier he will be a young man who has been left a little money and wants to start a school of his own he goes to ogdens man and suggests that he pay a small premium to come to him for a term as an extraassistantmaster to learn the business mr man will jump at him he will be getting the bargain of his life peter didnt get much of a degree at oxford but i believe he was wonderful at games from a privateschool point of view hes a treasure  butwould he do it  i think i can persuade him  mrs ford kissed her with an enthusiasm which hitherto she had reserved for ogden  my darling girl she cried if you knew how happy you have made me  i do said cynthia definitely and now you can do the same for me  anything anything you must have some more hats  i dont want any more hats i want to go with you on lord mountrys yacht to the riviera  of course said mrs ford after a slight pause it isnt my party you know dear  no but you can work me in darling  its quite a small party very quiet  crowds bore me i enjoy quiet  mrs ford capitulated  i fancy you are doing me a very good turn she said you must certainly come on the yacht  ill tell peter to come straight round here now said cynthia simply she went to the telephone       part two   in which other interested parties notably one buck macginnis and a trade rival smooth sam fisher make other plans for the nuggets future of stirring times at a private school for young gentlemen of stratagems spoils and alarms by night of journeys ending in lovers meetings the whole related by mr peter burns gentleman of leisure who forfeits that leisure in a good cause    peter burnss narrative     chapter 1   i  i am strongly of the opinion that after the age of twentyone a man ought not to be out of bed and awake at four in the morning the hour breeds thought at twentyone life being all future it may be examined with impunity but at thirty having become an uncomfortable mixture of future and past it is a thing to be looked at only when the sun is high and the world full of warmth and optimism  this thought came to me as i returned to my rooms after the fletchers ball the dawn was breaking as i let myself in the air was heavy with the peculiar desolation of a london winter morning the houses looked dead and untenanted a cart rumbled past and across the grey street a dingy black cat moving furtively along the pavement gave an additional touch of forlornness to the scene  i shivered i was tired and hungry and the reaction after the emotions of the night had left me dispirited  i was engaged to be married an hour back i had proposed to cynthia drassilis and i can honestly say that it had come as a great surprise to me  why had i done it did i love her it was so difficult to analyse love and perhaps the mere fact that i was attempting the task was an answer to the question certainly i had never tried to do so five years ago when i had loved audrey blake i had let myself be carried on from day to day in a sort of trance content to be utterly happy without dissecting my happiness but i was five years younger then and audrey wasaudrey  i must explain audrey for she in her turn explains cynthia  i have no illusions regarding my character when i first met audrey blake nature had given me the soul of a pig and circumstances had conspired to carry on natures work i loved comfort and i could afford to have it from the moment i came of age and relieved my trustees of the care of my money i wrapped myself in comfort as in a garment i wallowed in egoism in fact if between my twentyfirst and my twentyfifth birthdays i had one unselfish thought or did one genuinely unselfish action my memory is a blank on the point  it was at the height of this period that i became engaged to audrey now that i can understand her better and see myself impartially as i was in those days i can realize how indescribably offensive i must have been my love was real but that did not prevent its patronizing complacency being an insult i was king cophetua if i did not actually say in so many words this beggarmaid shall be my queen i said it plainly and often in my manner she was the daughter of a dissolute eviltempered artist whom i had met at a bohemian club he made a living by painting an occasional picture illustrating an occasional magazinestory but mainly by doing advertisement work a proprietor of a patent infants food not satisfied with the bare statement that baby cried for it would feel it necessary to push the fact home to the public through the medium of art and mr blake would be commissioned to draw the picture a good many specimens of his work in this vein were to be found in the back pages of the magazines  a man may make a living by these means but it is one that inclines him to jump at a wealthy soninlaw mr blake jumped at me it was one of his last acts on this earth a week after he hadas i now suspectbullied audrey into accepting me he died of pneumonia  his death had several results it postponed the wedding it stirred me to a very crescendo of patronage for with the removal of the breadwinner the only flaw in my cophetua pose had vanished and it gave audrey a great deal more scope than she had hitherto been granted for the exercise of free will in the choice of a husband  this last aspect of the matter was speedily brought to my notice which till then it had escaped by a letter from her handed to me one night at the club where i was sipping coffee and musing on the excellence of life in this best of all possible worlds  it was brief and to the point she had been married that morning  to say that that moment was a turning point in my life would be to use a ridiculously inadequate phrase it dynamited my life in a sense it killed me the man i had been died that night regretted i imagine by few whatever i am today i am certainly not the complacent spectator of life that i had been before that night  i crushed the letter in my hand and sat staring at it my pigsty in ruins about my ears face to face with the fact that even in a best of all possible worlds money will not buy everything  i remember as i sat there a man a club acquaintance a bore from whom i had fled many a time came and settled down beside me and began to talk he was a small man but he possessed a voice to which one had to listen he talked and talked and talked how i loathed him as i sat trying to think through his stream of words i see now that he saved me he forced me out of myself but at the time he oppressed me i was raw and bleeding i was struggling to grasp the incredible i had taken audreys unalterable affection for granted she was the natural complement to my scheme of comfort i wanted her i had chosen and was satisfied with her therefore all was well and now i had to adjust my mind to the impossible fact that i had lost her  her letter was a mirror in which i saw myself she said little but i understood and my selfsatisfaction was in ribbonsand something deeper than selfsatisfaction i saw now that i loved her as i had not dreamed myself capable of loving  and all the while this man talked and talked  i have a theory that speech persevered in is more efficacious in times of trouble than silent sympathy up to a certain point it maddens almost beyond endurance but that point past it soothes at least it was so in my case gradually i found myself hating him less soon i began to listen then to answer before i left the club that night the first mad frenzy in which i could have been capable of anything had gone from me and i walked home feeling curiously weak and helpless but calm to begin the new life  three years passed before i met cynthia i spent those years wandering in many countries at last as one is apt to do i drifted back to london and settled down again to a life which superficially was much the same as the one i had led in the days before i knew audrey my old circle in london had been wide and i found it easy to pick up dropped threads i made new friends among them cynthia drassilis  i liked cynthia and i was sorry for her i think that about that time i met her i was sorry for most people the shock of audreys departure had had that effect upon me it is always the bad nigger who gets religion most strongly at the campmeeting and in my case getting religion had taken the form of suppression of self i never have been able to do things by halves or even with a decent moderation as an egoist i had been thorough in my egoism and now fate having bludgeoned that vice out of me i found myself possessed of an almost morbid sympathy with the troubles of other people  i was extremely sorry for cynthia drassilis meeting her mother frequently i could hardly fail to be mrs drassilis was a representative of a type i disliked she was a widow who had been left with what she considered insufficient means and her outlook on life was a compound of greed and querulousness sloane square and south kensington are full of women in her situation their position resembles that of the ancient mariner water water everywhere and not a drop to drink for water in their case substitute money mrs drassilis was connected with money on all sides but could only obtain it in rare and minute quantities any one of a dozen relationsinlaw could if they had wished have trebled her annual income without feeling it but they did not so wish they disapproved of mrs drassilis in their opinion the hon hugo drassilis had married beneath himnot so far beneath him as to make the thing a horror to be avoided in conversation and thought but far enough to render them coldly polite to his wife during his lifetime and almost icy to his widow after his death hugos eldest brother the earl of westbourne had never liked the obviously beautiful but equally obviously secondrate daughter of a provincial solicitor whom hugo had suddenly presented to the family one memorable summer as his bride he considered that by doubling the income derived from hugos lifeinsurance and inviting cynthia to the family seat once a year during her childhood he had done all that could be expected of him in the matter  he had not mrs drassilis expected a great deal more of him the nonreceipt of which had spoiled her temper her looks and the peace of mind of all who had anything much to do with her  it used to irritate me when i overheard people as i occasionally have done speak of cynthia as hard i never found her so myself though heaven knows she had enough to make her so to me she was always a sympathetic charming friend  ours was a friendship almost untouched by sex our minds fitted so smoothly into one another that i had no inclination to fall in love i knew her too well i had no discoveries to make about her her honest simple soul had always been open to me to read there was none of that curiosity that sense of something beyond that makes for love we had reached a point of comradeship beyond which neither of us desired to pass  yet at the fletchers ball i asked cynthia to marry me and she consented                                       looking back i can see that though the determining cause was mr tankerville gifford it was audrey who was responsible she had made me human capable of sympathy and it was sympathy primarily that led me to say what i said that night  but the immediate cause was certainly young mr gifford  i arrived at marlow square where i was to pick up cynthia and her mother a little late and found mrs drassilis florid and overdressed in the drawingroom with a sleekhaired pale young man known to me as tankerville giffordto his intimates of whom i was not one and in the personal paragraphs of the coloured sporting weeklies as tanky i had seen him frequently at restaurants once at the empire somebody had introduced me to him but as he had not been sober at the moment he had missed any intellectual pleasure my acquaintanceship might have afforded him like everybody else who moves about in london i knew all about him to sum him up he was a most unspeakable little cad and if the drawingroom had not been mrs drassiliss i should have wondered at finding him in it  mrs drassilis introduced us  i think we have already met i said  he stared glassily  dont remember  i was not surprised  at this moment cynthia came in out of the corner of my eye i observed a look of fuddled displeasure come into tankys face at her frank pleasure at seeing me  i had never seen her looking better she is a tall girl who carries herself magnificently the simplicity of her dress gained an added dignity from comparison with the rank glitter of her mothers she wore unrelieved black a colour which set off to wonderful advantage the clear white of her skin and her palegold hair  youre late peter she said looking at the clock  i know im sorry  better be pushing what suggested tanky  my cabs waiting  will you ring the bell mr gifford said mrs drassilis i will tell parker to whistle for another  take me in yours i heard a voice whisper in my ear  i looked at cynthia her expression had not changed then i looked at tanky gifford and i understood i had seen that stuffedfish look on his face beforeon the occasion when i had been introduced to him at the empire  if you and mr gifford will take my cab i said to mrs drassilis we will follow  mrs drassilis blocked the motion i imagine that the sharp note in her voice was lost on tanky but it rang out like a clarion to me  i am in no hurry she said mr gifford will you take cynthia i will follow with mr burns you will meet parker on the stairs tell him to call another cab  as the door closed behind them she turned on me like a manycoloured snake  how can you be so extraordinarily tactless peter she cried youre a perfect fool have you no eyes  im sorry i said  hes devoted to her  im sorry  what do you mean  sorry for her  she seemed to draw herself together inside her dress her eyes glittered my mouth felt very dry and my heart was beginning to thump we were both furiously angry it was a moment that had been coming for years and we both knew it for my part i was glad that it had come on subjects on which one feels deeply it is a relief to speak ones mind  oh she said at last her voice quivered she was clutching at her selfcontrol as it slipped from her oh and what is my daughter to you mr burns  a great friend  and i suppose you think it friendly to try to spoil her chances  if mr gifford is a sample of themyes  what do you mean  she choked  i see i understand i am going to put a stop to this once and for all do you hear i have noticed it for a long time because i have given you the run of the house and allowed you to come in and out as you pleased like a tame cat you presume  presume i prompted  you come here and stand in cynthias way you trade on the fact that you have known us all this time to monopolize her attention you spoil her chances you  the invaluable parker entered to say that the cab was at the door  we drove to the fletchers house in silence the spell had been broken neither of us could recapture that first fine careless rapture which had carried us through the opening stages of the conflict and discussion of the subject on a less exalted plane was impossible it was that blessed period of calm the rest between rounds and we observed it to the full  when i reached the ballroom a waltz was just finishing cynthia a statue in black was dancing with tanky gifford they were opposite me when the music stopped and she caught sight of me over his shoulder  she disengaged herself and moved quickly towards me  take me away she said under her breath anywhere quick  it was no time to consider the etiquette of the ballroom tanky startled at his sudden loneliness seemed by his expression to be endeavouring to bring his mind to bear on the matter a couple making for the door cut us off from him and following them we passed out  neither of us spoke till we had reached the little room where i had meditated  she sat down she was looking pale and tired  oh dear she said  i understood i seemed to see that journey in the cab those dances those terrible betweendances   it was very sudden  i took her hand she turned to me with a tired smile there were tears in her eyes   i heard myself speaking   she was looking at me her eyes shining all the weariness seemed to have gone out of them  i looked at her  there was something missing i had felt it when i was speaking to me my voice had had no ring of conviction and then i saw what it was there was no mystery we knew each other too well friendship kills love  she put my thought into words  we have always been brother and sister she said doubtfully  till tonight  you have changed tonight you really want me  did i i tried to put the question to myself and answer it honestly yes in a sense i had changed tonight there was an added appreciation of her fineness a quickening of that blend of admiration and pity which i had always felt for her i wanted with all my heart to help her to take her away from her dreadful surroundings to make her happy but did i want her in the sense in which she had used the word did i want her as i had wanted audrey blake i winced away from the question audrey belonged to the dead past but it hurt to think of her  was it merely because i was five years older now than when i had wanted audrey that the fire had gone out of me  i shut my mind against my doubts  i have changed tonight i said  and i bent down and kissed her  i was conscious of being defiant against somebody and then i knew that the somebody was myself  i poured myself out a cup of hot coffee from the flask which smith my man had filled against my return it put life into me the oppression lifted  and yet there remained something that made for uneasiness a sort of foreboding at the back of my mind  i had taken a step in the dark and i was afraid for cynthia i had undertaken to give her happiness was i certain that i could succeed the glow of chivalry had left me and i began to doubt  audrey had taken from me something that i could not recoverpoetry was as near as i could get to a definition of it yes poetry with cynthia my feet would always be on the solid earth to the end of the chapter we should be friends and nothing more  i found myself pitying cynthia intensely i saw her future a series of years of intolerable dullness she was too good to be tied for life to a battered hulk like myself  i drank more coffee and my mood changed even in the grey of a winter morning a man of thirty in excellent health cannot pose to himself for long as a piece of human junk especially if he comforts himself with hot coffee  my mind resumed its balance i laughed at myself as a sentimental fraud of course i could make her happy no man and woman had ever been more admirably suited to each other as for that first disaster which i had been magnifying into a lifetragedy what of it an incident of my boyhood a ridiculous episode whichi rose with the intention of doing so at oncei should now proceed to eliminate from my life  i went quickly to my desk unlocked it and took out a photograph  and thenundoubtedly four oclock in the morning is no time for a man to try to be singleminded and decisivei wavered i had intended to tear the thing in pieces without a glance and fling it into the wastepaperbasket but i took the glance and i hesitated  the girl in the photograph was small and slight and she looked straight out of the picture with large eyes that met and challenged mine how well i remembered them those irishblue eyes under their expressive rather heavy brows how exactly the photographer had caught that halfwistful halfimpudent look the chin tilted the mouth curving into a smile  in a wave all my doubts had surged back upon me was this mere sentimentalism a fourinthemorning tribute to the pathos of the flying years or did she really fill my soul and stand guard over it so that no successor could enter in and usurp her place  i had no answer unless the fact that i replaced the photograph in its drawer was one i felt that this thing could not be decided now it was more difficult than i had thought  all my gloom had returned by the time i was in bed hours seemed to pass while i tossed restlessly aching for sleep  when i woke my last coherent thought was still clear in my mind it was a passionate vow that come what might if those irish eyes were to haunt me till my death i would play the game loyally with cynthia   ii  the telephone bell rang just as i was getting ready to call at marlow square and inform mrs drassilis of the position of affairs cynthia i imagined would have broken the news already which would mitigate the embarrassment of the interview to some extent but the recollection of my last nights encounter with mrs drassilis prevented me from looking forward with any joy to the prospect of meeting her again  cynthias voice greeted me as i unhooked the receiver  hullo peter is that you i want you to come round here at once  i was just starting i said  i dont mean marlow square im not there im at the guelph ask for mrs fords suite its very important ill tell you all about it when you get here come as soon as you can  my rooms were conveniently situated for visits to the hotel guelph a walk of a couple of minutes took me there mrs fords suite was on the third floor i rang the bell and cynthia opened the door to me  come in she said youre a dear to be so quick  my rooms are only just round the corner she shut the door and for the first time we looked at one another i could not say that i was nervous but there was certainly to me a something strange in the atmosphere last night seemed a long way off and somehow a little unreal i suppose i must have shown this in my manner for she suddenly broke what had amounted to a distinct pause by giving a little laugh peter she said youre embarrassed i denied the charge warmly but without real conviction i was embarrassed then you ought to be she said last night when i was looking my very best in a lovely dress you asked me to marry you now you see me again in cold blood and youre wondering how you can back out of it without hurting my feelings  i smiled she did not i ceased to smile she was looking at me in a very peculiar manner  peter she said are you sure  my dear old cynthia i said whats the matter with you  you are sure she persisted  absolutely entirely sure i had a vision of two large eyes looking at me out of a photograph it came and went in a flash  i kissed cynthia  what quantities of hair you have i said its a shame to cover it up she was not responsive youre in a very queer mood today cynthia i went on whats the matter  ive been thinking  out with it something has gone wrong an idea flashed upon me erhas your motheris your mother very angry about  mothers delighted she always liked you peter  i had the selfrestraint to check a grin  then what is it i said tired after the dance  nothing as simple as that  tell me  its so difficult to put it into words  try  she was playing with the papers on the table her face turned away for a moment she did not speak  ive been worrying myself peter she said at last you are so chivalrous and unselfish youre quixotic its that that is troubling me are you marrying me just because youre sorry for me dont speak i can tell you now if you will just let me say straight out whats in my mind we have known each other for two years now you know all about me you know howhow unhappy i am at home are you marrying me just because you pity me and want to take me out of all that  my dear girl  you havent answered my question  i answered it two minutes ago when you asked me if  you do love me  yes  all this time she had been keeping her face averted but now she turned and looked into my eyes with an abrupt intensity which i confess startled me her words startled me more  peter do you love me as much as you loved audrey blake  in the instant which divided her words from my reply my mind flew hither and thither trying to recall an occasion when i could have mentioned audrey to her i was convinced that i had not done so i never mentioned audrey to anyone  there is a grain of superstition in the most levelheaded man i am not particularly levelheaded and i have more than a grain in me i was shaken ever since i had asked cynthia to marry me it seemed as if the ghost of audrey had come back into my life  good lord i cried what do you know of audrey blake  she turned her face away again  her name seems to affect you very strongly she said quietly  i recovered myself  if you ask an old soldier i said he will tell you that a wound long after it has healed is apt to give you an occasional twinge  not if it has really healed  yes when it has really healedwhen you can hardly remember how you were fool enough to get it  she said nothing  how did you hear aboutit i asked  when i first met you or soon after a friend of yourswe happened to be talking about youtold me that you had been engaged to be married to a girl named audrey blake he was to have been your best man he said but one day you wrote and told him there would be no wedding and then you disappeared and nobody saw you again for three years  yes i said that is all quite true  it seems to have been a serious affair peter i meanthe sort of thing a man would find it hard to forget  i tried to smile but i knew that i was not doing it well it was hurting me extraordinarily this discussion of audrey  a man would find it almost impossible i said unless he had a remarkably poor memory  i didnt mean that you know what i mean by forget  yes i said i do  she came quickly to me and took me by the shoulders looking into my face  peter can you honestly say you have forgotten herin the sense i mean  yes i said  again that feeling swept over methat curious sensation of being defiant against myself  she does not stand between us  no i said  i could feel the effort behind the word it was as if some subconscious part of me were working to keep it back  peter  there was a soft smile on her face as she raised it to mine i put my arms around her  she drew away with a little laugh her whole manner had changed she was a different being from the girl who had looked so gravely into my eyes a moment before  oh my dear boy how terribly muscular you are youve crushed me i expect you used to be splendid at football like mr broster  i did not reply at once i cannot wrap up the deeper emotions and put them back on their shelf directly i have no further immediate use for them i slowly adjusted myself to the new key of the conversation  whos broster i asked at length  he used to be tutor toshe turned me round and pointedto that  i had seen a picture standing on one of the chairs when i entered the room but had taken no particular notice of it i now gave it a closer glance it was a portrait very crudely done of a singularly repulsive child of about ten or eleven years old  was he poor chap well we all have our troubles dont we who is this young thug not a friend of yours i hope  that is ogden mrs fords son its a tragedy  perhaps it doesnt do him justice does he really squint like that or is it just the artists imagination  dont make fun of it its the loss of that boy that is breaking nestas heart  i was shocked  is he dead im awfully sorry i wouldnt for the world  no no he is alive and well but he is dead to her the court gave him into the custody of his father  the court  mrs ford was the wife of elmer ford the american millionaire they were divorced a year ago  i see  cynthia was gazing at the portrait  this boy is quite a celebrity in his way she said they call him the little nugget in america  oh why is that  its a nickname the kidnappers have for him ever so many attempts have been made to steal him  she stopped and looked at me oddly  i made one today peter she said i went down to the country where the boy was and kidnapped him  cynthia what on earth do you mean  dont you understand i did it for nestas sake she was breaking her heart about not being able to see him so i slipped down and stole him away and brought him back here  i do not know if i was looking as amazed as i felt i hope not for i felt as if my brain were giving way the perfect calmness with which she spoke of this extraordinary freak added to my confusion  youre joking  no i stole him  but good heavens the law its a penal offence you know  well i did it men like elmer ford arent fit to have charge of a child you dont know him but hes just an unscrupulous financier without a thought above money to think of a boy growing up in that tainted atmosphereat his most impressionable age it means death to any good there is in him  my mind was still grappling feebly with the legal aspect of the affair  but cynthia kidnappings kidnapping you know the law doesnt take any notice of motives if youre caught  she cut through my babble  would you have been afraid to do it peter  well i began i had not considered the point before  i dont believe you would if i asked you to do it for my sake  but cynthia kidnapping you know its such an infernally lowdown game  i played it do you despise me  i perspired i could think of no other reply  peter she said i understand your scruples i know exactly how you feel but cant you see that this is quite different from the sort of kidnapping you naturally look on as horrible its just taking a boy away from surroundings that must harm him back to his mother who worships him its not wrong its splendid  she paused  you will do it for me peter she said  i dont understand i said feebly its done youve kidnapped him yourself  they tracked him and took him back and now i want you to try she came closer to me peter dont you see what it will mean to me if you agree to try im only human i cant help at the bottom of my heart still being a little jealous of this audrey blake no dont say anything words cant cure me but if you do this thing for me i shall be satisfied i shall know  she was close beside me holding my arm and looking into my face that sense of the unreality of things which had haunted me since that moment at the dance came over me with renewed intensity life had ceased to be a rather grey orderly business in which day succeeded day calmly and without event its steady stream had broken up into rapids and i was being whirled away on them  will you do it peter say you will  a voice presumably mine answered yes  my dear old boy  she pushed me into a chair and sitting on the arm of it laid her hand on mine and became of a sudden wondrously businesslike  listen she said ill tell you what we have arranged  it was borne in upon me as she began to do so that she appeared from the very beginning to have been extremely confident that that essential part of her plans my consent to the scheme could be relied upon as something of a certainty women have these intuitions   iii  looking back i think i can fix the point at which this insane venture i had undertaken ceased to be a distorted dream from which i vaguely hoped that i might shortly waken and took shape as a reality of the immediate future that moment came when i met mr arnold abney by appointment at his club  till then the whole enterprise had been visionary i gathered from cynthia that the boy ogden was shortly to be sent to a preparatory school and that i was to insinuate myself into this school and watching my opportunity to remove him but it seemed to me that the obstacles to this comparatively lucid scheme were insuperable in the first place how were we to discover which of englands million preparatory schools mr ford or mr mennick for him would choose secondly the plot which was to carry me triumphantly into this school whenor iffound struck me as extremely thin i was to pose cynthia told me as a young man of private means anxious to learn the business with a view to setting up a school of his own the objection to that was i held that i obviously did not want to do anything of the sort i had not the appearance of a man with such an ambition i had none of the conversation of such a man  i put it to cynthia  they would find me out in a day i assured her a man who wants to set up a school has got to be a pretty brainy sort of fellow i dont know anything  you got your degree  a degree at any rate ive forgotten all i knew  that doesnt matter you have the money anybody with money can start a school even if he doesnt know a thing nobody would think it strange  it struck me as a monstrous slur on our educational system but reflection told me it was true the proprietor of a preparatory school if he is a man of wealth need not be able to teach any more than an impresario need be able to write plays  well well pass that for the moment i said heres the real difficulty how are you going to find out the school mr ford has chosen  i have found it out alreadyor nesta has she set a detective to work it was perfectly easy ogdens going to mr abneys sanstead house is the name of the place its in hampshire somewhere quite a small school but full of little dukes and earls and things lord mountrys younger brother augustus beckford is there  i had known lord mountry and his family well some years ago i remembered augustus dimly  mountry do you know him he was up at oxford with me  she seemed interested  what kind of a man is he she asked  oh quite a good sort rather an ass i havent seen him for years  hes a friend of nestas ive only met him once he is going to be your reference  my what  you will need a reference at least i suppose you will and anyhow if you say you know lord mountry it will make it simpler for you with mr abney the brother being at the school  does mountry know about this business have you told him why i want to go to abneys  nesta told him he thought it was very sporting of you he will tell mr abney anything we like by the way peter you will have to pay a premium or something i suppose but nesta will look after all expenses of course  on this point i made my only stand of the afternoon  no i said its very kind of her but this is going to be entirely an amateur performance im doing this for you and ill stand the racket good heavens fancy taking money for a job of this kind  she looked at me rather oddly  that is very sweet of you peter she said after a slight pause now lets get to work  and together we composed the letter which led to my sitting two days later in stately conference at his club with mr arnold abney ma of sanstead house hampshire  mr abney proved to be a long suave benevolent man with an oxford manner a high forehead thin white hands a cooing intonation and a general air of hushed importance as of one in constant communication with the great there was in his bearing something of the family solicitor in whom dukes confide and something of the private chaplain at the castle  he gave me the keynote to his character in the first minute of our acquaintanceship we had seated ourselves at a table in the smokingroom when an elderly gentleman shuffled past giving a nod in transit my companion sprang to his feet almost convulsively returned the salutation and subsided slowly into his chair again  the duke of devizes he said in an undertone a most able man most able his nephew lord ronald stokeshaye was one of my pupils a charming boy  i gathered that the old feudal spirit still glowed to some extent in mr abneys bosom  we came to business  so you wish to be one of us mr burns to enter the scholastic profession  i tried to look as if i did  well in certain circumstances the circumstances in which iahmyself i may say am situated there is no more delightful occupation the work is interesting there is the constant fascination of seeing these fresh young lives developand of helping them to developunder ones eyes in any case i may say there is the exceptional interest of being in a position to mould the growing minds of lads who will some day take their place among the countrys hereditary legislators that little knot of devoted men who despite the vulgar attacks of loudmouthed demagogues still do their share and more in the guidance of englands fortunes yes  he paused i said i thought so too  you are an oxford man mr burns i think you told me ah i have your letter here just so you were atah yes a fine college the dean is a lifelong friend of mine perhaps you knew my late pupil lord rollono he would have been since your time a delightful boy quite delightful  and you took your degree exactly and represented the university at both cricket and rugby football excellent mens sana inahcorpore in fact sano yes  he folded the letter carefully and replaced it in his pocket  your primary object in coming to me mr burns is i gather to learn theahthe ropes the business you have had little or no previous experience of schoolmastering  none whatever  then your best plan would undoubtedly be to consider yourself and work for a time simply as an ordinary assistantmaster you would thus get a sound knowledge of the intricacies of the profession which would stand you in good stead when you decide to set up your own school schoolmastering is a profession which cannot be taught adequately except in practice only those whoahbrave its dangers comprehend its mystery yes i would certainly recommend you to begin at the foot of the ladder and go at least for a time through the mill  certainly i said of course  my ready acquiescence pleased him i could see that he was relieved i think he had expected me to jib at the prospect of actual work  as it happens he said my classical master left me at the end of last term i was about to go to the agency for a successor when your letter arrived would you consider  i had to think this over feeling kindly disposed towards mr arnold abney i wished to do him as little harm as possible i was going to rob him of a boy who while no moulding of his growing mind could make him into a hereditary legislator did undoubtedly represent a portion of mr abneys annual income and i did not want to increase my offence by being a useless assistantmaster then i reflected that if i was no jowett at least i knew enough latin and greek to teach the rudiments of those languages to small boys my conscience was satisfied  i should be delighted i said  excellent then let us consider that asahsettled said mr abney  there was a pause my companion began to fiddle a little uncomfortably with an ashtray i wondered what was the matter and then it came to me we were about to become sordid the discussion of terms was upon us  and as i realized this i saw simultaneously how i could throw one more sop to my exigent conscience after all the whole thing was really a question of hard cash by kidnapping ogden i should be taking money from mr abney by paying my premium i should be giving it back to him  i considered the circumstances ogden was now about thirteen years old the preparatoryschool age limit may be estimated roughly at fourteen that is to say in any event sanstead house could only harbour him for one year mr abneys fees i had to guess at to be on the safe side i fixed my premium at an outside figure and getting to the point at once i named it  it was entirely satisfactory my mental arithmetic had done me credit mr abney beamed upon me over tea and muffins we became very friendly in half an hour i heard more of the theory of schoolmastering than i had dreamed existed  we said goodbye at the club front door he smiled down at me benevolently from the top of the steps  goodbye mr burns goodbye he said we shall meet atahphilippi  when i reached my rooms i rang for smith  smith i said i want you to get some books for me first thing tomorrow you had better take a note of them  he moistened his pencil  a latin grammar  yes sir  a greek grammar  yes sir  brodley arnolds easy prose sentences  yes sir  and caesars gallic wars  what name sir  caesar  thank you sir anything else sir  no that will be all  very good sir  he shimmered from the room  thank goodness smith always has thought me mad and is consequently never surprised at anything i ask him to do     chapter 2   sanstead house was an imposing building in the georgian style it stood foursquare in the midst of about nine acres of land for the greater part of its existence i learned later it had been the private home of a family of the name of boone and in its early days the estate had been considerable but the progress of the years had brought changes to the boones money losses had necessitated the sale of land new roads had come into being cutting off portions of the estate from their centre new facilities for travel had drawn members of the family away from home the old fixed life of the country had changed and in the end the latest boone had come to the conclusion that to keep up so large and expensive a house was not worth his while  that the place should have become a school was the natural process of evolution it was too large for the ordinary purchaser and the estate had been so whittled down in the course of time that it was inadequate for the wealthy colonel boone had been glad to let it to mr abney and the school had started its career  it had all the necessary qualifications for a school it was isolated the village was two miles from its gates it was near the sea there were fields for cricket and football and inside the house a number of rooms of every size suitable for classrooms and dormitories  the household when i arrived consisted besides mr abney myself another master named glossop and the matron of twentyfour boys the butler the cook the oddjobman two housemaids a scullerymaid and a parlourmaid it was a little colony cut off from the outer world  with the exception of mr abney and glossop a dismal man of nerves and mannerisms the only person with whom i exchanged speech on my first evening was white the butler there are some men one likes at sight white was one of them even for a butler he was a man of remarkably smooth manners but he lacked that quality of austere aloofness which i have noticed in other butlers  he helped me unpack my box and we chatted during the process he was a man of medium height square and muscular with something some quality of springiness as it were that seemed unusual in a butler from one or two things he said i gathered that he had travelled a good deal altogether he interested me he had humour and the halfhour which i had spent with glossop made me set a premium on humour i found that he like myself was a newcomer his predecessor had left at short notice during the holidays and he had secured the vacancy at about the same time that i was securing mine we agreed that it was a pretty place white i gathered regarded its isolation as a merit he was not fond of village society  on the following morning at eight oclock my work began  my first day had the effect of entirely revolutionizing what ideas i possessed of the lot of the privateschool assistantmaster  my view till then had been that the assistantmaster had an easy time i had only studied him from the outside my opinion was based on observations made as a boy at my own private school when masters were an enviable race who went to bed when they liked had no preparation to do and couldnt be caned it seemed to me then that those three facts especially the last formed a pretty good basis on which to build up the perfect life  i had not been at sanstead house two days before doubts began to creep in on this point what the boy observing the assistantmaster standing about in apparently magnificent idleness does not realize is that the unfortunate is really putting in a spell of exceedingly hard work he is taking duty and taking duty is a thing to be remembered especially by a man who like myself has lived a life of fatted ease protected from all the minor annoyances of life by a substantial income  sanstead house educated me it startled me it showed me a hundred ways in which i had allowed myself to become soft and inefficient without being aware of it there may be other professions which call for a fiercer display of energy but for the man with a private income who has loitered through life at his own pace a little schoolmastering is brisk enough to be a wonderful tonic  i needed it and i got it  it was almost as if mr abney had realized intuitively how excellent the discipline of work was for my soul for the kindly man allowed me to do not only my own but most of his as well i have talked with assistantmasters since and i have gathered from them that headmasters of private schools are divided into two classes the workers and the runnersuptolondon mr abney belonged to the latter class indeed i doubt if a finer representative of the class could have been found in the length and breadth of southern england london drew him like a magnet  after breakfast he would take me aside the formula was always the same  ahmr burns  myself apprehensively scenting disaster like some wild creature caught within a trap who sees the trapper coming through the wood yes eryes  i am afraid i shall be obliged to run up to london today i have received an important letter from and then he would name some parent or some prospective parent by prospective i mean one who was thinking of sending his son to sanstead house you may have twenty children but unless you send them to his school a schoolmaster will refuse to dignify you with the name of parent  then he wishesahto see me or in the case of titled parents he wishesahto talk things over with me the distinction is subtle but he always made it  and presently the cab would roll away down the long drive and my work would begin and with it that souldiscipline to which i have alluded  taking duty makes certain definite calls upon a man he has to answer questions break up fights stop big boys bullying small boys prevent small boys bullying smaller boys check stonethrowing goingonthewetgrass worryingthecook teasingthedog makingtoomuchnoise and in particular discourage all forms of harakiri such as treeclimbing waterspoutscaling leaningtoofaroutofthewindow slidingdownthebanisters pencilswallowing and inkdrinkingbecausesomebodydaredmeto  at intervals throughout the day there are further feats to perform carving the joint helping the pudding playing football reading prayers teaching herding stragglers in for meals and going round the dormitories to see that the lights are out are a few of them  i wanted to oblige cynthia if i could but there were moments during the first day or so when i wondered how on earth i was going to snatch the necessary time to combine kidnapping with my other duties of all the learned professions it seemed to me that that of the kidnapper most urgently demanded certain intervals for leisured thought in which schemes and plots might be matured  schools vary sanstead house belonged to the more difficult class mr abneys constant flittings did much to add to the burdens of his assistants and his peculiar reverence for the aristocracy did even more his endeavour to make sanstead house a place where the delicately nurtured scions of the governing class might feel as little as possible the temporary loss of titled mothers led him into a benevolent tolerance which would have unsettled angels  success or failure for an assistantmaster is i consider very much a matter of luck my colleague glossop had most of the qualities that make for success but no luck properly backed up by mr abney he might have kept order as it was his classroom was a beargarden and when he took duty chaos reigned  i on the other hand had luck for some reason the boys agreed to accept me quite early in my sojourn i enjoyed that sweetest triumph of the assistantmasters life the spectacle of one boy smacking another boys head because the latter persisted in making a noise after i had told him to stop i doubt if a man can experience so keenly in any other way that thrill which comes from the knowledge that the populace is his friend political orators must have the same sort of feeling when their audience clamours for the ejection of a heckler but it cannot be so keen one is so helpless with boys unless they decide that they like one  it was a week from the beginning of the term before i made the acquaintance of the little nugget  i had kept my eyes open for him from the beginning and when i discovered that he was not at school i had felt alarmed had cynthia sent me down here to work as i had never worked before on a wildgoose chase  then one morning mr abney drew me aside after breakfast  ahmr burns  it was the first time that i had heard those soontobefamiliar words  i fear i shall be compelled to run up to london today i have an important appointment with the father of a boy who is coming to the school he wishesahto see me  this might be the little nugget at last  i was right during the interval before school augustus beckford approached me lord mountrys brother was a stolid boy with freckles he had two claims to popular fame he could hold his breath longer than any other boy in the school and he always got hold of any piece of gossip first  theres a new kid coming tonight sir he saidan american kid i heard him talking about it to the matron the kids names ford i believe the kids fathers awfully rich would you like to be rich sir i wish i was rich if i was rich id buy all sorts of things i believe im going to be rich when i grow up i heard father talking to a lawyer about it theres a new parlourmaid coming soon sir i heard cook telling emily im blowed if id like to be a parlourmaid would you sir id much rather be a cook  he pondered the point for a moment when he spoke again it was to touch on a still more profound problem  if you wanted a halfpenny to make up twopence to buy a lizard what would you do sir  he got it  ogden ford the el dorado of the kidnapping industry entered sanstead house at a quarter past nine that evening he was preceded by a worried look mr arnold abney a cabman bearing a large box and the oddjob man carrying two suitcases i have given precedence to the worried look because it was a thing by itself to say that mr abney wore it would be to create a wrong impression mr abney simply followed in its wake he was concealed behind it much as macbeths army was concealed behind the woods of dunsinane  i only caught a glimpse of ogden as mr abney showed him into his study he seemed a selfpossessed boy very like but if anything uglier than the portrait of him which i had seen at the hotel guelph  a moment later the door opened and my employer came out he appeared relieved at seeing me  ah mr burns i was about to go in search of you can you spare me a moment let us go into the diningroom  that is a boy called ford mr burns he said when he had closed the door a rathererremarkable boy he is an american the son of a mr elmer ford as he will be to a great extent in your charge i should like to prepare you for hisahpeculiarities  is he peculiar  a faint spasm disturbed mr abneys face he applied a silk handkerchief to his forehead before he replied  in many ways judged by the standard of the lads who have passed through my handsboys of course who it is only fair to add have enjoyed the advantages of a singularly refined homelifehe may be said to beahsomewhat peculiar while i have no doubt that au fond  au fond he is a charming boy quite charming at present he isshall i saypeculiar i am disposed to imagine that he has been from childhood up systematically indulged there has been in his life i suspect little or no discipline the result has been to make him curiously unboylike there is a complete absence of that diffidence that childish capacity for surprise which i for one find so charming in our english boys little ford appears to be completely blase he has tastes and ideas which are precocious andunusual in a boy of his age he expresses himself in a curious manner sometimes he seems to have little or no reverence forahconstituted authority  he paused while he passed his handkerchief once more over his forehead  mr ford the boys father who struck me as a man of great ability a typical american merchant prince was singularly frank with me about his domestic affairs as they concerned his son i cannot recall his exact words but the gist of what he said was that until now mrs ford had had sole charge of the boys upbringing andmr ford was singularly outspokenwas too indulgent in factahspoilt him indeedyou will of course respect my confidencethat was the real reason for the divorce whichahhas unhappily come about mr ford regards this school as in a measureshall i sayan antidote he wishes there to be no lack of wholesome discipline so that i shall expect you mr burns to check firmly though of course kindly such habits of his asahcigarettesmoking on our journey down he smoked incessantly i found it impossiblewithout physical violenceto induce him to stop but of course now that he is actually at the school and subject to the discipline of the school   exactly i said  that was all i wished to say perhaps it would be as well if you saw him now mr burns you will find him in the study  he drifted away and i went to the study to introduce myself  a cloud of tobaccosmoke rising above the back of an easychair greeted me as i opened the door moving into the room i perceived a pair of boots resting on the grate i stepped to the light and the remainder of the little nugget came into view  he was lying almost at full length in the chair his eyes fixed in dreamy abstraction upon the ceiling as i came towards him he drew at the cigarette between his fingers glanced at me looked away again and expelled another mouthful of smoke he was not interested in me  perhaps this indifference piqued me and i saw him with prejudiced eyes at any rate he seemed to me a singularly unprepossessing youth that portrait had flattered him he had a stout body and a round unwholesome face his eyes were dull and his mouth dropped discontentedly he had the air of one who is surfeited with life  i am disposed to imagine as mr abney would have said that my manner in addressing him was brisker and more incisive than mr abneys own i was irritated by his supercilious detachment  throw away that cigarette i said  to my amazement he did promptly i was beginning to wonder whether i had not been too abrupthe gave me a curious sensation of being a man of my own agewhen he produced a silver case from his pocket and opened it i saw that the cigarette in the fender was a stump  i took the case from his hand and threw it on to a table for the first time he seemed really to notice my existence  youve got a hell of a nerve he said  he was certainly exhibiting his various gifts in rapid order this i took it was what mr abney had called expressing himself in a curious manner  and dont swear i said  we eyed each other narrowly for the space of some seconds  who are you he demanded  i introduced myself  what do you want to come butting in for  i am paid to butt in its the main duty of an assistantmaster  oh youre the assistantmaster are you  one of them and in passingits a small technical pointyoure supposed to call me sir during these invigorating little chats of ours  call you what up an alley  i beg your pardon  fade away take a walk  i gathered that he was meaning to convey that he had considered my proposition but regretted his inability to entertain it  didnt you call your tutor sir when you were at home  me dont make me laugh ive got a cracked lip  i gather you havent an overwhelming respect for those set in authority over you  if you mean my tutors i should say nix  you use the plural had you a tutor before mr broster  he laughed  had i only about ten million  poor devils i said  whos swearing now  the point was well taken i corrected myself  poor brutes what happened to them did they commit suicide  oh they quit and i dont blame them im a pretty tough proposition and you dont want to forget it  he reached out for the cigarettecase i pocketed it  you make me tired he said  the sensations mutual  do you think you can swell around stopping me doing things  youve defined my job exactly  guess again i know all about this joint the hotair merchant was telling me about it on the train  i took the allusion to be to mr arnold abney and thought it rather a happy one  hes the boss and nobody but him is allowed to hit the fellows if you tried it youd lose your job and he aint going to because the dads paying double fees and hes scared stiff hell lose me if theres any trouble  you seem to have a grasp of the position  bet your life i have  i looked at him as he sprawled in the chair  youre a funny kid i said  he stiffened outraged his little eyes gleamed  say it looks to me as if you wanted making a head shorter youre a darned sight too fresh who do you think you are anyway  im your guardian angel i replied im the fellow whos going to take you in hand and make you a little ray of sunshine about the home i know your type backwards ive been in america and studied it on its native asphalt you superfatted millionaire kids are all the same if dad doesnt jerk you into the office before youre out of knickerbockers you just run to seed you get to think youre the only thing on earth and you go on thinking it till one day somebody comes along and shows you youre not and then you get whats coming to yougood and hard  he began to speak but i was on my favourite theme one i had studied and brooded upon since the evening when i had received a certain letter at my club  i knew a man i said who started out just like you he always had all the money he wanted never worked grew to think himself a sort of young prince what happened  he yawned  im afraid im boring you i said  go on enjoy yourself said the little nugget  well its a long story so ill spare you it but the moral of it was that a boy who is going to have money needs to be taken in hand and taught sense while hes young  he stretched himself  you talk a lot what do you reckon youre going to do  i eyed him thoughtfully  well everythings got to have a beginning i said what you seem to me to want most is exercise ill take you for a run every day you wont know yourself at the end of a week  say if you think youre going to get me to run  when i grab your little hand and start running youll find youll soon be running too and years hence when you win the marathon at the olympic games youll come to me with tears in your eyes and youll say  oh slush  i shouldnt wonder i looked at my watch meanwhile you had better go to bed its past your proper time  he stared at me in openeyed amazement  bed  bed  he seemed more amused than annoyed  say what time do you think i usually go to bed  i know what time you go here nine oclock  as if to support my words the door opened and mrs attwell the matron entered  i think its time he came to bed mr burns  just what i was saying mrs attwell  youre crazy observed the little nugget bed nothing  mrs attwell looked at me despairingly  i never saw such a boy  the whole machinery of the school was being held up by this legal infant any vacillation now and authority would suffer a setback from which it would be hard put to it to recover it seemed to me a situation that called for action  i bent down scooped the little nugget out of his chair like an oyster and made for the door outside he screamed incessantly he kicked me in the stomach and then on the knee he continued to scream he screamed all the way upstairs he was screaming when we reached his room                                       half an hour later i sat in the study smoking thoughtfully reports from the seat of war told of a sullen and probably only temporary acquiescence with fate on the part of the enemy he was in bed and seemed to have made up his mind to submit to the position an air of restrained jubilation prevailed among the elder members of the establishment mr abney was friendly and mrs attwell openly congratulatory i was something like the hero of the hour  but was i jubilant no i was inclined to moodiness unforeseen difficulties had arisen in my path till now i had regarded this kidnapping as something abstract personality had not entered into the matter if i had had any picture in my minds eye it was of myself stealing away softly into the night with a docile child his little hand laid trustfully in mine from what i had seen and heard of ogden ford in moments of emotion it seemed to me that whoever wanted to kidnap him with any approach to stealth would need to use chloroform  things were getting very complex     chapter 3   i have never kept a diary and i have found it in consequence somewhat difficult in telling this narrative to arrange the minor incidents of my story in their proper sequence i am writing by the light of an imperfect memory and the work is complicated by the fact that the early days of my sojourn at sanstead house are a blur a confused welter like a futurist picture from which emerge haphazard the figures of boysboys working boys eating boys playing football boys whispering shouting asking questions banging doors jumping on beds and clattering upstairs and along passages the whole picture faintly scented with a composite aroma consisting of roast beef ink chalk and that curious classroom smell which is like nothing else on earth  i cannot arrange the incidents i can see mr abney furrowed as to the brow and drooping at the jaw trying to separate ogden ford from a halfsmoked cigarstump i can hear glossop feverishly angry bellowing at an amused class a dozen other pictures come back to me but i cannot place them in their order and perhaps after all their sequence is unimportant this story deals with affairs which were outside the ordinary school life  with the war between the little nugget and authority for instance the narrative has little to do it is a subject for an epic but it lies apart from the main channel of the story and must be avoided to tell of his gradual taming of the chaos his advent caused until we became able to cope with him would be to turn this story into a treatise on education it is enough to say that the process of moulding his character and exorcising the devil which seemed to possess him was slow  it was ogden who introduced tobaccochewing into the school with fearful effects one saturday night on the aristocratic interiors of lords gartridge and windhall and honourables edwin bellamy and hildebrand kyne it was the ingenious gamblinggame imported by ogden which was rapidly undermining the moral sense of twentyfour innocent english boys when it was pounced upon by glossop it was ogden who on the one occasion when mr abney reluctantly resorted to the cane and administered four mild taps with it relieved his feelings by going upstairs and breaking all the windows in all the bedrooms  we had some difficult young charges at sanstead house abneys policy of benevolent toleration ensured that but ogden ford stood alone                                       i have said that it is difficult for me to place the lesser events of my narrative in their proper order i except three however which i will call the affair of the strange american the adventure of the sprinting butler and the episode of the genial visitor  i will describe them singly as they happened  it was the custom at sanstead house for each of the assistant masters to take half of one day in every week as a holiday the allowance was not liberal and in most schools i believe it is increased but mr abney was a man with peculiar views on other peoples holidays and glossop and i were accordingly restricted  my day was wednesday and on the wednesday of which i write i strolled towards the village i had in my mind a game of billiards at the local inn sanstead house and its neighbourhood were lacking in the fiercer metropolitan excitements and billiards at the feathers constituted for the pleasureseeker the beginning and end of the gay whirl  there was a local etiquette governing the game of billiards at the feathers you played the marker a hundred up then you took him into the barparlour and bought him refreshment he raised his glass said to you sir and drained it at a gulp after that you could if you wished play another game or go home as your fancy dictated  there was only one other occupant of the barparlour when we adjourned thither and a glance at him told me that he was not ostentatiously sober he was lying back in a chair with his feet on the sidetable and crooning slowly in a melancholy voice the following words    i dont careif he wearsa crown   hecantkeep kicking mydawg aroun  he was a tough cleanshaven man with a broken nose over which was tilted a soft felt hat his wiry limbs were clad in what i put down as a mailorder suit i could have placed him by his appearance if i had not already done so by his voice as an eastside new yorker and what an eastside new yorker could be doing in sanstead it was beyond me to explain  we had hardly seated ourselves when he rose and lurched out i saw him pass the window and his assertion that no crowned head should molest his dog came faintly to my ears as he went down the street  american said miss benjafield the stately barmaid with strong disapproval theyre all alike  i never contradict miss benjafieldone would as soon contradict the statue of libertyso i merely breathed sympathetically  whats he here for id like to know  it occurred to me that i also should like to know in another thirty hours i was to find out  i shall lay myself open to a charge of denseness such as even doctor watson would have scorned when i say that though i thought of the matter a good deal on my way back to the school i did not arrive at the obvious solution much teaching and taking of duty had dulled my wits and the presence at sanstead house of the little nugget did not even occur to me as a reason why strange americans should be prowling in the village  we now come to the remarkable activity of white the butler  it happened that same evening  it was not late when i started on my way back to the house but the short january day was over and it was very dark as i turned in at the big gate of the school and made my way up the drive the drive at sanstead house was a fine curving stretch of gravel about two hundred yards in length flanked on either side by fir trees and rhododendrons i stepped out briskly for it had begun to freeze just as i caught sight through the trees of the lights of the windows there came to me the sound of running feet  i stopped the noise grew louder there seemed to be two runners one moving with short quick steps the other the one in front taking a longer stride  i drew aside instinctively in another moment making a great clatter on the frozen gravel the first of the pair passed me and as he did so there was a sharp crack and something sang through the darkness like a large mosquito  the effect of the sound on the man who had been running was immediate he stopped in his stride and dived into the bushes his footsteps thudded faintly on the turf  the whole incident had lasted only a few seconds and i was still standing there when i was aware of the other man approaching he had apparently given up the pursuit for he was walking quite slowly he stopped within a few feet of me and i heard him swearing softly to himself  whos that i cried sharply the crack of the pistol had given a flick to my nerves mine had been a sheltered life into which hitherto revolvershots had not entered and i was resenting this abrupt introduction of them i felt jumpy and irritated  it gave me a malicious pleasure to see that i had startled the unknown dispenser of shocks quite as much as he had startled me the movement he made as he faced towards my direction was almost a leap and it suddenly flashed upon me that i had better at once establish my identity as a noncombatant i appeared to have wandered inadvertently into the midst of a private quarrel one party to whichthe one standing a couple of yards from me with a loaded revolver in his handwas evidently a man of impulse the sort of man who would shoot first and inquire afterwards  im mr burns i said im one of the assistantmasters who are you  mr burns  surely that rich voice was familiar  white i said  yes sir  what on earth do you think youre doing have you gone mad who was that man  i wish i could tell you sir a very doubtful character i found him prowling at the back of the house very suspiciously he took to his heels and i followed him  buti spoke querulously my orderly nature was shockedyou cant go shooting at people like that just because you find them at the back of the house he might have been a tradesman  i think not sir  well so do i if it comes to that he didnt behave like one but all the same  i take your point sir but i was merely intending to frighten him  you succeeded all right he went through those bushes like a cannonball  i heard him chuckle  i think i may have scared him a little sir  we must phone to the policestation could you describe the man  i think not sir it was very dark and if i may make the suggestion it would be better not to inform the police i have a very poor opinion of these country constables  but we cant have men prowling  if you will permit me sir i saylet them prowl its the only way to catch them  if you think this sort of thing is likely to happen again i must tell mr abney  pardon me sir i think it would be better not he impresses me as a somewhat nervous gentleman and it would only disturb him  at this moment it suddenly struck me that in my interest in the mysterious fugitive i had omitted to notice what was really the most remarkable point in the whole affair how did white happen to have a revolver at all i have met many butlers who behaved unexpectedly in their spare time one i knew played the fiddle another preached socialism in hyde park but i had never yet come across a butler who fired pistols  what were you doing with a revolver i asked  he hesitated  may i ask you to keep it to yourself sir if i tell you something he said at last  what do you mean  im a detective  what  a pinkertons man mr burns  i felt like one who sees the danger board over thin ice but for this information who knew what rash move i might not have made under the assumption that the little nugget was unguarded at the same time i could not help reflecting that if things had been complex before they had become far more so in the light of this discovery to spirit ogden away had never struck me since his arrival at the school as an easy task it seemed more difficult now than ever  i had the sense to affect astonishment i made my imitation of an innocent assistantmaster astounded by the news that the butler is a detective in disguise as realistic as i was able it appeared to be satisfactory for he began to explain  i am employed by mr elmer ford to guard his son there are several parties after that boy mr burns naturally he is a considerable prize mr ford would pay a large sum to get back his only son if he were kidnapped so it stands to reason he takes precautions  does mr abney know what you are  no sir mr abney thinks i am an ordinary butler you are the only person who knows and i have only told you because you have happened to catch me in a rather queer position for a butler to be in you will keep it to yourself sir it doesnt do for it to get about these things have to be done quietly it would be bad for the school if my presence here were advertised the other parents wouldnt like it they would think that their sons were in danger you see it would be disturbing for them so if you will just forget what ive been telling you mr burns  i assured him that i would but i was very far from meaning it if there was one thing which i intended to bear in mind it was the fact that watchful eyes besides mine were upon that little nugget  the third and last of this chain of occurrences the episode of the genial visitor took place on the following day and may be passed over briefly all that happened was that a welldressed man who gave his name as arthur gordon of philadelphia dropped in unexpectedly to inspect the school he apologized for not having written to make an appointment but explained that he was leaving england almost immediately he was looking for a school for his sisters son and happening to meet his business acquaintance mr elmer ford in london he had been recommended to mr abney he made himself exceedingly pleasant he was a breezy genial man who joked with mr abney chaffed the boys prodded the little nugget in the ribs to that overfed youths discomfort made a rollicking tour of the house in the course of which he inspected ogdens bedroomin order he told mr abney to be able to report conscientiously to his friend ford that the son and heir was not being pampered too much and departed in a whirl of goodhumour leaving every one enthusiastic over his charming personality his last words were that everything was thoroughly satisfactory and that he had learned all he wanted to know  which as was proved that same night was the simple truth     chapter 4   i  i owed it to my colleague glossop that i was in the centre of the surprising things that occurred that night by sheer weight of boredom glossop drove me from the house so that it came about that at half past nine the time at which the affair began i was patrolling the gravel in front of the porch  it was the practice of the staff of sanstead house school to assemble after dinner in mr abneys study for coffee the room was called the study but it was really more of a masters common room mr abney had a smaller sanctum of his own reserved exclusively for himself  on this particular night he went there early leaving me alone with glossop it is one of the drawbacks of the desertisland atmosphere of a private school that everybody is always meeting everybody else to avoid a man for long is impossible i had been avoiding glossop as long as i could for i knew that he wanted to corner me with a view to a hearttoheart talk on life insurance  these amateur life insurance agents are a curious band the world is full of them i have met them at countryhouses at seaside hotels on ships everywhere and it has always amazed me that they should find the game worth the candle what they add to their incomes i do not know but it cannot be very much and the trouble they have to take is colossal nobody loves them and they must see it yet they persevere glossop for instance had been trying to buttonhole me every time there was a five minutes break in the days work  he had his chance now and he did not mean to waste it mr abney had scarcely left the room when he began to exude pamphlets and booklets at every pocket  i eyed him sourly as he droned on about reactionable endowment surrendervalue and interest accumulating on the tontine policy and tried as i did so to analyse the loathing i felt for him i came to the conclusion that it was partly due to his pose of doing the whole thing from purely altruistic motives entirely for my good and partly because he forced me to face the fact that i was not always going to be young in an abstract fashion i had already realized that i should in time cease to be thirty but the way in which glossop spoke of my sixtyfifth birthday made me feel as if it was due tomorrow he was a man with a manner suggestive of a funeral mute suffering from suppressed jaundice and i had never before been so weighed down with a sense of the inevitability of decay and the remorseless passage of time i could feel my hair whitening  a need for solitude became imperative and murmuring something about thinking it over i escaped from the room  except for my bedroom whither he was quite capable of following me i had no refuge but the grounds i unbolted the front door and went out  it was still freezing and though the stars shone the trees grew so closely about the house that it was too dark for me to see more than a few feet in front of me  i began to stroll up and down the night was wonderfully still i could hear somebody walking up the driveone of the maids i supposed returning from her evening out i could even hear a bird rustling in the ivy on the walls of the stables  i fell into a train of thought i think my mind must still have been under glossops gloombreeding spell for i was filled with a sense of the infinite pathos of life what was the good of it all why was a man given chances of happiness without the sense to realize and use them if nature had made me so selfsatisfied that i had lost audrey because of my selfsatisfaction why had she not made me so selfsatisfied that i could lose her without a pang audrey it annoyed me that whenever i was free for a moment from active work my thoughts should keep turning to her it frightened me too engaged to cynthia i had no right to have such thoughts  perhaps it was the mystery which hung about her that kept her in my mind i did not know where she was i did not know how she fared i did not know what sort of a man it was whom she had preferred to me that it struck me was the crux of the matter she had vanished absolutely with another man whom i had never seen and whose very name i did not know i had been beaten by an unseen foe  i was deep in a very slough of despond when suddenly things began to happen i might have known that sanstead house would never permit solitary brooding on life for long it was a place of incident not of abstract speculation  i had reached the end of my beat and had stopped to relight my pipe when drama broke loose with the swift unexpectedness which was characteristic of the place the stillness of the night was split by a sound which i could have heard in a gale and recognized among a hundred conflicting noises it was a scream a shrill piercing squeal that did not rise to a crescendo but started at its maximum and held the note a squeal which could only proceed from one throat the deafening warcry of the little nugget  i had grown accustomed since my arrival at sanstead house to a certain quickening of the pace of life but tonight events succeeded one another with a rapidity which surprised me a whole cinematographdrama was enacted during the space of time it takes for a wooden match to burn  at the moment when the little nugget gave tongue i had just struck one and i stood startled into rigidity holding it in the air as if i had decided to constitute myself a sort of limelight man to the performance  it cannot have been more than a few seconds later before some person unknown nearly destroyed me  i was standing holding my match and listening to the sounds of confusion indoors when this person rounding the angle of the house in a desperate hurry emerged from the bushes and rammed me squarely  he was a short man or he must have crouched as he ran for his shouldera hard bony shoulderwas precisely the same distance from the ground as my solar plexus in the brief impact which ensued between the two the shoulder had the advantage of being in motion while the solar plexus was stationary and there was no room for any shadow of doubt as to which had the worst of it  that the mysterious unknown was not unshaken by the encounter was made clear by a sharp yelp of surprise and pain he staggered what happened to him after that was not a matter of interest to me i gather that he escaped into the night but i was too occupied with my own affairs to follow his movements  of all cures for melancholy introspection a violent blow in the solar plexus is the most immediate if mr corbett had any abstract worries that day at carson city i fancy they ceased to occupy his mind from the moment when mr fitzsimmons administered that historic left jab in my case the cure was instantaneous i can remember reeling across the gravel and falling in a heap and trying to breathe and knowing that i should never again be able to and then for some minutes all interest in the affairs of this world left me  how long it was before my breath returned hesitatingly like some timid prodigal son trying to muster up courage to enter the old home i do not know but it cannot have been many minutes for the house was only just beginning to disgorge its occupants as i sat up disconnected cries and questions filled the air dim forms moved about in the darkness  i had started to struggle to my feet feeling very sick and boneless when it was borne in upon me that the sensations of this remarkable night were not yet over as i reached a sitting position and paused before adventuring further to allow a wave of nausea to pass a hand was placed on my shoulder and a voice behind me said dont move   ii  i was not in a condition to argue beyond a fleeting feeling that a liberty was being taken with me and that i was being treated unjustly i do not remember resenting the command i had no notion who the speaker might be and no curiosity breathing just then had all the glamour of a difficult feat cleverly performed i concentrated my whole attention upon it i was pleased and surprised to find myself getting on so well i remember having much the same sensation when i first learned to ride a bicyclea kind of dazed feeling that i seemed to be doing it but heaven alone knew how  a minute or so later when i had leisure to observe outside matters i perceived that among the other actors in the drama confusion still reigned there was much scuttering about and much meaningless shouting mr abneys reedy tenor voice was issuing directions each of which reached a dizzier height of futility than the last glossop was repeating over and over again the words shall i telephone for the police to which nobody appeared to pay the least attention one or two boys were darting about like rabbits and squealing unintelligibly a female voicei think mrs attwellswas saying can you see him  up to this point my match long since extinguished had been the only illumination the affair had received but now somebody who proved to be white the butler came from the direction of the stableyard with a carriagelamp every one seemed calmer and happier for it the boys stopped squealing mrs attwell and glossop subsided and mr abney said ah in a selfsatisfied voice as if he had directed this move and was congratulating himself on the success with which it had been carried out  the whole strength of the company gathered round the light  thank you white said mr abney excellent i fear the scoundrel has escaped  i suspect so sir  this is a very remarkable occurrence white  yes sir  the man was actually in master fords bedroom  indeed sir  a shrill voice spoke i recognized it as that of augustus beckford always to be counted upon to be in the centre of things gathering information  sir please sir what was up who was it sir sir was it a burglar sir have you ever met a burglar sir my father took me to see raffles in the holidays sir do you think this chap was like raffles sir sir  it was undoubtedly mr abney was beginning when the identity of the questioner dawned upon him and for the first time he realized that the drive was full of boys actively engaged in catching their deaths of cold his allfriendshereletus discussthisinterestingepisodefully manner changed he became the outraged schoolmaster never before had i heard him speak so sharply to boys many of whom though breaking rules were still titled  what are you boys doing out of bed go back to bed instantly i shall punish you most severely i  shall i telephone for the police asked glossop disregarded  i will not have this conduct you will catch cold this is disgraceful ten bad marks i shall punish you most severely if you do not instantly  a calm voice interrupted him  say  the little nugget strolled easily into the circle of light he was wearing a dressinggown and in his hand was a smouldering cigarette from which he proceeded before continuing his remarks to blow a cloud of smoke  say i guess youre wrong that wasnt any ordinary porchclimber  the spectacle of his bete noire wreathed in smoke coming on top of the emotions of the night was almost too much for mr abney he gesticulated for a moment in impassioned silence his arms throwing grotesque shadows on the gravel  how dare you smoke boy how dare you smoke that cigarette  its the only one ive got responded the little nugget amiably  i have spoken to youi have warned youten bad marksi will not havefifteen bad marks  the little nugget ignored the painful scene he was smiling quietly  if you ask me he said that guy was after something better than plated spoons yes sir if you want my opinion it was buck macginnis or chicago ed or one of those guys and what he was trailing was me theyre always at it buck had a try for me in the fall of 07 and ed  do you hear me will you return instantly  if you dont believe me i can show you the piece there was about it in the papers ive got a pressclipping album in my box whenever theres a piece about me in the papers i cut it out and paste it into my album if youll come right along ill show you the story about buck now it happened in chicago and hed have got away with me if it hadnt been  twenty bad marks  mr abney  it was the person standing behind me who spoke till now he or she had remained a silent spectator waiting i suppose for a lull in the conversation  they jumped all together like a welltrained chorus  who is that cried mr abney i could tell by the sound of his voice that his nerves were on wires who was that who spoke  shall i telephone for the police asked glossop ignored  i am mrs sheridan mr abney you were expecting me tonight  mrs sheridan mrs sheri expected you in a cab i expected you inahin fact a cab  i walked  i had a curious sensation of having heard the voice before when she had told me not to move she had spoken in a whisperor to me in my dazed state it had sounded like a whisperbut now she was raising her voice and there was a note in it that seemed familiar it stirred some chord in my memory and i waited to hear it again  when it came it brought the same sensation but nothing more definite it left me groping for the clue  here is one of the men mr abney  there was a profound sensation boys who had ceased to squeal squealed with fresh vigour glossop made his suggestion about the telephone with a new ring of hope in his voice mrs attwell shrieked they made for us in a body boys and all white leading with the lantern i was almost sorry for being compelled to provide an anticlimax  augustus beckford was the first to recognize me and i expect he was about to ask me if i liked sitting on the gravel on a frosty night or what gravel was made of when mr abney spoke  mr burns whatdear mewhat are you doing there  perhaps mr burns can give us some information as to where the man went sir suggested white  on everything except that i said im a mine of information i havent the least idea where he went all i know about him is that he has a shoulder like the ram of a battleship and that he charged me with it  as i was speaking i thought i heard a little gasp behind me i turned i wanted to see this woman who stirred my memory with her voice but the rays of the lantern did not fall on her and she was a shapeless blur in the darkness somehow i felt that she was looking intently at me  i resumed my narrative  i was lighting my pipe when i heard a scream a chuckle came from the group behind the lantern  i screamed said the little nugget you bet i screamed what would you do if you woke up in the dark and found a strongarmed roughneck prising you out of bed as if you were a clam he tried to get his hand over my mouth but he only connected with my forehead and id got going before he could switch i guess i threw a scare into that gink  he chuckled again reminiscently and drew at his cigarette  how dare you smoke throw away that cigarette cried mr abney roused afresh by the red glow  forget it advised the little nugget tersely  and then i said somebody whizzed out from nowhere and hit me and after that i didnt seem to care much about him or anything else i spoke in the direction of my captor she was still standing outside the circle of light i expect you can tell us what happened mrs sheridan  i did not think that her information was likely to be of any practical use but i wanted to make her speak again  her first words were enough i wondered how i could ever have been in doubt i knew the voice now it was one which i had not heard for five years but one which i could never forget if i lived for ever  somebody ran past me i hardly heard her my heart was pounding and a curious dizziness had come over me i was grappling with the incredible i think he went into the bushes  i heard glossop speak and gathered from mr abneys reply that he had made his suggestion about the telephone once more  i think that will beahunnecessary mr glossop the man has undoubtedlyahmade good his escape i think we had all better return to the house he turned to the dim figure beside me ah mrs sheridan you must be tired after your journey and theah unusual excitement mrs attwell will show you where youin fact your room  in the general movement white must have raised the lamp or stepped forward for the rays shifted the figure beside me was no longer dim but stood out sharp and clear in the yellow light  i was aware of two large eyes looking into mine as in the grey london morning two weeks before they had looked from a faded photograph     chapter 5   of all the emotions which kept me awake that night a vague discomfort and a feeling of resentment against fate more than against any individual were the two that remained with me next morning astonishment does not last the fact of audrey and myself being under the same roof after all these years had ceased to amaze me it was a minor point and my mind shelved it in order to deal with the one thing that really mattered the fact that she had come back into my life just when i had definitely as i thought put her out of it  my resentment deepened fate had played me a wanton trick cynthia trusted me if i were weak i should not be the only one to suffer and something told me that i should be weak how could i hope to be strong tortured by the thousand memories which the sight of her would bring back to me  but i would fight i told myself i would not yield easily i promised that to my selfrespect and was rewarded with a certain glow of excitement i felt defiant i wanted to test myself at once  my opportunity came after breakfast she was standing on the gravel in front of the house almost in fact on the spot where we had met the night before she looked up as she heard my step and i saw that her chin had that determined tilt which in the days of our engagement i had noticed often without attaching any particular significance to it heavens what a ghastly lump of complacency i must have been in those days a child i thought if he were not wrapped up in the contemplation of his own magnificence could read its meaning  it meant war and i was glad of it i wanted war  good morning i said  good morning  there was a pause i took the opportunity to collect my thoughts  i looked at her curiously five years had left their mark on her but entirely for the good she had an air of quiet strength which i had never noticed in her before it may have been there in the old days but i did not think so it was i felt certain a later development she gave the impression of having been through much and of being sure of herself  in appearance she had changed amazingly little she looked as small and slight and trim as ever she had done she was a little paler i thought and the irish eyes were older and a shade harder but that was all  i awoke with a start to the fact that i was staring at her a slight flush had crept into her pale cheeks  dont she said suddenly with a little gesture of irritation  the word and the gesture killed as if they had been a blow a kind of sentimental tenderness which had been stealing over me  what are you doing here i asked  she was silent  please dont think i want to pry into your affairs i said viciously i was only interested in the coincidence that we should meet here like this  she turned to me impulsively her face had lost its hard look  oh peter she said im sorry i am sorry  it was my chance and i snatched at it with a lack of chivalry which i regretted almost immediately but i was feeling bitter and bitterness makes a man do cheap things  sorry i said politely puzzled why  she looked taken aback as i hoped she would  forfor what happened  my dear audrey anybody would have made the same mistake i dont wonder you took me for a burglar  i didnt mean that i meantfive years ago  i laughed i was not feeling like laughter at the moment but i did my best and had the satisfaction of seeing that it jarred upon her  surely youre not worrying yourself about that i said i laughed again very jovial and debonair i was that winter morning  the brief moment in which we might have softened towards each other was over there was a glitter in her blue eyes which told me that it was once more war between us  i thought you would get over it she said  well i said i was only twentyfive ones heart doesnt break at twentyfive  i dont think yours would ever be likely to break peter  is that a compliment or otherwise  you would probably think it a compliment i meant that you were not human enough to be heartbroken  so thats your idea of a compliment  i said i thought it was probably yours  i must have been a curious sort of man five years ago if i gave you that impression  you were  she spoke in a meditative voice as if across the years she were idly inspecting some strange species of insect the attitude annoyed me i could look myself with a detached eye at the man i had once been but i still retained a sort of affection for him and i felt piqued  i suppose you looked on me as a kind of ogre in those days i said  i suppose i did  there was a pause  i didnt mean to hurt your feelings she said and that was the most galling part of it mine was an attitude of studied offensiveness i did want to hurt her feelings but hers it seemed to me was no pose she really had hadand i suppose still retaineda genuine horror of me the struggle was unequal  you were very kind she went on sometimeswhen you happened to think of it  considered as the best she could find to say of me it was not an eulogy  well i said we neednt discuss what i was or did five years ago whatever i was or did you escaped lets think of the present what are we going to do about this  you think the situations embarrassing  i do  one of us ought to go i suppose she said doubtfully  exactly  well i cant go  nor can i  i have business here  obviously so have i  its absolutely necessary that i should be here  and that i should  she considered me for a moment  mrs attwell told me that you were one of the assistantmasters at the school  i am acting as assistantmaster i am supposed to be learning the business  she hesitated  why she said  why not  butbutyou used to be very well off  im better off now im working  she was silent for a moment  of course its impossible for you to leave you couldnt could you  no  i cant either  then i suppose we must face the embarrassment  but why must it be embarrassing you said yourself you hadgot over it  absolutely i am engaged to be married  she gave a little start she drew a pattern on the gravel with her foot before she spoke  i congratulate you she said at last  thank you  i hope you will be very happy  im sure i shall  she relapsed into silence it occurred to me that having posted her thoroughly in my affairs i was entitled to ask about hers  how in the world did you come to be here i said  its rather a long story after my husband died  oh i exclaimed startled  yes he died three years ago  she spoke in a level voice with a ring of hardness in it for which i was to learn the true reason later at the time it seemed to me due to resentment at having to speak of the man she had loved to me whom she disliked and my bitterness increased  i have been looking after myself for a long time  in england  in america we went to new york directly wedirectly i had written to you i have been in america ever since i only returned to england a few weeks ago  but what brought you to sanstead  some years ago i got to know mr ford the father of the little boy who is at the school he recommended me to mr abney who wanted somebody to help with the school  and you are dependent on your work i meanforgive me if i am personalmr sheridan did not  he left no money at all  who was he i burst out i felt that the subject of the dead man was one which it was painful for her to talk about at any rate to me but the sheridan mystery had vexed me for five years and i thirsted to know something of this man who had dynamited my life without ever appearing in it  he was an artist a friend of my father  i wanted to hear more i wanted to know what he looked like how he spoke how he compared with me in a thousand ways but it was plain that she would not willingly be communicative about him and with a feeling of resentment i gave her her way and suppressed my curiosity  so your work here is all you have i said  absolutely all and if its the same with you well here we are  here we are i echoed exactly  we must try and make it as easy for each other as we can she said  of course  she looked at me in that curious wideeyed way of hers  you have got thinner peter she said  have i i said suffering i suppose or exercise  her eyes left my face i saw her bite her lip  you hate me she said abruptly youve been hating me all these years well i dont wonder  she turned and began to walk slowly away and as she did so a sense of the littleness of the part i was playing came over me ever since our talk had begun i had been trying to hurt her trying to take a petty revenge on herfor what all that had happened five years ago had been my fault i could not let her go like this i felt unutterably mean  audrey i called  she stopped i went to her  audrey i said youre wrong if theres anybody i hate its myself i just want to tell you i understand  her lips parted but she did not speak  i understand just what made you do it i went on i can see now the sort of man i was in those days  youre saying that toto help me she said in a low voice  no i have felt like that about it for years  i treated you shamefully  nothing of the kind theres a certain sort of man who badly needs ajolt and he has to get it sooner or later it happened that you gave me mine but that wasnt your fault i was bound to get itsomehow i laughed fate was waiting for me round the corner fate wanted something to hit me with you happened to be the nearest thing handy  im sorry peter  nonsense you knocked some sense into me thats all you did every man needs education most men get theirs in small doses so that they hardly know they are getting it at all my money kept me from getting mine that way by the time i met you there was a great heap of back education due to me and i got it in a lump thats all  youre generous  nothing of the kind its only that i see things clearer than i did i was a pig in those days  you werent  i was well we wont quarrel about it  inside the house the bell rang for breakfast we turned as i drew back to let her go in she stopped  peter she said  she began to speak quickly  peter lets be sensible why should we let this embarrass us this being together here cant we just pretend that were two old friends who parted through a misunderstanding and have come together again with all the misunderstanding cleared awayfriends again shall we  she held out her hand she was smiling but her eyes were grave  old friends peter  i took her hand  old friends i said  and we went in to breakfast on the table beside my plate was lying a letter from cynthia     chapter 6   i  i give the letter in full it was written from the sy mermaid lying in monaco harbour  my dear peter where is ogden we have been expecting him every day mrs ford is worrying herself to death she keeps asking me if i have any news and it is very tiresome to have to keep telling her that i have not heard from you surely with the opportunities you must get every day you can manage to kidnap him do be quick we are relying on youin haste                                   cynthia  i read this brief and businesslike communication several times during the day and after dinner that night in order to meditate upon it in solitude i left the house and wandered off in the direction of the village  i was midway between house and village when i became aware that i was being followed the night was dark and the wind moving in the treetops emphasized the loneliness of the country road both time and place were such as made it peculiarly unpleasant to hear stealthy footsteps on the road behind me  uncertainty in such cases is the unnerving thing i turned sharply and began to walk back on tiptoe in the direction from which i had come  i had not been mistaken a moment later a dark figure loomed up out of the darkness and the exclamation which greeted me as i made my presence known showed that i had taken him by surprise  there was a momentary pause i expected the man whoever he might be to run but he held his ground indeed he edged forward  get back i said and allowed my stick to rasp suggestively on the road before raising it in readiness for any sudden development it was as well that he should know it was there  the hint seemed to wound rather than frighten him  aw cut out the rough stuff bo he said reproachfully in a cautious husky undertone i aint goin to start anything  i had an impression that i had heard the voice before but i could not place it  what are you following me for i demanded who are you  say i want a talk wit youse i took a slant at youse under de lamppost back dere an i seen it was you so i tagged along say im wise to your game sport  i had identified him by this time unless there were two men in the neighbourhood of sanstead who hailed from the bowery this must be the man i had seen at the feathers who had incurred the disapproval of miss benjafield  i havent the faintest idea what you mean i said what is my game  his voice became reproachful again  ah chee he protested quit yer kiddin what was youse rubberin around de house for last night if you wasnt trailin

together about dat kid  certainly if you wish it what do you happen to mean  aw quit yer kiddin he expectorated again he seemed to be a man who could express the whole gamut of emotions by this simple means i know you  then you have the advantage of me though i believe i remember seeing you before werent you at the feathers one wednesday evening singing something about a dog  sure dat was me  what do you mean by saying that you know me  aw quit yer kiddin sam  there was it seemed to me a reluctantly admiring note in his voice  tell me who do you think i am i asked patiently  ahr ghee you cant

other than that celebrity  dats right deres no need to keep up anyting wit me sam were bote on de same trail so lets get down to it  one moment i said would it surprise you to hear that my name is

smart of youse to be a perfessor youre right in on de ground floor  his voice became appealing  say sam dont be a hawg lets go fiftyfifty in dis deal my bunch and me has come a hell of a number of

cried i tell you i am not sam fisher cant you understand that you have got hold of the wrong man my name is burnsburns  he expectoratedscornfully this time he was a man slow by nature to receive ideas but slower to rid himself of one that had contrived to force its way into what he probably called his brain he had decided on the evidence that i was smooth sam fisher and no denials on my part were going to shake his belief he looked on them merely as so many unsportsmanlike quibbles prompted by greed  tell it to sweeney was the form in which he crystallized his scepticism  may be youll say youse aint trailin de nugget huh  it was a homethrust if truthtelling has become a habit one gets slowly off the mark when the moment arrives for the prudent lie quite against my will i hesitated observant mr macginnis perceived my hesitation and expectorated triumphantly  ah ghee he remarked and then with a sudden return to ferocity all right you sam you wait well fix you and fix you good see dat goes you tink youse kin put it across us huh all right youll get yours you wait  and with these words he slid off into the night from somewhere in the murky middle distance came a scornful hawg and he was gone leaving me with a settled conviction that while i had frequently had occasion since my expedition to sanstead began to describe affairs as complex their complexity had now reached its height with a watchful pinkertons man within and a vengeful gang of rivals without sanstead house seemed likely to become an unrestful place for a young kidnapper with no previous experience  the need for swift action had become imperative   ii  white the butler looking singularly unlike a detectivewhich i suppose is how a detective wants to lookwas taking the air on the football field when i left the house next morning for a beforebreakfast stroll the sight of him filled me with a desire for firsthand information on the subject of the man mr macginnis supposed me to be and also of mr macginnis himself i wanted to be assured that my friend buck despite appearances was a placid person whose bark was worse than his bite  whites manner at our first conversational exchanges was entirely that of the butler from what i came to know of him later i think he took an artistic pride in throwing himself into whatever role he had to assume  at the mention of smooth sam fisher however his manner peeled off him like a skin and he began to talk as himself a racy and vigorous self vastly different from the episcopal person he thought it necessary to be when on duty  white i said do you know anything of smooth sam fisher  he stared at me i suppose the question led up to by no previous remark was unusual  i met a gentleman of the name of buck macginnishe was our visitor that night by the wayand he was full of sam do you know him  buck  either of them  well ive never seen buck but i know all about him theres pepper to buck  so i should imagine and sam  you may take it from me that theres more pepper to sams little finger than there is to bucks whole body sam could make buck look like the last run of shad if it came to a showdown bucks just a common roughneck sams an educated man hes got brains  so i gathered well im glad to hear you speak so well of him because thats who im supposed to be  hows that  buck macginnis insists that i am smooth sam fisher nothing i can say will shift him  white stared he had very bright humorous brown eyes then he began to laugh  well what do you know about that he exclaimed wouldnt that jar you  it would i may say it did he called me a hog for wanting to keep the little nugget to myself and left threatening to fix me what would you say the verb to fix signified in mr macginniss vocabulary  white was still chuckling quietly to himself  hes a wonder he observed can you beat it taking you for smooth sam  he said he had never seen smooth sam have you  lord yes  does he look like me  not a bit  do you think hes over here in england  sam i know he is  then buck macginnis was right  dead right as far as sam being on the trail goes sams after the nugget to get him this time hes tried often enough before but weve been too smart for him this time he allows hes going to bring it off  then why havent we seen anything of him buck macginnis seems to be monopolizing the kidnapping industry in these parts  oh samll show up when he feels good and ready you can take it from me that sam knows what he is doing sams a special pet of mine i dont give a flip for buck macginnis  i wish i had your cheery disposition to me buck macginnis seems a pretty important citizen i wonder what he meant by fix  white however declined to leave the subject of bucks more gifted rival  sams a college man you know that gives him a pull he has brains and can use them  that was one of the points on which buck macginnis reproached me he said it was not fair to use my superior education  he laughed  bucks got no sense thats why you find him carrying on like a porchclimber its his only notion of how to behave when he wants to do a job and thats why theres only one man to keep your eye on in this thing of the little nugget and thats sam i wish you could get to know sam youd like him  you seem to look on him as a personal friend i certainly dont like buck  oh buck said white scornfully  we turned towards the house as the sound of the bell came to us across the field  then you think we may count on sams arrival sooner or later as a certainty i said  surest thing you know  you will have a busy time  all in the days work  i suppose i ought to look at it in that way but i do wish i knew exactly what buck meant by fix  white at last condescended to give his mind to the trivial point  i guess hell try to put one over on you with a sandbag he said carelessly he seemed to face the prospect with calm  a sandbag eh i said it sounds exciting  and feels it i know ive had some  i parted from him at the door as a comforter he had failed to qualify he had not eased my mind to the slightest extent     chapter 7   looking at it now i can see that the days which followed audreys arrival at sanstead marked the true beginning of our acquaintanceship before during our engagement we had been strangers artificially tied together and she had struggled against the chain but now for the first time we were beginning to know each other and were discovering that after all we had much in common  it did not alarm me this growing feeling of comradeship keenly on the alert as i was for the least sign that would show that i was in danger of weakening in my loyalty to cynthia i did not detect one in my friendliness for audrey on the contrary i was hugely relieved for it seemed to me that the danger was past i had not imagined it possible that i could ever experience towards her such a tranquil emotion as this easy friendliness for the last five years my imagination had been playing round her memory until i suppose i had built up in my mind some almost superhuman image some goddess what i was passing through now of course though i was unaware of it was the natural reaction from that state of mind instead of the goddess i had found a companionable human being and i imagined that i had effected the change myself and by sheer force of will brought audrey into a reasonable relation to the scheme of things  i suppose a not too intelligent moth has much the same views with regard to the lamp his last thought as he enters the flame is probably one of selfcongratulation that he has arranged his dealings with it on such a satisfactory commonsense basis  and then when i was feeling particularly safe and complacent disaster came  the day was wednesday and my afternoon off but the rain was driving against the windows and the attractions of billiards with the marker at the feathers had not proved sufficient to make me face the twomile walk in the storm i had settled myself in the study there was a noble fire burning in the grate and the darkness lit by the glow of the coals the dripping of the rain the good behaviour of my pipe and the reflection that as i sat there glossop was engaged downstairs in wrestling with my class combined to steep me in a meditative peace audrey was playing the piano in the drawingroom the sound came to me faintly through the closed doors i recognized what she was playing i wondered if the melody had the same associations for her that it had for me  the music stopped i heard the drawingroom door open she came into the study  i didnt know there was anyone here she said im frozen the drawingroom fires out  come and sit down i said you dont mind the smoke  i drew a chair up to the fire for her feeling as i did so a certain pride here i was alone with her in the firelight and my pulse was regular and my brain cool i had a momentary vision of myself as the strong man the strong quiet man with the iron grip on his emotions i was pleased with myself  she sat for some minutes gazing into the fire little spurts of flame whistled comfortably in the heart of the blackred coals outside the storm shrieked faintly and flurries of rain dashed themselves against the window  its very nice in here she said at last  peaceful  i filled my pipe and relit it her eyes seen for an instant in the light of the match looked dreamy  ive been sitting here listening to you i said i liked that last thing you played  you always did  you remember that do you remember one eveningno you wouldnt  which evening  oh you wouldnt remember its only one particular evening when you played that thing it sticks in my mind it was at your fathers studio  she looked up quickly  we went out afterwards and sat in the park  i sat up thrilled  a man came by with a dog i said  two dogs  one surely  two a bulldog and a foxterrier  i remember the bulldog butby jove youre right a foxterrier with a black patch over his left eye  right eye  right eye they came up to us and you  gave them chocolates  i sank back slowly in my chair  youve got a wonderful memory i said  she bent over the fire without speaking the rain rattled on the window  so you still like my playing peter  i like it better than ever theres something in it now that i dont believe there used to be i cant describe itsomething  i think its knowledge peter she said quietly experience im five years older than i was when i used to play to you before and ive seen a good deal in those five years it may not be altogether pleasant seeing life butwell it makes you play the piano better experience goes in at the heart and comes out at the fingertips  it seemed to me that she spoke a little bitterly  have you had a bad time audrey these last years i said  pretty bad  im sorry  im notaltogether ive learned a lot  she was silent again her eyes fixed on the fire  what are you thinking about i said  oh a great many things  pleasant  mixed the last thing i thought about was pleasant that was that i am very lucky to be doing the work i am doing now compared with some of the things i have done  she shivered  i wish you would tell me about those years audrey i said what were some of the things you did  she leaned back in her chair and shaded her face from the fire with a newspaper her eyes were in the shadow  well let me see i was a nurse for some time at the lafayette hospital in new york  thats hard work  horribly hard i had to give it up after a while butit teaches you you learn you learnall sorts of things realities how much of your own trouble is imagination you get real trouble in a hospital you get it thrown at you  i said nothing i was feelingi dont know whya little uncomfortable a little at a disadvantage as one feels in the presence of some one bigger than oneself  then i was a waitress  a waitress  i tell you i did everything i was a waitress and a very bad one i broke plates i muddled orders finally i was very rude to a customer and i went on to try something else i forget what came next i think it was the stage i travelled for a year with a touring company that was hard work too but i liked it after that came dressmaking which was harder and which i hated and then i had my first stroke of real luck  what was that  i met mr ford  how did that happen  you wouldnt remember a miss vanderley an american girl who was over in london five or six years ago my father taught her painting she was very rich but she was wild at that time to be bohemian i think thats why she chose father as a teacher well she was always at the studio and we became great friends and one day after all these things i have been telling you of i thought i would write to her and see if she could not find me something to do she was a dear her voice trembled and she lowered the newspaper till her whole face was hidden she wanted me to come to their home and live on her for ever but i couldnt have that i told her i must work so she sent me to mr ford whom the vanderleys knew very well and i became ogdens governess  great scott i cried what  she laughed rather shakily  i dont think i was a very good governess i knew next to nothing i ought to have been having a governess myself but i managed somehow  but ogden i said that little fiend didnt he worry the life out of you  oh i had luck there again he happened to take a mild liking to me and he was as good as goldfor him thats to say if i didnt interfere with him too much and i didnt i was horribly weak he let me alone it was the happiest time i had had for ages  and when he came here you came too as a sort of exgoverness to continue exerting your moral influence over him  she laughed  more or less that  we sat in silence for a while and then she put into words the thought which was in both our minds  how odd it seems you and i sitting together chatting like this peter after allall these years  like a dream  just like a dream  im so glad you dont know how ive hated myself sometimes forfor  audrey you mustnt talk like that dont lets think of it besides it was my fault  she shook her head  well put it that we didnt understand one another  she nodded slowly  no we didnt understand one another  but we do now i said were friends audrey  she did not answer for a long time we sat in silence and then the newspaper must have moveda gleam from the fire fell upon her face lighting up her eyes and at the sight something in me began to throb like a drum warning a city against danger the next moment the shadow had covered them again  i sat there tense gripping the arms of my chair i was tingling something was happening to me i had a curious sensation of being on the threshold of something wonderful and perilous  from downstairs there came the sound of boys voices work was over and with it this talk by the firelight in a few minutes somebody glossop or mr abney would be breaking in on our retreat  we both rose and thenit happened she must have tripped in the darkness she stumbled forward her hand caught at my coat and she was in my arms  it was a thing of an instant she recovered herself moved to the door and was gone  but i stood where i was motionless aghast at the revelation which had come to me in that brief moment it was the physical contact the feel of her warm and alive that had shattered for ever that flimsy structure of friendship which i had fancied so strong i had said to love thus far and no farther and love had swept over me the more powerful for being checked the time of selfdeception was over i knew myself     chapter 8   i  that buck macginnis was not the man to let the grass grow under his feet in a situation like the present one i would have gathered from whites remarks if i had not already done so from personal observation the world is divided into dreamers and men of action from what little i had seen of him i placed buck macginnis in the latter class every day i expected him to act and was agreeably surprised as each twentyfour hours passed and left me still unfixed but i knew the hour would come and it did  i looked for frontal attack from buck not subtlety but when the attack came it was so excessively frontal that my chief emotion was a sort of paralysed amazement it seemed incredible that such peculiarly wild western events could happen in peaceful england even in so isolated a spot as sanstead house  it had been one of those interminable days which occur only at schools a school more than any other institution is dependent on the weather every small boy rises from his bed of a morning charged with a definite quantity of devilry and this if he is to sleep the sound sleep of health he has got to work off somehow before bedtime that is why the summer term is the one a master longs for when the intervals between classes can be spent in the open there is no pleasanter sight for an assistantmaster at a private school than that of a number of boys expending their venom harmlessly in the sunshine  on this particular day snow had begun to fall early in the morning and while his pupils would have been only too delighted to go out and roll in it by the hour they were prevented from doing so by mr abneys strict orders no schoolmaster enjoys seeing his pupils running risks of catching cold and just then mr abney was especially definite on the subject the saturnalia which had followed mr macginnis nocturnal visit to the school had had the effect of giving violent colds to three lords a baronet and the younger son of an honourable and in addition to that mr abney himself his penetrating tenor changed to a guttural croak was in his bed looking on the world with watering eyes his views therefore on playing in the snow as an occupation for boys were naturally prejudiced  the result was that glossop and i had to try and keep order among a mob of small boys none of whom had had any chance of working off his superfluous energy how glossop fared i can only imagine judging by the fact that i who usually kept fair order without excessive effort was almost overwhelmed i should fancy he fared badly his classroom was on the opposite side of the hall from mine and at frequent intervals his voice would penetrate my door raised to a frenzied fortissimo  little by little however we had won through the day and the boys had subsided into comparative quiet over their evening preparation when from outside the front door there sounded the purring of the engine of a large automobile the bell rang  i did not i remember pay much attention to this at the moment i supposed that somebody from one of the big houses in the neighbourhood had called or taking the lateness of the hour into consideration that a motoring party had come as they did sometimessanstead house standing some miles from anywhere in the middle of an intricate system of byroadsto inquire the way to portsmouth or london if my class had allowed me i would have ignored the sound but for them it supplied just that break in the monotony of things which they had needed they welcomed it vociferously  a voice sir please sir theres a motor outside  myself austerely t know theres a motor outside get on with your work  various voices sir have you ever ridden in a motor  sir my father let me help drive our motor last easter sir  sir who do you think it is  an isolated genius imitating the engine prprr prprr prprr  i was on the point of distributing bad marks the schoolmasters standby broadcast when a curious sound checked me it followed directly upon the opening of the front door i heard whites footsteps crossing the hall then the click of the latch and thena sound that i could not define the closed door of the classroom deadened it but for all that it was audible it resembled the thud of a falling body but i knew it could not be that for in peaceful england butlers opening front doors did not fall with thuds  my class eager listeners found fresh material in the sound for friendly conversation  sir what was that sir  did you hear that sir  what do you thinks happened sir  be quiet i shouted will you be  there was a quick footstep outside the door flew open and on the threshold stood a short sturdy man in a motoring coat and cap the upper part of his face was covered by a strip of white linen with holes for the eyes and there was a browning pistol in his hand  it is my belief that if assistantmasters were allowed to wear white masks and carry automatic pistols keeping order in a school would become childs play a silence such as no threat of bad marks had ever been able to produce fell instantaneously upon the classroom out of the corner of my eye as i turned to face our visitor i could see small boys goggling rapturously at this miraculous realization of all the dreams induced by juvenile adventure fiction as far as i could ascertain on subsequent inquiry not one of them felt a tremor of fear it was all too tremendously exciting for that for their exclusive benefit an illustration from a weekly paper for boys had come to life and they had no time to waste in being frightened  as for me i was dazed motor bandits may terrorize france and desperadoes hold up trains in america but this was peaceful england the fact that buck macginnis was at large in the neighbourhood did not make the thing any the less incredible i had looked on my affair with buck as a thing of the open air and the darkness i had figured him lying in wait in lonely roads possibly even lurking about the grounds but in my most apprehensive moments i had not imagined him calling at the front door and holding me up with a revolver in my own classroom  and yet it was the simple even the obvious thing for him to do given an automobile success was certain sanstead house stood absolutely alone there was not even a cottage within half a mile a train broken down in the middle of the bad lands was not more cut off  consider too the peculiar helplessness of a school in such a case a school lives on the confidence of parents a nebulous foundation which the slightest breath can destroy everything connected with it must be done with exaggerated discretion i do not suppose mr macginnis had thought the thing out in all its bearings but he could not have made a sounder move if he had been a napoleon where the owner of an ordinary countryhouse raided by masked men can raise the countryside in pursuit a schoolmaster must do precisely the opposite from his point of view the fewer people that know of the affair the better parents are a jumpy race a man may be the ideal schoolmaster yet will a connection with melodrama damn him in the eyes of parents they do not inquire they are too panicstricken for that goldenhaired willie may be receiving the finest education conceivable yet if men with browning pistols are familiar objects at his shrine of learning they will remove him fortunately for schoolmasters it is seldom that such visitors call upon them indeed i imagine mr macginniss effort to have been the first of its kind  i do not as i say suppose that buck whose forte was action rather than brainwork had thought all this out he had trusted to luck and luck had stood by him there would be no raising of the countryside in his case on the contrary i could see mr abney becoming one of the busiest persons on record in his endeavour to hush the thing up and prevent it getting into the papers the man with the pistol spoke he sighted mei was standing with my back to the mantelpiece parallel with the doormade a sharp turn and raised his weapon  put em up sport he said  it was not the voice of buck macginnis i put my hands up  say which of dese is de nugget  he half turned his head to the class  which of youse kids is ogden ford  the class was beyond speech the silence continued  ogden ford is not here i said  our visitor had not that simple faith which is so much better than norman blood he did not believe me without moving his head he gave a long whistle steps sounded outside another short sturdy form entered the room  he aint in de odder room observed the newcomer i been rubberin  this was friend buck beyond question i could have recognized his voice anywhere  well dis guy said the man with the pistol indicating me says he aint here whats de answer  why its sam said buck howdy sam pleased to see us huh were in on de ground floor too dis time all right all right  his words had a marked effect on his colleague  is dat sam hell let me blow de head offn him he said with simple fervour and advancing a step nearer he waved his disengaged fist truculently in my role of sam i had plainly made myself very unpopular i have never heard so much emotion packed into a few words  buck to my relief opposed the motion i thought this decent of buck  cheese it he said curtly  the other cheesed it the operation took the form of lowering the fist the pistol he kept in position  mr macginnis resumed the conduct of affairs  now den sam he said come across wheres de nugget  my name is not sam i said may i put my hands down  yep if you want the top of your damn head blown off  such was not my desire i kept them up  now den you sam said mr macginnis again we aint got time to burn out with it wheres dat nugget  some reply was obviously required it was useless to keep protesting that i was not sam  at this time in the evening he is generally working with mr glossop  whos glossop dat doughfaced dub in de room over dere  exactly you have described him perfectly  well he aint dere i bin rubberin aw quit yer foolin sam where is he  i couldnt tell you just where he is at the present moment i said precisely  ahr chee let me swot him one begged the man with the pistol a most unlovable person i could never have made a friend of him  cheese it you said mr macginnis  the other cheesed it once more regretfully  you got him hidden away somewheres sam said mr macginnis you cant fool me im com troo dis joint wit a finetooth comb till i find him  by all means i said dont let me stop you  you youre coming wit me  if you wish it i shall be delighted  an cut out dat dam sissy way of talking you rummy bellowed buck with a sudden lapse into ferocity spiel like a regular guy standin dere pullin dat dude stuff on me cut it out  say why maynt i hand him one demanded the pistolbearer pathetically whats your kick against pushin his face in  i thought the question in poor taste buck ignored it  gimme dat canister he said taking the browning pistol from him now den sam are youse goin to be good and come across or aint youwhich  id be delighted to do anything you wished mr macginnis i said but  aw hire a hall said buck disgustedly step lively den an well go troo de joint i tought youse ud have had more sense sam dan to play dis fool game when you know youre beat you  shooting pains in my shoulders caused me to interrupt him  one moment i said im going to put my hands down im getting cramp  ill blow a hole in you if you do  just as you please but im not armed  lefty he said to the other man feel around to see if hes carryin anyting  lefty advanced and began to tap me scientifically in the neighbourhood of my pockets he grunted morosely the while i suppose at this close range the temptation to hand me one was almost more than he could bear  he aint got no gun he announced gloomily  den youse can put em down said mr macginnis  thanks i said  lefty youse stay here and look after dese kids get a move on sam  we left the room a little procession of two myself leading buck in my immediate rear administering occasional cautionary prods with the faithful canister   ii  the first thing that met my eyes as we entered the hall was the body of a man lying by the front door the light of the lamp fell on his face and i saw that it was white his hands and feet were tied as i looked at him he moved as if straining against his bonds and i was conscious of a feeling of relief that sound that had reached me in the classroom that thud of a falling body had become in the light of what had happened later very sinister it was good to know that he was still alive i gatheredcorrectly as i discovered subsequentlythat in his case the sandbag had been utilized he had been struck down and stunned the instant he opened the door  there was a masked man leaning against the wall by glossops classroom he was short and sturdy the buck macginnis gang seemed to have been turned out on a pattern externally they might all have been twins this man to give him a semblance of individuality had a ragged red moustache he was smoking a cigar with the air of the warrior taking his rest  hello he said as we appeared he jerked a thumb towards the classroom ive locked dem in whats doin buck he asked indicating me with a languid nod  were going troo de joint explained mr macginnis de kid aint in dere hump yourself sam  his colleagues languor disappeared with magic swiftness  sam is dat sam here let me beat de block offn him  few points in this episode struck me as more remarkable than the similarity of taste which prevailed as concerned myself among the members of mr macginniss gang men doubtless of varying opinions on other subjects on this one point they were unanimous they all wanted to assault me  buck however had other uses for me for the present i was necessary as a guide and my value as such would be impaired were the block to be beaten off me though feeling no friendlier towards me than did his assistants he declined to allow sentiment to interfere with business he concentrated his attention on the upward journey with all the earnestness of the young gentleman who carried the banner with the strange device in the poem  briefly requesting his ally to cheese itwhich he didhe urged me on with the nozzle of the pistol the redmoustached man sank back against the wall again with an air of dejection sucking his cigar now like one who has had disappointments in life while we passed on up the stairs and began to draw the rooms on the first floor  these consisted of mr abneys study and two dormitories the study was empty and the only occupants of the dormitories were the three boys who had been stricken down with colds on the occasion of mr macginniss last visit they squeaked with surprise at the sight of the assistantmaster in such questionable company  buck eyed them disappointedly i waited with something of the feelings of a drummer taking a buyer round the sample room  get on said buck  wont one of those do  hump yourself sam  call me sammy i urged were old friends now  dont get fresh he said austerely and we moved on  the top floor was even more deserted than the first there was no one in the dormitories the only other room was mr abneys and as we came opposite it a sneeze from within told of the sufferings of its occupant  the sound stirred buck to his depths he pointed at the door like a smelldog  whos in dere he demanded  only mr abney better not disturb him he has a bad cold  he placed a wrong construction on my solicitude for my employer his manner became excited  open dat door you he cried  itll give him a nasty shock  gwan open it  no one who is digging a browning pistol into the small of my back will ever find me disobliging i opened the doorknocking first as a mild concession to the conventionsand the procession passed in  my stricken employer was lying on his back staring at the ceiling and our entrance did not at first cause him to change this position  yes he said thickly and disappeared beneath a huge pockethandkerchief muffled sounds as of distant explosions of dynamite together with earthquake shudderings of the bedclothes told of another sneezingfit  im sorry to disturb you i began when buck ever the man of action with a scorn of palaver strode past me and having prodded with the pistol that part of the bedclothes beneath which a rough calculation suggested that mr abneys lower ribs were concealed uttered the one word saaay  mr abney sat up like a jackinthebox one might almost say that he shot up and then he saw buck  i cannot even faintly imagine what were mr abneys emotions at that moment he was a man who from boyhood up had led a quiet and regular life things like buck had appeared to him hitherto if they appeared at all only in dreams after injudicious suppers even in the ordinary costume of the bowery gentleman without such adventitious extras as masks and pistols buck was no beauty with that hideous strip of dingy white linen on his face he was a walking nightmare  mr abneys eyebrows had risen and his jaw had fallen to their uttermost limits his hair disturbed by contact with the pillow gave the impression of standing on end his eyes seemed to bulge like a snails he stared at buck fascinated  say you quit rubberin youse aint in a dime museum wheres dat ford kid huh  i have set down all mr macginniss remarks as if they had been uttered in a belllike voice with a clear and crisp enunciation but in doing so i have flattered him in reality his mode of speech suggested that he had something large and unwieldy permanently stuck in his mouth and it was not easy for a stranger to follow him mr abney signally failed to do so he continued to gape helplessly till the tension was broken by a sneeze  one cannot interrogate a sneezing man with any satisfaction to oneself buck stood by the bedside in moody silence waiting for the paroxysm to spend itself  i meanwhile had remained where i stood close to the door and as i waited for mr abney to finish sneezing for the first time since bucks colleague lefty had entered the classroom the idea of action occurred to me until this moment i suppose the strangeness and unexpectedness of these happenings had numbed my brain to precede buck meekly upstairs and to wait with equal meekness while he interviewed mr abney had seemed the only course open to me to one whose life has lain apart from such things the hypnotic influence of a browning pistol is irresistible  but now freed temporarily from this influence i began to think and my mind making up for its previous inaction by working with unwonted swiftness i formed a plan of action at once  it was simple but i had an idea that it would be effective my strength lay in my acquaintance with the geography of sanstead house and bucks ignorance of it let me but get an adequate start and he might find pursuit vain it was this start which i saw my way to achieving  to buck it had not yet occurred that it was a tactical error to leave me between the door and himself i supposed he relied too implicitly on the mesmeric pistol he was not even looking at me  the next moment my fingers were on the switch of the electric light and the room was in darkness  there was a chair by the door i seized it and swung it into the space between us then springing back i banged the door and ran  i did not run without a goal in view my objective was the study this as i have explained was on the first floor its window looked out on to a strip of lawn at the side of the house ending in a shrubbery the drop would not be pleasant but i seemed to remember a waterspout that ran up the wall close to the window and in any case i was not in a position to be deterred by the prospect of a bruise or two i had not failed to realize that my position was one of extreme peril when buck concluding the tour of the house found that the little nugget was not thereas i had reason to know that he wouldthere was no room for doubt that he would withdraw the protection which he had extended to me up to the present in my capacity of guide on me the disappointed fury of the raiders would fall no prudent consideration for their own safety would restrain them if ever the future was revealed to man i saw mine my only chance was to get out into the grounds where the darkness would make pursuit an impossibility  it was an affair which must be settled one way or the other in a few seconds and i calculated that it would take buck just those few seconds to win his way past the chair and find the doorhandle  i was right just as i reached the study the door of the bedroom flew open and the house rang with shouts and the noise of feet on the uncarpeted landing from the hall below came answering shouts but with an interrogatory note in them the assistants were willing but puzzled they did not like to leave their posts without specific instructions and buck shouting as he clattered over the bare boards was unintelligible  i was in the study the door locked behind me before they could arrive at an understanding i sprang to the window  the handle rattled voices shouted a panel splintered beneath a kick and the door shook on its hinges  and then for the first time i think in my life panic gripped me the sheer blind fear which destroys the reason it swept over me in a wave that numbing terror which comes to one in dreams indeed the thing had become dreamlike i seemed to be standing outside myself looking on at myself watching myself heave and strain with bruised fingers at a window that would not open   iii  the armchair critic reviewing a situation calmly and at his ease is apt to make too small allowances for the effect of hurry and excitement on the human mind he is cool and detached he sees exactly what ought to have been done and by what simple means catastrophe might have been averted  he would have made short work of my present difficulty i feel certain it was ridiculously simple but i had lost my head and had ceased for the moment to be a reasoning creature in the end indeed it was no presence of mind but pure good luck which saved me just as the door which had held out gallantly gave way beneath the attack from outside my fingers slipping struck against the catch of the window and i understood why i had failed to raise it  i snapped the catch back and flung up the sash an icy wind swept into the room bearing particles of snow i scrambled on to the windowsill and a crash from behind me told of the falling of the door  the packed snow on the sill was drenching my knees as i worked my way out and prepared to drop there was a deafening explosion inside the room and simultaneously something seared my shoulder like a hot iron i cried out with the pain of it and losing my balance fell from the sill  there was fortunately for me a laurel bush immediately below the window or i should have been undone i fell into it all arms and legs in a way which would have meant broken bones if i had struck the hard turf i was on my feet in an instant shaken and scratched and incidentally in a worse temper than ever in my life before the idea of flight which had obsessed me a moment before to the exclusion of all other mundane affairs had vanished absolutely i was full of fight i might say overflowing with it i remember standing there with the snow trickling in chilly rivulets down my face and neck and shaking my fist at the window two of my pursuers were leaning out of it while a third dodged behind them like a small man on the outskirts of a crowd so far from being thankful for my escape i was conscious only of a feeling of regret that there was no immediate way of getting at them  they made no move towards travelling the quick but trying route which had commended itself to me they seemed to be waiting for something to happen it was not long before i was made aware of what this something was from the direction of the front door came the sound of one running a sudden diminution of the noise of his feet told me that he had left the gravel and was on the turf i drew back a pace or two and waited  it was pitch dark and i had no fear that i should be seen i was standing well outside the light from the window  the man stopped just in front of me a short parley followed  cantja see him  the voice was not bucks it was buck who answered and when i realized that this man in front of me within easy reach on whose back i was shortly about to spring and whose neck i proposed under providence to twist into the shape of a corkscrew was no mere underling but mr macginnis himself i was filled with a joy which i found it hard to contain in silence  looking back i am a little sorry for mr macginnis he was not a good man his mode of speech was not pleasant and his manners were worse than his speech but though he undoubtedly deserved all that was coming to him it was nevertheless bad luck for him to be standing just there at just that moment the reactions after my panic added to the pain of my shoulder the scratches on my face and the general misery of being wet and cold had given me a reckless fury and a determination to do somebody whoever happened to come along grievous bodily hurt such as seldom invades the bosoms of the normally peaceful to put it crisply i was fighting mad and i looked on buck as something sent by heaven  he had got as far in his reply as naw i cant when i sprang  i have read of the spring of the jaguar and i have seen some very creditable flyingtackles made on the football field my leap combined the outstanding qualities of both i connected with mr macginnis in the region of the waist and the howl he gave as we crashed to the ground was music to my ears  but how true is the old roman saying surgit amari aliquid our pleasures are never perfect there is always something in the programme which i had hastily mapped out the upsetting of mr macginnis was but a small item a mere preliminary there were a number of things which i had wished to do to him once upset but it was not to be even as i reached for his throat i perceived that the light of the window was undergoing an eclipse a compact form had wriggled out on to the sill as i had done and i heard the grating of his shoes on the wall as he lowered himself for the drop  there is a moment when the pleasantest functions must come to an end i was loath to part from mr macginnis just when i was beginning as it were to do myself justice but it was unavoidable in another moment his ally would descend upon us like some homeric god swooping from a cloud and i was not prepared to continue the battle against odds  i disengaged myselfmr macginnis strangely quiescent during the processand was on my feet in the safety of the darkness just as the reinforcement touched earth this time i did not wait my hunger for fight had been appeased to some extent by my brush with buck and i was satisfied to have achieved safety with honour  making a wide detour i crossed the drive and worked my way through the bushes to within a few yards of where the automobile stood filling the night with the soft purring of its engines i was interested to see what would be the enemys next move it was improbable that they would attempt to draw the grounds in search of me i imagined that they would recognize failure and retire whence they had come  i was right i had not been watching long before a little group advanced into the light of the automobiles lamps there were four of them three were walking the fourth cursing with the vigour and breadth that marks the expert lying on their arms of which they had made something resembling a stretcher  the driver of the car who had been sitting woodenly in his seat turned at the sound  ja get him he inquired  get nothing replied one of the three moodily de nugget aint dere an we was chasin sam to fix him an he laid for us an what he did to buck was plenty  they placed their valuable burden in the tonneau where he lay repeating himself and two of them climbed in after him the third seated himself beside the driver  bucks legs broke he announced  hell said the chauffeur  no young actor receiving his first round of applause could have felt a keener thrill of gratification than i did at those words life may have nobler triumphs than the breaking of a kidnappers leg but i did not think so then it was with an effort that i stopped myself from cheering  let her go said the man in the front seat  the purring rose to a roar the car turned and began to move with increasing speed down the drive its drone grew fainter and ceased i brushed the snow from my coat and walked to the front door  my first act on entering the house was to release white he was still lying where i had seen him last he appeared to have made no headway with the cords on his wrists and ankles i came to his help with a rather blunt pocketknife and he rose stiffly and began to chafe the injured arms in silence  theyve gone i said  he nodded  did they hit you with a sandbag  he nodded again  i broke bucks leg i said with modest pride  he looked up incredulously i related my experiences as briefly as possible and when i came to the part where i made my flying tackle the gloom was swept from his face by a joyful smile bucks injury may have given its recipient pain but it was certainly the cause of pleasure to others whites manner was one of the utmost enthusiasm as i described the scene  thatll hold buck for a while was his comment i guess we shant hear from him for a week or two thats the best cure for the headache ive ever struck  he rubbed the lump that just showed beneath his hair i did not wonder at his emotion whoever had wielded the sandbag had done his work well in a manner to cause hard feelings on the part of the victim  i had been vaguely conscious during this conversation of an intermittent noise like distant thunder i now perceived that it came from glossops classroom and was caused by the beating of hands on the doorpanels i remembered that the redmoustached man had locked glossop and his young charges in it seemed to me that he had done well there would be plenty of confusion without their assistance  i was turning towards my own classroom when i saw audrey on the stairs and went to meet her  its all right i said theyve gone  who was it what did they want  it was a gentleman named macginnis and some friends they came after ogden ford but they didnt get him  where is he where is ogden  before i could reply babel broke loose while we had been talking white had injudiciously turned the key of glossops classroom which now disgorged its occupants headed by my colleague in a turbulent stream at the same moment my own classroom began to empty itself the hall was packed with boys and the din became deafening every one had something to say and they all said it at once  glossop was at my side semaphoring violently  we must telephone he bellowed in my ear for the police  somebody tugged at my arm it was audrey she was saying something which was drowned in the uproar i drew her towards the stairs and we found comparative quiet on the first landing  what were you saying i asked  he isnt there  who  ogden ford where is he he is not in his room they must have taken him  glossop came up at a gallop springing from stair to stair like the chamois of the alps  we must telephone for the police he cried  i have telephoned said audrey ten minutes ago they are sending some men at once mr glossop was ogden ford in your classroom  no mrs sheridan i thought he was with you burns  i shook my head  those men came to kidnap him mr glossop said audrey  undoubtedly the gang of scoundrels to which that man the other night belonged this is preposterous my nerves will not stand these repeated outrages we must have police protection the villains must be brought to justice i never heard of such a thing in an english school  glossops eyes gleamed agitatedly behind their spectacles macbeths deportment when confronted with banquos ghost was stolid by comparison there was no doubt that bucks visit had upset the smooth peace of our happy little community to quite a considerable extent  the noise in the hall had increased rather than subsided a belated sense of professional duty returned to glossop and myself we descended the stairs and began to do our best in our respective styles to produce order it was not an easy task small boys are always prone to make a noise even without provocation when they get a genuine excuse like the incursion of men in white masks who prod assistantmasters in the small of the back with browning pistols they tend to eclipse themselves i doubt whether we should ever have quieted them had it not been that the hour of bucks visit had chanced to fall within a short time of that set apart for the boys tea and that the kitchen had lain outside the sphere of our visitors operations as in many english country houses the kitchen at sanstead house was at the end of a long corridor shut off by doors through which even pistolshots penetrated but faintly our excellent cook had moreover the misfortune to be somewhat deaf with the result that throughout all the storm and stress in our part of the house she like the lady in goethes poem had gone on cutting bread and butter till now when it seemed that nothing could quell the uproar there rose above it the ringing of the bell  if there is anything exciting enough to keep the englishman or the english boy from his tea it has yet to be discovered the shouting ceased on the instant the general feeling seemed to be that inquiries could be postponed till a more suitable occasion but not tea there was a general movement in the direction of the diningroom  glossop had already gone with the crowd and i was about to follow when there was another ring at the frontdoor bell  i gathered that this must be the police and waited in the impending inquiry i was by way of being a star witness if any one had been in the thick of things from the beginning it was myself  white opened the door i caught a glimpse of blue uniforms and came forward to do the honours  there were two of them no more in response to our urgent appeal for assistance against armed bandits the majesty of the law had materialized itself in the shape of a stout inspector and a long lean constable i thought as i came to meet them that they were fortunate to have arrived late i could see lefty and the redmoustached man thwarted in their designs on me making dreadful havoc among the official force as here represented  white the simple butler once more introduced us  this is mr burns one of the masters at the school he said and removed himself from the scene there never was a man like white for knowing his place when he played the butler  the inspector looked at me sharply the constable gazed into space  hm said the inspector  mentally i had named them bones and johnson i do not know why except that they seemed to deserve it  you telephoned for us said bones accusingly  we did  whats the trouble whatgot your notebookhas been happening  johnson removed his gaze from the middle distance and produced a notebook  at about half past five i began  johnson moistened his pencil  at about half past five an automobile drove up to the front door in it were five masked men with revolvers  i interested them there was no doubt of that boness healthy colour deepened and his eyes grew round johnsons pencil raced over the page wobbling with emotion  masked men echoed bones  with revolvers i said now arent you glad you didnt go to the circus they rang the frontdoor bell when white opened it they stunned him with a sandbag then  bones held up a large hand  wait  i waited  who is white  the butler  i will take his statement fetch the butler  johnson trotted off obediently  left alone with me bones became friendlier and less official  this is as queer a start as ever i heard of mr burns he said twenty years ive been in the force and nothing like this has transpired it beats cockfighting what in the world do you suppose men with masks and revolvers was after first idea i had was that you were making fun of me  i was shocked at the idea i hastened to give further details  they were a gang of american crooks who had come over to kidnap mr elmer fords son who is a pupil at the school you have heard of mr ford he is an american millionaire and there have been several attempts during the past few years to kidnap ogden  at this point johnson returned with white white told his story briefly exhibited his bruise showed the marks of the cords on his wrists and was dismissed i suggested that further conversation had better take place in the presence of mr abney who i imagined would have something to say on the subject of hushing the thing up  we went upstairs the broken door of the study delayed us a while and led to a fresh spasm of activity on the part of johnsons pencil having disposed of this we proceeded to mr abneys room  boness authoritative rap upon the door produced an agitated whos that from the occupant i explained the nature of the visitation through the keyhole and there came from within the sound of moving furniture his one brief interview with buck had evidently caused my employer to ensure against a second by barricading himself in with everything he could find suitable for the purpose it was some moments before the way was clear for our entrance  cub id said a voice at last  mr abney was sitting up in bed the blankets wrapped tightly about him his appearance was still disordered the furniture of the room was in great confusion and a poker on the floor by the dressingtable showed that he had been prepared to sell his life dearly  i ab glad to see you idspector he said bister burds what is the expladation of this extraordinary affair  it took some time to explain matters to mr abney and more to convince bones and his colleague that so far from wanting a hue and cry raised over the countryside and columns about the affair in the papers publicity was the thing we were anxious to avoid they were visibly disappointed when they grasped the position of affairs the thing properly advertised would have been the biggest that had ever happened to the neighbourhood and their eager eyes could see glory within easy reach mention of a cold snack and a drop of beer however to be found in the kitchen served to cast a gleam of brightness on their gloom and they vanished in search of it with something approaching cheeriness johnson taking notes to the last  they had hardly gone when glossop whirled into the room in a state of effervescing agitation  mr abney ogden ford is nowhere to be found  mr abney greeted the information with a prodigious sneeze  what do you bead he demanded when the paroxysm was over he turned to me bister burds i understood you toahsay that the scoudrels took their departure without the boy ford  they certainly did i watched them go  i have searched the house thoroughly said glossop and there are no signs of him and not only that the boy beckford cannot be found  mr abney clasped his head in his hands poor man he was in no condition to bear up with easy fortitude against this succession of shocks he was like one who having survived an earthquake is hit by an automobile he had partly adjusted his mind to the quiet contemplation of mr macginnis and friends when he was called upon to face this fresh disaster and he had a cold in the head which unmans the stoutest napoleon would have won waterloo if wellington had had a cold in the head  augustus beckford caddot be foud he echoed feebly  they must have run away together said glossop  mr abney sat up galvanized  such a thing has never happened id the school before he cried it has aldways beed myahcodstant endeavour to make my boys look upod sadstead house as a happy hobe i have systebatically edcouraged a spirit of cheerful codtedment i caddot seriously credit the fact that augustus beckford one of the bost charbig boys it has ever beed by good fortude to have id by charge has deliberately rud away  he must have been persuaded by that boy ford said glossop who he added morosely i believe is the devil in disguise  mr abney did not rebuke the strength of his language probably the theory struck him as eminently sound to me there certainly seemed something in it  subbthig bust be done at once mr abney exclaimed it isahibperative that we take ibbediate steps they bust have gone to londod bister burds you bust go to londod by the next traid i caddot go byself with this cold  it was the irony of fate that on the one occasion when duty really summoned that champion popperuptolondon to the metropolis he should be unable to answer the call  very well i said ill go and look out a train  bister glossop you will be in charge of the school perhaps you had better go back to the boys dow  white was in the hall when i got there  white i said do you know anything about the trains to london  are you going to london he asked in his more conversational manner i thought he looked at me curiously as he spoke  yes ogden ford and lord beckford cannot be found mr abney thinks they must have run away to london  i shouldnt wonder said white dryly it seemed to me there was something distinctly odd in his manner and youre going after them  yes i must look up a train  there is a fast train in an hour you will have plenty of time  will you tell mr abney that while i go and pack my bag and telephone for a cab  sure said white nodding  i went up to my room and began to put a few things together in a suitcase i felt happy for several reasons a visit to london after my arduous weeks at sanstead was in the nature of an unexpected treat my tastes are metropolitan and the vision of an hour at a musichalli should be too late for the theatreswith supper to follow in some restaurant where there was an orchestra appealed to me  when i returned to the hall carrying my bag i found audrey there  im being sent to london i announced  i know white told me peter bring him back  thats why im being sent  it means everything to me  i looked at her in surprise there was a strained anxious expression on her face for which i could not account i declined to believe that anybody could care what happened to the little nugget purely for that amiable youths own sake besides as he had gone to london willingly the assumption was that he was enjoying himself  i dont understand i said what do you mean  ill tell you mr ford sent me here to be near ogden to guard him he knew that there was always a danger of attempts being made to kidnap him even though he was brought over to england very quietly that is how i come to be here i go wherever ogden goes i am responsible for him and i have failed if ogden is not brought back mr ford will have nothing more to do with me he never forgives failures it will mean going back to the old work againthe dressmaking or the waiting or whatever i can manage to find she gave a little shiver peter i cant all the pluck has gone out of me im afraid i couldnt face all that again bring him back you must you will say you will  i did not answer i could find nothing to say for it was i who was responsible for all her trouble i had planned everything i had given ogden ford the money that had taken him to london and soon unless i could reach london before it happened and prevent him he with my valet smith would be in the dover boattrain on his way to monaco     chapter 9   i  it was only after many hours of thought that it had flashed upon me that the simplest and safest way of removing the little nugget was to induce him to remove himself once the idea had come the rest was simple the negotiations which had taken place that morning in the stableyard had been brief i suppose a boy in ogdens position with his record of narrow escapes from the kidnapper comes to take things as a matter of course which would startle the ordinary boy he assumed i imagine that i was the accredited agent of his mother and that the money which i gave him for travelling expenses came from her perhaps he had been expecting something of the sort at any rate he grasped the essential points of the scheme with amazing promptitude his little hand was extended to receive the cash almost before i had finished speaking  the main outline of my plan was that he should slip away to london during the afternoon go to my rooms where he would find smith and with smith travel to his mother at monaco i had written to smith bidding him be in readiness for the expedition there was no flaw in the scheme as i had mapped it out and though ogden had complicated it a little by gratuitously luring away augustus beckford to bear him company he had not endangered its success  but now an utterly unforeseen complication had arisen my one desire now was to undo everything for which i had been plotting  i stood there looking at her dumbly hating myself for being the cause of the anxiety in her eyes if i had struck her i could not have felt more despicable in my misery i cursed cynthia for leading me into this tangle  i heard my name spoken and turned to find white at my elbow  mr abney would like to see you sir  i went upstairs glad to escape the tension of the situation had begun to tear at my nerves  cub id bister burds said my employer swallowing a lozenge his aspect was more dazed than ever white has just bade anahextraordinary cobbudicatiod to me it seebs he is in reality a detective an employee of pidkertods agedcy of which you have of courseahheard  so white had revealed himself on the whole i was not surprised certainly his motive for concealment the fear of making mr abney nervous was removed an inrush of red indians with tomahawks could hardly have added greatly to mr abneys nervousness at the present juncture  sent here by mr ford i suppose i said i had to say something  exactly ahprecisely he sneezed bister ford without codsulting mei do not cobbedt on the good taste or wisdob of his actioddispatched white to apply for the post of butler at thisahhouse his predecessor having left at a bobedts dotice bribed to do so i strodgly suspect by bister ford himself i bay be wrodging bister ford but do dot thig so  i thought the reasoning sound  all thad however resumed mr abney removing his face from a jug of menthol at which he had been sniffing with the tense concentration of a dog at a rabbithole is beside the poidt i berely bedtiod it to explaid why white will accompady you to london  what  the exclamation was forced from me by my dismay this was appalling if this infernal detective was to accompany me my chance of bringing ogden back was gone it had been my intention to go straight to my rooms in the hope of finding him not yet departed but how was i to explain his presence there to white  i dont think its necessary mr abney i protested i am sure i can manage this affair by myself  two heads are better thad wud said the invalid sententiously burying his features in the jug once more  too many cooks spoil the broth i replied if the conversation was to consist of copybook maxims i could match him as long as he pleased  he did not keep up the intellectual level of the discussion  dodseds he snapped with the irritation of a man whose proverb has been capped by another i had seldom heard him speak so sharply whites revelation had evidently impressed him he had all the ordinary peaceful mans reverence for the professional detective  white will accompany you bister burds he said doggedly  very well i said  after all it might be that i should get an opportunity of giving him the slip london is a large city  a few minutes later the cab arrived and white and i set forth on our mission  we did not talk much in the cab i was too busy with my thoughts to volunteer remarks and white apparently had meditations of his own to occupy him  it was when we had settled ourselves in an empty compartment and the train had started that he found speech i had provided myself with a book as a barrier against conversation and began at once to make a pretence of reading but he broke through my defences  interesting book mr burns  very i said  lifes more interesting than books  i made no comment on this profound observation he was not discouraged  mr burns he said after the silence had lasted a few moments  yes  lets talk for a spell these trainjourneys are pretty slow  again i seemed to detect that curious undercurrent of meaning in his voice which i had noticed in the course of our brief exchange of remarks in the hall i glanced up and met his eye he was looking at me in a way that struck me as curious there was something in those bright brown eyes of his which had the effect of making me vaguely uneasy something seemed to tell me that he had a definite motive in forcing his conversation on me  i guess i can interest you a heap more than that book even if its the darndest best seller that was ever hatched  oh  he lit a cigarette  you didnt want me around on this trip did you  it seemed rather unnecessary for both of us to go i said indifferently still perhaps two heads are better than one as mr abney remarked what do you propose to do when you get to london  he bent forward and tapped me on the knee  i propose to stick to you like a label on a bottle sonny he said thats what i propose to do  what do you mean  i was finding it difficult such is the effect of a guilty conscience to meet his eye and the fact irritated me  i want to find out that address you gave the ford kid this morning out in the stableyard  it is strange how really literal figurative expressions are i had read stories in which some astonished characters heart leaped into his mouth for an instant i could have supposed that mine had actually done so the illusion of some solid object blocking up my throat was extraordinarily vivid and there certainly seemed to be a vacuum in the spot where my heart should have been not for a substantial reward could i have uttered a word at that moment i could not even breathe the horrible unexpectedness of the blow had paralysed me  white however was apparently prepared to continue the chat without my assistance  i guess you didnt know i was around or you wouldnt have talked that way well i was and i heard every word you said here was the money you said and he was to take it and break for london and go to the address on this card and your pal smith would look after him i guess there had been some talk before that but i didnt arrive in time to hear it but i heard all i wanted except that address and thats what im going to find out when we get to london  he gave out this appalling information in a rich and soothing voice as if it were some ordinary commonplace to me it seemed to end everything i imagined i was already as good as under arrest what a fool i had been to discuss such a matter in a place like a stable yard however apparently empty i might have known that at a school there are no empty places  i must say it jarred me when i heard you pulling that stuff continued white i havent what you might call a childlike faith in my fellowman as a rule but it had never occurred to me for a moment that you could be playing that game it only shows he added philosophically that youve got to suspect everybody when it comes to a giltedged proposition like the little nugget  the train rattled on i tried to reduce my mind to working order to formulate some plan but could not  beyond the realization that i was in the tightest corner of my life i seemed to have lost the power of thought  white resumed his monologue  you had me guessing he admitted i couldnt figure you out first thing of course i thought you must be working in with buck macginnis and his crowd then all that happened tonight and i saw that whoever you might be working in with it wasnt buck and now ive placed you youre not in with any one youre just playing it by yourself i shouldnt mind betting this was your first job and that you saw your chance of making a pile by holding up old man ford and thought it was better than schoolmastering and grabbed it  he leaned forward and tapped me on the knee again there was something indescribably irritating in the action as one who has had experience i can state that while to be arrested at all is bad to be arrested by a detective with a fatherly manner is maddening  see here he said we must get together over this business  i suppose it was the recollection of the same words in the mouth of buck macginnis that made me sit up with a jerk and stare at him  well make a great team he said still in that same cosy voice if ever there was a case of fiftyfifty this is it youve got the kid and ive got you i cant get away with him without your help and you cant get away with him unless you square me its a standoff the only thing is to sit in at the game together and share out does it go  he beamed kindly on my bewilderment during the space of time it takes to select a cigarette and light a match then blowing a contented puff of smoke he crossed his legs and leaned back  when i told you i was a pinkertons man sonny he said i missed the cold truth by about a mile but you caught me shooting off guns in the grounds and it was up to me to say something  he blew a smokering and watched it dreamily till it melted in the draught from the ventilator  im smooth sam fisher he said   ii  when two emotions clash the weaker goes to the wall any surprise i might have felt was swallowed up in my relief if i had been at liberty to be astonished my companions information would no doubt have astonished me but i was not i was so relieved that he was not a pinkertons man that i did not really care what else he might be  its always been a habit of mine in these little matters he went on to let other folks do the rough work and chip in myself when theyve cleared the way it saves trouble and expense i dont travel with a gang like that boneheaded buck whats the use of a gang they only get tumbling over each other and spoiling everything look at buck where is he down and out while i  he smiled complacently his manner annoyed me i objected to being looked upon as a humble cats paw by this bland scoundrel  while youwhat i said  he looked at me in mild surprise  why i come in with you sonny and take my share like a gentleman  do you  well dont i  he looked at me in the halfreproachful halfaffectionate manner of the kind old uncle who reasons with a headstrong nephew  young man he said you surely arent thinking you can put one over on me in this business tell me you dont take me for that sort of ivoryskulled boob do you imagine for one instant sonny that im not next to every move in this game are you deluding yourself with the idea that this thing isnt a perfect cinch for me lets hear whats troubling you you seem to have gotten some foolish ideas in your head lets talk it over quietly  if you have no objection i said no i dont want to talk to you mr fisher i dont like you and i dont like your way of earning your living buck macginnis was bad enough but at least he was a straightforward tough theres no excuse for you  surely we are unusually righteous this pm are we not said sam suavely  i did not answer  is this not mere professional jealousy  this was too much for me  do you imagine for a moment that im doing this for money  i did have that impression was i wrong do you kidnap the sons of millionaires for your health  i promised that i would get this boy back to his mother that is why i gave him the money to go to london and that is why my valet was to have taken him toto where mrs ford is  he did not reply in words but if ever eyebrows spoke his said my dear sir really i could not remain silent under their patent disbelief  thats the simple truth i said  he shrugged his shoulders as who would say have it your own way let us change the subject  you say was to have taken have you changed your plans  yes im going to take the boy back to the school  he laugheda rich rolling laugh his double chin shook comfortably  it wont do he said shaking his head with humorous reproach it wont do  you dont believe me  frankly i do not  very well i said and began to read my book  if you want to give me the slip he chuckled you must do better than that i can see you bringing the nugget back to the school  you will if you wait i said  i wonder what that address was that you gave him he mused well i shall soon know  he lapsed into silence the train rolled on i looked at my watch london was not far off now  the present arrangement of equal division said sam breaking a long silence holds good of course only in the event of your quitting this fool game and doing the square thing by me let me put it plainly we are either partners or competitors it is for you to decide if you will be sensible and tell me that address i will pledge my word  your word i said scornfully  honour among thieves replied sam with unruffled geniality i wouldnt doublecross you for worlds if however you think you can manage without my assistance it will then be my melancholy duty to beat you to the kid and collect him and the money entirely on my own account am i to take it he said as i was silent that you prefer war to an alliance  i turned a page of my book and went on reading  if youth but knew he sighed young man i am nearly twice your age and i have at a modest estimate about ten times as much sense yet in your overweening selfconfidence with your ungovernable gall you fancy you can hand me a lemon me i should smile  do i said do while you can  he shook his head reprovingly  you will not be so fresh sonny in a few hours you will be biting pieces out of yourself i fear and later on when my automobile splashes you with mud in piccadilly you will taste the full bitterness of remorse well youth must buy its experience i suppose  i looked across at him as he sat plump and rosy and complacent puffing at his cigarette and my heart warmed to the old ruffian it was impossible to maintain an attitude of righteous iciness with him i might loathe his mode of life and hate him as a representativeand a leading representativeof one of the most contemptible trades on earth but there was a sunny charm about the man himself which made it hard to feel hostile to him as an individual  i closed my book with a bang and burst out laughing  youre a wonder i said  he beamed at what he took to be evidence that i was coming round to the friendly and sensible view of the matter  then you think on consideration he said excellent now my dear young man all joking aside you will take me with you to that address will you not you observe that i do not ask you to give it to me let there be not so much as the faintest odour of the doublecross about this business all i ask is that you allow me to accompany you to where the nugget is hidden and then rely on my wider experience of this sort of game to get him safely away and open negotiations with the dad  i suppose your experience has been wide i said  quite tolerablyquite tolerably  doesnt it ever worry you the anxiety and misery you cause  purely temporary both and then look at it in another way think of the joy and relief of the bereaved parents when sonny comes toddling home again surely it is worth some temporary distress to taste that supreme happiness in a sense you might call me a human benefactor i teach parents to appreciate their children you know what parents are father gets caught short in steel rails one morning when he reaches home what does he do he eases his mind by snapping at little willie mrs van firstfamily forgets to invite mother to her freakdinner what happens mother takes it out of william they love him maybe but they are too used to him they do not realize all he is to them and then one afternoon he disappears the agony the remorse how could i ever have told our lost angel to stop his darned noise moans father i struck him sobs mother with this jewelled hand i spanked our vanished darling we were not worthy to have him they wail together but oh if we could but get him back well they do they get him back as soon as ever they care to come across in unmarked hundreddollar bills and after that they think twice before working off their grouches on the poor kid so i bring universal happiness into the home i dont say father doesnt get a twinge every now and then when he catches sight of the hole in his bank balance but darn it whats money for if its not to spend  he snorted with altruistic fervour  what makes you so set on kidnapping ogden ford i asked i know he is valuable but you must have made your pile by this time i gather that you have been practising your particular brand of philanthropy for a good many years why dont you retire  he sighed  it is the dream of my life to retire young man you may not believe me but my instincts are thoroughly domestic when i have the leisure to weave daydreams they centre around a cosy little home with a nice porch and stationary washtubs  he regarded me closely as if to decide whether i was worthy of these confidences there was something wistful in his brown eyes i suppose the inspection must have been favourable or he was in a mood when a man must unbosom himself to someone for he proceeded to open his heart to me a man in his particular line of business i imagine finds few confidants and the strain probably becomes intolerable at times  have you ever experienced the love of a good woman sonny its a wonderful thing he brooded sentimentally for a moment then continued andto my mindsomewhat spoiled the impressiveness of his opening words the love of a good woman he said is about the darnedest wonderful layout that ever came down the pike i know ive had some  a spark from his cigarette fell on his hand he swore a startled oath  we came from the same old town he resumed having recovered from this interlude used to be kids at the same school  walked to school together  me carrying her luncheonbasket and helping her over the fences  ah  just the same when we grew up still pals and that was twenty years ago  the arrangement was that i should go out and make the money to buy the home and then come back and marry her  then why the devil havent you done it i said severely  he shook his head  if you know anything about crooks young man he said youll know that outside of their own line they are the easiest marks that ever happened they fall for anything at least its always been that way with me no sooner did i get together a sort of pile and start out for the old town when some smooth stranger would come along and steer me up against some skingame and back id have to go to work that happened a few times and when i did manage at last to get home with the dough i found she had married another guy its hard on women you see he explained chivalrously they get lonesome and roving rupert doesnt show up so they have to marry stayathome henry just to keep from getting the horrors  so shes mrs stayathome henry now i said sympathetically  she was till a year ago shes a widow now deceased had a misunderstanding with a hydrophobia skunk so im informed i believe he was a good man outside of licking him at school i didnt know him well i saw her just before i left to come here shes as fond of me as ever its all settled if only i can connect with the mazuma and she dont want much either just enough to keep the home together  i wish you happiness i said  you can do better than that you can take me with you to that address  i avoided the subject  what does she say to your way of making money i asked  she doesnt know and she aint going to know i dont see why a man has got to tell his wife every little thing in his past she thinks im a drummer travelling in england for a drygoods firm she wouldnt stand for the other thing not for a minute shes very particular always was thats why im going to quit after ive won out over this thing of the little nugget he looked at me hopefully so you will take me along sonny wont you  i shook my head  you wont  im sorry to spoil a romance but i cant you must look around for some other home into which to bring happiness the fords is barred  you are very obstinate young man he said sadly but without any apparent illfeeling i cant persuade you  no  ah well so we are to be rivals not allies you will regret this sonny i may say you will regret it very bitterly when you see me in my automo  you mentioned your automobile before  ah so i did  the train had stopped as trains always do on english railways before entering a terminus presently it began to move forward hesitatingly as if saying to itself now am i really wanted here shall i be welcome eventually after a second halt it glided slowly alongside the platform  i sprang out and ran to the cabrank i was aboard a taxi bowling out of the station before the train had stopped  peeping out of the window at the back i was unable to see sam my adroit move i took it had baffled him i had left him standing  it was a quarter of an hours drive to my rooms but to me in my anxiety it seemed more this was going to be a close thing and success or failure a matter of minutes if he followed my instructions smith would be starting for the continental boattrain tonight with his companion and working out the distances i saw that by the time i could arrive he might already have left my rooms sams supervision at sanstead station had made it impossible for me to send a telegram i had had to trust to chance fortunately my train by a miracle had been up to time and at my present rate of progress i ought to catch smith a few minutes before he left the building  the cab pulled up i ran up the stairs and opened the door of my apartment  smith i called  a chair scraped along the floor and a door opened at the end of the passage smith came out  thank goodness you have not started i thought i should miss you where is the boy  the boy sir  the boy i wrote to you about  he has not arrived sir  not arrived  no sir  i stared at him blankly  how long have you been here  all day sir  you have not been out  not since the hour of two sir  i cant understand it i said  perhaps the young gentleman changed his mind and never started sir  i know he started  smith had no further suggestion to offer  pending the young gentlemans arrival sir i remain in london  a fruity voice spoke at the door behind me  what hasnt he arrived  i turned there beaming and benevolent stood mr fisher  it occurred to me to look your name out in the telephone directory he explained i might have thought of that before  come in here i said opening the door of the sittingroom i did not want to discuss the thing with him before smith  he looked about the room admiringly  so these are your quarters he said you do yourself pretty well young man so i understand that the nugget has gone wrong in transit he has altered his plans on the way  i cant understand it  i can you gave him a certain amount of money  yes enough to get him towhere he was going  then knowing the boy i should say that he has found other uses for it hes whooping it up in london and i should fancy having the time of his young life  he got up  this of course he said alters considerably any understanding we may have come to sonny all idea of a partnership is now out of the question i wish you well but i have no further use for you somewhere in this great city the little nugget is hiding and i mean to find himentirely on my own account this is where our paths divide mr burns good night     chapter 10   when sam had left which he did rather in the manner of a heavy father in melodrama shaking the dust of an erring sons threshold off his feet i mixed myself a highball and sat down to consider the position of affairs it did not take me long to see that the infernal boy had doublecrossed me with a smooth effectiveness which mr fisher himself might have envied somewhere in this great city as sam had observed he was hiding but where london is a vague address  i wondered what steps sam was taking was there some underground secret service bureau to which persons of his profession had access i doubted it i imagined that he as i proposed to do was drawing the city at a venture in the hope of flushing the quarry by accident yet such was the impression he had made upon me as a man of resource and sagacity that i did not relish the idea of his getting a start on me even in a venture so uncertain as this my imagination began to picture him miraculously inspired in the search and such was the vividness of the vision that i jumped up from my chair resolved to get on the trail at once it was hopelessly late however and i did not anticipate that i should meet with any success  nor did i for two hours and a half i tramped the streets my spirits sinking more and more under the influence of failure and a blend of snow and sleet which had begun to fall and then tired out i went back to my rooms and climbed sorrowfully into bed  it was odd to wake up and realize that i was in london years seemed to have passed since i had left it time is a thing of emotions not of hours and minutes and i had certainly packed a considerable number of emotional moments into my stay at sanstead house i lay in bed reviewing the past while smith with a cheerful clatter of crockery prepared my breakfast in the next room  a curious lethargy had succeeded the feverish energy of the previous night more than ever the impossibility of finding the needle in this human bundle of hay oppressed me no one is optimistic before breakfast and i regarded the future with dull resignation turning my thoughts from it after a while to the past but the past meant audrey and to think of audrey hurt  it seemed curious to me that in a life of thirty years i should have been able to find among the hundreds of women i had met only one capable of creating in me that disquieting welter of emotions which is called love and hard that that one should reciprocate my feeling only to the extent of the mild liking which audrey entertained for me  i tried to analyse her qualifications for the place she held in my heart i had known women who had attracted me more physically and women who had attracted me more mentally i had known wiser women handsomer women more amiable women but none of them had affected me like audrey the problem was inexplicable any idea that we might be affinities soulmates destined for each other from the beginning of time was disposed of by the fact that my attraction for her was apparently in inverse ratio to hers for me for possibly the millionth time in the past five years i tried to picture in my mind the man sheridan that shadowy wooer to whom she had yielded so readily what quality had he possessed that i did not wherein lay the magnetism that had brought about his triumph  these were unprofitable speculations i laid them aside until the next occasion when i should feel disposed for selftorture and got out of bed a bath and breakfast braced me up and i left the house in a reasonably cheerful frame of mind  to search at random for an individual unit among londons millions lends an undeniable attraction to a day in town in a desultory way i pursued my investigations through the morning and afternoon but neither of ogden nor of his young friend lord beckford was i vouchsafed a glimpse my consolation was that smooth sam was probably being equally unsuccessful  towards the evening there arose the question of return to sanstead i had not gathered whether mr abney had intended to set any timelimit on my wanderings or whether i was not supposed to come back except with the deserters i decided that i had better remain in london at any rate for another night and went to the nearest post office to send mr abney a telegram to that effect  as i was writing it the problem which had baffled me for twentyfour hours solved itself in under a minute whether my powers of inductive reasoning had been under a cloud since i left sanstead or whether they were normally beneath contempt i do not know but the fact remains that i had completely overlooked the obvious solution of my difficulty i think i must have been thinking so exclusively of the little nugget that i had entirely forgotten the existence of augustus beckford it occurred to me now that by making inquiries at the latters house i should learn something to my advantage a boy of the augustus type does not run away from school without a reason probably some party was taking place tonight at the ancestral home at which tempted by the lawless nugget he had decided that his presence was necessary  i knew the house well there had been a time when lord mountry and i were at oxford when i had spent frequent weekends there since then owing to being abroad i had seen little of the family now was the moment to reintroduce myself i hailed a cab  inductive reasoning had not played me false there was a red carpet outside the house and from within came the sounds of music  lady wroxham the mother of mountry and the vanishing augustus was one of those women who take things as they come she did not seem surprised at seeing me  how nice of you to come and see us she said somebody told me you were abroad ted is in the south of france in the yacht augustus is here mr abney his schoolmaster let him come up for the night  i perceived that augustus had been playing a bold game i saw the coaching of ogden behind these dashing falsehoods  you will hardly remember sybil she was quite a baby when you were here last she is having her birthdayparty this evening  may i go in and help i said  i wish you would they would love it  i doubted it but went in a dance had just finished strolling towards me in his tightest eton suit his face shining with honest joy was the errant augustus and close behind him wearing the blase air of one for whom custom has staled the pleasures of life was the little nugget  i think they both saw me at the same moment the effect of my appearance on them was illustrative of their respective characters augustus turned a deep shade of purple and fixed me with a horrified stare the nugget winked augustus halted and shuffled his feet the nugget strolled up and accosted me like an old friend  hello he said how did you get here say i was going to try and get you on the phone some old time and explain things ive been pretty much on the jump since i hit london  you little brute  my gleaming eye travelling past him met that of the hon augustus beckford causing that youth to jump guiltily the nugget looked over his shoulder  i guess we dont want him around if were to talk business he said ill go and tell him to beat it  youll do nothing of the kind i dont propose to lose sight of either of you  oh hes all right you dont have to worry about him he was going back to the school anyway tomorrow he only ran away to go to this party why not let him enjoy himself while hes here ill go and make a date for you to meet at the end of the show  he approached his friend and a short colloquy ensued which ended in the latter shuffling off in the direction of the other revellers such is the buoyancy of youth that a moment later he was dancing a twostep with every appearance of careless enjoyment the future with its storms seemed to have slipped from his mind  thats all right said the nugget returning to me hes promised he wont duck away youll find him somewhere around whenever you care to look for him now we can talk  i hardly like to trespass on your valuable time i said the airy way in which this demon boy handled what should have beento himan embarrassing situation irritated me for all the authority i seemed to have over him i might have been the potted palm against which he was leaning  thats all right everything appeared to be all right with him this sort of thing does not appeal to me dont be afraid of spoiling my evening i only came because becky was so set on it dancing bores me pallid so lets get somewhere where we can sit down and talk  i was beginning to feel that a childrens party was the right place for me sam fisher had treated me as a child and so did the little nugget that i was a responsible person well on in my thirtyfirst year with a narrow escape from death and a hopeless loveaffair on my record seemed to strike neither of them i followed my companion to a secluded recess with the utmost meekness  he leaned back and crossed his legs  got a cigarette  i have not got a cigarette and if i had i wouldnt give it to you  he regarded me tolerantly  got a grouch tonight havent you you seem all flittered up about something whats the trouble sore about my not showing up at your apartment ill explain that all right  i shall be glad to listen  its like this it suddenly occurred to me that a day or two one way or the other wasnt going to affect our deal and that while i was about it i might just as well see a bit of london before i left i suggested it to becky and the idea made the biggest kind of a hit with him i found he had only been in an automobile once in his life can you beat it ive had one of my own ever since i was a kid well naturally it was up to me to blow him to a joyride and thats where the money went  where the money went  sure ive got two dollars left and thats all it wasnt altogether the automobiling it was the meals that got away with my roll say that kid beckford is one swell feeder hes wrapping himself around the eats all the time i guess its not smoking that does it i havent the appetite i used to have well thats how it was you see but im through now cough up the fare and ill make the trip tomorrow motherll be tickled to death to see me  she wont see you were going back to the school tomorrow  he looked at me incredulously  whats that going back to school  ive altered my plans  im not going back to any old school you darent take me wherell you be if i tell the hotair merchant about our deal and you slipping me the money and all that  tell him what you like he wont believe it  he thought this over and its truth came home to him the complacent expression left his face  whats the matter with you are you dippy or what you get me away up to london and the first thing that happens when im here is that you want to take me back you make me tired  it was borne in upon me that there was something in his point of view my sudden change of mind must have seemed inexplicable to him and having by a miracle succeeded in finding him i was in a mood to be generous i unbent  ogden old sport i said cordially t think weve both had all we want of this childrens party youre bored and if i stop on another half hour i may be called on to entertain these infants with comic songs we men of the world are above this sort of thing get your hat and coat and ill take you to a show we can discuss business later over a bit of supper  the gloom of his countenance melted into a pleased smile  you said something that time he observed joyfully and we slunk away to get our hats the best of friends a note for augustus beckford requesting his presence at waterloo station at ten minutes past twelve on the following morning i left with the butler there was a certain informality about my methods which i doubt if mr abney would have approved but i felt that i could rely on augustus  much may be done by kindness by the time the curtain fell on the musical comedy which we had attended all was peace between the nugget and myself supper cemented our friendship and we drove back to my rooms on excellent terms with one another half an hour later he was snoring in the spare room while i smoked contentedly before the fire in the sittingroom  i had not been there five minutes when the bell rang smith was in bed so i went to the door myself and found mr fisher on the mat  my feeling of benevolence towards all created things the result of my successful handling of the little nugget embraced sam i invited him in  well i said when i had given him a cigar and filled his glass and how have you been getting on mr fisher any luck  he shook his head at me reproachfully  young man youre deep ive got to hand it to you i underestimated you youre very deep  approbation from smooth sam fisher is praise indeed but why these stately compliments  you took me in young man i dont mind owning it when you told me the nugget had gone astray i lapped it up like a babe and all the time you were putting one over on me well well  but he had gone astray mr fisher  he knocked the ash off his cigar he wore a pained look  you neednt keep it up sonny i happened to be standing within three yards of you when you got into a cab with him in shaftesbury avenue  i laughed  well if thats the case let there be no secrets between us hes asleep in the next room  sam leaned forward earnestly and tapped me on the knee  young man this is a critical moment this is where if you arent careful you may undo all the good work you have done by getting chesty and thinking that because youve won out so far youre the whole show believe me the difficult part is to come and its right here that you need an experienced man to work in with you let me in on this and leave the negotiations with old man ford to me you would only make a mess of them ive handled this kind of thing a dozen times and i know just how to act you wont regret taking me on as a partner you wont lose a cent by it i can work him for just double what you would get even supposing you didnt make a mess of the deal and get nothing  its very good of you but there wont be any negotiations with mr ford i am taking the boy back to sanstead as i told you i caught his pained eye im afraid you dont believe me  he drew at his cigar without replying  it is a human weakness to wish to convince those who doubt us even if their opinion is not intrinsically valuable i remembered that i had cynthias letter in my pocket i produced it as exhibit a in my evidence and read it to him  sam listened carefully  i see he said who wrote that  never mind a friend of mine  i returned the letter to my pocket  i was going to have sent him over to monaco but i altered my plans something interfered  what  i might call it coincidence if you know what that means  and you are really going to take him back to the school  i am  we shall travel back together he said i had hoped i had seen the last of the place the english countryside may be delightful in the summer but for winter give me london however he sighed resignedly and rose from his chair i will say goodbye till tomorrow what train do you catch  do you mean to say i demanded that you have the nerve to come back to sanstead after what you have told me about yourself  you entertain some idea of exposing me to mr abney forget it young man we are both in glass houses dont let us throw stones besides would he believe it what proof have you  i had thought this argument tolerably sound when i had used it on the nugget now that it was used on myself i realized its soundness even more thoroughly my hands were tied  yes said sam tomorrow after our little jaunt to london we shall all resume the quiet rural life once more  he beamed expansively upon me from the doorway  however even the quiet rural life has its interest i guess we shant be dull he said  i believed him     chapter 11   considering the various handicaps under which he laboured notably a cold in the head a fear of the little nugget and a reverence for the aristocracymr abneys handling of the situation when the runaways returned to school bordered on the masterly any sort of physical punishment being out of the questionespecially in the case of the nugget who would certainly have retaliated with a bout of windowbreakinghe had to fall back on oratory and he did this to such effect that when he had finished augustus wept openly and was so subdued that he did not ask a single question for nearly three days  one result of the adventure was that ogdens bed was moved to a sort of cubbyhole adjoining my room in the house as originally planned this had evidently been a dressingroom under mr abneys rule it had come to be used as a general repository for lumber my boxes were there and a portmanteau of glossops it was an excellent place in which to bestow a boy in quest of whom kidnappers might break in by night the window was too small to allow a man to pass through and the only means of entrance was by way of my room by night at any rate the nuggets safety seemed to be assured  the curiosity of the small boy fortunately is not lasting his active mind lives mainly in the present it was not many days therefore before the excitement caused by bucks raid and the nuggets disappearance began to subside within a week both episodes had been shelved as subjects of conversation and the school had settled down to its normal humdrum life  to me however there had come a period of mental unrest more acute than i had ever experienced my life for the past five years had run in so smooth a stream that now that i found myself tossed about in the rapids i was bewildered it was a peculiar aggravation of the difficulty of my position that in my world the little world of sanstead house there should be but one woman and she the very one whom if i wished to recover my peace of mind it was necessary for me to avoid  my feelings towards cynthia at this time defied my powers of analysis there were moments when i clung to the memory of her when she seemed the only thing solid and safe in a world of chaos and moments again when she was a burden crushing me there were days when i would give up the struggle and let myself drift and days when i would fight myself inch by inch but every day found my position more hopeless than the last  at night sometimes as i lay awake i would tell myself that if only i could see her or even hear from her the struggle would be easier it was her total disappearance from my life that made it so hard for me i had nothing to help me to fight  and then one morning as if in answer to my thoughts her letter came  the letter startled me it was as if there had been some telepathic communion between us  it was very short almost formal  my dear peteri want to ask you a question i can put it quite shortly it is this are your feelings towards me still the same i dont tell you why i ask this i simply ask it whatever your answer is it cannot affect our friendship so be quite candid cynthia  i sat down there and then to write my reply the letter coming when it did and saying what it said had affected me profoundly it was like an unexpected reinforcement in a losing battle it filled me with a glow of selfconfidence i felt strong again able to fight and win my mood bore me away and i poured out my whole heart to her i told her that my feelings had not altered that i loved her and nobody but her it was a letter i can see looking back born of fretted nerves but at the time i had no such criticism to make it seemed to me a true expression of my real feelings  that the fight was not over because in my moment of exaltation i had imagined that i had conquered myself was made uncomfortably plain to me by the thrill that ran through me when returning from posting my letter i met audrey the sight of her reminded me that a reinforcement is only a reinforcement a help towards victory not victory itself  for the first time i found myself feeling resentful towards her there was no reason in my resentment it would not have borne examination but it was there and its presence gave me support i found myself combating the thrill the sight of her had caused and looking at her with a critical and hostile eye who was she that she should enslave a man against his will fascination exists only in the imagination of the fascinated if he have the strength to deny the fascination and convince himself that it does not exist he is saved it is purely a matter of willpower and calm reasonableness there must have been sturdy levelheaded egyptian citizens who could not understand what people saw to admire in cleopatra  thus reasoning i raised my hat uttered a crisp good morning and passed on the very picture of the brisk man of affairs  peter  even the brisk man of affairs must stop when spoken to otherwise apart from any question of politeness it looks as if he were running away  her face was still wearing the faint look of surprise which my manner had called forth  youre in a great hurry  i had no answer she did not appear to expect one  we moved towards the house in silence to me oppressive silence the force of her personality was beginning to beat against my defences concerning the stability of which under pressure a certain uneasiness troubled my mind  are you worried about anything peter she said at last  no i said why  i was afraid you might be  i felt angry with myself i was mismanaging this thing in the most idiotic way instead of this bovine silence gay smalltalk the easy eloquence in fact of the brisk man of affairs should have been my policy no wonder smooth sam fisher treated me as a child my whole bearing was that of a sulky schoolboy  the silence became more oppressive  we reached the house in the hall we parted she to upper regions i to my classroom she did not look at me her face was cold and offended  one is curiously inconsistent having created what in the circumstances was a most desirable coldness between audrey and myself i ought to have been satisfied reason told me that this was the best thing that could have happened yet joy was one of the few emotions which i did not feel during the days which followed my brief moment of clearheadedness had passed and with it the exhilaration that had produced the letter to cynthia and the resentment which had helped me to reason calmly with myself on the intrinsic nature of fascination in woman once more audrey became the centre of my world but our friendship that elusive thing which had contrived to exist side by side with my love had vanished there was a breach between us which widened daily soon we hardly spoke  nothing in short could have been more eminently satisfactory and the fact that i regretted it is only a proof of the essential weakness of my character     chapter 12   i  in those grey days there was one thought of the many that occupied my mind which brought with it a certain measure of consolation it was the reflection that this state of affairs could not last for ever the school term was drawing to a close soon i should be free from the propinquity which paralysed my efforts to fight i was resolved that the last day of term should end for ever my connection with sanstead house and all that was in it mrs ford must find some other minion if her happiness depended on the recovery of the little nugget she must learn to do without happiness like the rest of the inhabitants of this horrible world  meanwhile however i held myself to be still on duty by what tortuous processes of thought i had arrived at the conclusion i do not know but i considered myself responsible to audrey for the safeguarding of the little nugget and no altered relations between us could affect my position perhaps mixed up with this attitude of mind was the less altruistic wish to foil smooth sam his continued presence at the school was a challenge to me  sams behaviour puzzled me i do not know exactly what i expected him to do but i certainly did not expect him to do nothing yet day followed day and still he made no move he was the very model of a butler but our dealings with one another in london had left me vigilant and his inaction did not disarm me it sprang from patience not from any weakening of purpose or despair of success sooner or later i knew he would act swiftly and suddenly with a plan perfected in every detail  but when he made his attack it was the very simplicity of his methods that tricked me and only pure chance defeated him  i have said that it was the custom of the staff of masters at sanstead house schoolin other words of every male adult in the house except mr fisher himselfto assemble in mr abneys study after dinner of an evening to drink coffee it was a ceremony like most of the ceremonies at an establishment such as a school where things are run on a schedule which knew of no variation sometimes mr abney would leave us immediately after the ceremony but he never omitted to take his part in it first  on this particular evening for the first time since the beginning of the term i was seized with a prejudice against coffee i had been sleeping badly for several nights and i decided that abstention from coffee might remedy this  i waited for forms sake till glossop and mr abney had filled their cups then went to my room where i lay down in the dark to wrestle with a more than usually pronounced fit of depression which had descended upon me solitude and darkness struck me as the suitable setting for my thoughts  at this moment smooth sam fisher had no place in my meditations my mind was not occupied with him at all when therefore the door which had been ajar began to open slowly i did not become instantly on the alert perhaps it was some sound barely audible that aroused me from my torpor and set my blood tingling with anticipation perhaps it was the way the door was opening an honest draught does not move a door furtively in jerks  i sat up noiseless tense and alert and then very quietly somebody entered the room  there was only one person in sanstead house who would enter a room like that i was amused the impudence of the thing tickled me it seemed so foreign to mr fishers usual cautious methods this strolling in and helping oneself was certainly kidnapping de luxe in the small hours i could have understood it but at nine oclock at night with glossop mr abney and myself awake and liable to be met at any moment on the stairs it was absurd i marvelled at smooth sams effrontery  i lay still i imagined that being in he would switch on the electric light he did and i greeted him pleasantly  and what can i do for you mr fisher  for a man who had learned to control himself in difficult situations he took the shock badly he uttered a startled exclamation and spun round openmouthed  i could not help admiring the quickness with which he recovered himself almost immediately he was the suave chatty sam fisher who had unbosomed his theories and dreams to me in the train to london  i quit he said pleasantly the episode is closed i am a man of peace and i take it that you would not keep on lying quietly on that bed while i went into the other room and abstracted our young friend unless you have changed your mind again would a fiftyfifty offer tempt you  not an inch  just so i merely asked  and how about mr abney in any case suppose we met him on the stairs  we should not meet him on the stairs said sam confidently you did not take coffee tonight i gather  i didntno why  he jerked his head resignedly  can you beat it i ask you young man could i have foreseen that after drinking coffee every night regularly for two months you would pass it up tonight of all nights you certainly are my jinx sonny you have hung the indian sign on me all right  his words had brought light to me  did you drug the coffee  did i i fixed it so that one sip would have an insomnia patient in dreamland before he had time to say good night that stuff rip van winkle drank had nothing on my coffee and all wasted well well  he turned towards the door  shall i leave the light on or would you prefer it off  on please i might fall asleep in the dark  not you and if you did you would dream that i was there and wake up there are moments young man when you bring me pretty near to quitting and taking to honest work  he paused  but not altogether i have still a shot or two in my locker we shall see what we shall see i am not dead yet wait  i will and some day when i am walking along piccadilly a passing automobile will splash me with mud a heavily furred plutocrat will stare haughtily at me from the tonneau and with a start of surprise i shall recognize  stranger things have happened be flip while you can sonny you win so far but this hoodoo of mine cant last for ever  he passed from the room with a certain sad dignity a moment later he reappeared  a thought strikes me he said the fiftyfifty proposition does not impress you would it make things easier if i were to offer my cooperation for a mere quarter of the profit  not in the least  its a handsome offer  wonderfully im afraid im not dealing on any terms  he left the room only to return once more his head appeared staring at me round the door in a disembodied way like the cheshire cat  you wont say later on i didnt give you your chance he said anxiously  he vanished again permanently this time i heard his steps passing down the stairs   ii  we had now arrived at the last week of term at the last days of the last week the holiday spirit was abroad in the school among the boys it took the form of increased disorderliness boys who had hitherto only made glossop bellow now made him perspire and tear his hair as well boys who had merely spilt ink now broke windows the little nugget abandoned cigarettes in favour of an old clay pipe which he had found in the stables  as for me i felt like a spent swimmer who sees the shore almost within his reach audrey avoided me when she could and was frigidly polite when we met but i suffered less now a few more days and i should have done with this phase of my life for ever and audrey would once more become a memory  complete quiescence marked the deportment of mr fisher during these days he did not attempt to repeat his last effort the coffee came to the study unmixed with alien drugs sam like lightning did not strike twice in the same place he had the artists soul and disliked patching up bungled work if he made another move it would i knew be on entirely fresh lines  ignoring the fact that i had had all the luck i was inclined to be selfsatisfied when i thought of sam i had pitted my wits against his and i had won it was a praiseworthy performance for a man who had done hitherto nothing particular in his life  if all the copybook maxims which had been drilled into me in my childhood and my early disaster with audrey had not been sufficient i ought to have been warned by sams advice not to take victory for granted till the fight was over as sam had said his luck would turn sooner or later  one realizes these truths in theory but the practical application of them seldom fails to come as a shock i received mine on the last morning but one of the term  shortly after breakfast a message was brought to me that mr abney would like to see me in his study i went without any sense of disaster to come most of the business of the school was discussed in the study after breakfast and i imagined that the matter had to do with some detail of the morrows exodus  i found mr abney pacing the room a look of annoyance on his face at the desk her back to me audrey was writing it was part of her work to take charge of the business correspondence of the establishment she did not look round when i came in nor when mr abney spoke my name but went on writing as if i did not exist  there was a touch of embarrassment in mr abneys manner for which i could not at first account he was stately but with the rather defensive stateliness which marked his announcements that he was about to pop up to london and leave me to do his work he coughed once or twice before proceeding to the business of the moment  ah mr burns he said at length might i ask if your plans for the holidays theahearlier part of the holidays are settled no ahexcellent  he produced a letter from the heap of papers on the desk  ahexcellent that simplifies matters considerably i have no right to ask what i am about toahin fact ask i have no claim on your time in the holidays but in the circumstances perhaps you may see your way to doing me a considerable service i have received a letter from mr elmer ford which puts me in a position of some difficulty it is not my wishindeed it is foreign to my policyto disoblige the parents of the boys who are entrusted to myahcare and i should like if possible to do what mr ford asks it appears that certain business matters call him to the north of england for a few days this rendering it impossible for him to receive little ogden tomorrow it is not my custom to criticize parents who have paid me the compliment of placing their sons at the most malleable and important period of their lives in myahcharge but i must say that a little longer notice would have been ain fact a convenience but mr ford like so many of his countrymen is what i believe is called a hustler he does it now as the expression is in short he wishes to leave little ogden at the school for the first few days of the holidays and i should be extremely obliged mr burns if you should find it possible to stay here andahlook after him  audrey stopped writing and turned in her chair the first intimation she had given that she had heard mr abneys remarks  it really wont be necessary to trouble mr burns she said without looking at me i can take care of ogden very well by myself  in the case of anahordinary boy mrs sheridan i should not hesitate to leave you in sole charge as you have very kindly offered to stay and help me in this matter but we must recollect not onlyi speak franklynot only the peculiarahdisposition of this particular lad but also the fact that those ruffians who visited the house that night may possibly seize the opportunity to make a fresh attack i should not feelahjustified in thrusting so heavy a responsibility upon you  there was reason in what he said audrey made no reply i heard her pen tapping on the desk and deduced her feelings i myself felt like a prisoner who having filed through the bars of his cell is removed to another on the eve of escape i had so braced myself up to endure till the end of term and no longer that this postponement of the day of release had a crushing effect  mr abney coughed and lowered his voice confidentially  i would stay myself but the fact is i am called to london on very urgent business and shall be unable to return for a day or so my late pupil theahthe earl of buxton has beeni can rely on your discretion mr burnshas been in trouble with the authorities at eton and his guardian an old college friend of minethein fact the duke of bessborough who rightly or wrongly placeserconsiderable reliance on my advice is anxious to consult me on the matter i shall return as soon as possible but you will readily understand that in the circumstances my time will not be my own i must place myself unreservedly atahbessboroughs disposal  he pressed the bell  in the event of your observing any suspicious characters in the neighbourhood you have the telephone and can instantly communicate with the police and you will have the assistance of  the door opened and smooth sam fisher entered  you rang sir  ah come in white and close the door i have something to say to you i have just been informing mr burns that mr ford has written asking me to allow his son to stay on at the school for the first few days of the vacation  he turned to audrey  you will doubtless be surprised mrs sheridan and possiblyah somewhat startled to learn the peculiar nature of whites position at sanstead house you have no objection to my informing mrs sheridan white in consideration of the fact that you will be working together in this matter just so white is a detective in the employment of pinkertons agency mr forda slight frown appeared on his lofty browmr ford obtained his present situation for him in order that he might protect his son in the event ofahin fact any attempt to remove him  i saw audrey start a quick flush came into her face she uttered a little exclamation of astonishment  just so said mr abney by way of comment on this you are naturally surprised the whole arrangement is excessively unusual and i may sayahdisturbing however you have your duty to fulfil to your employer white and you will of course remain here with the boy  yes sir  i found myself looking into a bright brown eye that gleamed with genial triumph the other was closed in the exuberance of the moment smooth sam had had the bad taste to wink at me  you will have mr burns to help you white he has kindly consented to postpone his departure during the short period in which i shall be compelled to be absent  i had no recollection of having given any kind consent but i was very willing to have it assumed and i was glad to see that mr fisher though mr abney did not observe it was visibly taken aback by this piece of information but he made one of his swift recoveries  it is very kind of mr burns he said in his fruitiest voice but i hardly think it will be necessary to put him to the inconvenience of altering his plans i am sure that mr ford would prefer the entire charge of the affair to be in my hands  he had not chosen a happy moment for the introduction of the millionaires name mr abney was a man of method who hated any dislocation of the fixed routine of life and mr fords letter had upset him the ford family father and son were just then extremely unpopular with him  he crushed sam  what mr ford would or would not prefer is in this particular matter beside the point the responsibility for the boy while he remains on the school premises isahmine and i shall take such precautions as seem fit and adequate tohimmyself irrespective of those which in your opinion might suggest themselves to mr ford as i cannot be here myself owing toahurgent business in london i shall certainly take advantage of mr burnss kind offer to remain as my deputy  he paused and blew his nose his invariable custom after these occasional outbursts of his sam had not wilted beneath the storm he waited unmoved till all was over  i am afraid i shall have to be more explicit he said i had hoped to avoid scandal and unpleasantness but i see it is impossible  mr abneys astonished face emerged slowly from behind his handkerchief  i quite agree with you sir that somebody should be here to help me look after the boy but not mr burns i am sorry to have to say it but i do not trust mr burns  mr abneys look of astonishment deepened i too was surprised it was so unlike sam to fling away his chances on a blundering attack like this  what do you mean demanded mr abney  mr burns is after the boy himself he came to kidnap him  mr abney as he had every excuse for doing grunted with amazement i achieved the ringing laugh of amused innocence it was beyond me to fathom sams mind he could not suppose that any credence would be given to his wild assertion it seemed to me that disappointment had caused him momentarily to lose his head  are you mad white  no sir i can prove what i say if i had not gone to london with him that last time hed have got away with the boy then for certain  for an instant an uneasy thought came to me that he might have something in reserve something unknown to me which had encouraged him to this direct attack i dismissed the notion there could be nothing  mr abney had turned to me with a look of hopeless bewilderment i raised my eyebrows  ridiculous i said  that this was the only comment seemed to be mr abneys view he turned on sam with the pettish anger of the mild man  what do you mean white by coming to me with such a preposterous story  i dont say mr burns wished to kidnap the boy in the ordinary way said sam imperturbably like those men who came that night he had a special reason mr and mrs ford as of course you know sir are divorced mr burns was trying to get the boy away and take him back to his mother  i heard audrey give a little gasp mr abneys anger became modified by a touch of doubt i could see that these words by lifting the accusation from the wholly absurd to the somewhat plausible had impressed him once again i was gripped by the uneasy feeling that sam had an unsuspected card to play this might be bluff but it had a sinister ring  you might say went on sam smoothly that this was creditable to mr burnss heart but from my employers viewpoint and yours too it was a chivalrous impulse that needed to be checked will you please read this sir  he handed a letter to mr abney who adjusted his glasses and began to readat first in a detached judicial way then with startled eagerness  i felt it necessary to search among mr burnss papers sir in the hope of finding  and then i knew what he had found from the first the bluegrey notepaper had had a familiar look i recognized it now it was cynthias letter that damning document which i had been mad enough to read to him in london his prediction that the luck would change had come amazingly true  i caught sams eye for the second time he was unfeeling enough to wink it was a rich comprehensive wink as expressive and joyous as a college yell  mr abney had absorbed the letter and was struggling for speech i could appreciate his emotion if he had not actually been nurturing a viper in his bosom he had come from his point of view very near it of all men a schoolmaster necessarily looks with the heartiest dislike on the wouldbe kidnapper  as for me my mind was in a whirl i was entirely without a plan without the very beginnings of a plan to help me cope with this appalling situation i was crushed by a sense of the utter helplessness of my position to denounce sam was impossible to explain my comparative innocence was equally out of the question the suddenness of the onslaught had deprived me of the power of coherent thought i was routed  mr abney was speaking  is your name peter mr burns  i nodded speech was beyond me  this letter is written byahby a lady it asks you in set terms toahhasten to kidnap ogden ford do you wish me to read it to you or do you confess to knowing its contents  he waited for a reply i had none to make  you do not deny that you came to sanstead house for the deliberate purpose of kidnapping ogden ford  i had nothing to say i caught a glimpse of audreys face cold and hard and shifted my eyes quickly mr abney gulped his face wore the reproachful expression of a codfish when jerked out of the water on the end of a line he stared at me with pained repulsion that scoundrelly old buccaneer sam did the same he looked like a shocked bishop  iahtrusted you implicitly said mr abney  sam wagged his head at me reproachfully with a flicker of spirit i glared at him he only wagged the more  it was i think the blackest moment of my life a wild desire for escape on any terms surged over me that look on audreys face was biting into my brain like an acid  i will go and pack i said  this is the end of all things i said to myself  i had suspended my packing in order to sit on my bed and brood i was utterly depressed there are crises in a mans life when reason fails to bring the slightest consolation in vain i tried to tell myself that what had happened was in essence precisely what twentyfour hours ago i was so eager to bring about it amounted to this that now at last audrey had definitely gone out of my life from now on i could have no relations with her of any sort was not this exactly what twentyfour hours ago i had wished twentyfour hours ago had i not said to myself that i would go away and never see her again undoubtedly nevertheless i sat there and groaned in spirit  it was the end of all things  a mild voice interrupted my meditations  can i help  sam was standing in the doorway beaming on me with invincible goodhumour  you are handling them wrong allow me a moment more and you would have ruined the crease  i became aware of a pair of trousers hanging limply in my grasp he took them from me and folding them neatly placed them in my trunk  dont get all worked up about it sonny he said its the fortune of war besides what does it matter to you judging by that very snug apartment in london you have quite enough money for a young man losing your job here wont break you and if youre worrying about mrs ford and her feelings dont i guess shes probably forgotten all about the nugget by this time so cheer up youre all right  he stretched out a hand to pat me on the shoulder then thought better of it and drew it back  think of my happiness if you want something to make you feel good believe me young man its some i could sing gee when i think that its all plain sailing now and no more troubles i could dance you dont know what it means to me putting through this deal i wish you knew mary thats her name you must come and visit us sonny when were fixed up in the home therell always be a knife and fork for you well make you one of the family lord i can see the place as plain as i can see you nice frame house with a good porch me in a rocker in my shirtsleeves smoking a cigar and reading the baseball news mary in another rocker mending my socks and nursing the cat well sure have a cat two cats i like cats and a goat in the front garden say itll be great  and on the word emotion overcoming prudence he brought his fat hand down with a resounding smack on my bowed shoulders  there is a limit i bounded to my feet  get out i yelped get out of here  sure he replied agreeably he rose without haste and regarded me compassionately cheer up son be a sport  there are moments when the best of men become melodramatic i offer this as excuse for my next observation  clenching my fists and glaring at him i cried ill foil you yet you hound  some people have no soul for the dramatic he smiled tolerantly  sure he said anything you like desperate desmond enjoy yourself  and he left me     chapter 13   i evacuated sanstead house unostentatiously setting off on foot down the long drive my luggage i gathered was to follow me to the station in a cart i was thankful to providence for the small mercy that the boys were in their classrooms and consequently unable to ask me questions augustus beckford alone would have handled the subject of my premature exit in a manner calculated to bleach my hair  it was a wonderful morning the sky was an unclouded blue and a fresh breeze was blowing in from the sea i think that something of the exhilaration of approaching spring must have stirred me for quite suddenly the dull depression with which i had started my walk left me and i found myself alert and full of schemes  why should i feebly withdraw from the struggle why should i give in to smooth sam in this tame way the memory of that wink came back to me with a tonic effect i would show him that i was still a factor in the game if the house was closed to me was there not the feathers i could lie in hiding there and observe his movements unseen  i stopped on reaching the inn and was on the point of entering and taking up my position at once when it occurred to me that this would be a false move it was possible that sam would not take my departure for granted so readily as i assumed it was sams way to do a thing thoroughly and the probability was that if he did not actually come to see me off he would at least make inquiries at the station to find out if i had gone i walked on  he was not at the station nor did he arrive in the cart with my trunk but i was resolved to risk nothing i bought a ticket for london and boarded the london train it had been my intention to leave it at guildford and catch an afternoon train back to stanstead but it seemed to me on reflection that this was unnecessary there was no likelihood of sam making any move in the matter of the nugget until the following day i could take my time about returning  i spent the night in london and arrived at sanstead by an early morning train with a suitcase containing among other things a browning pistol i was a little ashamed of this purchase to the buck macginnis type of man i suppose a pistol is as commonplace a possession as a pair of shoes but i blushed as i entered the gunshop if it had been buck with whom i was about to deal i should have felt less selfconscious but there was something about sam which made pistols ridiculous  my first act after engaging a room at the inn and leaving my suitcase was to walk to the school before doing anything else i felt i must see audrey and tell her the facts in the case of smooth sam if she were on her guard my assistance might not be needed but her present state of trust in him was fatal  a school when the boys are away is a lonely place the deserted air of the grounds as i slipped cautiously through the trees was almost eerie a stillness brooded over everything as if the place had been laid under a spell never before had i been so impressed with the isolation of sanstead house anything might happen in this lonely spot and the world would go on its way in ignorance it was with quite distinct relief that as i drew nearer the house i caught sight of the wire of the telephone among the trees above my head it had a practical comforting look  a tradesmans cart rattled up the drive and disappeared round the side of the house this reminder also of the outside world was pleasant but i could not rid myself of the feeling that the atmosphere of the place was sinister i attributed it to the fact that i was a spy in an enemys country i had to see without being seen i did not imagine that johnson grocer who had just passed in his cart found anything wrong with the atmosphere it was created for me by my own furtive attitude  of audrey and ogden there were no signs that they were out somewhere in the grounds this mellow spring morning i took for granted but i could not make an extended search already i had come nearer to the house than was prudent  my eye caught the telephone wire again and an idea came to me i would call her up from the inn and ask her to meet me there was the risk that the call would be answered by smooth sam but it was not great sam unless he had thrown off his role of butler completelywhich would be unlike the artist that he waswould be in the housekeepers room and the ringing of the telephone which was in the study would not penetrate to him  i chose a moment when dinner was likely to be over and audrey might be expected to be in the drawingroom  i had deduced her movements correctly it was her voice that answered the call  this is peter burns speaking  there was a perceptible pause before she replied when she did her voice was cold  yes  i want to speak to you on a matter of urgent importance  well  i cant do it through the telephone will you meet me in half an hours time at the gate  where are you speaking from  the feathers i am staying there  i thought you were in london  i came back will you meet me  she hesitated  why  because i have something important to say to youimportant to you  there was another pause  very well  in half an hour then is ogden ford in bed  yes  is his door locked  no  then lock it and bring the key with you  why  i will tell you when we meet  i will bring it  thank you goodbye  i hung up the receiver and set out at once for the school  she was waiting in the road a small indistinct figure in the darkness  is that youpeter  her voice had hesitated at the name as if at some obstacle it was a trivial thing but in my present mood it stung me  im afraid im late i wont keep you long shall we walk down the road you may not have been followed but it is as well to be on the safe side  followed i dont understand  we walked a few paces and halted  who would follow me  a very eminent person of the name of smooth sam fisher  smooth sam fisher  better known to you as white  i dont understand  i should be surprised if you did i asked you to meet me here so that i could make you understand the man who poses as a pinkertons detective and is staying in the house to help you take care of ogden ford is smooth sam fisher a professional kidnapper  butbut  but what proof have i was that what you were going to say none but i had the information from the man himself he told me in the train that night going to london  she spoke quickly i knew from her tone that she thought she had detected a flaw in my story  why did he tell you  because he needed me as an accomplice he wanted my help it was i who got ogden away that day sam overheard me giving money and directions to him telling him how to get away from the school and where to go and he gatheredcorrectlythat i was in the same line of business as himself he suggested a partnership which i was unable to accept  why  our objects were different my motive in kidnapping ogden was not to extract a ransom  she blazed out at me in an absolutely unexpected manner till now she had listened so calmly and asked her questions with such a notable absence of emotion that the outburst overwhelmed me  oh i know what your motive was there is no need to explain that isnt there any depth to which a man who thinks himself in love wont stoop i suppose you told yourself you were doing something noble and chivalrous a woman of her sort can trick a man into whatever meanness she pleases and just because she asks him he thinks himself a kind of knighterrant i suppose she told you that he had illtreated her and didnt appreciate her higher self and all that sort of thing she looked at you with those big brown eyes of hersi can see herand drooped and cried till you were ready to do anything she asked you  whom do you mean  mrs ford of course the woman who sent you here to steal ogden the woman who wrote you that letter  she did not write that letter but never mind that the reason why i wanted you to come here was to warn you against sam fisher that was all if there is any way in which i can help you send for me if you like i will come and stay at the house till mr abney returns  before the words were out of my mouth i saw that i had made a mistake the balance of her mind was poised between suspicion and belief and my offer turned the scale  no thank you she said curtly  you dont trust me  why should i white may or may not be sam fisher i shall be on my guard and i thank you for telling me but why should i trust you it all hangs together you told me you were engaged to be married you come here on an errand which no man would undertake except for a woman and a woman with whom he was very much in love there is that letter imploring you to steal the boy i know what a man will do for a woman he is fond of why should i trust you  there is this you forget that i had the opportunity to steal ogden if i had wanted to i had got him away to london but i brought him back i did it because you had told me what it meant to you  she hesitated but only for an instant suspicion was too strong for her  i dont believe you you brought him back because this man whom you call fisher got to know of your plans why should you have done it because of me why should you have put my interests before mrs fords i am nothing to you  for a moment a mad impulse seized me to cast away all restraint to pour out the unspoken words that danced like imps in my brain to make her understand whatever the cost my feelings towards her but the thought of my letter to cynthia checked me that letter had been the irrevocable step if i was to preserve a shred of selfrespect i must be silent  very well i said good night and i turned to go  peter  there was something in her voice which whirled me round thrilling despite my resolution  are you going  weakness would now be my undoing i steadied myself and answered abruptly  i have said all i came to say good night  i turned once more and walked quickly off towards the village i came near to running i was in the mood when flight alone can save a man she did not speak again and soon i was out of danger hurrying on through the friendly darkness beyond the reach of her voice  the bright light from the doorway of the feathers was the only illumination that relieved the blackness of the market square as i approached a man came out and stopped in the entrance to light a cigar his back was turned towards me as he crouched to protect the match from the breeze but something in his appearance seemed familiar  i had only a glimpse of him as he straightened himself and walked out of the pool of light into the square but it was enough  it was my muchenduring acquaintance mr buck macginnis     chapter 14   i  at the receipt of custom behind the bar sat miss benjafield stately as ever relaxing her massive mind over a penny novelette  who was the man who just left miss benjafield i asked  she marked the place with a shapely thumb and looked up  the man oh him heswhy werent you in here mr burns one evening in january when  that american  thats him what hes doing here i dont know he disappeared quite a while back and i havent seen him since nor want tonight up he turns again like a bad hapenny id like to know what hes after no good if you ask me  miss benjafields prejudices did not easily dissolve she prided herself as she frequently observed on knowing her own mind  is he staying here  not at the feathers were particular who we have here  i thanked her for the implied compliment ordered beer for the good of the house and lighting a pipe sat down to meditate on this new development  the vultures were gathered together with a vengeance sam within buck without it was quite like old times with the difference that now i too was on the wrong side of the school door  it was not hard to account for bucks reappearance he would of course have made it his business to get early information of mr fords movements it would be easy for him to discover that the millionaire had been called away to the north and that the nugget was still an inmate of sanstead house and here he was preparing for the grand attack  i had been premature in removing bucks name from the list of active combatants broken legs mend i ought to have remembered that  his presence on the scene made i perceived a vast difference to my plan of campaign it was at this point that my purchase of the browning pistol lost its absurdity and appeared in the light of an acute strategic move with sam the only menace i had been prepared to play a purely waiting game watching proceedings from afar ready to give my help if necessary to check buck more strenuous methods were called for  my mind was made up with buck that stout disciple of the frontal attack in the field there was only one place for me i must get into sanstead house and stay there on guard  did he intend to make an offensive movement tonight that was the question which occupied my mind from the point of view of an opponent there was this merit about mr macginnis that he was not subtle he could be counted on with fair certainty to do the direct thing sooner or later he would make another of his vigorous frontal attacks upon the stronghold the only point to be decided was whether he would make it that night would professional zeal cause him to omit his beauty sleep  i did not relish the idea of spending the night patrolling the grounds but it was imperative that the house be protected then it occurred to me that the man for the vigil was smooth sam if the arrival of mr macginnis had complicated matters in one way it had simplified them in another for there was no more need for the secrecy which had been till now the basis of my plan of action bucks arrival made it possible for me to come out and fight in the open instead of brooding over sanstead house from afar like a providence tomorrow i proposed to turn sam out tonight i would use him the thing had resolved itself into a triangular tournament and sam and buck should play the first game  once more i called up the house on the telephone there was a long delay before a reply came it was mr fishers voice that spoke audrey apparently had not returned to the house immediately after leaving me  hullo said sam  good evening mr fisher  gee is that you young fellowmelad are you speaking from london  no i am at the feathers  he chuckled richly  cant tear yourself away hat still in the ring say whats the use why not turn it up sonny youre only wasting your time  do you sleep lightly mr fisher  i dont get you  you had better do so tonight buck macginnis is back again  there was silence at the other end of the wire then i heard him swear softly the significance of the information had not been lost on mr fisher  is that straight  it is  youre not stringing me  certainly not  youre sure it was buck  is bucks the sort of face one forgets  he swore again  you seem disturbed i said  where did you see him asked sam  coming out of the feathers looking very fierce and determined the berserk blood of the macginnises is up hes going to do or die im afraid this means an allnight sitting for you mr fisher  i thought you had put him out of business  there was a somewhat querulous note in his voice  only temporarily i did my best but he wasnt even limping when i saw him  he did not speak for a moment i gathered that he was pondering over the new development  thanks for tipping me off sonny its a thing worth knowing why did you do it  because i love you samuel good night  i rose late and breakfasted at my leisure the peace of the english country inn enveloped me as i tilted back my chair and smoked the first pipe of the morning it was a day to hearten a man for great deeds one of those days of premature summer which comes sometimes to help us bear the chill winds of early spring the sun streamed in through the open window in the yard below fowls made their soothing music the thought of violence seemed very alien to such a morning  i strolled out into the square i was in no hurry to end this interlude of peace and embark on what for all practical purposes would be a siege  after lunch i decided would be time enough to begin active campaigning  the clock on the church tower was striking two as i set forth carrying my suitcase on my way to the school the lightheartedness of the morning still lingered with me i was amused at the thought of the surprise i was about to give mr fisher that wink still rankled  as i made my way through the grounds i saw audrey in the distance walking with the nugget i avoided them and went on into the house  about the house there was the same air of enchanted quiet which pervaded the grounds perhaps the stillness indoors was even more insistent i had grown so accustomed to the neverending noise and bustle of the boys quarters that as i crossed the silent hall i had an almost guilty sense of intrusion i felt like a burglar  sam the object of my visit would i imagined if he were in the house at all be in the housekeepers room a cosy little apartment off the passage leading to the kitchen i decided to draw that first and was rewarded on pushing open the halfclosed door by the sight of a pair of blacktrousered legs stretched out before me from the depths of a wickerwork armchair his portly middle section rising beyond like a small hill heaved rhythmically his face was covered with a silk handkerchief from beneath which came in even succession faint and comfortable snores it was a peaceful picturethe good man taking his rest and for me it had an added attractiveness in that it suggested that sam was doing by day what my information had prevented him from doing in the night it had been some small consolation to me as i lay trying to compose my anxious mind for sleep on the previous night that mr fisher also was keeping his vigil  pleasing as sam was as a study in still life pressure of business compelled me to stir him into activity i prodded him gently in the centre of the rising territory beyond the black trousers he grunted discontentedly and sat up the handkerchief fell from his face and he blinked at me first with the dazed glassiness of the newly awakened then with a souls awakening expression which spread over his face until it melted into a friendly smile  hello young man  good afternoon you seem tired  he yawned cavernously  lord what a night  did buck drop in  no but i thought he had every time i heard a board creak i didnt dare close my eyes for a minute have you ever stayed awake all night waiting for the goblins that get you if you dont watch out well take it from me its no picnic  his face split in another mammoth yawn he threw his heart into it as if life held no other tasks for him only in alligators have i ever seen its equal  i waited till the seismic upheaval had spent itself then i came to business  im sorry you had a disturbed night mr fisher you must make up for it this afternoon you will find the beds very comfortable  hows that  at the feathers i should go there if i were you the charges are quite reasonable and the food is good you will like the feathers  i dont get you sonny  i was trying to break it gently to you that you are about to move from this house now at once take your last glimpse of the old home sam and out into the hard world  he looked at me inquiringly  you seem to be talking young man words appear to be fluttering from you but your meaning if any escapes me  my meaning is that i am about to turn you out i am coming back here and there is not room for both of us so if you do not see your way to going quietly i shall take you by the back of the neck and run you out do i make myself fairly clear now  he permitted himself a rich chuckle  you have gall young man well i hate to seem unfriendly i like you sonny you amuse mebut there are moments when one wants to be alone i have a whole heap of arrears of sleep to make up trot along kiddo and quit disturbing uncle tie a string to yourself and disappear byebye  the wickerwork creaked as he settled his stout body he picked up the handkerchief  mr fisher i said i have no wish to propel your grey hairs at a rapid run down the drive so i will explain further i am physically stronger than you i mean to turn you out how can you prevent it mr abney is away you cant appeal to him the police are at the end of the telephone but you cant appeal to them so what can you do except go do you get me now  he regarded the situation in thoughtful silence he allowed no emotion to find expression in his face but i knew that the significance of my remarks had sunk in i could almost follow his mind as he tested my position point by point and found it impregnable  when he spoke it was to accept defeat jauntily  you are my jinx young man i said it all along youre really set on my going say no more ill go after all its quiet at the inn and what more does a man want at my time of life  i went out into the garden to interview audrey  she was walking up and down on the tennislawn the nugget lounging in a deckchair appeared to be asleep  she caught sight of me as i came out from the belt of trees and stopped i had the trying experience of walking across open country under hostile observation  the routing of sam had left me alert and selfconfident i felt no embarrassment i greeted her briskly  good afternoon i have been talking to sam fisher if you wait you will see him passing away down the drive he is leaving the house i am coming back  coming back  she spoke incredulously or rather as if my words had conveyed no meaning it was so that sam had spoken her mind like his took time to adjust itself to the unexpected  she seemed to awake to my meaning with a start  coming back her eyes widened the flush deepened on her cheeks but i told you  i know what you told me you said you did not trust me it doesnt matter i am coming back whether you trust me or not this house is under martial law and i am in command the situation has changed since i spoke to you last night last night i was ready to let you have your way i intended to keep an eye on things from the inn but its different now it is not a case of sam fisher any longer you could have managed sam its buck macginnis now the man who came that night in the automobile i saw him in the village after i left you hes dangerous  she looked away past me in the direction of the drive i followed her gaze a stout figure carrying a suitcase was moving slowly down it  i smiled her eyes met mine and i saw the anger that had been lying at the back of them flash out her chin went up with the old defiant tilt i was sorry i had smiled it was my old fault the complacency that would not be hidden  i dont believe you she cried i dont trust you  it is curious how ones motive for embarking on a course of conduct changes or disappears altogether as the action develops once started on an enterprise it is as if one proceeded with it automatically irrespective of ones original motives i had begun what i might call the second phase of this matter of the little nugget the abandoning of cynthias cause in favour of audreys with a clear idea of why i was doing it i had set myself to resist the various forces which were trying to take ogden from audrey for one simple reason because i loved audrey and wished to help her that motive if it still existed at all did so only in the form of abstract chivalry my personal feelings towards her seemed to have undergone a complete change dating from our parting in the road the night before i found myself now meeting hostility with hostility i looked at her critically and told myself that her spell was broken at last that if she disliked me i was at least indifferent to her  and yet despite my altered feelings my determination to help her never wavered the guarding of ogden might beprimarilyno business of mine but i had adopted it as my business  i dont ask you to trust me i said we have settled all that theres no need to go over old ground think what you please about this ive made up my mind  if you mean to stay i suppose i cant prevent you  exactly  sam appeared again in a gap in the trees walking slowly and pensively as one retreating from his moscow her eyes followed him till he was out of sight  if you like i said bitterly you may put what i am doing down to professional rivalry if i am in love with mrs ford and am here to steal ogden for her it is natural for me to do all i can to prevent buck macginnis getting him there is no need for you to look on me as an ally because we are working together  we are not working together  we shall be in a very short time buck will not let another night go by without doing something  i dont believe that you saw him  just as you please i said and walked away what did it matter to me what she believed  the day dragged on towards evening the weather broke suddenly after the fashion of spring in england showers of rain drove me to the study  it must have been nearly ten oclock when the telephone rang  it was mr fisher  hello is that you sonny  it is do you want anything  i want a talk with you business can i come up  if you wish it  ill start right away  it was some fifteen minutes later that i heard in the distance the engines of an automobile the headlights gleamed through the trees and presently the car swept round the bend of the drive and drew up at the front door a portly figure got down and rang the bell i observed these things from a window on the first floor overlooking the front steps and it was from this window that i spoke  is that you mr fisher  he backed away from the door  where are you  is that your car  it belongs to a friend of mine  i didnt know you meant to bring a party  theres only three of us me the chauffeur and my friendmacginnis  the possibility indeed the probability of sam seeking out buck and forming an alliance had occurred to me and i was prepared for it i shifted my grip on the automatic pistol in my hand  mr fisher  hello  ask your friend macginnis to be good enough to step into the light of that lamp and drop his gun  there was a muttered conversation i heard bucks voice rumbling like a train going under a bridge the request did not appear to find favour with him then came an interlude of soothing speech from mr fisher i could not distinguish the words but i gathered that he was pointing out to him that on this occasion only the visit being for the purposes of parley and not of attack pistols might be looked on as nonessentials whatever his arguments they were successful for finally humped as to the back and muttering buck moved into the light  good evening mr macginnis i said im glad to see your leg is all right again i wont detain you a moment just feel in your pockets and shed a few of your guns and then you can come in out of the rain to prevent any misunderstanding i may say i have a gun of my own it is trained on you now  i aint got no gun  come along this is no time for airy persiflage out with them  a moments hesitation and a small black pistol fell to the ground  no more  think im a regiment  i dont know what you are well ill take your word for it you will come in one by one with your hands up  i went down and opened the door holding my pistol in readiness against the unexpected   ii  sam came first his raised hands gave him a vaguely pontifical air bishop blessing pilgrims and the kindly smile he wore heightened the illusion mr macginnis who followed suggested no such idea he was muttering moodily to himself and he eyed me askance  i showed them into the classroom and switched on the light the air was full of many odours disuse seems to bring out the inkychalky appleydealboardy bouquet of a classroom as the night brings out the scent of flowers during the term i had never known this classroom smell so exactly like a classroom i made use of my free hand to secure and light a cigarette  sam rose to a point of order  young man he said i should like to remind you that we are here as it were under a flag of truce to pull a gun on us and keep us holding our hands up this way is raw work i feel sure i speak for my friend mr macginnis  he cocked an eye at his friend mr macginnis who seconded the motion by expectorating into the fireplace i had observed at a previous interview his peculiar gift for laying bare his soul by this means of mode of expression a man of silent habit judged by the more conventional standard of words he was almost an orator in expectoration  mr macginnis agrees with me said sam cheerfully do we take them down have we your permission to assume position two of these swedish exercises all we came for was a little friendly chat among gentlemen and we can talk just as wellspeaking for myself betterin a less strained attitude a little rest mr burns a little folding of the hands thank you  he did not wait for permission nor was it necessary sam and the melodramatic atmosphere was as oil and water it was impossible to blend them i laid the pistol on the table and sat down buck after one wistful glance at the weapon did the same sam was already seated and was looking so cosy and at home that i almost felt it remiss of me not to have provided sherry and cake for this pleasant gathering  well i said what can i do for you  let me explain said sam as you have no doubt gathered mr macginnis and i have gone into partnership the little nugget combine  i gathered thatwell  judicious partnerships are the soul of business mr macginnis and i have been rivals in the past but we both saw that the moment had come for the genial smile the hearty handshake in fact for an alliance we form a strong team sonny my partners speciality is action i supply the strategy say cant you see youre up against it why be foolish  you think youre certain to win  its a cinch  then why trouble to come here and see me  i appeared to have put into words the smouldering thought which was vexing mr macginnis he burst into speech  ahr chee sure whats de use didnt i tell youse whats de use of wastin time what are we spielin away here for lets get busy  sam waved a hand towards him with the air of a lecturer making a point  you see the man of action he likes trouble he asks for it he eats it alive now i prefer peace why have a fuss when you can get what you want quietly thats my motto thats why weve come its the old proposition were here to buy you out yes i know you have turned the offer down before but things have changed your stock has fallen in fact instead of letting you in on sharing terms we only feel justified now in offering a commission for the moment you may seem to hold a strong position you are in the house and youve got the boy but theres nothing to it really we could get him in five minutes if we cared to risk having a fuss but it seems to me theres no need of any fuss we should win dead easy all right if it came to trouble but on the other hand youve a gun and theres a chance some of us might get hurt so whats the good when we can settle it quietly how about it sonny  mr macginnis began to rumble preparatory to making further remarks on the situation but sam waved him down and turned his brown eyes inquiringly on me  fifteen per cent is our offer he said  and to think it was once fiftyfifty  strict business  business its sweating  its our limit and it wasnt easy to make buck here agree to that he kicked like a mule  buck shuffled his feet and eyed me disagreeably i suppose it is hard to think kindly of a man who has broken your leg it was plain that with mr macginnis bygones were by no means bygones  i rose  well im sorry you should have had the trouble of coming here for nothing let me see you out single file please  sam looked aggrieved  you turn it down  i do  one moment lets have this thing clear do you realize what youre up against dont think its only buck and me youve got to tackle all the boys are here waiting round the corner the same gang that came the other night be sensible sonny you dont stand a dogs chance i shouldnt like to see you get hurt and you never know what may not happen the boys are pretty sore at you because of what you did that night i shouldnt act like a bonehead sonnyhonest  there was a kindly ring in his voice which rather touched me between him and me there had sprung up an odd sort of friendship he meant business but he would i knew be genuinely sorry if i came to harm and i could see that he was quite sincere in his belief that i was in a tight corner and that my chances against the combine were infinitesimal i imagine that with victory so apparently certain he had had difficulty in persuading his allies to allow him to make his offer  but he had overlooked one thingthe telephone that he should have made this mistake surprised me if it had been buck i could have understood it bucks was a mind which lent itself to such blunders from sam i had expected better things especially as the telephone had been so much in evidence of late he had used it himself only half an hour ago  i clung to the thought of the telephone it gave me the quiet satisfaction of the gambler who holds the unforeseen ace the situation was in my hands the police i knew had been profoundly stirred by mr macginniss previous raid when i called them up as i proposed to do directly the door had closed on the ambassadors there would be no lack of response it would not again be a case of inspector bones and constable johnson to the rescue a great cloud of willing helpers would swoop to our help  with these thoughts in my mind i answered sam pleasantly but firmly  im sorry im unpopular but all the same  i indicated the door  emotion that could only be expressed in words and not through his usual medium welled up in mr macginnis he sprang forward with a snarl falling back as my faithful automatic caught his eye  say you listen here youll  sam the peaceable plucked at his elbow  nothing doing buck step lively  buck wavered then allowed himself to be drawn away we passed out of the classroom in our order of entry  an exclamation from the stairs made me look up audrey was leaning over the banisters her face was in the shadow but i gathered from her voice that the sight of our little procession had startled her i was not surprised buck was a distinctly startling spectacle and his habit of growling to himself as he walked highly disturbing to strangers  good evening mrs sheridan said sam suavely  audrey did not speak she seemed fascinated by buck  i opened the front door and they passed out the automobile was still purring on the drive bucks pistol had disappeared i supposed the chauffeur had picked it up a surmise which was proved correct a few moments later when just as the car was moving off there was a sharp crack and a bullet struck the wall to the right of the door it was a random shot and i did not return it its effect on me was to send me into the hall with a leap that was almost a backsomersault somehow though i was keyed up for violence and the shooting of pistols i had not expected it at just that moment and i was disagreeably surprised at the shock it had given me i slammed the door and bolted it i was intensely irritated to find that my fingers were trembling  audrey had left the stairs and was standing beside me  they shot at me i said  by the light of the hall lamp i could see that she was very pale  it missed by a mile my nerves had not recovered and i spoke abruptly dont be frightened  ii was not frightened she said without conviction  i was i said with conviction it was too sudden for me its the sort of thing one wants to get used to gradually i shall be ready for it another time  i made for the stairs  where are you going  im going to call up the policestation  peter  yes  waswas that man the one you spoke of  yes that was buck macginnis he and sam have gone into partnership  she hesitated  im sorry she said  i was halfway up the stairs by this time i stopped and looked over the banisters  sorry  i didnt believe you this afternoon  oh thats all right i said i tried to make my voice indifferent for i was on guard against insidious friendliness i had bludgeoned my mind into an attitude of safe hostility towards her and i saw the old chaos ahead if i allowed myself to abandon it  i went to the telephone and unhooked the receiver  there is apt to be a certain leisureliness about the methods of country telephoneoperators and the fact that a voice did not immediately ask me what number i wanted did not at first disturb me suspicion of the truth came to me i think after my third shout into the receiver had remained unanswered i had suffered from delay before but never such delay as this  i must have remained there fully two minutes shouting at intervals before i realized the truth then i dropped the receiver and leaned limply against the wall for the moment i was as stunned as if i had received a blow i could not even think it was only by degrees that i recovered sufficiently to understand that audrey was speaking to me  what is it dont they answer  it is curious how the mind responds to the need for making an effort for the sake of somebody else if i had had only myself to think of it would i believe have been a considerable time before i could have adjusted my thoughts to grapple with this disaster but the necessity of conveying the truth quietly to audrey and of helping her to bear up under it steadied me at once i found myself thinking quite coolly how best i might break to her what had happened  im afraid i said i have something to tell you which may  she interrupted me quickly  what is it cant you make them answer  i shook my head we looked at each other in silence  her mind leaped to the truth more quickly than mine had done  they have cut the wire  i took up the receiver again and gave another call there was no reply  im afraid so i said     chapter 15   i  what shall we do said audrey  she looked at me hopefully as if i were a mine of ideas her voice was level without a suggestion of fear in it women have the gift of being courageous at times when they might legitimately give way it is part of their unexpectedness  this was certainly such an occasion daylight would bring us relief for i did not suppose that even buck macginnis would care to conduct a siege which might be interrupted by the arrival of tradesmens carts but while the darkness lasted we were completely cut off from the world with the destruction of the telephone wire our only link with civilization had been snapped even had the night been less stormy than it was there was no chance of the noise of our warfare reaching the ears of anyone who might come to the rescue it was as sam had said bucks energy united to his strategy formed a strong combination  broadly speaking there are only two courses open to a beleaguered garrison it can stay where it is or it can make a sortie i considered the second of these courses  it was possible that sam and his allies had departed in the automobile to get reinforcements leaving the coast temporarily clear in which case by escaping from the house at once we might be able to slip unobserved through the grounds and reach the village in safety to support this theory there was the fact that the car on its late visit had contained only the chauffeur and the two ambassadors while sam had spoken of the remainder of bucks gang as being in readiness to attack in the event of my not coming to terms that might mean that they were waiting at bucks headquarters wherever those might beat one of the cottages down the road i imagined and in the interval before the attack began it might be possible for us to make our sortie with success  is ogden in bed i asked  yes  will you go and get him up as quickly as you can  i strained my eyes at the window but it was impossible to see anything the rain was still falling heavily if the drive had been full of men they would have been invisible to me  presently audrey returned followed by ogden the little nugget was yawning the aggrieved yawns of one roused from his beauty sleep  whats all this he demanded  listen i said buck macginnis and smooth sam fisher have come after you they are outside now dont be frightened  he snorted derisively  whos frightened i guess they wont hurt me how do you know its them  they have just been here the man who called himself white the butler was really sam fisher he has been waiting an opportunity to get you all the term  white was he sam fisher he chuckled admiringly say hes a wonder  they have gone to fetch the rest of the gang  why dont you call the cops  they have cut the wire  his only emotions at the news seemed to be amusement and a renewed admiration for smooth sam he smiled broadly the little brute  hes a wonder he repeated i guess hes smooth all right hes the limit hell get me all right this trip i bet you a nickel he wins out  i found his attitude trying that he the cause of all the trouble should be so obviously regarding it as a sporting contest got up for his entertainment was hard to bear and the fact that whatever might happen to myself he was in no danger comforted me not at all if i could have felt that we were in any way companions in peril i might have looked on the bulbous boy with quite a friendly eye as it was i nearly kicked him  we had better waste no time suggested audrey if we are going  i think we ought to try it i said  whats that asked the nugget go where  we are going to steal out through the back way and try to slip through to the village  the nuggets comment on the scheme was brief and to the point he did not embarrass me with fulsome praise of my strategic genius  of all the fool games he said simply in this rain no sir  this new complication was too much for me in planning out my manoeuvres i had taken his cooperation for granted i had looked on him as so much baggagethe impedimenta of the retreating army and behold a mutineer  i took him by the scruff of the neck and shook him it was a relief to my feelings and a sound move the argument was one which he understood  oh all right he said anything you like come on but it sounds to me like darned foolishness  if nothing else had happened to spoil the success of that sortie the nuggets depressing attitude would have done so of all things it seems to me a forlorn hope should be undertaken with a certain enthusiasm and optimism if it is to have a chance of being successful ogden threw a gloom over the proceedings from the start he was cross and sleepy and he condemned the expedition unequivocally as we moved towards the back door he kept up a running stream of abusive comment i silenced him before cautiously unbolting the door but he had said enough to damp my spirits i do not know what effect it would have had on napoleons tactics if his armysay before austerlitzhad spoken of his manoeuvres as a fool game and of himself as a big chump but i doubt if it would have stimulated him  the back door of sanstead house opened on to a narrow yard paved with flagstones and shut in on all sides but one by walls to the left was the outhouse where the coal was stored a squat barnlike building to the right a wall that appeared to have been erected by the architect in an outburst of pure whimsicality it just stood there it served no purpose that i had ever been able to discover except to act as a cats clubhouse  tonight however i was thankful for this wall it formed an important piece of cover by keeping in its shelter it was possible to work round the angle of the coalshed enter the stableyard and by making a detour across the football field avoid the drive altogether and it was the drive in my opinion that might be looked on as the danger zone  the nuggets complaints which i had momentarily succeeded in checking burst out afresh as the rain swept in at the open door and lashed our faces certainly it was not an ideal night for a ramble the wind was blowing through the opening at the end of the yard with a compressed violence due to the confined space there was a suggestion in our position of the cave of the winds under niagara falls the verisimilitude of which was increased by the stream of water that poured down from the gutter above our heads the nugget found it unpleasant and said so shrilly  i pushed him out into the storm still protesting and we began to creep across the yard halfway to the first point of importance of our journey the corner of the coalshed i halted the expedition there was a sudden lull in the wind and i took advantage of it to listen  from somewhere beyond the wall apparently near the house sounded the muffled note of the automobile the siegeparty had returned  there was no time to be lost apparently the possibility of a sortie had not yet occurred to sam or he would hardly have left the back door unguarded but a general of his astuteness was certain to remedy the mistake soon and our freedom of action might be a thing of moments it behoved us to reach the stableyard as quickly as possible once there we should be practically through the enemys lines  administering a kick to the nugget who showed a disposition to linger and talk about the weather i moved on and we reached the corner of the coalshed in safety  we had now arrived at the really perilous stage in our journey having built his wall to a point level with the end of the coalshed the architect had apparently wearied of the thing and given it up for it ceased abruptly leaving us with a matter of half a dozen yards of open ground to cross with nothing to screen us from the watchers on the drive the flagstones moreover stopped at this point on the open space was loose gravel even if the darkness allowed us to make the crossing unseen there was the risk that we might be heard  it was a moment for a flash of inspiration and i was waiting for one when that happened which took the problem out of my hands from the interior of the shed on our left there came a sudden scrabbling of feet over loose coal and through the square opening in the wall designed for the peaceful purpose of taking in sacks climbed two men a pistol cracked from the drive came an answering shout we had been ambushed  i had misjudged sam he had not overlooked the possibility of a sortie  it is the accidents of life that turn the scale in a crisis the opening through which the men had leaped was scarcely a couple of yards behind the spot where we were standing if they had leaped fairly and kept their feet they would have been on us before we could have moved but fortune ordered it that zeal outrunning discretion the first of the two should catch his foot in the woodwork and fall on all fours while the second unable to check his spring alighted on top of him and judging from the stifled yell which followed must have kicked him in the face  in the moment of their downfall i was able to form a plan and execute it  the stables  i shouted the words to audrey in the act of snatching up the nugget and starting to run she understood she did not hesitate in the direction of the house for even the instant which might have undone us but was with me at once and we were across the open space and in the stableyard before the first of the men in the drive loomed up through the darkness half of the wooden doublegate of the yard was open and the other half served us as a shield they fired as they ranat random i think for it was too dark for them to have seen us clearlyand two bullets slapped against the gate a third struck the wall above our heads and ricocheted off into the night but before they could fire again we were in the stables the door slammed behind us and i had dumped the nugget on the floor and was shooting the heavy bolts into their places footsteps clattered over the flagstones and stopped outside some weighty body plunged against the door then there was silence the first round was over  the stables as is the case in most english countryhouses had been in its palmy days the glory of sanstead house in whatever other respect the british architect of that period may have fallen short he never scamped his work on the stables he built them strong and solid with walls fitted to repel the assaults of the weather and possibly those of men as well for the boones in their day had been mighty owners of racehorses at a time when men with money at stake did not stick at trifles and it was prudent to see to it that the spot where the favourite was housed had something of the nature of a fortress the walls were thick the door solid the windows barred with iron we could scarcely have found a better haven of refuge  under mr abneys rule the stables had lost their original character they had been divided into three compartments each separated by a stout wall one compartment became a gymnasium another the carpenters shop the third in which we were remained a stable though in these degenerate days no horse ever set foot inside it its only use being to provide a place for the oddjob man to clean shoes the mangers which had once held fodder were given over now to brushes and pots of polish in termtime bicycles were stored in the loosebox which had once echoed to the tramping of derby favourites  i groped about among the pots and brushes and found a candleend which i lit i was running a risk but it was necessary to inspect our ground i had never troubled really to examine this stable before and i wished to put myself in touch with its geography  i blew out the candle well content with what i had seen the only two windows were small high up and excellently barred even if the enemy fired through them there were half a dozen spots where we should be perfectly safe best of all in the event of the door being carried by assault we had a second line of defence in a loft a ladder against the back wall led to it by way of a trapdoor circumstances had certainly been kind to us in driving us to this apparently impregnable shelter  on concluding my inspection i became aware that the nugget was still occupied with his grievances i think the shots must have stimulated his nerve centres for he had abandoned the languid drawl with which in happier moments he was wont to comment on lifes happenings and was dealing with the situation with a staccato briskness  of all the darned fool layouts i ever struck this is the limit what do those idiots think theyre doing shooting us up that way it went within an inch of my head it might have killed me gee and im all wet im catching cold its all through your blamed foolishness bringing us out here why couldnt we stay in the house  we could not have kept them out of the house for five minutes i explained we can hold this place  who wants to hold it i dont what does it matter if they do get me i dont care ive a good mind to walk straight out through that door and let them rope me in it would serve dad right it would teach him not to send me away from home to any darned school again what did he want to do it for i was all right where i was i  a loud hammering on the door cut off his eloquence the intermission was over and the second round had begun  it was pitch dark in the stable now that i had blown out the candle and there is something about a combination of noise and darkness which tries the nerves if mine had remained steady i should have ignored the hammering from the sound it appeared to be made by some wooden instrumenta mallet from the carpenters shop i discovered laterand the door could be relied on to hold its own without my intervention for a novice to violence however to maintain a state of calm inaction is the most difficult feat of all i was irritated and worried by the noise and exaggerated its importance it seemed to me that it must be stopped at once  a moment before i had bruised my shins against an empty packingcase which had found its way with other lumber into the stable i groped for this swung it noiselessly into position beneath the window and standing on it looked out i found the catch of the window and opened it there was nothing to be seen but the sound of the hammering became more distinct and pushing an arm through the bars i emptied my pistol at a venture  as a practical move the action had flaws the shots cannot have gone anywhere near their vague target but as a demonstration it was a wonderful success the yard became suddenly full of dancing bullets they struck the flagstones bounded off chipped the bricks of the far wall ricocheted from those buzzed in all directions and generally behaved in a manner calculated to unman the stoutest hearted  the siegeparty did not stop to argue they stampeded as one man i could hear them clattering across the flagstones to every point of the compass in a few seconds silence prevailed broken only by the swish of the rain round two had been brief hardly worthy to be called a round at all and like round one it had ended wholly in our favour  i jumped down from my packingcase swelling with pride i had had no previous experience of this sort of thing yet here i was handling the affair like a veteran i considered that i had a right to feel triumphant i lit the candle again and beamed protectively upon the garrison  the nugget was sitting on the floor gaping feebly and awed for the moment into silence audrey in the far corner looked pale but composed her behaviour was perfect there was nothing for her to do and she was doing it with a quiet selfcontrol which won my admiration her manner seemed to me exactly suited to the exigencies of the situation with a supercompetent daredevil like myself in charge of affairs all she had to do was to wait and not get in the way  i didnt hit anybody i announced but they ran like rabbits they are all over hampshire  i laughed indulgently i could afford an attitude of tolerant amusement towards the enemy  will they come back  possibly and in that casei felt in my lefthand coatpocketi had better be getting ready i felt in my righthand coatpocket ready i repeated blankly a clammy coldness took possession of me my voice trailed off into nothingness for in neither pocket was there a single one of the shells with which i had fancied that i was abundantly provided in moments of excitement man is apt to make mistakes i had made mine when starting out on the sortie i had left all my ammunition in the house   ii  i should like to think that it was an unselfish desire to spare my companions anxiety that made me keep my discovery to myself but i am afraid that my reticence was due far more to the fact that i shrank from letting the nugget discover my imbecile carelessness even in times of peril one retains ones human weaknesses and i felt that i could not face his comments if he had permitted a certain note of querulousness to creep into his conversation already the imagination recoiled from the thought of the caustic depths he would reach now should i reveal the truth  i tried to make things better with cheery optimism  they wont come back i said stoutly and tried to believe it  the nugget as usual struck the jarring note  well then lets beat it he said i dont want to spend the night in this darned icehouse i tell you im catching cold my chests weak if youre so dead certain youve scared them away lets quit  i was not prepared to go as far as this  they may be somewhere near hiding  well what if they are i dont mind being kidnapped lets go  i think we ought to wait said audrey  of course i said it would be madness to go out now  oh pshaw said the little nugget and from this point onwards punctuated the proceedings with a hacking cough  i had never really believed that my demonstration had brought the siege to a definite end i anticipated that there would be some delay before the renewal of hostilities but i was too well acquainted with buck macginniss tenacity to imagine that he would abandon his task because a few random shots had spread momentary panic in his ranks he had all the night before him and sooner or later he would return  i had judged him correctly many minutes dragged wearily by without a sign from the enemy then listening at the window i heard footsteps crossing the yard and voices talking in cautious undertones the fight was on once more  a bright light streamed through the window flooding the opening and spreading in a wide circle on the ceiling it was not difficult to understand what had happened they had gone to the automobile and come back with one of the headlamps an astute move in which i seemed to see the finger of sam the dangerspot thus rendered harmless they renewed their attack on the door with a reckless vigour the mallet had been superseded by some heavier instrumentof iron this time i think it must have been the jack from the automobile it was a more formidable weapon altogether than the mallet and even our good oak door quivered under it  a splintering of wood decided me that the time had come to retreat to our second line of entrenchments how long the door would hold it was impossible to say but i doubted if it was more than a matter of minutes  relighting my candle which i had extinguished from motives of economy i caught audreys eye and jerked my head towards the ladder  you go first i whispered  the nugget watched her disappear through the trapdoor then turned to me with an air of resolution  if you think youre going to get me up there youve another guess coming im going to wait here till they get in and let them take me im about tired of this foolishness  it was no time for verbal argument i collected him a kicking handful bore him to the ladder and pushed him through the opening he uttered one of his devastating squeals the sound seemed to encourage the workers outside like a trumpetblast the blows on the door redoubled  i climbed the ladder and shut the trapdoor behind me  the air of the loft was close and musty and smelt of mildewed hay it was not the sort of spot which one would have selected of ones own free will to sit in for any length of time there was a rustling noise and a rat scurried across the rickety floor drawing a startled gasp from audrey and a disgusted oh piffle from the nugget whatever merits this final refuge might have as a stronghold it was beyond question a noisome place  the beating on the stabledoor was working up to a crescendo presently there came a crash that shook the floor on which we sat and sent our neighbours the rats scuttling to and fro in a perfect frenzy of perturbation the light of the automobile lamp poured in through the numerous holes and chinks which the passage of time had made in the old boards there was one large hole near the centre which produced a sort of searchlight effect and allowed us for the first time to see what manner of place it was in which we had entrenched ourselves the loft was high and spacious the roof must have been some seven feet above our heads i could stand upright without difficulty  in the proceedings beneath us there had come a lull the mystery of our disappearance had not baffled the enemy for long for almost immediately the rays of the lamp had shifted and begun to play on the trapdoor i heard somebody climb the ladder and the trapdoor creaked gently as a hand tested it i had taken up a position beside it ready if the bolt gave way to do what i could with the butt of my pistol my only weapon but the bolt though rusty was strong and the man dropped to the ground again since then except for occasional snatches of whispered conversation i had heard nothing  suddenly sams voice spoke  mr burns  i saw no advantage in remaining silent  well  havent you had enough of this youve given us a mighty good run for our money but you can see for yourself that youre through now id hate like anything for you to get hurt pass the kid down and well call it off  he paused  well he said why dont you answer  i did  did you i didnt hear you  i smiled  you mean to stick it out dont be foolish sonny the boys here are mad enough at you already whats the use of getting yourself in bad for nothing weve got you in a pocket i know all about that gun of yours young fellow i had a suspicion what had happened and ive been into the house and found the shells you forgot to take with you so if you were thinking of making a bluff in that direction forget it  the exposure had the effect i had anticipated  of all the chumps exclaimed the nugget caustically you ought to be in a home well i guess youll agree to end this foolishness now lets go down and get it over and have some peace im getting pneumonia  youre quite right mr fisher i said but dont forget i still have the pistol even if i havent the shells the first man who tries to come up here will have a headache tomorrow  i shouldnt bank on it sonny come along kiddo youre done be good and own it we cant wait much longer  youll have to try  bucks voice broke in on the discussion quite unintelligible except that it was obviously wrathful  oh well i heard sam say resignedly and then there was silence again below  i resumed my watch over the trapdoor encouraged this parleying i thought was an admission of failure on the part of the besiegers i did not credit sam with a real concern for my welfarethereby doing him an injustice i can see now that he spoke perfectly sincerely the position though i was unaware of it really was hopeless for the reason that like most positions it had a flank as well as a front in estimating the possibilities of attack i had figured assaults as coming only from below i had omitted from my calculations the fact that the loft had a roof  it was a scraping on the tiles above my head that first brought the new dangerpoint to my notice there followed the sound of heavy hammering and with it came a sickening realization of the truth of what sam had said we were beaten  i was too paralysed by the unexpectedness of the attack to form any plan and indeed i do not think that there was anything that i could have done i was unarmed and helpless i stood there waiting for the inevitable  affairs moved swiftly plaster rained down on to the wooden floor i was vaguely aware that the nugget was speaking but i did not listen to him  a gap appeared in the roof and widened i could hear the heavy breathing of the man as he wrenched at the tiles  and then the climax arrived with anticlimax following so swiftly upon it that the two were almost simultaneous i saw the worker on the roof cautiously poise himself in the opening hunched up like some strange ape the next moment he had sprung  as his feet touched the floor there came a rending splintering crash the air was filled with a choking dust and he was gone the old worn out boards had shaken under my tread they had given way in complete ruin beneath this sharp onslaught the rays of the lamp which had filtered in like pencils of light through crevices now shone in a great lake in the centre of the floor  in the stable below all was confusion everybody was speaking at once the hero of the late disaster was groaning horribly for which he certainly had good reason i did not know the extent of his injuries but a man does not do that sort of thing with impunity the next of the strange happenings of the night now occurred  i had not been giving the nugget a great deal of my attention for some time other and more urgent matters occupying me  his action at this juncture consequently came as a complete and crushing surprise  i was edging my way cautiously towards the jagged hole in the centre of the floor in the hope of seeing something of what was going on below when from close beside me his voice screamed its me ogden ford im coming and without further warning he ran to the hole swung himself over and dropped  manna falling from the skies in the wilderness never received a more wholehearted welcome howls and cheers and earsplitting whoops filled the air the babel of talk broke out again some exuberant person found expression of his joy in emptying his pistol at the ceiling to my acute discomfort the spot he had selected as a target chancing to be within a foot of where i stood then they moved off in a body still cheering the fight was over  i do not know how long it was before i spoke it may have been some minutes i was dazed with the swiftness with which the final stages of the drama had been played out if i had given him more of my attention i might have divined that ogden had been waiting his opportunity to make some such move but as it was the possibility had not even occurred to me and i was stunned  in the distance i heard the automobile moving off down the drive the sound roused me  well we may as well go i said dully i lit the candle and held it up audrey was standing against the wall her face white and set  i raised the trapdoor and followed her down the ladder  the rain had ceased and the stars were shining after the closeness of the loft the clean wet air was delicious for a moment we stopped held by the peace and stillness of the night  then quite suddenly she broke down  it was the unexpectedness of it that first threw me off my balance in all the time i had known her i had never before seen audrey in tears always in the past she had borne the blows of fate with a stoical indifference which had alternately attracted and repelled me according as my mood led me to think it courage or insensibility in the old days it had done much this trait of hers to rear a barrier between us it had made her seem aloof and unapproachable subconsciously i suppose it had offended my egoism that she should be able to support herself in times of trouble and not feel it necessary to lean on me  and now the barrier had fallen the old independence the almost aggressive selfreliance had vanished a new audrey had revealed herself  she was sobbing helplessly standing quite still her arms hanging and her eyes staring blankly before her there was something in her attitude so hopeless so beaten that the pathos of it seemed to cut me like a knife  audrey  the stars glittered in the little pools among the worn flagstones the night was very still only the steady drip of water from the trees broke the silence  a great wave of tenderness seemed to sweep from my mind everything in the world but her everything broke abruptly that had been checking me stifling me holding me gagged and bound since the night when our lives had come together again after those five long years i forgot cynthia my promise everything  audrey  she was in my arms clinging to me murmuring my name the darkness was about us like a cloud  and then she had slipped from me and was gone     chapter 16   in my recollections of that strange night there are wide gaps trivial incidents come back to me with extraordinary vividness while there are hours of which i can remember nothing what i did or where i went i cannot recall it seems to me looking back that i walked without a pause till morning yet when day came i was still in the school grounds perhaps i walked as a wounded animal runs in circles i lost i know all count of time i became aware of the dawn as something that had happened suddenly as if light had succeeded darkness in a flash it had been night i looked about me and it was daya steely cheerless day like a december evening and i found that i was very cold very tired and very miserable  my mind was like the morning grey and overcast conscience may be expelled but like nature it will return mine which i had cast from me had crept back with the daylight i had had my hour of freedom and it was now for me to pay for it  i paid in full my thoughts tore me i could see no way out through the night the fever and exhilaration of that mad moment had sustained me but now the morning had come when dreams must yield to facts and i had to face the future  i sat on the stump of a tree and buried my face in my hands i must have fallen asleep for when i raised my eyes again the day was brighter its cheerlessness had gone the sky was blue and birds were singing  it must have been about half an hour later that the first beginnings of a plan of action came to me i could not trust myself to reason out my position clearly and honestly in this place where audreys spell was over everything the part of me that was struggling to be loyal to cynthia was overwhelmed here london called to me i could think there face my position quietly and make up my mind  i turned to walk to the station i could not guess even remotely what time it was the sun was shining through the trees but in the road outside the grounds there were no signs of workers beginning the day  it was half past five when i reached the station a sleepy porter informed me that there would be a train to london a slow train at six                                       i remained in london two days and on the third went down to sanstead to see audrey for the last time i had made my decision  i found her on the drive close by the gate she turned at my footstep on the gravel and as i saw her i knew that the fight which i had thought over was only beginning  i was shocked at her appearance her face was very pale and there were tired lines about her eyes  i could not speak something choked me once again as on that night in the stableyard the world and all that was in it seemed infinitely remote  it was she who broke the silence  well peter she said listlessly  we walked up the drive together  have you been to london  yes i came down this morning i paused i went there to think i said  she nodded  i have been thinking too  i stopped and began to hollow out a groove in the wet gravel with my heel words were not coming readily  suddenly she found speech she spoke quickly but her voice was dull and lifeless  let us forget what has happened peter we were neither of us ourselves i was tired and frightened and disappointed you were sorry for me just at the moment and your nerves were strained like mine it was all nothing let us forget it  i shook my head  no i said it was not that i cant let you even pretend you think that was all i love you i always have loved you though i did not know how much till you had gone away after a time i thought i had got over it but when i met you again down here i knew that i had not and never should i came back to say goodbye but i shall always love you it is my punishment for being the sort of man i was five years ago  and mine for being the sort of woman i was five years ago she laughed bitterly woman i was just a little fool a sulky child my punishment is going to be worse than yours peter you will not be always thinking that you had the happiness of two lives in your hands and threw it away because you had not the sense to hold it  it is just that that i shall always be thinking what happened five years ago was my fault audrey and nobodys but mine i dont think that even when the loss of you hurt most i ever blamed you for going away you had made me see myself as i was and i knew that you had done the right thing i was selfish patronizingi was insufferable it was i who threw away our happiness you put it in a sentence that first day here when you said that i had been kindsometimeswhen i happened to think of it that summed me up you have nothing to reproach yourself for i think we have not had the best of luck but all the blame is mine  a flush came into her pale face  i remember saying that i said it because i was afraid of myself i was shaken by meeting you again i thought you must be hating meyou had every reason to hate me and you spoke as if you didand i did not want to show you what you were to me it wasnt true peter five years ago i may have thought it but not now i have grown to understand the realities by this time i have been through too much to have any false ideas left i have had some chance to compare men and i realize that they are not all kind peter even sometimes when they happen to think of it  audrey i saidi had never found myself able to ask the question beforewaswashewas sheridan kind to you  she did not speak for a moment and i thought she was resenting the question  no she said abruptly  she shot out the monosyllable with a force that startled and silenced me there was a whole history of unhappiness in the word  no she said again after a pause more gently this time i understood she was speaking of a dead man  i cant talk about him she went on hurriedly i expect most of it was my fault i was unhappy because he was not you and he saw that i was unhappy and hated me for it we had nothing in common it was just a piece of sheer madness our marriage he swept me off my feet i never had a great deal of sense and i lost it all then i was far happier when he had left me  left you  he deserted me almost directly we reached america she laughed i told you i had grown to understand the realities i began then  i was horrified for the first time i realized vividly all that she had gone through when she had spoken to me before of her struggles that evening over the study fire i had supposed that they had begun only after her husbands death and that her life with him had in some measure trained her for the fight that she should have been pitched into the arena a mere child with no experience of life appalled me and as she spoke there came to me the knowledge that now i could never do what i had come to do i could not give her up she needed me i tried not to think of cynthia  i took her hand  audrey i said i came here to say goodbye i cant i want you nothing matters except you i wont give you up  its too late she said with a little catch in her voice you are engaged to mrs ford  i am engaged but not to mrs ford i am engaged to someone you have never metcynthia drassilis  she pulled her hand away quickly wideeyed and for some moments was silent  do you love her she asked at last  no  does she love you  cynthias letter rose before my eyes that letter that could have had no meaning but one  i am afraid she does i said  she looked at me steadily her face was very pale  you must marry her peter  i shook my head  you must she believes in you  i cant i want you and you need me can you deny that you need me  no  she said it quite simply without emotion i moved towards her thrilling but she stepped back  she needs you too she said  a dull despair was creeping over me i was weighed down by a premonition of failure i had fought my conscience my sense of duty and honour and crushed them she was raising them up against me once more my selfcontrol broke down  audrey i cried for gods sake cant you see what youre doing we have been given a second chance our happiness is in your hands again and you are throwing it away why should we make ourselves wretched for the whole of our lives what does anything else matter except that we love each other why should we let anything stand in our way i wont give you up  she did not answer her eyes were fixed on the ground hope began to revive in me telling me that i had persuaded her but when she looked up it was with the same steady gaze and my heart sank again  peter she said i want to tell you something it will make you understand i think i havent been honest peter i have not fought fairly all these weeks ever since we met i have been trying to steal you its the only word i have tried every little miserable trick i could think of to steal you from the girl you had promised to marry and she wasnt here to fight for herself i didnt think of her i was wrapped up in my own selfishness and then after that night when you had gone away i thought it all out i had a sort of awakening i saw the part i had been playing even then i tried to persuade myself that i had done something rather fine i thought you see at that time that you were infatuated with mrs fordand i know mrs ford if she is capable of loving any man she loves mr ford though they are divorced i knew she would only make you unhappy i told myself i was saving you then you told me it was not mrs ford but this girl that altered everything dont you see that i cant let you give her up now you would despise me i shouldnt feel clean i should feel as if i had stabbed her in the back  i forced a laugh it rang hollow against the barrier that separated us in my heart i knew that this barrier was not to be laughed away  cant you see peter you must see  i certainly dont i think youre overstrained and that you have let your imagination run away with you i  she interrupted me  do you remember that evening in the study she asked abruptly we had been talking i had been telling you how i had lived during those five years  i remember  every word i spoke was spoken with an objectcalculated yes even the pauses i tried to make them tell too i knew you you see peter i knew you through and through because i loved you and i knew the effect those tales would have on you oh they were all true i was honest as far as that goes but they had the mean motive at the back of them i was playing on your feelings i knew how kind you were how you would pity me i set myself to create an image which would stay in your mind and kill the memory of the other girl the image of a poor illtreated little creature who should work through to your heart by way of your compassion i knew you peter i knew you and then i did a meaner thing still i pretended to stumble in the dark i meant you to catch me and hold me and you did and   her voice broke off  im glad i have told you she said it makes it a little better you understand now how i feel dont you  she held out her hand  goodbye  i am not going to give you up i said doggedly  goodbye she said again her voice was a whisper  i took her hand and began to draw her towards me  it is not goodbye there is no one else in the world but you and i am not going to give you up  peter she struggled feebly oh let me go  i drew her nearer  i wont let you go i said  but as i spoke there came the sound of automobile wheels on the gravel a large red car was coming up the drive i dropped audreys hand and she stepped back and was lost in the shrubbery the car slowed down and stopped beside me there were two women in the tonneau one who was dark and handsome i did not know the other was mrs drassilis     chapter 17   i was given no leisure for wondering how cynthias mother came to be in the grounds of sanstead house for her companion almost before the car had stopped jumped out and clutched me by the arm at the same time uttering this cryptic speech whatever he offers ill double  she fixed me as she spoke with a commanding eye she was a woman i gathered in that instant born to command there seemed at any rate no doubt in her mind that she could command me if i had been a black beetle she could not have looked at me with a more scornful superiority her eyes were very large and of a rich fiery brown colour and it was these that gave me my first suspicion of her identity as to the meaning of her words however i had no clue  bear that in mind she went on ill double it if its a million dollars  im afraid i dont understand i said finding speech  she clicked her tongue impatiently  theres no need to be so cautious and mysterious this lady is a friend of mine she knows all about it i asked her to come im mrs elmer ford i came here directly i got your letter i think youre the lowest sort of scoundrel that ever managed to keep out of gaol but that neednt make any difference just now were here to talk business mr fisher so we may as well begin  i was getting tired of being taken for smooth sam  i am not smooth sam fisher  i turned to the automobile will you identify me mrs drassilis  she was regarding me with wideopen eyes  what on earth are you doing down here i have been trying everywhere to find you but nobody  mrs ford interrupted her she gave me the impression of being a woman who wanted a good deal of the conversation and who did not care how she got it in a conversational sense she thugged mrs drassilis at this point or rather she swept over her like some tidal wave blotting her out  oh she said fixing her brown eyes less scornful now but still imperious on mine i must apologize i have made a mistake i took you for a low villain of the name of sam fisher i hope you will forgive me i was to have met him at this exact spot just about this time by appointment so seeing you here i mistook you for him  if i might have a word with you alone i said  mrs ford had a short way with people in matters concerning her own wishes she took their acquiescence for granted  drive on up to the house jarvis she said and mrs drassilis was whirled away round the curve of the drive before she knew what had happened to her  well  my name is burns i said  now i understand she said i know who you are now she paused and i was expecting her to fawn upon me for my gallant service in her cause when she resumed in quite a different strain  i cant think what you can have been about mr burns not to have been able to do what cynthia asked you surely in all these weeks and months and then after all to have let this fisher scoundrel steal him away from under your nose  she gave me a fleeting glance of unfathomable scorn and when i thought of all the sufferings i had gone through that term owing to her repulsive son and indirectly for her sake i felt that the time had come to speak out  may i describe the way in which i allowed your son to be stolen away from under my nose i said and in wellchosen words i sketched the outline of what had happened i did not omit to lay stress on the fact that the nuggets departure with the enemy was entirely voluntary  she heard me out in silence  that was too bad of oggie she said tolerantly when i had ceased dramatically on the climax of my tale  as a comment it seemed to me inadequate  oggie was always highspirited she went on no doubt you have noticed that  a little  he could be led but never driven with the best intentions no doubt you refused to allow him to leave the stables that night and return to the house and he resented the check and took the matter into his own hands she broke off and looked at her watch have you a watch what time is it only that i thought it must be later i arrived too soon i got a letter from this man fisher naming this spot and this hour for a meeting when we could discuss terms he said that he had written to mr ford appointing the same time she frowned i have no doubt he will come she said coldly  perhaps this is his car i said  a second automobile was whirring up the drive there was a shout as it came within sight of us and the chauffeur put on the brake a man sprang from the tonneau he jerked a word to the chauffeur and the car went on up the drive  he was a massively built man of middle age with powerful shoulders and a facewhen he had removed his motorgoggles very like any one of half a dozen of those roman emperors whose features have come down to us on coins and statues squarejawed cleanshaven and aggressive like his late wife who was now standing drawn up to her full height staring haughtily at him he had the air of one born to command i should imagine that the married life of these two must have been something more of a battle even than most married lives the clashing of those wills must have smacked of a collision between the immovable mass and the irresistible force  he met mrs fords stare with one equally militant then turned to me  ill give you double what she has offered you he said he paused and eyed me with loathing you damned scoundrel he added  custom ought to have rendered me immune to irritation but it had not i spoke my mind  one of these days mr ford i said i am going to publish a directory of the names and addresses of the people who have mistaken me for smooth sam fisher i am not sam fisher can you grasp that my name is peter burns and for the past term i have been a master at this school and i may say that judging from what i know of the little brute any one who kidnapped your son as long as two days ago will be so anxious by now to get rid of him that he will probably want to pay you for taking him back  my words almost had the effect of bringing this divorced couple together again they made common cause against me it was probably the first time in years that they had formed even a temporary alliance  how dare you talk like that said mrs ford oggie is a sweet boy in every respect  youre perfectly right nesta said mr ford he may want intelligent handling but hes a mighty fine boy i shall make inquiries and if this man has been illtreating ogden i shall complain to mr abney where the devil is this man fisher he broke off abruptly  on the spot said an affable voice the bushes behind me parted and smooth sam stepped out on to the gravel  i had recognized him by his voice i certainly should not have done so by his appearance he had taken the precaution of making up for this important meeting a white wig of indescribable respectability peeped out beneath his black hat his eyes twinkled from under two penthouses of white eyebrows a white moustache covered his mouth he was venerable to a degree  he nodded to me and bared his white head gallantly to mrs ford  no worse for our little outing mr burns i am glad to see mrs ford i must apologize for my apparent unpunctuality but i was not really behind time i have been waiting in the bushes i thought it just possible that you might have brought unwelcome members of the police force with you and i have been scouting as it were before making my advance i see however that all is well and we can come at once to business may i say before we begin that i overheard your recent conversation and that i entirely disagree with mr burns master ford is a charming boy already i feel like an elder brother to him i am loath to part with him  how much snapped mr ford youve got me how much do you want  ill give you double what he offers cried mrs ford  sam held up his hand his old pontifical manner intensified by the white wig  may i speak thank you this is a little embarrassing when i asked you both to meet me here it was not for the purpose of holding an auction i had a straightforward business proposition to make to you it will necessitate a certain amount of plain and somewhat personal speaking may i proceed thank you i will be as brief as possible  his eloquence appeared to have had a soothing effect on the two fords they remained silent  you must understand said sam that i am speaking as an expert i have been in the kidnapping business many years and i know what i am talking about and i tell you that the moment you two got your divorce you said goodbye to all peace and quiet bless yousams manner became fatherlyive seen it a hundred times couple get divorced and if theres a child what happens they start in playing battledoreandshuttlecock with him wife sneaks him from husband husband sneaks him back from wife after a while along comes a gentleman in my line of business a professional at the game and he puts one across on both the amateurs he takes advantage of the confusion slips in and gets away with the kid thats what has happened here and im going to show you the way to stop it another time now ill make you a proposition what you want to doi have never heard anything so soothing so suggestive of the old family friend healing an unfortunate breach as sams voice at this juncturewhat you want to do is to get together again right quick never mind the past let bygones be bygones kiss and be friends  a snort from mr ford checked him for a moment but he resumed  i guess there were faults on both sides get together and talk it over and when youve agreed to call the fight off and start fair again thats where i come in mr burns here will tell you if you ask him that im anxious to quit this business and marry and settle down well see here what you want to do is to give me a salarywe can talk figures later onto stay by you and watch over the kid dont snortim talking plain sense youd a sight better have me with you than against you set a thief to catch a thief what i dont know about the fine points of the game isnt worth knowing ill guarantee if you put me in charge to see that nobody comes within a hundred miles of the kid unless he has an ordertoview youll find i earn every penny of that salary  mr burns and i will now take a turn up the drive while you think it over  he linked his arm in mine and drew me away as we turned the corner of the drive i caught a glimpse over my shoulder of the little nuggets parents they were standing where we had left them as if sams eloquence had rooted them to the spot  well well well young man said sam eyeing me affectionately its pleasant to meet you again under happier conditions than last time you certainly have all the luck sonny or you would have been badly hurt that night i was getting scared how the thing would end bucks a plain roughneck and his gang are as bad as he is and they had got mighty sore at you mighty sore if they had grabbed you theres no knowing what might not have happened however alls well that ends well and this little game has surely had the happy ending i shall get that job sonny old man ford isnt a fool and it wont take him long when he gets to thinking it over to see that im right hell hire me  arent you rather reckoning without your partner i said where does buck macginnis come in on the deal  sam patted my shoulder paternally  he doesnt sonny he doesnt it was a shame to do itit was like taking candy from a kidbut business is business and i was reluctantly compelled to doublecross poor old buck i sneaked the nugget away from him next day its not worth talking about it was too easy bucks all right in a roughandtumble but when it comes to brains he gets left and so hell go on through life poor fellow i hate to think of it  he sighed bucks misfortunes seemed to move him deeply  i shouldnt be surprised if he gave up the profession after this he has had enough to discourage him i told you about what happened to him that night didnt i no i thought i did why buck was the guy who did the steve brodie through the roof and when we picked him up we found hed broken his leg again isnt that enough to jar a man i guess hell retire from the business after that he isnt intended for it  we were approaching the two automobiles now and looking back i saw mr and mrs ford walking up the drive sam followed my gaze and i heard him chuckle  its all right he said theyve fixed it up something in the way theyre walking tells me theyve fixed it up  mrs drassilis was still sitting in the red automobile looking piqued but resigned mrs ford addressed her  i shall have to leave you mrs drassilis she said tell jarvis to drive you wherever you want to go i am going with my husband to see my boy oggie  she stretched out a hand towards the millionaire he caught it in his and they stood there smiling foolishly at each other while sam almost purring brooded over them like a stout fairy queen the two chauffeurs looked on woodenly  mr ford released his wifes hand and turned to sam  fisher  sir  ive been considering your proposition theres a string tied to it  oh no sir i assure you  there is what guarantee have i that you wont doublecross me  sam smiled relieved  you forget that i told you i was about to be married sir my wife wont let me  mr ford waved his hand towards the automobile  jump in he said briefly and tell him where to drive to youre engaged     chapter 18   no manners said mrs drassilis none whatever i always said so  she spoke bitterly she was following the automobile with an offended eye as it moved down the drive  the car rounded the corner sam turned and waved a farewell mr and mrs ford seated close together in the tonneau did not even look round  mrs drassilis sniffed disgustedly  shes a friend of cynthias cynthia asked me to come down here with her to see you i came to oblige her and now without a word of apology she leaves me stranded she has no manners whatever  i offered no defence of the absent one the verdict more or less squared with my own opinion  is cynthia back in england i asked to change the subject  the yacht got back yesterday peter i have something of the utmost importance to speak to you about she glanced at jarvis the chauffeur leaning back in his seat with the air peculiar to chauffeurs in repose of being stuffed walk down the drive with me  i helped her out of the car and we set off in silence there was a suppressed excitement in my companions manner which interested me and something furtive which brought back all my old dislike of her i could not imagine what she could have to say to me that had brought her all these miles  how do you come to be down here she said when cynthia told me you were here i could hardly believe her why are you a master at this school i cannot understand it  what did you want to see me about i asked  she hesitated it was always an effort for her to be direct now apparently the effort was too great the next moment she had rambled off on some tortuous bypath of her own which though it presumably led in the end to her destination was evidently a long way round  i have known you for so many years now peter and i dont know of anybody whose character i admire more you are so generousquixotic in fact you are one of the few really unselfish men i have ever met you are always thinking of other people whatever it cost you i know you would not hesitate to give up anything if you felt that it was for someone elses happiness i do admire you so for it one meets so few young men nowadays who consider anybody except themselves  she paused either for breath or for fresh ideas and i took advantage of the lull in the rain of bouquets to repeat my question  what did you want to see me about i asked patiently  about cynthia she asked me to see you  oh  you got a letter from her  yes  last night when she came home she told me about it and showed me your answer it was a beautiful letter peter im sure i cried when i read it and cynthia did i feel certain of course to a girl of her character that letter was final she is so loyal dear child  i dont understand  as sam would have said she seemed to be speaking words appeared to be fluttering from her but her meaning was beyond me  once she has given her promise i am sure nothing would induce her to break it whatever her private feelings she is so loyal she has such character  would you mind being a little clearer i said sharply i really dont understand what it is you are trying to tell me what do you mean about loyalty and character i dont understand  she was not to be hustled from her bypath she had chosen her route and she meant to travel by it ignoring shortcuts  to cynthia as i say it was final she simply could not see that the matter was not irrevocably settled i thought it so fine of her but i am her mother and it was my duty not to give in and accept the situation as inevitable while there was anything i could do for her happiness i knew your chivalrous unselfish nature peter i could speak to you as cynthia could not i could appeal to your generosity in a way impossible of course for her i could put the whole facts of the case clearly before you  i snatched at the words  i wish you would what are they  she rambled off again  she has such a rigid sense of duty there is no arguing with her i told her that if you knew you would not dream of standing in her way you are so generous such a true friend that your only thought would be for her if her happiness depended on your releasing her from her promise you would not think of yourself so in the end i took matters into my own hands and came to see you i am truly sorry for you dear peter but to me cynthias happiness of course must come before everything you do understand dont you  gradually as she was speaking i had begun to grasp hesitatingly at her meaning hesitatingly because the first hint of it had stirred me to such a whirl of hope that i feared to risk the shock of finding that after all i had been mistaken if i were rightand surely she could mean nothing elsei was free free with honour but i could not live on hints i must hear this thing in words  hashas cynthia i stopped to steady my voice has cynthia found i stopped again i was finding it absurdly difficult to frame my sentence is there someone else i concluded with a rush  mrs drassilis patted my arm sympathetically  be brave peter  there is  yes  the trees the drive the turf the sky the birds the house the automobile and jarvis the stuffed chauffeur leaped together for an instant in one whirling dancing mass of which i was the centre and then out of the chaos as it separated itself once more into its component parts i heard my voice saying tell me  the world was itself again and i was listening quietly and with a mild interest which try as i would i could not make any stronger i had exhausted my emotion on the essential fact the details were an anticlimax  i liked him directly i saw him said mrs drassilis and of course as he was such a friend of yours we naturally  a friend of mine  i am speaking of lord mountry  mountry what about him light flooded in on my numbed brain you dont meanis it lord mountry  my manner must have misled her she stammered in her eagerness to dispel what she took to be my misapprehension  dont think that he acted in anything but the most honourable manner nothing could be farther from the truth he knew nothing of cynthias engagement to you she told him when he asked her to marry him and heas a matter of fact it was he who insisted on dear cynthia writing that letter to you  she stopped apparently staggered by this excursion into honesty  well  in fact he dictated it  oh  unfortunately it was quite the wrong sort of letter it was the very opposite of clear it can have given you no inkling of the real state of affairs  it certainly did not  he would not allow her to alter it in any way he is very obstinate at times like so many shy men and when your answer came you see things were worse than before  i suppose so  i could see last night how unhappy they both were and when cynthia suggested it i agreed at once to come to you and tell you everything  she looked at me anxiously from her point of view this was the climax the supreme moment she hesitated i seemed to see her marshalling her forces the telling sentences the persuasive adjectives rallying them together for the grand assault  but through the trees i caught a glimpse of audrey walking on the lawn and the assault was never made  i will write to cynthia tonight i said wishing her happiness  oh peter said mrs drassilis  dont mention it said i  doubts appeared to mar her perfect contentment  you are sure you can convince her  convince her  anderlord mountry he is so determined not to do anything erwhat he would call unsportsmanlike  perhaps i had better tell her i am going to marry some one else i suggested  i think that would be an excellent idea she said brightening visibly how clever of you to have thought of it  she permitted herself a truism  after all dear peter there are plenty of nice girls in the world you have only to look for them  youre perfectly right i said ill start at once  a gleam of white caught my eye through the trees by the lawn i moved towards it
