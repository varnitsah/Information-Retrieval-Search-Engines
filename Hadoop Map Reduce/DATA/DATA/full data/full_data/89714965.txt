89714965	tanglewood tales  by nathaniel hawthorne     the wayside introductory  a short time ago i was favored with a flying visit from my young friend eustace bright whom i had not before met with since quitting the breezy mountains of berkshire it being the winter vacation at his college eustace was allowing himself a little relaxation in the hope he told me of repairing the inroads which severe application to study had made upon his health and i was happy to conclude from the excellent physical condition in which i saw him that the remedy had already been attended with very desirable success he had now run up from boston by the noon train partly impelled by the friendly regard with which he is pleased to honor me and partly as i soon found on a matter of literary business  it delighted me to receive mr bright for the first time under a roof though a very humble one which i could really call my own nor did i fail as is the custom of landed proprietors all about the world to parade the poor fellow up and down over my half a dozen acres secretly rejoicing nevertheless that the disarray of the inclement season and particularly the six inches of snow then upon the ground prevented him from observing the ragged neglect of soil and shrubbery into which the place had lapsed it was idle however to imagine that an airy guest from monument mountain bald summit and old graylock shaggy with primeval forests could see anything to admire in my poor little hillside with its growth of frail and insecteaten locust trees eustace very frankly called the view from my hill top tame and so no doubt it was after rough broken rugged headlong berkshire and especially the northern parts of the county with which his college residence had made him familiar but to me there is a peculiar quiet charm in these broad meadows and gentle eminences they are better than mountains because they do not stamp and stereotype themselves into the brain and thus grow wearisome with the same strong impression repeated day after day a few summer weeks among mountains a lifetime among green meadows and placid slopes with outlines forever new because continually fading out of the memorysuch would be my sober choice  i doubt whether eustace did not internally pronounce the whole thing a bore until i led him to my predecessors little ruined rustic summer house midway on the hillside it is a mere skeleton of slender decaying tree trunks with neither walls nor a roof nothing but a tracery of branches and twigs which the next wintry blast will be very likely to scatter in fragments along the terrace it looks and is as evanescent as a dream and yet in its rustic network of boughs it has somehow enclosed a hint of spiritual beauty and has become a true emblem of the subtile and ethereal mind that planned it i made eustace bright sit down on a snow bank which had heaped itself over the mossy seat and gazing through the arched windows opposite he acknowledged that the scene at once grew picturesque  simple as it looks said he this little edifice seems to be the work of magic it is full of suggestiveness and in its way is as good as a cathedral ah it would be just the spot for one to sit in of a summer afternoon and tell the children some more of those wild stories from the classic myths  it would indeed answered i the summer house itself so airy and so broken is like one of those old tales imperfectly remembered and these living branches of the baldwin apple tree thrusting so rudely in are like your unwarrantable interpolations but by the by have you added any more legends to the series since the publication of the wonderbook  many more said eustace primrose periwinkle and the rest of them allow me no comfort of my life unless i tell them a story every day or two i have run away from home partly to escape the importunity of these little wretches but i have written out six of the new stories and have brought them for you to look over  are they as good as the first i inquired  better chosen and better handled replied eustace bright you will say so when you read them  possibly not i remarked i know from my own experience that an authors last work is always his best one in his own estimate until it quite loses the red heat of composition after that it falls into its true place quietly enough but let us adjourn to my study and examine these new stories it would hardly be doing yourself justice were you to bring me acquainted with them sitting here on this snow bank  so we descended the hill to my small old cottage and shut ourselves up in the southeastern room where the sunshine comes in warmly and brightly through the better half of a winters day eustace put his bundle of manuscript into my hands and i skimmed through it pretty rapidly trying to find out its merits and demerits by the touch of my fingers as a veteran storyteller ought to know how to do  it will be remembered that mr bright condescended to avail himself of my literary experience by constituting me editor of the wonderbook as he had no reason to complain of the reception of that erudite work by the public he was now disposed to retain me in a similar position with respect to the present volume which he entitled tanglewood tales not as eustace hinted that there was any real necessity for my services as introducer inasmuch as his own name had become established in some good degree of favor with the literary world but the connection with myself he was kind enough to say had been highly agreeable nor was he by any means desirous as most people are of kicking away the ladder that had perhaps helped him to reach his present elevation my young friend was willing in short that the fresh verdure of his growing reputation should spread over my straggling and halfnaked boughs even as i have sometimes thought of training a vine with its broad leafiness and purple fruitage over the wormeaten posts and rafters of the rustic summer house i was not insensible to the advantages of his proposal and gladly assured him of my acceptance  merely from the title of the stories i saw at once that the subjects were not less rich than those of the former volume nor did i at all doubt that mr brights audacity so far as that endowment might avail had enabled him to take full advantage of whatever capabilities they offered yet in spite of my experience of his free way of handling them i did not quite see i confess how he could have obviated all the difficulties in the way of rendering them presentable to children these old legends so brimming over with everything that is most abhorrent to our christianized moral sense some of them so hideous others so melancholy and miserable amid which the greek tragedians sought their themes and moulded them into the sternest forms of grief that ever the world saw was such material the stuff that childrens playthings should be made of how were they to be purified how was the blessed sunshine to be thrown into them  but eustace told me that these myths were the most singular things in the world and that he was invariably astonished whenever he began to relate one by the readiness with which it adapted itself to the childish purity of his auditors the objectionable characteristics seem to be a parasitical growth having no essential connection with the original fable they fall away and are thought of no more the instant he puts his imagination in sympathy with the innocent little circle whose wideopen eyes are fixed so eagerly upon him thus the stories not by any strained effort of the narrators but in harmony with their inherent germ transform themselves and reassume the shapes which they might be supposed to possess in the pure childhood of the world when the first poet or romancer told these marvellous legends such is eustace brights opinion it was still the golden age evil had never yet existed and sorrow misfortune crime were mere shadows which the mind fancifully created for itself as a shelter against too sunny realities or at most but prophetic dreams to which the dreamer himself did not yield a waking credence children are now the only representatives of the men and women of that happy era and therefore it is that we must raise the intellect and fancy to the level of childhood in order to recreate the original myths  i let the youthful author talk as much and as extravagantly as he pleased and was glad to see him commencing life with such confidence in himself and his performances a few years will do all that is necessary towards showing him the truth in both respects meanwhile it is but right to say he does really appear to have overcome the moral objections against these fables although at the expense of such liberties with their structure as must be left to plead their own excuse without any help from me indeed except that there was a necessity for itand that the inner life of the legends cannot be come at save by making them entirely ones own propertythere is no defense to be made  eustace informed me that he had told his stories to the children in various situationsin the woods on the shore of the lake in the dell of shadow brook in the playroom at tanglewood fireside and in a magnificent palace of snow with ice windows which he helped his little friends to build his auditors were even more delighted with the contents of the present volume than with the specimens which have already been given to the world the classically learned mr pringle too had listened to two or three of the tales and censured them even more bitterly than he did the three golden apples so that what with praise and what with criticism eustace bright thinks that there is good hope of at least as much success with the public as in the case of the wonderbook  i made all sorts of inquiries about the children not doubting that there would be great eagerness to hear of their welfare among some good little folks who have written to me to ask for another volume of myths they are all i am happy to say unless we except clover in excellent health and spirits primrose is now almost a young lady and eustace tells me is just as saucy as ever she pretends to consider herself quite beyond the age to be interested by such idle stories as these but for all that whenever a story is to be told primrose never fails to be one of the listeners and to make fun of it when finished periwinkle is very much grown and is expected to shut up her baby house and throw away her doll in a month or two more sweet fern has learned to read and write and has put on a jacket and pair of pantaloonsall of which improvements i am sorry for squash blossom blue eye plantain and buttercup have had the scarlet fever but came easily through it huckleberry milkweed and dandelion were attacked with the whooping cough but bore it bravely and kept out of doors whenever the sun shone cowslip during the autumn had either the measles or some eruption that looked very much like it but was hardly sick a day poor clover has been a good deal troubled with her second teeth which have made her meagre in aspect and rather fractious in temper nor even when she smiles is the matter much mended since it discloses a gap just within her lips almost as wide as the barn door but all this will pass over and it is predicted that she will turn out a very pretty girl  as for mr bright himself he is now in his senior year at williams college and has a prospect of graduating with some degree of honorable distinction at the next commencement in his oration for the bachelors degree he gives me to understand he will treat of the classical myths viewed in the aspect of baby stories and has a great mind to discuss the expediency of using up the whole of ancient history for the same purpose i do not know what he means to do with himself after leaving college but trust that by dabbling so early with the dangerous and seductive business of authorship he will not be tempted to become an author by profession if so i shall be very sorry for the little that i have had to do with the matter in encouraging these first beginnings  i wish there were any likelihood of my soon seeing primrose periwinkle dandelion sweet fern clover plantain huckleberry milkweed cowslip buttercup blue eye and squash blossom again but as i do not know when i shall revisit tanglewood and as eustace bright probably will not ask me to edit a third wonderbook the public of little folks must not expect to hear any more about those dear children from me heaven bless them and everybody else whether grown people or children     the minotaur  in the old city of troezene at the foot of a lofty mountain there lived a very long time ago a little boy named theseus his grandfather king pittheus was the sovereign of that country and was reckoned a very wise man so that theseus being brought up in the royal palace and being naturally a bright lad could hardly fail of profiting by the old kings instructions his mothers name was aethra as for his father the boy had never seen him but from his earliest remembrance aethra used to go with little theseus into a wood and sit down upon a mossgrown rock which was deeply sunken into the earth here she often talked with her son about his father and said that he was called aegeus and that he was a great king and ruled over attica and dwelt at athens which was as famous a city as any in the world theseus was very fond of hearing about king aegeus and often asked his good mother aethra why he did not come and live with them at troezene  ah my dear son answered aethra with a sigh a monarch has his people to take care of the men and women over whom he rules are in the place of children to him and he can seldom spare time to love his own children as other parents do your father will never be able to leave his kingdom for the sake of seeing his little boy  well but dear mother asked the boy why cannot i go to this famous city of athens and tell king aegeus that i am his son  that may happen by and by said aethra be patient and we shall see you are not yet big and strong enough to set out on such an errand  and how soon shall i be strong enough theseus persisted in inquiring  you are but a tiny boy as yet replied his mother see if you can lift this rock on which we are sitting  the little fellow had a great opinion of his own strength so grasping the rough protuberances of the rock he tugged and toiled amain and got himself quite out of breath without being able to stir the heavy stone it seemed to be rooted into the ground no wonder he could not move it for it would have taken all the force of a very strong man to lift it out of its earthy bed  his mother stood looking on with a sad kind of a smile on her lips and in her eyes to see the zealous and yet puny efforts of her little boy she could not help being sorrowful at finding him already so impatient to begin his adventures in the world  you see how it is my dear theseus said she you must possess far more strength than now before i can trust you to go to athens and tell king aegeus that you are his son but when you can lift this rock and show me what is hidden beneath it i promise you my permission to depart  often and often after this did theseus ask his mother whether it was yet time for him to go to athens and still his mother pointed to the rock and told him that for years to come he could not be strong enough to move it and again and again the rosychecked and curlyheaded boy would tug and strain at the huge mass of stone striving child as he was to do what a giant could hardly have done without taking both of his great hands to the task meanwhile the rock seemed to be sinking farther and farther into the ground the moss grew over it thicker and thicker until at last it looked almost like a soft green seat with only a few gray knobs of granite peeping out the overhanging trees also shed their brown leaves upon it as often as the autumn came and at its base grew ferns and wild flowers some of which crept quite over its surface to all appearance the rock was as firmly fastened as any other portion of the earths substance  but difficult as the matter looked theseus was now growing up to be such a vigorous youth that in his own opinion the time would quickly come when he might hope to get the upper hand of this ponderous lump of stone  mother i do believe it has started cried he after one of his attempts the earth around it is certainly a little cracked  no no child his mother hastily answered it is not possible you can have moved it such a boy as you still are  nor would she be convinced although theseus showed her the place where he fancied that the stem of a flower had been partly uprooted by the movement of the rock but aethra sighed and looked disquieted for no doubt she began to be conscious that her son was no longer a child and that in a little while hence she must send him forth among the perils and troubles of the world  it was not more than a year afterwards when they were again sitting on the mosscovered stone aethra had once more told him the oftrepeated story of his father and how gladly he would receive theseus at his stately palace and how he would present him to his courtiers and the people and tell them that here was the heir of his dominions the eyes of theseus glowed with enthusiasm and he would hardly sit still to hear his mother speak  dear mother aethra he exclaimed i never felt half so strong as now i am no longer a child nor a boy nor a mere youth i feel myself a man it is now time to make one earnest trial to remove the stone  ah my dearest theseus replied his mother not yet not yet  yes mother said he resolutely the time has come  then theseus bent himself in good earnest to the task and strained every sinew with manly strength and resolution he put his whole brave heart into the effort he wrestled with the big and sluggish stone as if it had been a living enemy he heaved he lifted he resolved now to succeed or else to perish there and let the rock be his monument forever aethra stood gazing at him and clasped her hands partly with a mothers pride and partly with a mothers sorrow the great rock stirred yes it was raised slowly from the bedded moss and earth uprooting the shrubs and flowers along with it and was turned upon its side theseus had conquered  while taking breath he looked joyfully at his mother and she smiled upon him through her tears  yes theseus she said the time has come and you must stay no longer at my side see what king aegeus your royal father left for you beneath the stone when he lifted it in his mighty arms and laid it on the spot whence you have now removed it  theseus looked and saw that the rock had been placed over another slab of stone containing a cavity within it so that it somewhat resembled a roughlymade chest or coffer of which the upper mass had served as the lid within the cavity lay a sword with a golden hilt and a pair of sandals  that was your fathers sword said aethra and those were his sandals when he went to be king of athens he bade me treat you as a child until you should prove yourself a man by lifting this heavy stone that task being accomplished you are to put on his sandals in order to follow in your fathers footsteps and to gird on his sword so that you may fight giants and dragons as king aegeus did in his youth  i will set out for athens this very day cried theseus  but his mother persuaded him to stay a day or two longer while she got ready some necessary articles for his journey when his grandfather the wise king pittheus heard that theseus intended to present himself at his fathers palace he earnestly advised him to get on board of a vessel and go by sea because he might thus arrive within fifteen miles of athens without either fatigue or danger  the roads are very bad by land quoth the venerable king and they are terribly infested with robbers and monsters a mere lad like theseus is not fit to be trusted on such a perilous journey all by himself no no let him go by sea  but when theseus heard of robbers and monsters he pricked up his ears and was so much the more eager to take the road along which they were to be met with on the third day therefore he bade a respectful farewell to his grandfather thanking him for all his kindness and after affectionately embracing his mother he set forth with a good many of her tears glistening on his cheeks and some if the truth must be told that had gushed out of his own eyes but he let the sun and wind dry them and walked stoutly on playing with the golden hilt of his sword and taking very manly strides in his fathers sandals  i cannot stop to tell you hardly any of the adventures that befell theseus on the road to athens it is enough to say that he quite cleared that part of the country of the robbers about whom king pittheus had been so much alarmed one of these bad people was named procrustes and he was indeed a terrible fellow and had an ugly way of making fun of the poor travelers who happened to fall into his clutches in his cavern he had a bed on which with great pretense of hospitality he invited his guests to lie down but if they happened to be shorter than the bed this wicked villain stretched them out by main force or if they were too tall he lopped off their heads or feet and laughed at what he had done as an excellent joke thus however weary a man might be he never liked to lie in the bed of procrustes another of these robbers named scinis must likewise have been a very great scoundrel he was in the habit of flinging his victims off a high cliff into the sea and in order to give him exactly his deserts theseus tossed him off the very same place but if you will believe me the sea would not pollute itself by receiving such a bad person into its bosom neither would the earth having once got rid of him consent to take him back so that between the cliff and the sea scinis stuck fast in the air which was forced to bear the burden of his naughtiness  after these memorable deeds theseus heard of an enormous sow which ran wild and was the terror of all the farmers round about and as he did not consider himself above doing any good thing that came in his way he killed this monstrous creature and gave the carcass to the poor people for bacon the great sow had been an awful beast while ramping about the woods and fields but was a pleasant object enough when cut up into joints and smoking on i know not how many dinner tables  thus by the time he reached his journeys end theseus had done many valiant feats with his fathers goldenhilted sword and had gained the renown of being one of the bravest young men of the day his fame traveled faster than he did and reached athens before him as he entered the city he heard the inhabitants talking at the street corners and saying that hercules was brave and jason too and castor and pollux likewise but that theseus the son of their own king would turn out as great a hero as the best of them theseus took longer strides on hearing this and fancied himself sure of a magnificent reception at his fathers court since he came thither with fame to blow her trumpet before him and cry to king aegeus behold your son  he little suspected innocent youth that he was that here in this very athens where his father reigned a greater danger awaited him than any which he had encountered on the road yet this was the truth you must understand that the father of theseus though not very old in years was almost worn out with the cares of government and had thus grown aged before his time his nephews not expecting him to live a very great while intended to get all the power of the kingdom into their own hands but when they heard that theseus had arrived in athens and learned what a gallant young man he was they saw that he would not be at all the kind of a person to let them steal away his fathers crown and scepter which ought to be his own by right of inheritance thus these badhearted nephews of king aegeus who were the own cousins of theseus at once became his enemies a still more dangerous enemy was medea the wicked enchantress for she was now the kings wife and wanted to give the kingdom to her son medus instead of letting it be given to the son of aethra whom she hated  it so happened that the kings nephews met theseus and found out who he was just as he reached the entrance of the royal palace with all their evil designs against him they pretended to be their cousins best friends and expressed great joy at making his acquaintance they proposed to him that he should come into the kings presence as a stranger in order to try whether aegeus would discover in the young mans features any likeness either to himself or his mother aethra and thus recognize him for a son theseus consented for he fancied that his father would know him in a moment by the love that was in his heart but while he waited at the door the nephews ran and told king aegeus that a young man had arrived in athens who to their certain knowledge intended to put him to death and get possession of his royal crown  and he is now waiting for admission to your majestys presence added they  aha cried the old king on hearing this why he must be a very wicked young fellow indeed pray what would you advise me to do with him  in reply to this question the wicked medea put in her word as i have already told you she was a famous enchantress according to some stories she was in the habit of boiling old people in a large caldron under pretense of making them young again but king aegeus i suppose did not fancy such an uncomfortable way of growing young or perhaps was contented to be old and therefore would never let himself be popped into the caldron if there were time to spare from more important matters i should be glad to tell you of medeas fiery chariot drawn by winged dragons in which the enchantress used often to take an airing among the clouds this chariot in fact was the vehicle that first brought her to athens where she had done nothing but mischief ever since her arrival but these and many other wonders must be left untold and it is enough to say that medea amongst a thousand other bad things knew how to prepare a poison that was instantly fatal to whomsoever might so much as touch it with his lips  so when the king asked what he should do with theseus this naughty woman had an answer ready at her tongues end  leave that to me please your majesty she replied only admit this evilminded young man to your presence treat him civilly and invite him to drink a goblet of wine your majesty is well aware that i sometimes amuse myself by distilling very powerful medicines here is one of them in this small phial as to what it is made of that is one of my secrets of state do but let me put a single drop into the goblet and let the young man taste it and i will answer for it he shall quite lay aside the bad designs with which he comes hither  as she said this medea smiled but for all her smiling face she meant nothing less than to poison the poor innocent theseus before his fathers eyes and king aegeus like most other kings thought any punishment mild enough for a person who was accused of plotting against his life he therefore made little or no objection to medeas scheme and as soon as the poisonous wine was ready gave orders that the young stranger should be admitted into his presence  the goblet was set on a table beside the kings throne and a fly meaning just to sip a little from the brim immediately tumbled into it dead observing this medea looked round at the nephews and smiled again  when theseus was ushered into the royal apartment the only object that he seemed to behold was the whitebearded old king there he sat on his magnificent throne a dazzling crown on his head and a scepter in his hand his aspect was stately and majestic although his years and infirmities weighed heavily upon him as if each year were a lump of lead and each infirmity a ponderous stone and all were bundled up together and laid upon his weary shoulders the tears both of joy and sorrow sprang into the young mans eyes for he thought how sad it was to see his dear father so infirm and how sweet it would be to support him with his own youthful strength and to cheer him up with the alacrity of his loving spirit when a son takes a father into his warm heart it renews the old mans youth in a better way than by the heat of medeas magic caldron and this was what theseus resolved to do he could scarcely wait to see whether king aegeus would recognize him so eager was he to throw himself into his arms  advancing to the foot of the throne he attempted to make a little speech which he had been thinking about as he came up the stairs but he was almost choked by a great many tender feelings that gushed out of his heart and swelled into his throat all struggling to find utterance together and therefore unless he could have laid his full overbrimming heart into the kings hand poor theseus knew not what to do or say the cunning medea observed what was passing in the young mans mind she was more wicked at that moment than ever she had been before for and it makes me tremble to tell you of it she did her worst to turn all this unspeakable love with which theseus was agitated to his own ruin and destruction  does your majesty see his confusion she whispered in the kings ear he is so conscious of guilt that he trembles and cannot speak the wretch lives too long quick offer him the wine  now king aegeus had been gazing earnestly at the young stranger as he drew near the throne there was something he knew not what either in his white brow or in the fine expression of his mouth or in his beautiful and tender eyes that made him indistinctly feel as if he had seen this youth before as if indeed he had trotted him on his knee when a baby and had beheld him growing to be a stalwart man while he himself grew old but medea guessed how the king felt and would not suffer him to yield to these natural sensibilities although they were the voice of his deepest heart telling him as plainly as it could speak that here was our dear son and aethras son coming to claim him for a father the enchantress again whispered in the kings ear and compelled him by her witchcraft to see everything under a false aspect  he made up his mind therefore to let theseus drink off the poisoned wine  young man said he you are welcome i am proud to show hospitality to so heroic a youth do me the favor to drink the contents of this goblet it is brimming over as you see with delicious wine such as i bestow only on those who are worthy of it none is more worthy to quaff it than yourself  so saying king aegeus took the golden goblet from the table and was about to offer it to theseus but partly through his infirmities and partly because it seemed so sad a thing to take away this young mans life however wicked he might be and partly no doubt because his heart was wiser than his head and quaked within him at the thought of what he was going to dofor all these reasons the kings hand trembled so much that a great deal of the wine slopped over in order to strengthen his purpose and fearing lest the whole of the precious poison should be wasted one of his nephews now whispered to him  has your majesty any doubt of this strangers guilt this is the very sword with which he meant to slay you how sharp and bright and terrible it is quicklet him taste the wine or perhaps he may do the deed even yet  at these words aegeus drove every thought and feeling out of his breast except the one idea of how justly the young man deserved to be put to death he sat erect on his throne and held out the goblet of wine with a steady hand and bent on theseus a frown of kingly severity for after all he had too noble a spirit to murder even a treacherous enemy with a deceitful smile upon his face  drink said he in the stern tone with which he was wont to condemn a criminal to be beheaded you have well deserved of me such wine as this  theseus held out his hand to take the wine but before he touched it king aegeus trembled again his eyes had fallen on the goldhilted sword that hung at the young mans side he drew back the goblet  that sword he exclaimed how came you by it  it was my fathers sword replied theseus with a tremulous voice these were his sandals my dear mother her name is aethra told me his story while i was yet a little child but it is only a month since i grew strong enough to lift the heavy stone and take the sword and sandals from beneath it and come to athens to seek my father  my son my son cried king aegeus flinging away the fatal goblet and tottering down from the throne to fall into the arms of theseus yes these are aethras eyes it is my son  i have quite forgotten what became of the kings nephews but when the wicked medea saw this new turn of affairs she hurried out of the room and going to her private chamber lost no time to setting her enchantments to work in a few moments she heard a great noise of hissing snakes outside of the chamber window and behold there was her fiery chariot and four huge winged serpents wriggling and twisting in the air flourishing their tails higher than the top of the palace and all ready to set off on an aerial journey medea staid only long enough to take her son with her and to steal the crown jewels together with the kings best robes and whatever other valuable things she could lay hands on and getting into the chariot she whipped up the snakes and ascended high over the city  the king hearing the hiss of the serpents scrambled as fast as he could to the window and bawled out to the abominable enchantress never to come back the whole people of athens too who had run out of doors to see this wonderful spectacle set up a shout of joy at the prospect of getting rid of her medea almost bursting with rage uttered precisely such a hiss as one of her own snakes only ten times more venomous and spiteful and glaring fiercely out of the blaze of the chariot she shook her hands over the multitude below as if she were scattering a million of curses among them in so doing however she unintentionally let fall about five hundred diamonds of the first water together with a thousand great pearls and two thousand emeralds rubies sapphires opals and topazes to which she had helped herself out of the kings strong box all these came pelting down like a shower of manycolored hailstones upon the heads of grown people and children who forthwith gathered them up and carried them back to the palace but king aegeus told them that they were welcome to the whole and to twice as many more if he had them for the sake of his delight at finding his son and losing the wicked medea and indeed if you had seen how hateful was her last look as the flaming chariot flew upward you would not have wondered that both king and people should think her departure a good riddance  and now prince theseus was taken into great favor by his royal father the old king was never weary of having him sit beside him on his throne which was quite wide enough for two and of hearing him tell about his dear mother and his childhood and his many boyish efforts to lift the ponderous stone theseus however was much too brave and active a young man to be willing to spend all his time in relating things which had already happened his ambition was to perform other and more heroic deeds which should be better worth telling in prose and verse nor had he been long in athens before he caught and chained a terrible mad bull and made a public show of him greatly to the wonder and admiration of good king aegeus and his subjects but pretty soon he undertook an affair that made all his foregone adventures seem like mere boys play the occasion of it was as follows  one morning when prince theseus awoke he fancied that he must have had a very sorrowful dream and that it was still running in his mind even now that his eyes were opened for it appeared as if the air was full of a melancholy wail and when he listened more attentively he could hear sobs and groans and screams of woe mingled with deep quiet sighs which came from the kings palace and from the streets and from the temples and from every habitation in the city and all these mournful noises issuing out of thousands of separate hearts united themselves into one great sound of affliction which had startled theseus from slumber he put on his clothes as quickly as he could not forgetting his sandals and goldhilted sword and hastening to the king inquired what it all meant  alas my son quoth king aegeus heaving a long sigh here is a very lamentable matter in hand this is the wofulest anniversary in the whole year it is the day when we annually draw lots to see which of the youths and maids of athens shall go to be devoured by the horrible minotaur  the minotaur exclaimed prince theseus and like a brave young prince as he was he put his hand to the hilt of his sword what kind of a monster may that be is it not possible at the risk of ones life to slay him  but king aegeus shook his venerable head and to convince theseus that it was quite a hopeless case he gave him an explanation of the whole affair it seems that in the island of crete there lived a certain dreadful monster called a minotaur which was shaped partly like a man and partly like a bull and was altogether such a hideous sort of a creature that it is really disagreeable to think of him if he were suffered to exist at all it should have been on some desert island or in the duskiness of some deep cavern where nobody would ever be tormented by his abominable aspect but king minos who reigned over crete laid out a vast deal of money in building a habitation for the minotaur and took great care of his health and comfort merely for mischiefs sake a few years before this time there had been a war between the city of athens and the island of crete in which the athenians were beaten and compelled to beg for peace no peace could they obtain however except on condition that they should send seven young men and seven maidens every year to be devoured by the pet monster of the cruel king minos for three years past this grievous calamity had been borne and the sobs and groans and shrieks with which the city was now filled were caused by the peoples woe because the fatal day had come again when the fourteen victims were to be chosen by lot and the old people feared lest their sons or daughters might be taken and the youths and damsels dreaded lest they themselves might be destined to glut the ravenous maw of that detestable manbrute  but when theseus heard the story he straightened himself up so that he seemed taller than ever before and as for his face it was indignant despiteful bold tender and compassionate all in one look  let the people of athens this year draw lots for only six young men instead of seven said he i will myself be the seventh and let the minotaur devour me if he can  o my dear son cried king aegeus why should you expose yourself to this horrible fate you are a royal prince and have a right to hold yourself above the destinies of common men  it is because i am a prince your son and the rightful heir of your kingdom that i freely take upon me the calamity of your subjects answered theseus and you my father being king over these people and answerable to heaven for their welfare are bound to sacrifice what is dearest to you rather than that the son or daughter of the poorest citizen should come to any harm  the old king shed tears and besought theseus not to leave him desolate in his old age more especially as he had but just begun to know the happiness of possessing a good and valiant son theseus however felt that he was in the right and therefore would not give up his resolution but he assured his father that he did not intend to be eaten up unresistingly like a sheep and that if the minotaur devoured him it should not be without a battle for his dinner and finally since he could not help it king aegeus consented to let him go so a vessel was got ready and rigged with black sails and theseus with six other young men and seven tender and beautiful damsels came down to the harbor to embark a sorrowful multitude accompanied them to the shore there was the poor old king too leaning on his sons arm and looking as if his single heart held all the grief of athens  just as prince theseus was going on board his father bethought himself of one last word to say  my beloved son said he grasping the princes hand you observe that the sails of this vessel are black as indeed they ought to be since it goes upon a voyage of sorrow and despair now being weighed down with infirmities i know not whether i can survive till the vessel shall return but as long as i do live i shall creep daily to the top of yonder cliff to watch if there be a sail upon the sea and dearest theseus if by some happy chance you should escape the jaws of the minotaur then tear down those dismal sails and hoist others that shall be bright as the sunshine beholding them on the horizon myself and all the people will know that you are coming back victorious and will welcome you with such a festal uproar as athens never heard before  theseus promised that he would do so then going on board the mariners trimmed the vessels black sails to the wind which blew faintly off the shore being pretty much made up of the sighs that everybody kept pouring forth on this melancholy occasion but by and by when they had got fairly out to sea there came a stiff breeze from the northwest and drove them along as merrily over the whitecapped waves as if they had been going on the most delightful errand imaginable and though it was a sad business enough i rather question whether fourteen young people without any old persons to keep them in order could continue to spend the whole time of the voyage in being miserable there had been some few dances upon the undulating deck i suspect and some hearty bursts of laughter and other such unseasonable merriment among the victims before the high blue mountains of crete began to show themselves among the faroff clouds that sight to be sure made them all very grave again  theseus stood among the sailors gazing eagerly towards the land although as yet it seemed hardly more substantial than the clouds amidst which the mountains were looming up once or twice he fancied that he saw a glare of some bright object a long way off flinging a gleam across the waves  did you see that flash of light he inquired of the master of the vessel  no prince but i have seen it before answered the master it came from talus i suppose  as the breeze came fresher just then the master was busy with trimming his sails and had no more time to answer questions but while the vessel flew faster and faster towards crete theseus was astonished to behold a human figure gigantic in size which appeared to be striding with a measured movement along the margin of the island it stepped from cliff to cliff and sometimes from one headland to another while the sea foamed and thundered on the shore beneath and dashed its jets of spray over the giants feet what was still more remarkable whenever the sun shone on this huge figure it flickered and glimmered its vast countenance too had a metallic lustre and threw great flashes of splendor through the air the folds of its garments moreover instead of waving in the wind fell heavily over its limbs as if woven of some kind of metal  the nigher the vessel came the more theseus wondered what this immense giant could be and whether it actually had life or no for though it walked and made other lifelike motions there yet was a kind of jerk in its gait which together with its brazen aspect caused the young prince to suspect that it was no true giant but only a wonderful piece of machinery the figure looked all the more terrible because it carried an enormous brass club on its shoulder  what is this wonder theseus asked of the master of the vessel who was now at leisure to answer him  it is talus the man of brass said the master  and is he a live giant or a brazen image asked theseus  that truly replied the master is the point which has always perplexed me some say indeed that this talus was hammered out for king minos by vulcan himself the skilfullest of all workers in metal but who ever saw a brazen image that had sense enough to walk round an island three times a day as this giant walks round the island of crete challenging every vessel that comes nigh the shore and on the other hand what living thing unless his sinews were made of brass would not be weary of marching eighteen hundred miles in the twentyfour hours as talus does without ever sitting down to rest he is a puzzler take him how you will  still the vessel went bounding onward and now theseus could hear the brazen clangor of the giants footsteps as he trod heavily upon the seabeaten rocks some of which were seen to crack and crumble into the foaming waves beneath his weight as they approached the entrance of the port the giant straddled clear across it with a foot firmly planted on each headland and uplifting his club to such a height that its buttend was hidden in the cloud he stood in that formidable posture with the sun gleaming all over his metallic surface there seemed nothing else to be expected but that the next moment he would fetch his great club down slam bang and smash the vessel into a thousand pieces without heeding how many innocent people he might destroy for there is seldom any mercy in a giant you know and quite as little in a piece of brass clockwork but just when theseus and his companions thought the blow was coming the brazen lips unclosed themselves and the figure spoke  whence come you strangers  and when the ringing voice ceased there was just such a reverberation as you may have heard within a great church bell for a moment or two after the stroke of the hammer  from athens shouted the master in reply  on what errand thundered the man of brass  and he whirled his club aloft more threateningly than ever as if he were about to smite them with a thunderstroke right amidships because athens so little while ago had been at war with crete  we bring the seven youths and the seven maidens answered the master to be devoured by the minotaur  pass cried the brazen giant  that one loud word rolled all about the sky while again there was a booming reverberation within the figures breast the vessel glided between the headlands of the port and the giant resumed his march in a few moments this wondrous sentinel was far away flashing in the distant sunshine and revolving with immense strides round the island of crete as it was his neverceasing task to do  no sooner had they entered the harbor than a party of the guards of king minos came down to the water side and took charge of the fourteen young men and damsels surrounded by these armed warriors prince theseus and his companions were led to the kings palace and ushered into his presence now minos was a stern and pitiless king if the figure that guarded crete was made of brass then the monarch who ruled over it might be thought to have a still harder metal in his breast and might have been called a man of iron he bent his shaggy brows upon the poor athenian victims any other mortal beholding their fresh and tender beauty and their innocent looks would have felt himself sitting on thorns until he had made every soul of them happy by bidding them go free as the summer wind but this immitigable minos cared only to examine whether they were plump enough to satisfy the minotaurs appetite for my part i wish he himself had been the only victim and the monster would have found him a pretty tough one  one after another king minos called these pale frightened youths and sobbing maidens to his footstool gave them each a poke in the ribs with his sceptre to try whether they were in good flesh or no and dismissed them with a nod to his guards but when his eyes rested on theseus the king looked at him more attentively because his face was calm and brave  young man asked he with his stern voice are you not appalled at the certainty of being devoured by this terrible minotaur  i have offered my life in a good cause answered theseus and therefore i give it freely and gladly but thou king minos art thou not thyself appalled who year after year hast perpetrated this dreadful wrong by giving seven innocent youths and as many maidens to be devoured by a monster dost thou not tremble wicked king to turn shine eyes inward on shine own heart sitting there on thy golden throne and in thy robes of majesty i tell thee to thy face king minos thou art a more hideous monster than the minotaur himself  aha do you think me so cried the king laughing in his cruel way tomorrow at breakfast time you shall have an opportunity of judging which is the greater monster the minotaur or the king take them away guards and let this freespoken youth be the minotaurs first morsel  near the kings throne though i had no time to tell you so before stood his daughter ariadne she was a beautiful and tenderhearted maiden and looked at these poor doomed captives with very different feelings from those of the ironbreasted king minos she really wept indeed at the idea of how much human happiness would be needlessly thrown away by giving so many young people in the first bloom and rose blossom of their lives to be eaten up by a creature who no doubt would have preferred a fat ox or even a large pig to the plumpest of them and when she beheld the brave spirited figure of prince theseus bearing himself so calmly in his terrible peril she grew a hundred times more pitiful than before as the guards were taking him away she flung herself at the kings feet and besought him to set all the captives free and especially this one young man  peace foolish girl answered king minos  what hast thou to do with an affair like this it is a matter of state policy and therefore quite beyond thy weak comprehension go water thy flowers and think no more of these athenian caitiffs whom the minotaur shall as certainly eat up for breakfast as i will eat a partridge for my supper  so saying the king looked cruel enough to devour theseus and all the rest of the captives himself had there been no minotaur to save him the trouble as he would hear not another word in their favor the prisoners were now led away and clapped into a dungeon where the jailer advised them to go to sleep as soon as possible because the minotaur was in the habit of calling for breakfast early the seven maidens and six of the young men soon sobbed themselves to slumber but theseus was not like them he felt conscious that he was wiser and braver and stronger than his companions and that therefore he had the responsibility of all their lives upon him and must consider whether there was no way to save them even in this last extremity so he kept himself awake and paced to and fro across the gloomy dungeon in which they were shut up  just before midnight the door was softly unbarred and the gentle ariadne showed herself with a torch in her hand  are you awake prince theseus she whispered  yes answered theseus with so little time to live i do not choose to waste any of it in sleep  then follow me said ariadne and tread softly  what had become of the jailer and the guards theseus never knew but however that might be ariadne opened all the doors and led him forth from the darksome prison into the pleasant moonlight  theseus said the maiden you can now get on board your vessel and sail away for athens  no answered the young man i will never leave crete unless i can first slay the minotaur and save my poor companions and deliver athens from this cruel tribute  i knew that this would be your resolution said ariadne come then with me brave theseus here is your own sword which the guards deprived you of you will need it and pray heaven you may use it well  then she led theseus along by the hand until they came to a dark shadowy grove where the moonlight wasted itself on the tops of the trees without shedding hardly so much as a glimmering beam upon their pathway after going a good way through this obscurity they reached a high marble wall which was overgrown with creeping plants that made it shaggy with their verdure the wall seemed to have no door nor any windows but rose up lofty and massive and mysterious and was neither to be clambered over nor as far as theseus could perceive to be passed through nevertheless ariadne did but press one of her soft little fingers against a particular block of marble and though it looked as solid as any other part of the wall it yielded to her touch disclosing an entrance just wide enough to admit them they crept through and the marble stone swung back into its place  we are now said ariadne in the famous labyrinth which daedalus built before he made himself a pair of wings and flew away from our island like a bird that daedalus was a very cunning workman but of all his artful contrivances this labyrinth is the most wondrous were we to take but a few steps from the doorway we might wander about all our lifetime and never find it again yet in the very center of this labyrinth is the minotaur and theseus you must go thither to seek him  but how shall i ever find him asked theseus if the labyrinth so bewilders me as you say it will  just as he spoke they heard a rough and very disagreeable roar which greatly resembled the lowing of a fierce bull but yet had some sort of sound like the human voice theseus even fancied a rude articulation in it as if the creature that uttered it were trying to shape his hoarse breath into words it was at some distance however and he really could not tell whether it sounded most like a bulls roar or a mans harsh voice  that is the minotaurs noise whispered ariadne closely grasping the hand of theseus and pressing one of her own hands to her heart which was all in a tremble you must follow that sound through the windings of the labyrinth and by and by you will find him stay take the end of this silken string i will hold the other end and then if you win the victory it will lead you again to this spot farewell brave theseus  so the young man took the end of the silken string in his left hand and his goldhilted sword ready drawn from its scabbard in the other and trod boldly into the inscrutable labyrinth how this labyrinth was built is more than i can tell you but so cunningly contrived a mizmaze was never seen in the world before nor since there can be nothing else so intricate unless it were the brain of a man like daedalus who planned it or the heart of any ordinary man which last to be sure is ten times as great a mystery as the labyrinth of crete theseus had not taken five steps before he lost sight of ariadne and in five more his head was growing dizzy but still he went on now creeping through a low arch now ascending a flight of steps now in one crooked passage and now in another with here a door opening before him and there one banging behind until it really seemed as if the walls spun round and whirled him round along with them and all the while through these hollow avenues now nearer now farther off again resounded the cry of the minotaur and the sound was so fierce so cruel so ugly so like a bulls roar and withal so like a human voice and yet like neither of them that the brave heart of theseus grew sterner and angrier at every step for he felt it an insult to the moon and sky and to our affectionate and simple mother earth that such a monster should have the audacity to exist  as he passed onward the clouds gathered over the moon and the labyrinth grew so dusky that theseus could no longer discern the bewilderment through which he was passing he would have left quite lost and utterly hopeless of ever again walking in a straight path if every little while he had not been conscious of a gentle twitch at the silken cord then he knew that the tenderhearted ariadne was still holding the other end and that she was fearing for him and hoping for him and giving him just as much of her sympathy as if she were close by his side o indeed i can assure you there was a vast deal of human sympathy running along that slender thread of silk but still he followed the dreadful roar of the minotaur which now grew louder and louder and finally so very loud that theseus fully expected to come close upon him at every new zizgag and wriggle of the path and at last in an open space at the very center of the labyrinth he did discern the hideous creature  sure enough what an ugly monster it was only his horned head belonged to a bull and yet somehow or other he looked like a bull all over preposterously waddling on his hind legs or if you happened to view him in another way he seemed wholly a man and all the more monstrous for being so and there he was the wretched thing with no society no companion no kind of a mate living only to do mischief and incapable of knowing what affection means theseus hated him and shuddered at him and yet could not but be sensible of some sort of pity and all the more the uglier and more detestable the creature was for he kept striding to and fro in a solitary frenzy of rage continually emitting a hoarse roar which was oddly mixed up with halfshaped words and after listening a while theseus understood that the minotaur was saying to himself how miserable he was and how hungry and how he hated everybody and how he longed to eat up the human race alive  ah the bullheaded villain and o my good little people you will perhaps see one of these days as i do now that every human being who suffers any thing evil to get into his nature or to remain there is a kind of minotaur an enemy of his fellowcreatures and separated from all good companionship as this poor monster was  was theseus afraid by no means my dear auditors what a hero like theseus afraid not had the minotaur had twenty bullheads instead of one bold as he was however i rather fancy that it strengthened his valiant heart just at this crisis to feel a tremulous twitch at the silken cord which he was still holding in his left hand it was as if ariadne were giving him all her might and courage and much as he already had and little as she had to give it made his own seem twice as much and to confess the honest truth he needed the whole for now the minotaur turning suddenly about caught sight of theseus and instantly lowered his horribly sharp horns exactly as a mad bull does when he means to rush against an enemy at the same time he belched forth a tremendous roar in which there was something like the words of human language but all disjointed and shaken to pieces by passing through the gullet of a miserably enraged brute  theseus could only guess what the creature intended to say and that rather by his gestures than his words for the minotaurs horns were sharper than his wits and of a great deal more service to him than his tongue but probably this was the sense of what he uttered  ah wretch of a human being ill stick my horns through you and toss you fifty feet high and eat you up the moment you come down  come on then and try it was all that theseus deigned to reply for he was far too magnanimous to assault his enemy with insolent language  without more words on either side there ensued the most awful fight between theseus and the minotaur that ever happened beneath the sun or moon i really know not how it might have turned out if the monster in his first headlong rush against theseus had not missed him by a hairs breadth and broken one of his horns short off against the stone wall on this mishap he bellowed so intolerably that a part of the labyrinth tumbled down and all the inhabitants of crete mistook the noise for an uncommonly heavy thunder storm smarting with the pain he galloped around the open space in so ridiculous a way that theseus laughed at it long afterwards though not precisely at the moment after this the two antagonists stood valiantly up to one another and fought sword to horn for a long while at last the minotaur made a run at theseus grazed his left side with his horn and flung him down and thinking that he had stabbed him to the heart he cut a great caper in the air opened his bull mouth from ear to ear and prepared to snap his head off but theseus by this time had leaped up and caught the monster off his guard fetching a sword stroke at him with all his force he hit him fair upon the neck and made his bull head skip six yards from his human body which fell down flat upon the ground  so now the battle was ended immediately the moon shone out as brightly as if all the troubles of the world and all the wickedness and the ugliness that infest human life were past and gone forever and theseus as he leaned on his sword taking breath felt another twitch of the silken cord for all through the terrible encounter he had held it fast in his left hand eager to let ariadne know of his success he followed the guidance of the thread and soon found himself at the entrance of the labyrinth  thou hast slain the monster cried ariadne clasping her hands  thanks to thee dear ariadne answered theseus i return victorious  then said ariadne we must quickly summon thy friends and get them and thyself on board the vessel before dawn if morning finds thee here my father will avenge the minotaur  to make my story short the poor captives were awakened and hardly knowing whether it was not a joyful dream were told of what theseus had done and that they must set sail for athens before daybreak hastening down to the vessel they all clambered on board except prince theseus who lingered behind them on the strand holding ariadnes hand clasped in his own  dear maiden said he thou wilt surely go with us thou art too gentle and sweet a child for such an ironhearted father as king minos he cares no more for thee than a granite rock cares for the little flower that grows in one of its crevices but my father king aegeus and my dear mother aethra and all the fathers and mothers in athens and all the sons and daughters too will love and honor thee as their benefactress come with us then for king minos will be very angry when he knows what thou hast done  now some lowminded people who pretend to tell the story of theseus and ariadne have the face to say that this royal and honorable maiden did really flee away under cover of the night with the young stranger whose life she had preserved they say too that prince theseus who would have died sooner than wrong the meanest creature in the world ungratefully deserted ariadne on a solitary island where the vessel touched on its voyage to athens but had the noble theseus heard these falsehoods he would have served their slanderous authors as he served the minotaur here is what ariadne answered when the brave prince of athens besought her to accompany him  no theseus the maiden said pressing his hand and then drawing back a step or two i cannot go with you my father is old and has nobody but myself to love him hard as you think his heart is it would break to lose me at first king minos will be angry but he will soon forgive his only child and by and by he will rejoice i know that no more youths and maidens must come from athens to be devoured by the minotaur i have saved you theseus as much for my fathers sake as for your own farewell heaven bless you  all this was so true and so maidenlike and was spoken with so sweet a dignity that theseus would have blushed to urge her any longer nothing remained for him therefore but to bid ariadne an affectionate farewell and to go on board the vessel and set sail  in a few moments the white foam was boiling up before their prow as prince theseus and his companions sailed out of the harbor with a whistling breeze behind them talus the brazen giant on his neverceasing sentinels march happened to be approaching that part of the coast and they saw him by the glimmering of the moonbeams on his polished surface while he was yet a great way off as the figure moved like clockwork however and could neither hasten his enormous strides nor retard them he arrived at the port when they were just beyond the reach of his club nevertheless straddling from headland to headland as his custom was talus attempted to strike a blow at the vessel and overreaching himself tumbled at full length into the sea which splashed high over his gigantic shape as when an iceberg turns a somerset there he lies yet and whoever desires to enrich himself by means of brass had better go thither with a diving bell and fish up talus  on the homeward voyage the fourteen youths and damsels were in excellent spirits as you will easily suppose they spent most of their time in dancing unless when the sidelong breeze made the deck slope too much in due season they came within sight of the coast of attica which was their native country but here i am grieved to tell you happened a sad misfortune  you will remember what theseus unfortunately forgot that his father king aegeus had enjoined it upon him to hoist sunshiny sails instead of black ones in case he should overcome the minotaur and return victorious in the joy of their success however and amidst the sports dancing and other merriment with which these young folks wore away the time they never once thought whether their sails were black white or rainbow colored and indeed left it entirely to the mariners whether they had any sails at all thus the vessel returned like a raven with the same sable wings that had wafted her away but poor king aegeus day after day infirm as he was had clambered to the summit of a cliff that overhung the sea and there sat watching for prince theseus homeward bound and no sooner did he behold the fatal blackness of the sails than he concluded that his dear son whom he loved so much and felt so proud of had been eaten by the minotaur he could not bear the thought of living any longer so first flinging his crown and sceptre into the sea useless baubles that they were to him now king aegeus merely stooped forward and fell headlong over the cliff and was drowned poor soul in the waves that foamed at its base  this was melancholy news for prince theseus who when he stepped ashore found himself king of all the country whether he would or no and such a turn of fortune was enough to make any young man feel very much out of spirits however he sent for his dear mother to athens and by taking her advice in matters of state became a very excellent monarch and was greatly beloved by his people    the pygmies  a great while ago when the world was full of wonders there lived an earthborn giant named antaeus and a million or more of curious little earthborn people who were called pygmies this giant and these pygmies being children of the same mother that is to say our good old grandmother earth were all brethren and dwelt together in a very friendly and affectionate manner far far off in the middle of hot africa the pygmies were so small and there were so many sandy deserts and such high mountains between them and the rest of mankind that nobody could get a peep at them oftener than once in a hundred years as for the giant being of a very lofty stature it was easy enough to see him but safest to keep out of his sight  among the pygmies i suppose if one of them grew to the height of six or eight inches he was reckoned a prodigiously tall man it must have been very pretty to behold their little cities with streets two or three feet wide paved with the smallest pebbles and bordered by habitations about as big as a squirrels cage the kings palace attained to the stupendous magnitude of periwinkles baby house and stood in the center of a spacious square which could hardly have been covered by our hearthrug their principal temple or cathedral was as lofty as yonder bureau and was looked upon as a wonderfully sublime and magnificent edifice all these structures were built neither of stone nor wood they were neatly plastered together by the pygmy workmen pretty much like birds nests out of straw feathers egg shells and other small bits of stuff with stiff clay instead of mortar and when the hot sun had dried them they were just as snug and comfortable as a pygmy could desire  the country round about was conveniently laid out in fields the largest of which was nearly of the same extent as one of sweet ferns flower beds here the pygmies used to plant wheat and other kinds of grain which when it grew up and ripened overshadowed these tiny people as the pines and the oaks and the walnut and chestnut trees overshadow you and me when we walk in our own tracts of woodland at harvest time they were forced to go with their little axes and cut down the grain exactly as a woodcutter makes a clearing in the forest and when a stalk of wheat with its overburdened top chanced to come crashing down upon an unfortunate pygmy it was apt to be a very sad affair if it did not smash him all to pieces at least i am sure it must have made the poor little fellows head ache and o my stars if the fathers and mothers were so small what must the children and babies have been a whole family of them might have been put to bed in a shoe or have crept into an old glove and played at hideandseek in its thumb and fingers you might have hidden a yearold baby under a thimble  now these funny pygmies as i told you before had a giant for their neighbor and brother who was bigger if possible than they were little he was so very tall that he carried a pine tree which was eight feet through the butt for a walking stick it took a farsighted pygmy i can assure you to discern his summit without the help of a telescope and sometimes in misty weather they could not see his upper half but only his long legs which seemed to be striding about by themselves but at noonday in a clear atmosphere when the sun shone brightly over him the giant antaeus presented a very grand spectacle there he used to stand a perfect mountain of a man with his great countenance smiling down upon his little brothers and his one vast eye which was as big as a cart wheel and placed right in the center of his forehead giving a friendly wink to the whole nation at once  the pygmies loved to talk with antaeus and fifty times a day one or another of them would turn up his head and shout through the hollow of his fists halloo brother antaeus how are you my good fellow and when the small distant squeak of their voices reached his ear the giant would make answer pretty well brother pygmy i thank you in a thunderous roar that would have shaken down the walls of their strongest temple only that it came from so far aloft  it was a happy circumstance that antaeus was the pygmy peoples friend for there was more strength in his little finger than in ten million of such bodies as this if he had been as illnatured to them as he was to everybody else he might have beaten down their biggest city at one kick and hardly have known that he did it with the tornado of his breath he could have stripped the roofs from a hundred dwellings and sent thousands of the inhabitants whirling through the air he might have set his immense foot upon a multitude and when he took it up again there would have been a pitiful sight to be sure but being the son of mother earth as they likewise were the giant gave them his brotherly kindness and loved them with as big a love as it was possible to feel for creatures so very small and on their parts the pygmies loved antaeus with as much affection as their tiny hearts could hold he was always ready to do them any good offices that lay in his power as for example when they wanted a breeze to turn their windmills the giant would set all the sails agoing with the mere natural respiration of his lungs when the sun was too hot he often sat himself down and let his shadow fall over the kingdom from one frontier to the other and as for matters in general he was wise enough to let them alone and leave the pygmies to manage their own affairswhich after all is about the best thing that great people can do for little ones  in short as i said before antaeus loved the pygmies and the pygmies loved antaeus the giants life being as long as his body was large while the lifetime of a pygmy was but a span this friendly intercourse had been going on for innumerable generations and ages it was written about in the pygmy histories and talked about in their ancient traditions the most venerable and whitebearded pygmy had never heard of a time even in his greatest of grandfathers days when the giant was not their enormous friend once to be sure as was recorded on an obelisk three feet high erected on the place of the catastrophe antaeus sat down upon about five thousand pygmies who were assembled at a military review but this was one of those unlucky accidents for which nobody is to blame so that the small folks never took it to heart and only requested the giant to be careful forever afterwards to examine the acre of ground where he intended to squat himself  it is a very pleasant picture to imagine antaeus standing among the pygmies like the spire of the tallest cathedral that ever was built while they ran about like pismires at his feet and to think that in spite of their difference in size there were affection and sympathy between them and him indeed it has always seemed to me that the giant needed the little people more than the pygmies needed the giant for unless they had been his neighbors and well wishers and as we may say his playfellows antaeus would not have had a single friend in the world no other being like himself had ever been created no creature of his own size had ever talked with him in thunderlike accents face to face when he stood with his head among the clouds he was quite alone and had been so for hundreds of years and would be so forever even if he had met another giant antaeus would have fancied the world not big enough for two such vast personages and instead of being friends with him would have fought him till one of the two was killed but with the pygmies he was the most sportive and humorous and merryhearted and sweettempered old giant that ever washed his face in a wet cloud  his little friends like all other small people had a great opinion of their own importance and used to assume quite a patronizing air towards the giant  poor creature they said one to another he has a very dull time of it all by himself and we ought not to grudge wasting a little of our precious time to amuse him he is not half so bright as we are to be sure and for that reason he needs us to look after his comfort and happiness let us be kind to the old fellow why if mother earth had not been very kind to ourselves we might all have been giants too  on all their holidays the pygmies had excellent sport with antaeus he often stretched himself out at full length on the ground where he looked like the long ridge of a hill and it was a good hours walk no doubt for a shortlegged pygmy to journey from head to foot of the giant he would lay down his great hand flat on the grass and challenge the tallest of them to clamber upon it and straddle from finger to finger so fearless were they that they made nothing of creeping in among the folds of his garments when his head lay sidewise on the earth they would march boldly up and peep into the great cavern of his mouth and take it all as a joke as indeed it was meant when antaeus gave a sudden snap of his jaws as if he were going to swallow fifty of them at once you would have laughed to see the children dodging in and out among his hair or swinging from his beard it is impossible to tell half of the funny tricks that they played with their huge comrade but i do not know that anything was more curious than when a party of boys were seen running races on his forehead to try which of them could get first round the circle of his one great eye it was another favorite feat with them to march along the bridge of his nose and jump down upon his upper lip  if the truth must be told they were sometimes as troublesome to the giant as a swarm of ants or mosquitoes especially as they had a fondness for mischief and liked to prick his skin with their little swords and lances to see how thick and tough it was but antaeus took it all kindly enough although once in a while when he happened to be sleepy he would grumble out a peevish word or two like the muttering of a tempest and ask them to have done with their nonsense a great deal oftener however he watched their merriment and gambols until his huge heavy clumsy wits were completely stirred up by them and then would he roar out such a tremendous volume of immeasurable laughter that the whole nation of pygmies had to put their hands to their ears else it would certainly have deafened them  ho ho ho quoth the giant shaking his mountainous sides what a funny thing it is to be little if i were not antaeus i should like to be a pygmy just for the jokes sake  the pygmies had but one thing to trouble them in the world they were constantly at war with the cranes and had always been so ever since the longlived giant could remember from time to time very terrible battles had been fought in which sometimes the little men won the victory and sometimes the cranes according to some historians the pygmies used to go to the battle mounted on the backs of goats and rams but such animals as these must have been far too big for pygmies to ride upon so that i rather suppose they rode on squirrelback or rabbitback or ratback or perhaps got upon hedgehogs whose prickly quills would be very terrible to the enemy however this might be and whatever creatures the pygmies rode upon i do not doubt that they made a formidable appearance armed with sword and spear and bow and arrow blowing their tiny trumpet and shouting their little war cry they never failed to exhort one another to fight bravely and recollect that the world had its eyes upon them although in simple truth the only spectator was the giant antaeus with his one great stupid eye in the middle of his forehead  when the two armies joined battle the cranes would rush forward flapping their wings and stretching out their necks and would perhaps snatch up some of the pygmies crosswise in their beaks whenever this happened it was truly an awful spectacle to see those little men of might kicking and sprawling in the air and at last disappearing down the cranes long crooked throat swallowed up alive a hero you know must hold himself in readiness for any kind of fate and doubtless the glory of the thing was a consolation to him even in the cranes gizzard if antaeus observed that the battle was going hard against his little allies he generally stopped laughing and ran with milelong strides to their assistance flourishing his club aloft and shouting at the cranes who quacked and croaked and retreated as fast as they could then the pygmy army would march homeward in triumph attributing the victory entirely to their own valor and to the warlike skill and strategy of whomsoever happened to be captain general and for a tedious while afterwards nothing would be heard of but grand processions and public banquets and brilliant illuminations and shows of waxwork with likenesses of the distinguished officers as small as life  in the abovedescribed warfare if a pygmy chanced to pluck out a cranes tail feather it proved a very great feather in his cap once or twice if you will believe me a little man was made chief ruler of the nation for no other merit in the world than bringing home such a feather  but i have now said enough to let you see what a gallant little people these were and how happily they and their forefathers for nobody knows how many generations had lived with the immeasurable giant antaeus in the remaining part of the story i shall tell you of a far more astonishing battle than any that was fought between the pygmies and the cranes  one day the mighty antaeus was lolling at full length among his little friends his pinetree walking stick lay on the ground close by his side his head was in one part of the kingdom and his feet extended across the boundaries of another part and he was taking whatever comfort he could get while the pygmies scrambled over him and peeped into his cavernous mouth and played among his hair sometimes for a minute or two the giant dropped asleep and snored like the rush of a whirlwind during one of these little bits of slumber a pygmy chanced to climb upon his shoulder and took a view around the horizon as from the summit of a hill and he beheld something a long way off which made him rub the bright specks of his eyes and look sharper than before at first he mistook it for a mountain and wondered how it had grown up so suddenly out of the earth but soon he saw the mountain move as it came nearer and nearer what should it turn out to be but a human shape not so big as antaeus it is true although a very enormous figure in comparison with pygmies and a vast deal bigger than the men we see nowadays  when the pygmy was quite satisfied that his eyes had not deceived him he scampered as fast as his legs would carry him to the giants ear and stooping over its cavity shouted lustily into it  halloo brother antaeus get up this minute and take your pinetree walking stick in your hand here comes another giant to have a tussle with you  poh poh grumbled antaeus only half awake none of your nonsense my little fellow dont you see im sleepy there is not a giant on earth for whom i would take the trouble to get up  but the pygmy looked again and now perceived that the stranger was coming directly towards the prostrate form of antaeus with every step he looked less like a blue mountain and more like an immensely large man he was soon so nigh that there could be no possible mistake about the matter there he was with the sun flaming on his golden helmet and flashing from his polished breastplate he had a sword by his side and a lions skin over his back and on his right shoulder he carried a club which looked bulkier and heavier than the pinetree walking stick of antaeus  by this time the whole nation of the pygmies had seen the new wonder and a million of them set up a shout all together so that it really made quite an audible squeak  get up antaeus bestir yourself you lazy old giant here comes another giant as strong as you are to fight with you  nonsense nonsense growled the sleepy giant ill have my nap out come who may  still the stranger drew nearer and now the pygmies could plainly discern that if his stature were less lofty than the giants yet his shoulders were even broader and in truth what a pair of shoulders they must have been as i told you a long while ago they once upheld the sky the pygmies being ten times as vivacious as their great numskull of a brother could not abide the giants slow movements and were determined to have him on his feet so they kept shouting to him and even went so far as to prick him with their swords  get up get up get up they cried up with you lazy bones the strange giants club is bigger than your own his shoulders are the broadest and we think him the stronger of the two  antaeus could not endure to have it said that any mortal was half so mighty as himself this latter remark of the pygmies pricked him deeper than their swords and sitting up in rather a sulky humor he gave a gape of several yards wide rubbed his eyes and finally turned his stupid head in the direction whither his little friends were eagerly pointing  no sooner did he set eyes on the stranger than leaping on his feet and seizing his walking stick he strode a mile or two to meet him all the while brandishing the sturdy pine tree so that it whistled through the air  who are you thundered the giant and what do you want in my dominions  there was one strange thing about antaeus of which i have not yet told you lest hearing of so many wonders all in a lump you might not believe much more than half of them you are to know then that whenever this redoubtable giant touched the ground either with his hand his foot or any other part of his body he grew stronger than ever he had been before the earth you remember was his mother and was very fond of him as being almost the biggest of her children and so she took this method of keeping him always in full vigor some persons affirm that he grew ten times stronger at every touch others say that it was only twice as strong but only think of it whenever antaeus took a walk supposing it were but ten miles and that he stepped a hundred yards at a stride you may try to cipher out how much mightier he was on sitting down again than when he first started and whenever he flung himself on the earth to take a little repose even if he got up the very next instant he would be as strong as exactly ten just such giants as his former self it was well for the world that antaeus happened to be of a sluggish disposition and liked ease better than exercise for if he had frisked about like the pygmies and touched the earth as often as they did he would long ago have been strong enough to pull down the sky about peoples ears but these great lubberly fellows resemble mountains not only in bulk but in their disinclination to move  any other mortal man except the very one whom antaeus had now encountered would have been half frightened to death by the giants ferocious aspect and terrible voice but the stranger did not seem at all disturbed he carelessly lifted his club and balanced it in his hand measuring antaeus with his eye from head to foot not as if wondersmitten at his stature but as if he had seen a great many giants before and this was by no means the biggest of them in fact if the giant had been no bigger than the pygmies who stood pricking up their ears and looking and listening to what was going forward the stranger could not have been less afraid of him  who are you i say roared antaeus again whats your name why do you come hither speak you vagabond or ill try the thickness of your skull with my walkingstick  you are a very discourteous giant answered the stranger quietly and i shall probably have to teach you a little civility before we part as for my name it is hercules i have come hither because this is my most convenient road to the garden of the hesperides whither i am going to get three of the golden apples for king eurystheus  caitiff you shall go no farther bellowed antaeus putting on a grimmer look than before for he had heard of the mighty hercules and hated him because he was said to be so strong neither shall you go back whence you came  how will you prevent me asked hercules from going whither i please  by hitting you a rap with this pine tree here shouted antaeus scowling so that he made himself the ugliest monster in africa i am fifty times stronger than you and now that i stamp my foot upon the ground i am five hundred times stronger i am ashamed to kill such a puny little dwarf as you seem to be i will make a slave of you and you shall likewise be the slave of my brethren here the pygmies so throw down your club and your other weapons and as for that lions skin i intend to have a pair of gloves made of it  come and take it off my shoulders then answered hercules lifting his club  then the giant grinning with rage strode towerlike towards the stranger ten times strengthened at every step and fetched a monstrous blow at him with his pine tree which hercules caught upon his club and being more skilful than antaeus he paid him back such a rap upon the sconce that down tumbled the great lumbering manmountain flat upon the ground the poor little pygmies who really never dreamed that anybody in the world was half so strong as their brother antaeus were a good deal dismayed at this but no sooner was the giant down than up he bounced again with tenfold might and such a furious visage as was horrible to behold he aimed another blow at hercules but struck awry being blinded with wrath and only hit his poor innocent mother earth who groaned and trembled at the stroke his pine tree went so deep into the ground and stuck there so fast that before antaeus could get it out hercules brought down his club across his shoulders with a mighty thwack which made the giant roar as if all sorts of intolerable noises had come screeching and rumbling out of his immeasurable lungs in that one cry away it went over mountains and valleys and for aught i know was heard on the other side of the african deserts  as for the pygmies their capital city was laid in ruins by the concussion and vibration of the air and though there was uproar enough without their help they all set up a shriek out of three millions of little throats fancying no doubt that they swelled the giants bellow by at least ten times as much meanwhile antaeus had scrambled upon his feet again and pulled his pine tree out of the earth and all aflame with fury and more outrageously strong than ever he ran at hercules and brought down another blow  this time rascal shouted he you shall not escape me  but once more hercules warded off the stroke with his club and the giants pine tree was shattered into a thousand splinters most of which flew among the pygmies and did them more mischief than i like to think about before antaeus could get out of the way hercules let drive again and gave him another knockdown blow which sent him heels over head but served only to increase his already enormous and insufferable strength as for his rage there is no telling what a fiery furnace it had now got to be his one eye was nothing but a circle of red flame having now no weapons but his fists he doubled them up each bigger than a hogshead smote one against the other and danced up and down with absolute frenzy flourishing his immense arms about as if he meant not merely to kill hercules but to smash the whole world to pieces  come on roared this thundering giant let me hit you but one box on the ear and youll never have the headache again  now hercules though strong enough as you already know to hold the sky up began to be sensible that he should never win the victory if he kept on knocking antaeus down for by and by if he hit him such hard blows the giant would inevitably by the help of his mother earth become stronger than the mighty hercules himself so throwing down his club with which he had fought so many dreadful battles the hero stood ready to receive his antagonist with naked arms  step forward cried he since ive broken your pine tree well try which is the better man at a wrestling match  aha then ill soon satisfy you shouted the giant for if there was one thing on which he prided himself more than another it was his skill in wrestling villain ill fling you where you can never pick yourself up again  on came antaeus hopping and capering with the scorching heat of his rage and getting new vigor wherewith to wreak his passion every time he hopped  but hercules you must understand was wiser than this numskull of a giant and had thought of a way to fight himhuge earthborn monster that he wasand to conquer him too in spite of all that his mother earth could do for him watching his opportunity as the mad giant made a rush at him hercules caught him round the middle with both hands lifted him high into the air and held him aloft overhead  just imagine it my dear little friends what a spectacle it must have been to see this monstrous fellow sprawling in the air face downwards kicking out his long legs and wriggling his whole vast body like a baby when its father holds it at arms length towards the ceiling  but the most wonderful thing was that as soon as antaeus was fairly off the earth he began to lose the vigor which he had gained by touching it hercules very soon perceived that his troublesome enemy was growing weaker both because he struggled and kicked with less violence and because the thunder of his big voice subsided into a grumble the truth was that unless the giant touched mother earth as often as once in five minutes not only his overgrown strength but the very breath of his life would depart from him hercules had guessed this secret and it may be well for us all to remember it in case we should ever have to fight a battle with a fellow like antaeus for these earthborn creatures are only difficult to conquer on their own ground but may easily be managed if we can contrive to lift them into a loftier and purer region so it proved with the poor giant whom i am really a little sorry for notwithstanding his uncivil way of treating strangers who came to visit him  when his strength and breath were quite gone hercules gave his huge body a toss and flung it about a mile off where it fell heavily and lay with no more motion than a sand hill it was too late for the giants mother earth to help him now and i should not wonder if his ponderous bones were lying on the same spot to this very day and were mistaken for those of an uncommonly large elephant  but alas me what a wailing did the poor little pygmies set up when they saw their enormous brother treated in this terrible manner if hercules heard their shrieks however he took no notice and perhaps fancied them only the shrill plaintive twittering of small birds that had been frightened from their nests by the uproar of the battle between himself and antaeus indeed his thoughts had been so much taken up with the giant that he had never once looked at the pygmies nor even knew that there was such a funny little nation in the world and now as he had traveled a good way and was also rather weary with his exertions in the fight he spread out his lions skin on the ground and reclining himself upon it fell fast asleep  as soon as the pygmies saw hercules preparing for a nap they nodded their little heads at one another and winked with their little eyes and when his deep regular breathing gave them notice that he was asleep they assembled together in an immense crowd spreading over a space of about twentyseven feet square one of their most eloquent orators and a valiant warrior enough besides though hardly so good at any other weapon as he was with his tongue climbed upon a toadstool and from that elevated position addressed the multitude his sentiments were pretty much as follows or at all events something like this was probably the upshot of his speech  tall pygmies and mighty little men you and all of us have seen what a public calamity has been brought to pass and what an insult has here been offered to the majesty of our nation yonder lies antaeus our great friend and brother slain within our territory by a miscreant who took him at disadvantage and fought him if fighting it can be called in a way that neither man nor giant nor pygmy ever dreamed of fighting until this hour and adding a grievous contumely to the wrong already done us the miscreant has now fallen asleep as quietly as if nothing were to be dreaded from our wrath it behooves you fellowcountrymen to consider in what aspect we shall stand before the world and what will be the verdict of impartial history should we suffer these accumulated outrages to go unavenged  antaeus was our brother born of that same beloved parent to whom we owe the thews and sinews as well as the courageous hearts which made him proud of our relationship he was our faithful ally and fell fighting as much for our national rights and immunities as for his own personal ones we and our forefathers have dwelt in friendship with him and held affectionate intercourse as man to man through immemorial generations you remember how often our entire people have reposed in his great shadow and how our little ones have played at hideandseek in the tangles of his hair and how his mighty footsteps have familiarly gone to and fro among us and never trodden upon any of our toes and there lies this dear brotherthis sweet and amiable friendthis brave and faithful allythis virtuous giantthis blameless and excellent antaeusdead dead silent powerless a mere mountain of clay forgive my tears nay i behold your own were we to drown the world with them could the world blame us  but to resume shall we my countrymen suffer this wicked stranger to depart unharmed and triumph in his treacherous victory among distant communities of the earth shall we not rather compel him to leave his bones here on our soil by the side of our slain brothers bones so that while one skeleton shall remain as the everlasting monument of our sorrow the other shall endure as long exhibiting to the whole human race a terrible example of pygmy vengeance such is the question i put it to you in full confidence of a response that shall be worthy of our national character and calculated to increase rather than diminish the glory which our ancestors have transmitted to us and which we ourselves have proudly vindicated in our warfare with the cranes  the orator was here interrupted by a burst of irrepressible enthusiasm every individual pygmy crying out that the national honor must be preserved at all hazards he bowed and making a gesture for silence wound up his harangue in the following admirable manner  it only remains for us then to decide whether we shall carry on the war in our national capacityone united people against a common enemyor whether some champion famous in former fights shall be selected to defy the slayer of our brother antaeus to single combat in the latter case though not unconscious that there may be taller men among you i hereby offer myself for that enviable duty and believe me dear countrymen whether i live or die the honor of this great country and the fame bequeathed us by our heroic progenitors shall suffer no diminution in my hands never while i can wield this sword of which i now fling away the scabbardnever never never even if the crimson hand that slew the great antaeus shall lay me prostrate like him on the soil which i give my life to defend  so saying this valiant pygmy drew out his weapon which was terrible to behold being as long as the blade of a penknife and sent the scabbard whirling over the heads of the multitude his speech was followed by an uproar of applause as its patriotism and selfdevotion unquestionably deserved and the shouts and clapping of hands would have been greatly prolonged had they not been rendered quite inaudible by a deep respiration vulgarly called a snore from the sleeping hercules  it was finally decided that the whole nation of pygmies should set to work to destroy hercules not be it understood from any doubt that a single champion would be capable of putting him to the sword but because he was a public enemy and all were desirous of sharing in the glory of his defeat there was a debate whether the national honor did not demand that a herald should be sent with a trumpet to stand over the ear of hercules and after blowing a blast right into it to defy him to the combat by formal proclamation but two or three venerable and sagacious pygmies well versed in state affairs gave it as their opinion that war already existed and that it was their rightful privilege to take the enemy by surprise moreover if awakened and allowed to get upon his feet hercules might happen to do them a mischief before he could be beaten down again for as these sage counselors remarked the strangers club was really very big and had rattled like a thunderbolt against the skull of antaeus so the pygmies resolved to set aside all foolish punctilios and assail their antagonist at once  accordingly all the fighting men of the nation took their weapons and went boldly up to hercules who still lay fast asleep little dreaming of the harm which the pygmies meant to do him a body of twenty thousand archers marched in front with their little bows all ready and the arrows on the string the same number were ordered to clamber upon hercules some with spades to dig his eyes out and others with bundles of hay and all manner of rubbish with which they intended to plug up his mouth and nostrils so that he might perish for lack of breath these last however could by no means perform their appointed duty inasmuch as the enemys breath rushed out of his nose in an obstreperous hurricane and whirlwind which blew the pygmies away as fast as they came nigh it was found necessary therefore to hit upon some other method of carrying on the war  after holding a council the captains ordered their troops to collect sticks straws dry weeds and whatever combustible stuff they could find and make a pile of it heaping it high around the head of hercules as a great many thousand pygmies were employed in this task they soon brought together several bushels of inflammatory matter and raised so tall a heap that mounting on its summit they were quite upon a level with the sleepers face the archers meanwhile were stationed within bow shot with orders to let fly at hercules the instant that he stirred everything being in readiness a torch was applied to the pile which immediately burst into flames and soon waxed hot enough to roast the enemy had he but chosen to lie still a pygmy you know though so very small might set the world on fire just as easily as a giant could so that this was certainly the very best way of dealing with their foe provided they could have kept him quiet while the conflagration was going forward  but no sooner did hercules begin to be scorched than up he started with his hair in a red blaze  whats all this he cried bewildered with sleep and staring about him as if he expected to see another giant  at that moment the twenty thousand archers twanged their bowstrings and the arrows came whizzing like so many winged mosquitoes right into the face of hercules but i doubt whether more than half a dozen of them punctured the skin which was remarkably tough as you know the skin of a hero has good need to be  villain shouted all the pygmies at once you have killed the giant antaeus our great brother and the ally of our nation we declare bloody war against you and will slay you on the spot  surprised at the shrill piping of so many little voices hercules after putting out the conflagration of his hair gazed all round about but could see nothing at last however looking narrowly on the ground he espied the innumerable assemblage of pygmies at his feet he stooped down and taking up the nearest one between his thumb and finger set him on the palm of his left hand and held him at a proper distance for examination it chanced to be the very identical pygmy who had spoken from the top of the toadstool and had offered himself as a champion to meet hercules in single combat  what in the world my little fellow ejaculated hercules may you be  i am your enemy answered the valiant pygmy in his mightiest squeak you have slain the enormous antaeus our brother by the mothers side and for ages the faithful ally of our illustrious nation we are determined to put you to death and for my own part i challenge you to instant battle on equal ground  hercules was so tickled with the pygmys big words and warlike gestures that he burst into a great explosion of laughter and almost dropped the poor little mite of a creature off the palm of his hand through the ecstasy and convulsion of his merriment  upon my word cried he i thought i had seen wonders before todayhydras with nine heads stags with golden horns sixlegged men threeheaded dogs giants with furnaces in their stomachs and nobody knows what besides but here on the palm of my hand stands a wonder that outdoes them all your body my little friend is about the size of an ordinary mans finger pray how big may your soul be  as big as your own said the pygmy  hercules was touched with the little mans dauntless courage and could not help acknowledging such a brotherhood with him as one hero feels for another  my good little people said he making a low obeisance to the grand nation not for all the world would i do an intentional injury to such brave fellows as you your hearts seem to me so exceedingly great that upon my honor i marvel how your small bodies can contain them i sue for peace and as a condition of it will take five strides and be out of your kingdom at the sixth goodbye i shall pick my steps carefully for fear of treading upon some fifty of you without knowing it ha ha ha ho ho ho for once hercules acknowledges himself vanquished  some writers say that hercules gathered up the whole race of pygmies in his lions skin and carried them home to greece for the children of king eurystheus to play with but this is a mistake he left them one and all within their own territory where for aught i can tell their descendants are alive to the present day building their little houses cultivating their little fields spanking their little children waging their little warfare with the cranes doing their little business whatever it may be and reading their little histories of ancient times in those histories perhaps it stands recorded that a great many centuries ago the valiant pygmies avenged the death of the giant antaeus by scaring away the mighty hercules    the dragons teeth  cadmus phoenix and cilix the three sons of king agenor and their little sister europa who was a very beautiful child were at play together near the seashore in their fathers kingdom of phoenicia they had rambled to some distance from the palace where their parents dwelt and were now in a verdant meadow on one side of which lay the sea all sparkling and dimpling in the sunshine and murmuring gently against the beach the three boys were very happy gathering flowers and twining them into garlands with which they adorned the little europa seated on the grass the child was almost hidden under an abundance of buds and blossoms whence her rosy face peeped merrily out and as cadmus said was the prettiest of all the flowers  just then there came a splendid butterfly fluttering along the meadow and cadmus phoenix and cilix set off in pursuit of it crying out that it was a flower with wings europa who was a little wearied with playing all day long did not chase the butterfly with her brothers but sat still where they had left her and closed her eyes for a while she listened to the pleasant murmur of the sea which was like a voice saying hush and bidding her go to sleep but the pretty child if she slept at all could not have slept more than a moment when she heard something trample on the grass not far from her and peeping out from the heap of flowers beheld a snowwhite bull  and whence could this bull have com europa and her brothers had been a long time playing in the meadow and had seen no cattle nor other living thing either there or on the neighboring hills  brother cadmus cried europa starting up out of the midst of the roses and lilies phoenix cilix where are you all help help come and drive away this bull  but her brothers were too far off to hear especially as the fright took away europas voice and hindered her from calling very loudly so there she stood with her pretty mouth wide open as pale as the white lilies that were twisted among the other flowers in her garlands  nevertheless it was the suddenness with which she had perceived the bull rather than anything frightful in his appearance that caused europa so much alarm on looking at him more attentively she began to see that he was a beautiful animal and even fancied a particularly amiable expression in his face as for his breaththe breath of cattle you know is always sweetit was as fragrant as if he had been grazing on no other food than rosebuds or at least the most delicate of clover blossoms never before did a bull have such bright and tender eyes and such smooth horns of ivory as this one and the bull ran little races and capered sportively around the child so that she quite forgot how big and strong he was and from the gentleness and playfulness of his actions soon came to consider him as innocent a creature as a pet lamb  thus frightened as she at first was you might by and by have seen europa stroking the bulls forehead with her small white hand and taking the garlands off her own head to hang them on his neck and ivory horns then she pulled up some blades of grass and he ate them out of her hand not as if he were hungry but because he wanted to be friends with the child and took pleasure in eating what she had touched well my stars was there ever such a gentle sweet pretty and amiable creature as this bull and ever such a nice playmate for a little girl  when the animal saw for the bull had so much intelligence that it is really wonderful to think of when he saw that europa was no longer afraid of him he grew overjoyed and could hardly contain himself for delight he frisked about the meadow now here now there making sprightly leaps with as little effort as a bird expends in hopping from twig to twig indeed his motion was as light as if he were flying through the air and his hoofs seemed hardly to leave their print in the grassy soil over which he trod with his spotless hue he resembled a snow drift wafted along by the wind once he galloped so far away that europa feared lest she might never see him again so setting up her childish voice called him back  come back pretty creature she cried here is a nice clover blossom  and then it was delightful to witness the gratitude of this amiable bull and how he was so full of joy and thankfulness that he capered higher than ever he came running and bowed his head before europa as if he knew her to be a kings daughter or else recognized the important truth that a little girl is everybodys queen and not only did the bull bend his neck he absolutely knelt down at her feet and made such intelligent nods and other inviting gestures that europa understood what he meant just as well as if he had put it in so many words  come dear child was what he wanted to say let me give you a ride on my back  at the first thought of such a thing europa drew back but then she considered in her wise little head that there could be no possible harm in taking just one gallop on the back of this docile and friendly animal who would certainly set her down the very instant she desired it and how it would surprise her brothers to see her riding across the green meadow and what merry times they might have either taking turns for a gallop or clambering on the gentle creature all four children together and careering round the field with shouts of laughter that would be heard as far off as king agenors palace  i think i will do it said the child to herself  and indeed why not she cast a glance around and caught a glimpse of cadmus phoenix and cilix who were still in pursuit of the butterfly almost at the other end of the meadow it would be the quickest way of rejoining them to get upon the white bulls back she came a step nearer to him therefore andsociable creature that he washe showed so much joy at this mark of her confidence that the child could not find in her heart to hesitate any longer making one bound for this little princess was as active as a squirrel there sat europa on the beautiful bull holding an ivory horn in each hand lest she should fall off  softly pretty bull softly she said rather frightened at what she had done do not gallop too fast  having got the child on his back the animal gave a leap into the air and came down so like a feather that europa did not know when his hoofs touched the ground he then began a race to that part of the flowery plain where her three brothers were and where they had just caught their splendid butterfly europa screamed with delight and phoenix cilix and cadmus stood gaping at the spectacle of their sister mounted on a white bull not knowing whether to be frightened or to wish the same good luck for themselves the gentle and innocent creature for who could possibly doubt that he was so pranced round among the children as sportively as a kitten europa all the while looked down upon her brothers nodding and laughing but yet with a sort of stateliness in her rosy little face as the bull wheeled about to take another gallop across the meadow the child waved her hand and said goodbye playfully pretending that she was now bound on a distant journey and might not see her brothers again for nobody could tell how long  goodbye shouted cadmus phoenix and cilix all in one breath  but together with her enjoyment of the sport there was still a little remnant of fear in the childs heart so that her last look at the three boys was a troubled one and made them feel as if their dear sister were really leaving them forever and what do you think the snowy bull did next why he set off as swift as the wind straight down to the seashore scampered across the sand took an airy leap and plunged right in among the foaming billows the white spray rose in a shower over him and little europa and fell spattering down upon the water  then what a scream of terror did the poor child send forth the three brothers screamed manfully likewise and ran to the shore as fast as their legs would carry them with cadmus at their head but it was too late when they reached the margin of the sand the treacherous animal was already far away in the wide blue sea with only his snowy head and tail emerging and poor little europa between them stretching out one hand towards her dear brothers while she grasped the bulls ivory horn with the other and there stood cadmus phoenix and cilix gazing at this sad spectacle through their tears until they could no longer distinguish the bulls snowy head from the whitecapped billows that seemed to boil up out of the seas depths around him nothing more was ever seen of the white bullnothing more of the beautiful child  this was a mournful story as you may well think for the three boys to carry home to their parents king agenor their father was the ruler of the whole country but he loved his little daughter europa better than his kingdom or than all his other children or than anything else in the world therefore when cadmus and his two brothers came crying home and told him how that a white bull had carried off their sister and swam with her over the sea the king was quite beside himself with grief and rage although it was now twilight and fast growing dark he bade them set out instantly in search of her  never shall you see my face again he cried unless you bring me back my little europa to gladden me with her smiles and her pretty ways begone and enter my presence no more till you come leading her by the hand  as king agenor said this his eyes flashed fire for he was a very passionate king and he looked so terribly angry that the poor boys did not even venture to ask for their suppers but slunk away out of the palace and only paused on the steps a moment to consult whither they should go first while they were standing there all in dismay their mother queen telephassa who happened not to be by when they told the story to the king came hurrying after them and said that she too would go in quest of her daughter  o no mother cried the boys the night is dark and there is no knowing what troubles and perils we may meet with  alas my dear children answered poor queen telephassa weeping bitterly that is only another reason why i should go with you if i should lose you too as well as my little europa what would become of me  and let me go likewise said their playfellow thasus who came running to join them  thasus was the son of a seafaring person in the neighborhood he had been brought up with the young princes and was their intimate friend and loved europa very much so they consented that he should accompany them the whole party therefore set forth together cadmus phoenix cilix and thasus clustered round queen telephassa grasping her skirts and begging her to lean upon their shoulders whenever she felt weary in this manner they went down the palace steps and began a journey which turned out to be a great deal longer than they dreamed of the last that they saw of king agenor he came to the door with a servant holding a torch beside him and called after them into the gathering darkness  remember never ascend these steps again without the child  never sobbed queen telephassa and the three brothers and thasus answered never never never never  and they kept their word year after year king agenor sat in the solitude of his beautiful palace listening in vain for their returning footsteps hoping to hear the familiar voice of the queen and the cheerful talk of his sons and their playfellow thasus entering the door together and the sweet childish accents of little europa in the midst of them but so long a time went by that at last if they had really come the king would not have known that this was the voice of telephassa and these the younger voices that used to make such joyful echoes when the children were playing about the palace we must now leave king agenor to sit on his throne and must go along with queen telephassa and her four youthful companions  they went on and on and traveled a long way and passed over mountains and rivers and sailed over seas here and there and everywhere they made continual inquiry if any person could tell them what had become of europa the rustic people of whom they asked this question paused a little while from their labors in the field and looked very much surprised they thought it strange to behold a woman in the garb of a queen for telephassa in her haste had forgotten to take off her crown and her royal robes roaming about the country with four lads around her on such an errand as this seemed to be but nobody could give them any tidings of europa nobody had seen a little girl dressed like a princess and mounted on a snowwhite bull which galloped as swiftly as the wind  i cannot tell you how long queen telephassa and cadmus phoenix and cilix her three sons and thasus their playfellow went wandering along the highways and bypaths or through the pathless wildernesses of the earth in this manner but certain it is that before they reached any place of rest their splendid garments were quite worn out they all looked very much travelstained and would have had the dust of many countries on their shoes if the streams through which they waded had not washed it all away when they had been gone a year telephassa threw away her crown because it chafed her forehead  it has given me many a headache said the poor queen and it cannot cure my heartache  as fast as their princely robes got torn and tattered they exchanged them for such mean attire as ordinary people wore by and by they come to have a wild and homeless aspect so that you would much sooner have taken them for a gypsy family than a queen and three princes and a young nobleman who had once a palace for a home and a train of servants to do their bidding the four boys grew up to be tall young men with sunburnt faces each of them girded on a sword to defend themselves against the perils of the way when the husbandmen at whose farmhouses they sought hospitality needed their assistance in the harvest field they gave it willingly and queen telephassa who had done no work in her palace save to braid silk threads with golden ones came behind them to bind the sheaves if payment was offered they shook their heads and only asked for tidings of europa  there are bulls enough in my pasture the old farmers would reply but i never heard of one like this you tell me of a snowwhite bull with a little princess on his back ho ho i ask your pardon good folks but there never such a sight seen hereabouts  at last when his upper lip began to have the down on it phoenix grew weary of rambling hither and thither to no purpose so one day when they happened to be passing through a pleasant and solitary tract of country he sat himself down on a heap of moss  i can go no farther said phoenix it is a mere foolish waste of life to spend it as we do always wandering up and down and never coming to any home at nightfall our sister is lost and never will be found she probably perished in the sea or to whatever shore the white bull may have carried her it is now so many years ago that there would be neither love nor acquaintance between us should we meet again my father has forbidden us to return to his palace so i shall build me a hut of branches and dwell here  well son phoenix said telephassa sorrowfully you have grown to be a man and must do as you judge best but for my part i will still go in quest of my poor child  and we three will go along with you cried cadmus and cilix and their faithful friend thasus  but before setting out they all helped phoenix to build a habitation when completed it was a sweet rural bower roofed overhead with an arch of living boughs inside there were two pleasant rooms one of which had a soft heap of moss for a bed while the other was furnished with a rustic seat or two curiously fashioned out of the crooked roots of trees so comfortable and homelike did it seem that telephassa and her three companions could not help sighing to think that they must still roam about the world instead of spending the remainder of their lives in some such cheerful abode as they had here built for phoenix but when they bade him farewell phoenix shed tears and probably regretted that he was no longer to keep them company  however he had fixed upon an admirable place to dwell in and by and by there came other people who chanced to have no homes and seeing how pleasant a spot it was they built themselves huts in the neighborhood of phoenixs habitation thus before many years went by a city had grown up there in the center of which was seen a stately palace of marble wherein dwelt phoenix clothed in a purple robe and wearing a golden crown upon his head for the inhabitants of the new city finding that he had royal blood in his veins had chosen him to be their king the very first decree of state which king phoenix issued was that if a maiden happened to arrive in the kingdom mounted on a snowwhite bull and calling herself europa his subjects should treat her with the greatest kindness and respect and immediately bring her to the palace you may see by this that phoenixs conscience never quite ceased to trouble him for giving up the quest of his dear sister and sitting himself down to be comfortable while his mother and her companions went onward  but often and often at the close of a weary days journey did telephassa and cadmus cilix and thasus remember the pleasant spot in which they had left phoenix it was a sorrowful prospect for these wanderers that on the morrow they must again set forth and that after many nightfalls they would perhaps be no nearer the close of their toilsome pilgrimage than now these thoughts made them all melancholy at times but appeared to torment cilix more than the rest of the party at length one morning when they were taking their staffs in hand to set out he thus addressed them  my dear mother and you good brother cadmus and my friend thasus methinks we are like people in a dream there is no substance in the life which we are leading it is such a dreary length of time since the white bull carried off my sister europa that i have quite forgotten how she looked and the tones of her voice and indeed almost doubt whether such a little girl ever lived in the world and whether she once lived or no i am convinced that she no longer survives and that therefore it is the merest folly to waste our own lives and happiness in seeking her were we to find her she would now be a woman grown and would look upon us all as strangers so to tell you the truth i have resolved to take up my abode here and i entreat you mother brother and friend to follow my example  not i for one said telephassa although the poor queen firmly as she spoke was so travelworn that she could hardly put her foot to the ground not i for one in the depths of my heart little europa is still the rosy child who ran to gather flowers so many years ago she has not grown to womanhood nor forgotten me at noon at night journeying onward sitting down to rest her childish voice is always in my ears calling mother mother stop here who may there is no repose for me  nor for me said cadmus while my dear mother pleases to go onward  and the faithful thasus too was resolved to bear them company they remained with cilix a few days however and helped him to build a rustic bower resembling the one which they had formerly built for phoenix  when they were bidding him farewell cilix burst into tears and told his mother that it seemed just as melancholy a dream to stay there in solitude as to go onward if she really believed that they would ever find europa he was willing to continue the search with them even now but telephassa bade him remain there and be happy if his own heart would let him so the pilgrims took their leave of him and departed and were hardly out of sight before some other wandering people came along that way and saw cilixs habitation and were greatly delighted with the appearance of the place there being abundance of unoccupied ground in the neighborhood these strangers built huts for themselves and were soon joined by a multitude of new settlers who quickly formed a city in the middle of it was seen a magnificent palace of colored marble on the balcony of which every noontide appeared cilix in a long purple robe and with a jeweled crown upon his head for the inhabitants when they found out that he was a kings son had considered him the fittest of all men to be a king himself  one of the first acts of king cilixs government was to send out an expedition consisting of a grave ambassador and an escort of bold and hardy young men with orders to visit the principal kingdoms of the earth and inquire whether a young maiden had passed through those regions galloping swiftly on a white bull it is therefore plain to my mind that cilix secretly blamed himself for giving up the search for europa as long as he was able to put one foot before the other  as for telephassa and cadmus and the good thasus it grieves me to think of them still keeping up that weary pilgrimage the two young men did their best for the poor queen helping her over the rough places often carrying her across rivulets in their faithful arms and seeking to shelter her at nightfall even when they themselves lay on the ground sad sad it was to hear them asking of every passerby if he had seen europa so long after the white bull had carried her away but though the gray years thrust themselves between and made the childs figure dim in their remembrance neither of these truehearted three ever dreamed of giving up the search  one morning however poor thasus found that he had sprained his ankle and could not possibly go a step farther  after a few days to be sure said he mournfully i might make shift to hobble along with a stick but that would only delay you and perhaps hinder you from finding dear little europa after all your pains and trouble do you go forward therefore my beloved companions and leave me to follow as i may  thou hast been a true friend dear thasus said queen telephassa kissing his forehead being neither my son nor the brother of our lost europa thou hast shown thyself truer to me and her than phoenix and cilix did whom we have left behind us without thy loving help and that of my son cadmus my limbs could not have borne me half so far as this now take thy rest and be at peace forand it is the first time i have owned it to myselfi begin to question whether we shall ever find my beloved daughter in this world  saying this the poor queen shed tears because it was a grievous trial to the mothers heart to confess that her hopes were growing faint from that day forward cadmus noticed that she never traveled with the same alacrity of spirit that had heretofore supported her her weight was heavier upon his arm  before setting out cadmus helped thasus build a bower while telephassa being too infirm to give any great assistance advised them how to fit it up and furnish it so that it might be as comfortable as a hut of branches could thasus however did not spend all his days in this green bower for it happened to him as to phoenix and cilix that other homeless people visited the spot and liked it and built themselves habitations in the neighborhood so here in the course of a few years was another thriving city with a red freestone palace in the center of it where thasus sat upon a throne doing justice to the people with a purple robe over his shoulders a sceptre in his hand and a crown upon his head the inhabitants had made him king not for the sake of any royal blood for none was in his veins but because thasus was an upright truehearted and courageous man and therefore fit to rule  but when the affairs of his kingdom were all settled king thasus laid aside his purple robe and crown and sceptre and bade his worthiest subjects distribute justice to the people in his stead then grasping the pilgrims staff that had supported him so long he set forth again hoping still to discover some hoofmark of the snowwhite bull some trace of the vanished child he returned after a lengthened absence and sat down wearily upon his throne to his latest hour nevertheless king thasus showed his truehearted remembrance of europa by ordering that a fire should always be kept burning in his palace and a bath steaming hot and food ready to be served up and a bed with snowwhite sheets in case the maiden should arrive and require immediate refreshment and though europa never came the good thasus had the blessings of many a poor traveler who profited by the food and lodging which were meant for the little playmate of the kings boyhood  telephassa and cadmus were now pursuing their weary way with no companion but each other the queen leaned heavily upon her sons arm and could walk only a few miles a day but for all her weakness and weariness she would not be persuaded to give up the search it was enough to bring tears into the eyes of bearded men to hear the melancholy tone with which she inquired of every stranger whether he could not tell her any news of the lost child  have you seen a little girlno no i mean a young maiden of full growthpassing by this way mounted on a snowwhite bull which gallops as swiftly as the wind  we have seen no such wondrous sight the people would reply and very often taking cadmus aside they whispered to him is this stately and sadlooking woman your mother surely she is not in her right mind and you ought to take her home and make her comfortable and do your best to get this dream out of her fancy  it is no dream said cadmus everything else is a dream save that  but one day telephassa seemed feebler than usual and leaned almost her whole weight on the arm of cadmus and walked more slowly than ever before at last they reached a solitary spot where she told her son that she must needs lie down and take a good long rest  a good long rest she repeated looking cadmus tenderly in the face a good long rest thou dearest one  as long as you please dear mother answered cadmus  telephassa bade him sit down on the turf beside her and then she took his hand  my son said she fixing her dim eyes most lovingly upon him this rest that i speak of will be very long indeed you must not wait till it is finished dear cadmus you do not comprehend me you must make a grave here and lay your mothers weary frame into it my pilgrimage is over  cadmus burst into tears and for a long time refused to believe that his dear mother was now to be taken from him but telephassa reasoned with him and kissed him and at length made him discern that it was better for her spirit to pass away out of the toil the weariness and grief and disappointment which had burdened her on earth ever since the child was lost he therefore repressed his sorrow and listened to her last words  dearest cadmus said she thou hast been the truest son that ever mother had and faithful to the very last who else would have borne with my infirmities as thou hast it is owing to thy care thou tenderest child that my grave was not dug long years ago in some valley or on some hillside that lies far far behind us it is enough thou shalt wander no more on this hopeless search but when thou hast laid thy mother in the earth then go my son to delphi and inquire of the oracle what thou shalt do next  o mother mother cried cadmus couldst thou but have seen my sister before this hour  it matters little now answered telephassa and there was a smile upon her face i go now to the better world and sooner or later shall find my daughter there  i will not sadden you my little hearers with telling how telephassa died and was buried but will only say that her dying smile grew brighter instead of vanishing from her dead face so that cadmus left convinced that at her very first step into the better world she had caught europa in her arms he planted some flowers on his mothers grave and left them to grow there and make the place beautiful when he should be far away  after performing this last sorrowful duty he set forth alone and took the road towards the famous oracle of delphi as telephassa had advised him on his way thither he still inquired of most people whom he met whether they had seen europa for to say the truth cadmus had grown so accustomed to ask the question that it came to his lips as readily as a remark about the weather he received various answers some told him one thing and some another among the rest a mariner affirmed that many years before in a distant country he had heard a rumor about a white bull which came swimming across the sea with a child on his back dressed up in flowers that were blighted by the sea water he did not know what had become of the child or the bull and cadmus suspected indeed by a queer twinkle in the mariners eyes that he was putting a joke upon him and had never really heard anything about the matter  poor cadmus found it more wearisome to travel alone than to bear all his dear mothers weight while she had kept him company his heart you will understand was now so heavy that it seemed impossible sometimes to carry it any farther but his limbs were strong and active and well accustomed to exercise he walked swiftly along thinking of king agenor and queen telephassa and his brothers and the friendly thasus all of whom he had left behind him at one point of his pilgrimage or another and never expected to see them any more full of these remembrances he came within sight of a lofty mountain which the people thereabouts told him was called parnassus on the slope of mount parnassus was the famous delphi whither cadmus was going  this delphi was supposed to be the very midmost spot of the whole world the place of the oracle was a certain cavity in the mountain side over which when cadmus came thither he found a rude bower of branches it reminded him of those which he had helped to build for phoenix and cilix and afterwards for thasus in later times when multitudes of people came from great distances to put questions to the oracle a spacious temple of marble was erected over the spot but in the days of cadmus as i have told you there was only this rustic bower with its abundance of green foliage and a tuft of shrubbery that ran wild over the mysterious hole in the hillside  when cadmus had thrust a passage through the tangled boughs and made his way into the bower he did not at first discern the halfhidden cavity but soon he felt a cold stream of air rushing out of it with so much force that it shook the ringlets on his cheek pulling away the shrubbery which clustered over the hole he bent forward and spoke in a distinct but reverential tone as if addressing some unseen personage inside of the mountain  sacred oracle of delphi said he whither shall i go next in quest of my dear sister europa  there was at first a deep silence and then a rushing sound or a noise like a long sigh proceeding out of the interior of the earth this cavity you must know was looked upon as a sort of fountain of truth which sometimes gushed out in audible words although for the most part these words were such a riddle that they might just as well have staid at the bottom of the hole but cadmus was more fortunate than many others who went to delphi in search of truth by and by the rushing noise began to sound like articulate language it repeated over and over again the following sentence which after all was so like the vague whistle of a blast of air that cadmus really did not quite know whether it meant anything or not  seek her no more seek her no more seek her no more  what then shall i do asked cadmus  for ever since he was a child you know it had been the great object of his life to find his sister from the very hour that he left following the butterfly in the meadow near his fathers palace he had done his best to follow europa over land and sea and now if he must give up the search he seemed to have no more business in the world  but again the sighing gust of air grew into something like a hoarse voice  follow the cow it said follow the cow follow the cow  and when these words had been repeated until cadmus was tired of hearing them especially as he could not imagine what cow it was or why he was to follow her the gusty hole gave vent to another sentence  where the stray cow lies down there is your home  these words were pronounced but a single time and died away into a whisper before cadmus was fully satisfied that he had caught the meaning he put other questions but received no answer only the gust of wind sighed continually out of the cavity and blew the withered leaves rustling along the ground before it  did there really come any words out of the hole thought cadmus or have i been dreaming all this while  he turned away from the oracle and thought himself no wiser than when he came thither caring little what might happen to him he took the first path that offered itself and went along at a sluggish pace for having no object in view nor any reason to go one way more than another it would certainly have been foolish to make haste whenever he met anybody the old question was at his tongues end  have you seen a beautiful maiden dressed like a kings daughter and mounted on a snowwhite bull that gallops as swiftly as the wind  but remembering what the oracle had said he only half uttered the words and then mumbled the rest indistinctly and from his confusion people must have imagined that this handsome young man had lost his wits  i know not how far cadmus had gone nor could he himself have told you when at no great distance before him he beheld a brindled cow she was lying down by the wayside and quietly chewing her cud nor did she take any notice of the young man until he had approached pretty nigh then getting leisurely upon her feet and giving her head a gentle toss she began to move along at a moderate pace often pausing just long enough to crop a mouthful of grass cadmus loitered behind whistling idly to himself and scarcely noticing the cow until the thought occurred to him whether this could possibly be the animal which according to the oracles response was to serve him for a guide but he smiled at himself for fancying such a thing he could not seriously think that this was the cow because she went along so quietly behaving just like any other cow evidently she neither knew nor cared so much as a wisp of hay about cadmus and was only thinking how to get her living along the wayside where the herbage was green and fresh perhaps she was going home to be milked  cow cow cow cried cadmus hey brindle hey stop my good cow  he wanted to come up with the cow so as to examine her and see if she would appear to know him or whether there were any peculiarities to distinguish her from a thousand other cows whose only business is to fill the milkpail and sometimes kick it over but still the brindled cow trudged on whisking her tail to keep the flies away and taking as little notice of cadmus as she well could if he walked slowly so did the cow and seized the opportunity to graze if he quickened his pace the cow went just so much the faster and once when cadmus tried to catch her by running she threw out her heels stuck her tail straight on end and set off at a gallop looking as queerly as cows generally do while putting themselves to their speed  when cadmus saw that it was impossible to come up with her he walked on moderately as before the cow too went leisurely on without looking behind wherever the grass was greenest there she nibbled a mouthful or two where a brook glistened brightly across the path there the cow drank and breathed a comfortable sigh and drank again and trudged onward at the pace that best suited herself and cadmus  i do believe thought cadmus that this may be the cow that was foretold me if it be the one i suppose she will lie down somewhere hereabouts  whether it were the oracular cow or some other one it did not seem reasonable that she should travel a great way farther so whenever they reached a particularly pleasant spot on a breezy hillside or in a sheltered vale or flowery meadow on the shore of a calm lake or along the bank of a clear stream cadmus looked eagerly around to see if the situation would suit him for a home but still whether he liked the place or no the brindled cow never offered to lie down on she went at the quiet pace of a cow going homeward to the barn yard and every moment cadmus expected to see a milkmaid approaching with a pail or a herdsman running to head the stray animal and turn her back towards the pasture but no milkmaid came no herdsman drove her back and cadmus followed the stray brindle till he was almost ready to drop down with fatigue  o brindled cow cried he in a tone of despair do you never mean to stop  he had now grown too intent on following her to think of lagging behind however long the way and whatever might be his fatigue indeed it seemed as if there were something about the animal that bewitched people several persons who happened to see the brindled cow and cadmus following behind began to trudge after her precisely as he did cadmus was glad of somebody to converse with and therefore talked very freely to these good people he told them all his adventures and how he had left king agenor in his palace and phoenix at one place and cilix at another and thasus at a third and his dear mother queen telephassa under a flowery sod so that now he was quite alone both friendless and homeless he mentioned likewise that the oracle had bidden him be guided by a cow and inquired of the strangers whether they supposed that this brindled animal could be the one  why tis a very wonderful affair answered one of his new companions i am pretty well acquainted with the ways of cattle and i never knew a cow of her own accord to go so far without stopping if my legs will let me ill never leave following the beast till she lies down  nor i said a second  nor i cried a third if she goes a hundred miles farther i am determined to see the end of it  the secret of it was you must know that the cow was an enchanted cow and that without their being conscious of it she threw some of her enchantment over everybody that took so much as half a dozen steps behind her they could not possibly help following her though all the time they fancied themselves doing it of their own accord the cow was by no means very nice in choosing her path so that sometimes they had to scramble over rocks or wade through mud and mire and all in a terribly bedraggled condition and tired to death and very hungry into the bargain what a weary business it was  but still they kept trudging stoutly forward and talking as they went the strangers grew very fond of cadmus and resolved never to leave him but to help him build a city wherever the cow might lie down in the center of it there should be a noble palace in which cadmus might dwell and be their king with a throne a crown a sceptre a purple robe and everything else that a king ought to have for in him there was the royal blood and the royal heart and the head that knew how to rule  while they were talking of these schemes and beguiling the tediousness of the way with laying out the plan of the new city one of the company happened to look at the cow  joy joy cried he clapping his hands brindle is going to lie down  they all looked and sure enough the cow had stopped and was staring leisurely about her as other cows do when on the point of lying down and slowly slowly did she recline herself on the soft grass first bending her forelegs and then crouching her hind ones when cadmus and his companions came up with her there was the brindled cow taking her ease chewing her cud and looking them quietly in the face as if this was just the spot she had been seeking for and as if it were all a matter of course  this then said cadmus gazing around him this is to be my home  it was a fertile and lovely plain with great trees flinging their sunspeckled shadows over it and hills fencing it in from the rough weather at no great distance they beheld a river gleaming in the sunshine a home feeling stole into the heart of poor cadmus he was very glad to know that here he might awake in the morning without the necessity of putting on his dusty sandals to travel farther and farther the days and the years would pass over him and find him still in this pleasant spot if he could have had his brothers with him and his friend thasus and could have seen his dear mother under a roof of his own he might here have been happy after all their disappointments some day or other too his sister europa might have come quietly to the door of his home and smiled round upon the familiar faces but indeed since there was no hope of regaining the friends of his boyhood or ever seeing his dear sister again cadmus resolved to make himself happy with these new companions who had grown so fond of him while following the cow  yes my friends said he to them this is to be our home here we will build our habitations the brindled cow which has led us hither will supply us with milk we will cultivate the neighboring soil and lead an innocent and happy life  his companions joyfully assented to this plan and in the first place being very hungry and thirsty they looked about them for the means of providing a comfortable meal not far off they saw a tuft of trees which appeared as if there might be a spring of water beneath them they went thither to fetch some leaving cadmus stretched on the ground along with the brindled cow for now that he had found a place of rest it seemed as if all the weariness of his pilgrimage ever since he left king agenors palace had fallen upon him at once but his new friends had not long been gone when he was suddenly startled by cries shouts and screams and the noise of a terrible struggle and in the midst of it all a most awful hissing which went right through his ears like a rough saw  running towards the tuft of trees he beheld the head and fiery eyes of an immense serpent or dragon with the widest jaws that ever a dragon had and a vast many rows of horribly sharp teeth before cadmus could reach the spot this pitiless reptile had killed his poor companions and was busily devouring them making but a mouthful of each man  it appears that the fountain of water was enchanted and that the dragon had been set to guard it so that no mortal might ever quench his thirst there as the neighboring inhabitants carefully avoided the spot it was now a long time not less than a hundred years or thereabouts since the monster had broken his fast and as was natural enough his appetite had grown to be enormous and was not half satisfied by the poor people whom he had just eaten up when he caught sight of cadmus therefore he set up another abominable hiss and flung back his immense jaws until his mouth looked like a great red cavern at the farther end of which were seen the legs of his last victim whom he had hardly had time to swallow  but cadmus was so enraged at the destruction of his friends that he cared neither for the size of the dragons jaws nor for his hundreds of sharp teeth drawing his sword he rushed at the monster and flung himself right into his cavernous mouth this bold method of attacking him took the dragon by surprise for in fact cadmus had leaped so far down into his throat that the rows of terrible teeth could not close upon him nor do him the least harm in the world thus though the struggle was a tremendous one and though the dragon shattered the tuft of trees into small splinters by the lashing of his tail yet as cadmus was all the while slashing and stabbing at his very vitals it was not long before the scaly wretch bethought himself of slipping away he had not gone his length however when the brave cadmus gave him a sword thrust that finished the battle and creeping out of the gateway of the creatures jaws there he beheld him still wriggling his vast bulk although there was no longer life enough in him to harm a little child  but do not you suppose that it made cadmus sorrowful to think of the melancholy fate which had befallen those poor friendly people who had followed the cow along with him it seemed as if he were doomed to lose everybody whom he loved or to see them perish in one way or another and here he was after all his toils and troubles in a solitary place with not a single human being to help him build a hut  what shall i do cried he aloud it were better for me to have been devoured by the dragon as my poor companions were  cadmus said a voice but whether it came from above or below him or whether it spoke within his own breast the young man could not tellcadmus pluck out the dragons teeth and plant them in the earth  this was a strange thing to do nor was it very easy i should imagine to dig out all those deeprooted fangs from the dead dragons jaws but cadmus toiled and tugged and after pounding the monstrous head almost to pieces with a great stone he at last collected as many teeth as might have filled a bushel or two the next thing was to plant them this likewise was a tedious piece of work especially as cadmus was already exhausted with killing the dragon and knocking his head to pieces and had nothing to dig the earth with that i know of unless it were his sword blade finally however a sufficiently large tract of ground was turned up and sown with this new kind of seed although half of the dragons teeth still remained to be planted some other day  cadmus quite out of breath stood leaning upon his sword and wondering what was to happen next he had waited but a few moments when he began to see a sight which was as great a marvel as the most marvelous thing i ever told you about  the sun was shining slantwise over the field and showed all the moist dark soil just like any other newlyplanted piece of ground all at once cadmus fancied he saw something glisten very brightly first at one spot then at another and then at a hundred and a thousand spots together soon he perceived them to be the steel heads of spears sprouting up everywhere like so many stalks of grain and continually growing taller and taller next appeared a vast number of bright sword blades thrusting themselves up in the same way a moment afterwards the whole surface of the ground was broken by a multitude of polished brass helmets coming up like a crop of enormous beans so rapidly did they grow that cadmus now discerned the fierce countenance of a man beneath every one in short before he had time to think what a wonderful affair it was he beheld an abundant harvest of what looked like human beings armed with helmets and breastplates shields swords and spears and before they were well out of the earth they brandished their weapons and clashed them one against another seeming to think little while as they had yet lived that they had wasted too much of life without a battle every tooth of the dragon had produced one of these sons of deadly mischief  up sprouted also a great many trumpeters and with the first breath that they drew they put their brazen trumpets to their lips and sounded a tremendous and earshattering blast so that the whole space just now so quiet and solitary reverberated with the clash and clang of arms the bray of warlike music and the shouts of angry men so enraged did they all look that cadmus fully expected them to put the whole world to the sword how fortunate would it be for a great conqueror if he could get a bushel of the dragons teeth to sow  cadmus said the same voice which he had before heard throw a stone into the midst of the armed men  so cadmus seized a large stone and flinging it into the middle of the earth army saw it strike the breastplate of a gigantic and fiercelooking warrior immediately on feeling the blow he seemed to take it for granted that somebody had struck him and uplifting his weapon he smote his next neighbor a blow that cleft his helmet asunder and stretched him on the ground in an instant those nearest the fallen warrior began to strike at one another with their swords and stab with their spears the confusion spread wider and wider each man smote down his brother and was himself smitten down before he had time to exult in his victory the trumpeters all the while blew their blasts shriller and shriller each soldier shouted a battle cry and often fell with it on his lips it was the strangest spectacle of causeless wrath and of mischief for no good end that had ever been witnessed but after all it was neither more foolish nor more wicked than a thousand battles that have since been fought in which men have slain their brothers with just as little reason as these children of the dragons teeth it ought to be considered too that the dragon people were made for nothing else whereas other mortals were born to love and help one another  well this memorable battle continued to rage until the ground was strewn with helmeted heads that had been cut off of all the thousands that began the fight there were only five left standing these now rushed from different parts of the field and meeting in the middle of it clashed their swords and struck at each others hearts as fiercely as ever  cadmus said the voice again bid those five warriors sheathe their swords they will help you to build the city  without hesitating an instant cadmus stepped forward with the aspect of a king and a leader and extending his drawn sword amongst them spoke to the warriors in a stern and commanding voice  sheathe your weapons said he  and forthwith feeling themselves bound to obey him the five remaining sons of the dragons teeth made him a military salute with their swords returned them to the scabbards and stood before cadmus in a rank eyeing him as soldiers eye their captain while awaiting the word of command  these five men had probably sprung from the biggest of the dragons teeth and were the boldest and strongest of the whole army they were almost giants indeed and had good need to be so else they never could have lived through so terrible a fight they still had a very furious look and if cadmus happened to glance aside would glare at one another with fire flashing out of their eyes it was strange too to observe how the earth out of which they had so lately grown was incrusted here and there on their bright breastplates and even begrimed their faces just as you may have seen it clinging to beets and carrots when pulled out of their native soil cadmus hardly knew whether to consider them as men or some odd kind of vegetable although on the whole he concluded that there was human nature in them because they were so fond of trumpets and weapons and so ready to shed blood  they looked him earnestly in the face waiting for his next order and evidently desiring no other employment than to follow him from one battlefield to another all over the wide world but cadmus was wiser than these earthborn creatures with the dragons fierceness in them and knew better how to use their strength and hardihood  come said he you are sturdy fellows make yourselves useful quarry some stones with those great swords of yours and help me to build a city  the five soldiers grumbled a little and muttered that it was their business to overthrow cities not to build them up but cadmus looked at them with a stern eye and spoke to them in a tone of authority so that they knew him for their master and never again thought of disobeying his commands they set to work in good earnest and toiled so diligently that in a very short time a city began to make its appearance at first to be sure the workmen showed a quarrelsome disposition like savage beasts they would doubtless have done one another a mischief if cadmus had not kept watch over them and quelled the fierce old serpent that lurked in their hearts when he saw it gleaming out of their wild eyes but in course of time they got accustomed to honest labor and had sense enough to feel that there was more true enjoyment in living at peace and doing good to ones neighbor than in striking at him with a twoedged sword it may not be too much to hope that the rest of mankind will by and by grow as wise and peaceable as these five earthbegrimed warriors who sprang from the dragons teeth  and now the city was built and there was a home in it for each of the workmen but the palace of cadmus was not yet erected because they had left it till the last meaning to introduce all the new improvements of architecture and make it very commodious as well as stately and beautiful after finishing the rest of their labors they all went to bed betimes in order to rise in the gray of the morning and get at least the foundation of the edifice laid before nightfall but when cadmus arose and took his way towards the site where the palace was to be built followed by his five sturdy workmen marching all in a row what do you think he saw  what should it be but the most magnificent palace that had ever been seen in the world it was built of marble and other beautiful kinds of stone and rose high into the air with a splendid dome and a portico along the front and carved pillars and everything else that befitted the habitation of a mighty king it had grown up out of the earth in almost as short a time as it had taken the armed host to spring from the dragons teeth and what made the matter more strange no seed of this stately edifice ever had been planted  when the five workmen beheld the dome with the morning sunshine making it look golden and glorious they gave a great shout  long live king cadmus they cried in his beautiful palace  and the new king with his five faithful followers at his heels shouldering their pickaxes and marching in a rank for they still had a soldierlike sort of behavior as their nature was ascended the palace steps halting at the entrance they gazed through a long vista of lofty pillars that were ranged from end to end of a great hall at the farther extremity of this hall approaching slowly towards him cadmus beheld a female figure wonderfully beautiful and adorned with a royal robe and a crown of diamonds over her golden ringlets and the richest necklace that ever a queen wore his heart thrilled with delight he fancied it his longlost sister europa now grown to womanhood coming to make him happy and to repay him with her sweet sisterly affection for all those weary wonderings in quest of her since he left king agenors palacefor the tears that he had shed on parting with phoenix and cilix and thasusfor the heartbreakings that had made the whole world seem dismal to him over his dear mothers grave  but as cadmus advanced to meet the beautiful stranger he saw that her features were unknown to him although in the little time that it required to tread along the hall he had already felt a sympathy betwixt himself and her  no cadmus said the same voice that had spoken to him in the field of the armed men this is not that dear sister europa whom you have sought so faithfully all over the wide world this is harmonia a daughter of the sky who is given you instead of sister and brothers and friend and mother you will find all those dear ones in her alone  so king cadmus dwelt in the palace with his new friend harmonia and found a great deal of comfort in his magnificent abode but would doubtless have found as much if not more in the humblest cottage by the wayside before many years went by there was a group of rosy little children but how they came thither has always been a mystery to me sporting in the great hall and on the marble steps of the palace and running joyfully to meet king cadmus when affairs of state left him at leisure to play with them they called him father and queen harmonia mother the five old soldiers of the dragons teeth grew very fond of these small urchins and were never weary of showing them how to shoulder sticks flourish wooden swords and march in military order blowing a penny trumpet or beating an abominable rubadub upon a little drum  but king cadmus lest there should be too much of the dragons tooth in his childrens disposition used to find time from his kingly duties to teach them their a b cwhich he invented for their benefit and for which many little people i am afraid are not half so grateful to him as they ought to be     circes palace  some of you have heard no doubt of the wise king ulysses and how he went to the siege of troy and how after that famous city was taken and burned he spent ten long years in trying to get back again to his own little kingdom of ithaca at one time in the course of this weary voyage he arrived at an island that looked very green and pleasant but the name of which was unknown to him for only a little while before he came thither he had met with a terrible hurricane or rather a great many hurricanes at once which drove his fleet of vessels into a strange part of the sea where neither himself nor any of his mariners had ever sailed this misfortune was entirely owing to the foolish curiosity of his shipmates who while ulysses lay asleep had untied some very bulky leathern bags in which they supposed a valuable treasure to be concealed but in each of these stout bags king aeolus the ruler of the winds had tied up a tempest and had given it to ulysses to keep in order that he might be sure of a favorable passage homeward to ithaca and when the strings were loosened forth rushed the whistling blasts like air out of a blown bladder whitening the sea with foam and scattering the vessels nobody could tell whither  immediately after escaping from this peril a still greater one had befallen him scudding before the hurricane he reached a place which as he afterwards found was called laestrygonia where some monstrous giants had eaten up many of his companions and had sunk every one of his vessels except that in which he himself sailed by flinging great masses of rock at them from the cliffs along the shore after going through such troubles as these you cannot wonder that king ulysses was glad to moor his tempestbeaten bark in a quiet cove of the green island which i began with telling you about but he had encountered so many dangers from giants and oneeyed cyclops and monsters of the sea and land that he could not help dreading some mischief even in this pleasant and seemingly solitary spot for two days therefore the poor weatherworn voyagers kept quiet and either staid on board of their vessel or merely crept along under the cliffs that bordered the shore and to keep themselves alive they dug shellfish out of the sand and sought for any little rill of fresh water that might be running towards the sea  before the two days were spent they grew very weary of this kind of life for the followers of king ulysses as you will find it important to remember were terrible gormandizers and pretty sure to grumble if they missed their regulars meals and their irregular ones besides their stock of provisions was quite exhausted and even the shellfish began to get scarce so that they had now to choose between starving to death or venturing into the interior of the island where perhaps some huge threeheaded dragon or other horrible monster had his den such misshapen creatures were very numerous in those days and nobody ever expected to make a voyage or take a journey without running more or less risk of being devoured by them  but king ulysses was a bold man as well as a prudent one and on the third morning he determined to discover what sort of a place the island was and whether it were possible to obtain a supply of food for the hungry mouths of his companions so taking a spear in his hand he clambered to the summit of a cliff and gazed round about him at a distance towards the center of the island he beheld the stately towers of what seemed to be a palace built of snowwhite marble and rising in the midst of a grove of lofty trees the thick branches of these trees stretched across the front of the edifice and more than half concealed it although from the portion which he saw ulysses judged it to be spacious and exceedingly beautiful and probably the residence of some great nobleman or prince a blue smoke went curling up from the chimney and was almost the pleasantest part of the spectacle to ulysses for from the abundance of this smoke it was reasonable to conclude that there was a good fire in the kitchen and that at dinnertime a plentiful banquet would be served up to the inhabitants of the palace and to whatever guests might happen to drop in  with so agreeable a prospect before him ulysses fancied that he could not do better than go straight to the palace gate and tell the master of it that there was a crew of poor shipwrecked mariners not far off who had eaten nothing for a day or two save a few clams and oysters and would therefore be thankful for a little food and the prince or nobleman must be a very stingy curmudgeon to be sure if at least when his own dinner was over he would not bid them welcome to the broken victuals from the table  pleasing himself with this idea king ulysses had made a few steps in the direction of the palace when there was a great twittering and chirping from the branch of a neighboring tree a moment afterwards a bird came flying towards him and hovered in the air so as almost to brush his face with its wings it was a very pretty little bird with purple wings and body and yellow legs and a circle of golden feathers round its neck and on its head a golden tuft which looked like a kings crown in miniature ulysses tried to catch the bird but it fluttered nimbly out of his reach still chirping in a piteous tone as if it could have told a lamentable story had it only been gifted with human language and when he attempted to drive it away the bird flew no farther than the bough of the next tree and again came fluttering about his head with its doleful chirp as soon as he showed a purpose of going forward  have you anything to tell me little bird asked ulysses  and he was ready to listen attentively to whatever the bird might communicate for at the siege of troy and elsewhere he had known such odd things to happen that he would not have considered it much out of the common run had this little feathered creature talked as plainly as himself  peep said the bird peep peep peweep and nothing else would it say but only peep peep peweep in a melancholy cadence and over and over and over again as often as ulysses moved forward however the bird showed the greatest alarm and did its best to drive him back with the anxious flutter of its purple wings its unaccountable behavior made him conclude at last that the bird knew of some danger that awaited him and which must needs be very terrible beyond all question since it moved even a little fowl to feel compassion for a human being so he resolved for the present to return to the vessel and tell his companions what he had seen  this appeared to satisfy the bird as soon as ulysses turned back it ran up the trunk of a tree and began to pick insects out of the bark with its long sharp bill for it was a kind of woodpecker you must know and had to get its living in the same manner as other birds of that species but every little while as it pecked at the bark of the tree the purple bird bethought itself of some secret sorrow and repeated its plaintive note of peep peep peweep  on his way to the shore ulysses had the good luck to kill a large stag by thrusting his spear into his back taking it on his shoulders for he was a remarkably strong man he lugged it along with him and flung it down before his hungry companions i have already hinted to you what gormandizers some of the comrades of king ulysses were from what is related of them i reckon that their favorite diet was pork and that they had lived upon it until a good part of their physical substance was swines flesh and their tempers and dispositions were very much akin to the hog a dish of venison however was no unacceptable meal to them especially after feeding so long on oysters and clams so beholding the dead stag they felt of its ribs in a knowing way and lost no time in kindling a fire of driftwood to cook it the rest of the day was spent in feasting and if these enormous eaters got up from table at sunset it was only because they could not scrape another morsel off the poor animals bones  the next morning their appetites were as sharp as ever they looked at ulysses as if they expected him to clamber up the cliff again and come back with another fat deer upon his shoulders instead of setting out however he summoned the whole crew together and told them it was in vain to hope that he could kill a stag every day for their dinner and therefore it was advisable to think of some other mode of satisfying their hunger  now said he when i was on the cliff yesterday i discovered that this island is inhabited at a considerable distance from the shore stood a marble palace which appeared to be very spacious and had a great deal of smoke curling out of one of its chimneys  aha muttered some of his companions smacking their lips that smoke must have come from the kitchen fire there was a good dinner on the spit and no doubt there will be as good a one today  but continued the wise ulysses you must remember my good friends our misadventure in the cavern of oneeyed polyphemus the cyclops instead of his ordinary milk diet did he not eat up two of our comrades for his supper and a couple more for breakfast and two at his supper again methinks i see him yet the hideous monster scanning us with that great red eye in the middle of his forehead to single out the fattest and then again only a few days ago did we not fall into the hands of the king of the laestrygons and those other horrible giants his subjects who devoured a great many more of us than are now left to tell you the truth if we go to yonder palace there can be no question that we shall make our appearance at the dinner table but whether seated as guests or served up as food is a point to be seriously considered  either way murmured some of the hungriest of the crew it will be better than starvation particularly if one could be sure of being well fattened beforehand and daintily cooked afterwards  that is a matter of taste said king ulysses and for my own part neither the most careful fattening nor the daintiest of cookery would reconcile me to being dished at last my proposal is therefore that we divide ourselves into two equal parties and ascertain by drawing lots which of the two shall go to the palace and beg for food and assistance if these can be obtained all is well if not and if the inhabitants prove as inhospitable as polyphemus or the laestrygons then there will but half of us perish and the remainder may set sail and escape  as nobody objected to this scheme ulysses proceeded to count the whole band and found that there were fortysix men including himself he then numbered off twentytwo of them and put eurylochus who was one of his chief officers and second only to himself in sagacity at their head ulysses took command of the remaining twentytwo men in person then taking off his helmet he put two shells into it on one of which was written go and on the other stay another person now held the helmet while ulysses and eurylochus drew out each a shell and the word go was found written on that which eurylochus had drawn in this manner it was decided that ulysses and his twentytwo men were to remain at the seaside until the other party should have found out what sort of treatment they might expect at the mysterious palace as there was no help for it eurylochus immediately set forth at the head of his twentytwo followers who went off in a very melancholy state of mind leaving their friends in hardly better spirits than themselves  no sooner had they clambered up the cliff than they discerned the tall marble towers of the palace ascending as white as snow out of the lovely green shadow of the trees which surrounded it a gush of smoke came from a chimney in the rear of the edifice this vapor rose high in the air and meeting with a breeze was wafted seaward and made to pass over the heads of the hungry mariners when peoples appetites are keen they have a very quick scent for anything savory in the wind  that smoke comes from the kitchen cried one of them turning up his nose as high as he could and snuffing eagerly and as sure as im a halfstarved vagabond i smell roast meat in it  pig roast pig said another ah the dainty little porker my mouth waters for him  let us make haste cried the others or we shall be too late for the good cheer  but scarcely had they made half a dozen steps from the edge of the cliff when a bird came fluttering to meet them it was the same pretty little bird with the purple wings and body the yellow legs the golden collar round its neck and the crownlike tuft upon its head whose behavior had so much surprised ulysses it hovered about eurylochus and almost brushed his face with its wings  peep peep peweep chirped the bird  so plaintively intelligent was the sound that it seemed as if the little creature were going to break its heart with some mighty secret that it had to tell and only this one poor note to tell it with  my pretty bird said eurylochusfor he was a wary person and let no token of harm escape his noticemy pretty bird who sent you hither and what is the message which you bring  peep peep peweep replied the bird very sorrowfully  then it flew towards the edge of the cliff and looked around at them as if exceedingly anxious that they should return whence they came eurylochus and a few of the others were inclined to turn back they could not help suspecting that the purple bird must be aware of something mischievous that would befall them at the palace and the knowledge of which affected its airy spirit with a human sympathy and sorrow but the rest of the voyagers snuffing up the smoke from the palace kitchen ridiculed the idea of returning to the vessel one of them more brutal than his fellows and the most notorious gormandizer in the crew said such a cruel and wicked thing that i wonder the mere thought did not turn him into a wild beast in shape as he already was in his nature  this troublesome and impertinent little fowl said he would make a delicate titbit to begin dinner with just one plump morsel melting away between the teeth if he comes within my reach ill catch him and give him to the palace cook to be roasted on a skewer  the words were hardly out of his mouth before the purple bird flew away crying peep peep peweep more dolorously than ever  that bird remarked eurylochus knows more than we do about what awaits us at the palace  come on then cried his comrades and well soon know as much as he does  the party accordingly went onward through the green and pleasant wood every little while they caught new glimpses of the marble palace which looked more and more beautiful the nearer they approached it they soon entered a broad pathway which seemed to be very neatly kept and which went winding along with streaks of sunshine falling across it and specks of light quivering among the deepest shadows that fell from the lofty trees it was bordered too with a great many sweetsmelling flowers such as the mariners had never seen before so rich and beautiful they were that if the shrubs grew wild here and were native in the soil then this island was surely the flower garden of the whole earth or if transplanted from some other clime it must have been from the happy islands that lay towards the golden sunset  there has been a great deal of pains foolishly wasted on these flowers observed one of the company and i tell you what he said that you may keep in mind what gormandizers they were for my part if i were the owner of the palace i would bid my gardener cultivate nothing but savory pot herbs to make a stuffing for roast meat or to flavor a stew with  well said cried the others but ill warrant you theres a kitchen garden in the rear of the palace  at one place they came to a crystal spring and paused to drink at it for want of liquor which they liked better looking into its bosom they beheld their own faces dimly reflected but so extravagantly distorted by the gush and motion of the water that each one of them appeared to be laughing at himself and all his companions so ridiculous were these images of themselves indeed that they did really laugh aloud and could hardly be grave again as soon as they wished and after they had drank they grew still merrier than before  it has a twang of the wine cask in it said one smacking his lips  make haste cried his fellows well find the wine cask itself at the palace and that will be better than a hundred crystal fountains  then they quickened their pace and capered for joy at the thought of the savory banquet at which they hoped to be guests but eurylochus told them that he felt as if he were walking in a dream  if i am really awake continued he then in my opinion we are on the point of meeting with some stranger adventure than any that befell us in the cave of polyphemus or among the gigantic maneating laestrygons or in the windy palace of king aeolus which stands on a brazenwalled island this kind of dreamy feeling always comes over me before any wonderful occurrence if you take my advice you will turn back  no no answered his comrades snuffing the air in which the scent from the palace kitchen was now very perceptible we would not turn back though we were certain that the king of the laestrygons as big as a mountain would sit at the head of the table and huge polyphemus the oneeyed cyclops at its foot  at length they came within full sight of the palace which proved to be very large and lofty with a great number of airy pinnacles upon its roof though it was midday and the sun shone brightly over the marble front yet its snowy whiteness and its fantastic style of architecture made it look unreal like the frost work on a window pane or like the shapes of castles which one sees among the clouds by moonlight but just then a puff of wind brought down the smoke of the kitchen chimney among them and caused each man to smell the odor of the dish that he liked best and after scenting it they thought everything else moonshine and nothing real save this palace and save the banquet that was evidently ready to be served up in it  so they hastened their steps towards the portal but had not got half way across the wide lawn when a pack of lions tigers and wolves came bounding to meet them the terrified mariners started back expecting no better fate than to be torn to pieces and devoured to their surprise and joy however these wild beasts merely capered around them wagging their tails offering their heads to be stroked and patted and behaving just like so many wellbred house dogs when they wish to express their delight at meeting their master or their masters friends the biggest lion licked the feet of eurylochus and every other lion and every wolf and tiger singled out one of his two and twenty followers whom the beast fondled as if he loved him better than a beef bone  but for all that eurylochus imagined that he saw something fierce and savage in their eyes nor would he have been surprised at any moment to feel the big lions terrible claws or to see each of the tigers make a deadly spring or each wolf leap at the throat of the man whom he had fondled their mildness seemed unreal and a mere freak but their savage nature was as true as their teeth and claws  nevertheless the men went safely across the lawn with the wild beasts frisking about them and doing no manner of harm although as they mounted the steps of the palace you might possibly have heard a low growl particularly from the wolves as if they thought it a pity after all to let the strangers pass without so much as tasting what they were made of  eurylochus and his followers now passed under a lofty portal and looked through the open doorway into the interior of the palace the first thing that they saw was a spacious hall and a fountain in the middle of it gushing up towards the ceiling out of a marble basin and falling back into it with a continual plash the water of this fountain as it spouted upward was constantly taking new shapes not very distinctly but plainly enough for a nimble fancy to recognize what they were now it was the shape of a man in a long robe the fleecy whiteness of which was made out of the fountains spray now it was a lion or a tiger or a wolf or an ass or as often as anything else a hog wallowing in the marble basin as if it were his sty it was either magic or some very curious machinery that caused the gushing waterspout to assume all these forms but before the strangers had time to look closely at this wonderful sight their attention was drawn off by a very sweet and agreeable sound a womans voice was singing melodiously in another room of the palace and with her voice was mingled the noise of a loom at which she was probably seated weaving a rich texture of cloth and intertwining the high and low sweetness of her voice into a rich tissue of harmony  by and by the song came to an end and then all at once there were several feminine voices talking airily and cheerfully with now and then a merry burst of laughter such as you may always hear when three or four young women sit at work together  what a sweet song that was exclaimed one of the voyagers  too sweet indeed answered eurylochus shaking his head yet it was not so sweet as the song of the sirens those birdlike damsels who wanted to tempt us on the rocks so that our vessel might be wrecked and our bones left whitening along the shore  but just listen to the pleasant voices of those maidens and that buzz of the loom as the shuttle passes to and fro said another comrade what a domestic household homelike sound it is ah before that weary siege of troy i used to hear the buzzing loom and the womens voices under my own roof shall i never hear them again nor taste those nice little savory dishes which my dearest wife knew how to serve up  tush we shall fare better here said another but how innocently those women are babbling together without guessing that we overhear them and mark that richest voice of all so pleasant and so familiar but which yet seems to have the authority of a mistress among them let us show ourselves at once what harm can the lady of the palace and her maidens do to mariners and warriors like us  remember said eurylochus that it was a young maiden who beguiled three of our friends into the palace of the king of the laestrygons who ate up one of them in the twinkling of an eye  no warning or persuasion however had any effect on his companions they went up to a pair of folding doors at the farther end of the hall and throwing them wide open passed into the next room eurylochus meanwhile had stepped behind a pillar in the short moment while the folding doors opened and closed again he caught a glimpse of a very beautiful woman rising from the loom and coming to meet the poor weatherbeaten wanderers with a hospitable smile and her hand stretched out in welcome there were four other young women who joined their hands and danced merrily forward making gestures of obeisance to the strangers they were only less beautiful than the lady who seemed to be their mistress yet eurylochus fancied that one of them had seagreen hair and that the closefitting bodice of a second looked like the bark of a tree and that both the others had something odd in their aspect although he could not quite determine what it was in the little while that he had to examine them  the folding doors swung quickly back and left him standing behind the pillar in the solitude of the outer hall there eurylochus waited until he was quite weary and listened eagerly to every sound but without hearing anything that could help him to guess what had become of his friends footsteps it is true seemed to be passing and repassing in other parts of the palace then there was a clatter of silver dishes or golden ones which made him imagine a rich feast in a splendid banqueting hall but by and by he heard a tremendous grunting and squealing and then a sudden scampering like that of small hard hoofs over a marble floor while the voices of the mistress and her four handmaidens were screaming all together in tones of anger and derision eurylochus could not conceive what had happened unless a drove of swine had broken into the palace attracted by the smell of the feast chancing to cast his eyes at the fountain he saw that it did not shift its shape as formerly nor looked either like a longrobed man or a lion a tiger a wolf or an ass it looked like nothing but a hog which lay wallowing in the marble basin and filled it from brim to brim  but we must leave the prudent eurylochus waiting in the outer hall and follow his friends into the inner secrecy of the palace as soon as the beautiful woman saw them she arose from the loom as i have told you and came forward smiling and stretching out her hand she took the hand of the foremost among them and bade him and the whole party welcome  you have been long expected my good friends said she i and my maidens are well acquainted with you although you do not appear to recognize us look at this piece of tapestry and judge if your faces must not have been familiar to us  so the voyagers examined the web of cloth which the beautiful woman had been weaving in her loom and to their vast astonishment they saw their own figures perfectly represented in different colored threads it was a lifelike picture of their recent adventures showing them in the cave of polyphemus and how they had put out his one great moony eye while in another part of the tapestry they were untying the leathern bags puffed out with contrary winds and farther on they beheld themselves scampering away from the gigantic king of the laestrygons who had caught one of them by the leg lastly there they were sitting on the desolate shore of this very island hungry and downcast and looking ruefully at the bare bones of the stag which they devoured yesterday this was as far as the work had yet proceeded but when the beautiful woman should again sit down at her loom she would probably make a picture of what had since happened to the strangers and of what was now going to happen  you see she said that i know all about your troubles and you cannot doubt that i desire to make you happy for as long a time as you may remain with me for this purpose my honored guests i have ordered a banquet to be prepared fish fowl and flesh roasted and in luscious stews and seasoned i trust to all your tastes are ready to be served up if your appetites tell you it is dinner time then come with me to the festal saloon  at this kind invitation the hungry mariners were quite overjoyed and one of them taking upon himself to be spokesman assured their hospitable hostess that any hour of the day was dinner time with them whenever they could get flesh to put in the pot and fire to boil it with so the beautiful woman led the way and the four maidens one of them had seagreen hair another a bodice of oak bark a third sprinkled a shower of water drops from her fingers ends and the fourth had some other oddity which i have forgotten all these followed behind and hurried the guests along until they entered a magnificent saloon it was built in a perfect oval and lighted from a crystal dome above around the walls were ranged two and twenty thrones overhung by canopies of crimson and gold and provided with the softest of cushions which were tasselled and fringed with gold cord each of the strangers was invited to sit down and there they were two and twenty stormbeaten mariners in worn and tattered garb sitting on two and twenty cushioned and canopied thrones so rich and gorgeous that the proudest monarch had nothing more splendid in his stateliest hall  then you might have seen the guests nodding winking with one eye and leaning from one throne to another to communicate their satisfaction in hoarse whispers  our good hostess has made kings of us all said one ha do you smell the feast ill engage it will be fit to set before two and twenty kings  i hope said another it will be mainly good substantial joints sirloins spareribs and hinder quarters without too many kickshaws if i thought the good lady would not take it amiss i should call for a fat slice of fried bacon to begin with  ah the gluttons and gormandizers you see how it was with them in the loftiest seats of dignity on royal thrones they could think of nothing but their greedy appetite which was the portion of their nature that they shared with wolves and swine so that they resembled those vilest of animals far more than they did kingsif indeed kings were what they ought to be  but the beautiful woman now clapped her hands and immediately there entered a train of two and twenty serving man bringing dishes of the richest food all hot from the kitchen fire and sending up such a steam that it hung like a cloud below the crystal dome of the saloon an equal number of attendants brought great flagons of wine of various kinds some of which sparkled as it was poured out and went bubbling down the throat while of other sorts the purple liquor was so clear that you could see the wrought figures at the bottom of the goblet while the servants supplied the two and twenty guests with food and drink the hostess and her four maidens went from one throne to another exhorting them to eat their fill and to quaff wine abundantly and thus to recompense themselves at this one banquet for the many days when they had gone without a dinner but whenever the mariners were not looking at them which was pretty often as they looked chiefly into the basins and platters the beautiful woman and her damsels turned aside and laughed even the servants as they knelt down to present the dishes might be seen to grin and sneer while the guests were helping themselves to the offered dainties  and once in a while the strangers seemed to taste something that they did not like  here is an odd kind of spice in this dish said one i cant say it quite suits my palate down it goes however  send a good draught of wine down your throat said his comrade on the next throne that is the stuff to make this sort of cookery relish well though i must needs say the wine has a queer taste too but the more i drink of it the better i like the flavor  whatever little fault they might find with the dishes they sat at dinner a prodigiously long while and it would really have made you ashamed to see how they swilled down the liquor and gobbled up the food they sat on golden thrones to be sure but they behaved like pigs in a sty and if they had had their wits about them they might have guessed that this was the opinion of their beautiful hostess and her maidens it brings a blush into my face to reckon up in my own mind what mountains of meat and pudding and what gallons of wine these two and twenty guzzlers and gormandizers ate and drank they forgot all about their homes and their wives and children and all about ulysses and everything else except this banquet at which they wanted to keep feasting forever but at length they began to give over from mere incapacity to hold any more  that last bit of fat is too much for me said one  and i have not room for another morsel said his next neighbor heaving a sigh what a pity my appetite is as sharp as ever  in short they all left off eating and leaned back on their thrones with such a stupid and helpless aspect as made them ridiculous to behold when their hostess saw this she laughed aloud so did her four damsels so did the two and twenty serving men that bore the dishes and their two and twenty fellows that poured out the wine and the louder they all laughed the more stupid and helpless did the two and twenty gormandizers look then the beautiful woman took her stand in the middle of the saloon and stretching out a slender rod it had been all the while in her hand although they never noticed it till this moment she turned it from one guest to another until each had felt it pointed at himself beautiful as her face was and though there was a smile on it it looked just as wicked and mischievous as the ugliest serpent that ever was seen and fatwitted as the voyagers had made themselves they began to suspect that they had fallen into the power of an evilminded enchantress  wretches cried she you have abused a ladys hospitality and in this princely saloon your behavior has been suited to a hogpen you are already swine in everything but the human form which you disgrace and which i myself should be ashamed to keep a moment longer were you to share it with me but it will require only the slightest exercise of magic to make the exterior conform to the hoggish disposition assume your proper shapes gormandizers and begone to the sty  uttering these last words she waved her wand and stamping her foot imperiously each of the guests was struck aghast at beholding instead of his comrades in human shape one and twenty hogs sitting on the same number of golden thrones each man as he still supposed himself to be essayed to give a cry of surprise but found that he could merely grunt and that in a word he was just such another beast as his companions it looked so intolerably absurd to see hogs on cushioned thrones that they made haste to wallow down upon all fours like other swine they tried to groan and beg for mercy but forthwith emitted the most awful grunting and squealing that ever came out of swinish throats they would have wrung their hands in despair but attempting to do so grew all the more desperate for seeing themselves squatted on their hams and pawing the air with their fore trotters dear me what pendulous ears they had what little red eyes half buried in fat and what long snouts instead of grecian noses  but brutes as they certainly were they yet had enough of human nature in them to be shocked at their own hideousness and still intending to groan they uttered a viler grunt and squeal than before so harsh and earpiercing it was that you would have fancied a butcher was sticking his knife into each of their throats or at the very least that somebody was pulling every hog by his funny little twist of a tail  begone to your sty cried the enchantress giving them some smart strokes with her wand and then she turned to the serving mendrive out these swine and throw down some acorns for them to eat  the door of the saloon being flung open the drove of hogs ran in all directions save the right one in accordance with their hoggish perversity but were finally driven into the back yard of the palace it was a sight to bring tears into ones eyes and i hope none of you will be cruel enough to laugh at it to see the poor creatures go snuffing along picking up here a cabbage leaf and there a turnip top and rooting their noses in the earth for whatever they could find in their sty moreover they behaved more piggishly than the pigs that had been born so for they bit and snorted at one another put their feet in the trough and gobbled up their victuals in a ridiculous hurry and when there was nothing more to be had they made a great pile of themselves among some unclean straw and fell fast asleep if they had any human reason left it was just enough to keep them wondering when they should be slaughtered and what quality of bacon they should make  meantime as i told you before eurylochus had waited and waited and waited in the entrance hall of the palace without being able to comprehend what had befallen his friends at last when the swinish uproar resounded through the palace and when he saw the image of a hog in the marble basin he thought it best to hasten back to the vessel and inform the wise ulysses of these marvelous occurrences so he ran as fast as he could down the steps and never stopped to draw breath till he reached the shore  why do you come alone asked king ulysses as soon as he saw him where are your two and twenty comrades  at these questions eurylochus burst into tears  alas he cried i greatly fear that we shall never see one of their faces again  then he told ulysses all that had happened as far as he knew it and added that he suspected the beautiful woman to be a vile enchantress and the marble palace magnificent as it looked to be only a dismal cavern in reality as for his companions he could not imagine what had become of them unless they had been given to the swine to be devoured alive at this intelligence all the voyagers were greatly affrighted but ulysses lost no time in girding on his sword and hanging his bow and quiver over his shoulders and taking a spear in his right hand when his followers saw their wise leader making these preparations they inquired whither he was going and earnestly besought him not to leave them  you are our king cried they and what is more you are the wisest man in the whole world and nothing but your wisdom and courage can get us out of this danger if you desert us and go to the enchanted palace you will suffer the same fate as our poor companions and not a soul of us will ever see our dear ithaca again  as i am your king answered ulysses and wiser than any of you it is therefore the more my duty to see what has befallen our comrades and whether anything can yet be done to rescue them wait for me here until tomorrow if i do not then return you must hoist sail and endeavor to find your way to our native land for my part i am answerable for the fate of these poor mariners who have stood by my side in battle and been so often drenched to the skin along with me by the same tempestuous surges i will either bring them back with me or perish  had his followers dared they would have detained him by force but king ulysses frowned sternly on them and shook his spear and bade them stop him at their peril seeing him so determined they let him go and sat down on the sand as disconsolate a set of people as could be waiting and praying for his return  it happened to ulysses just as before that when he had gone a few steps from the edge of the cliff the purple bird came fluttering towards him crying peep peep peweep and using all the art it could to persuade him to go no farther  what mean you little bird cried ulysses you are arrayed like a king in purple and gold and wear a golden crown upon your head is it because i too am a king that you desire so earnestly to speak with me if you can talk in human language say what you would have me do  peep answered the purple bird very dolorously peep peep pewee  certainly there lay some heavy anguish at the little birds heart and it was a sorrowful predicament that he could not at least have the consolation of telling what it was but ulysses had no time to waste in trying to get at the mystery he therefore quickened his pace and had gone a good way along the pleasant wood path when there met him a young man of very brisk and intelligent aspect and clad in a rather singular garb he wore a short cloak and a sort of cap that seemed to be furnished with a pair of wings and from the lightness of his step you would have supposed that there might likewise be wings on his feet to enable him to walk still better for he was always on one journey or another he carried a winged staff around which two serpents were wriggling and twisting in short i have said enough to make you guess that it was quicksilver and ulysses who knew him of old and had learned a great deal of his wisdom from him recognized him in a moment  whither are you going in such a hurry wise ulysses asked quicksilver do you not know that this island is enchanted the wicked enchantress whose name is circe the sister of king aetes dwells in the marble palace which you see yonder among the trees by her magic arts she changes every human being into the brute beast or fowl whom he happens most to resemble  that little bird which met me at the edge of the cliff exclaimed ulysses was he a human being once  yes answered quicksilver he was once a king named picus and a pretty good sort of a king too only rather too proud of his purple robe and his crown and the golden chain about his neck so he was forced to take the shape of a gaudyfeathered bird the lions and wolves and tigers who will come running to meet you in front of the palace were formerly fierce and cruel men resembling in their disposition the wild beasts whose forms they now rightfully wear  and my poor companions said ulysses have they undergone a similar change through the arts of this wicked circe  you well know what gormandizers they were replied quicksilver and rogue that he was he could not help laughing at the joke so you will not be surprised to hear that they have all taken the shapes of swine if circe had never done anything worse i really should not think her so very much to blame  but can i do nothing to help them inquired ulysses  it will require all your wisdom said quicksilver and a little of my own into the bargain to keep your royal and sagacious self from being transformed into a fox but do as i bid you and the matter may end better than it has begun  while he was speaking quicksilver seemed to be in search of something he went stooping along the ground and soon laid his hand on a little plant with a snowwhite flower which he plucked and smelt of ulysses had been looking at that very spot only just before and it appeared to him that the plant had burst into full flower the instant when quicksilver touched it with his fingers  take this flower king ulysses said he guard it as you do your eyesight for i can assure you it is exceedingly rare and precious and you might seek the whole earth over without ever finding another like it keep it in your hand and smell of it frequently after you enter the palace and while you are talking with the enchantress especially when she offers you food or a draught of wine out of her goblet be careful to fill your nostrils with the flowers fragrance follow these directions and you may defy her magic arts to change you into a fox  quicksilver then gave him some further advice how to behave and bidding him be bold and prudent again assured him that powerful as circe was he would have a fair prospect of coming safely out of her enchanted palace after listening attentively ulysses thanked his good friend and resumed his way but he had taken only a few steps when recollecting some other questions which he wished to ask he turned round again and beheld nobody on the spot where quicksilver had stood for that winged cap of his and those winged shoes with the help of the winged staff had carried him quickly out of sight  when ulysses reached the lawn in front of the palace the lions and other savage animals came bounding to meet him and would have fawned upon him and licked his feet but the wise king struck at them with his long spear and sternly bade them begone out of his path for he knew that they had once been bloodthirsty men and would now tear him limb from limb instead of fawning upon him could they do the mischief that was in their hearts the wild beasts yelped and glared at him and stood at a distance while he ascended the palace steps  on entering the hall ulysses saw the magic fountain in the center of it the upgushing water had now again taken the shape of a man in a long white fleecy robe who appeared to be making gestures of welcome the king likewise heard the noise of the shuttle in the loom and the sweet melody of the beautiful womans song and then the pleasant voices of herself and the four maidens talking together with peals of merry laughter intermixed but ulysses did not waste much time in listening to the laughter or the song he leaned his spear against one of the pillars of the hall and then after loosening his sword in the scabbard stepped boldly forward and threw the folding doors wide open the moment she beheld his stately figure standing in the doorway the beautiful woman rose from the loom and ran to meet him with a glad smile throwing its sunshine over her face and both her hands extended  welcome brave stranger cried she we were expecting you  and the nymph with the seagreen hair made a courtesy down to the ground and likewise bade him welcome so did her sister with the bodice of oaken bark and she that sprinkled dewdrops from her fingers ends and the fourth one with some oddity which i cannot remember and circe as the beautiful enchantress was called who had deluded so many persons that she did not doubt of being able to delude ulysses not imagining how wise he was again addressed him  your companions said she have already been received into my palace and have enjoyed the hospitable treatment to which the propriety of their behavior so well entitles them if such be your pleasure you shall first take some refreshment and then join them in the elegant apartment which they now occupy see i and my maidens have been weaving their figures into this piece of tapestry  she pointed to the web of beautifullywoven cloth in the loom circe and the four nymphs must have been very diligently at work since the arrival of the mariners for a great many yards of tapestry had now been wrought in addition to what i before described in this new part ulysses saw his two and twenty friends represented as sitting on cushions and canopied thrones greedily devouring dainties and quaffing deep draughts of wine the work had not yet gone any further o no indeed the enchantress was far too cunning to let ulysses see the mischief which her magic arts had since brought upon the gormandizers  as for yourself valiant sir said circe judging by the dignity of your aspect i take you to be nothing less than a king deign to follow me and you shall be treated as befits your rank  so ulysses followed her into the oval saloon where his two and twenty comrades had devoured the banquet which ended so disastrously for themselves but all this while he had held the snowwhite flower in his hand and had constantly smelt of it while circe was speaking and as he crossed the threshold of the saloon he took good care to inhale several long and deep snuffs of its fragrance instead of two and twenty thrones which had before been ranged around the wall there was now only a single throne in the center of the apartment but this was surely the most magnificent seat that ever a king or an emperor reposed himself upon all made of chased gold studded with precious stones with a cushion that looked like a soft heap of living roses and overhung by a canopy of sunlight which circe knew how to weave into drapery the enchantress took ulysses by the hand and made him sit down upon this dazzling throne then clapping her hands she summoned the chief butler  bring hither said she the goblet that is set apart for kings to drink out of and fill it with the same delicious wine which my royal brother king aetes praised so highly when he last visited me with my fair daughter medea that good and amiable child were she now here it would delight her to see me offering this wine to my honored guest  but ulysses while the butler was gone for the wine held the snowwhite flower to his nose  is it a wholesome wine he asked  at this the four maidens tittered whereupon the enchantress looked round at them with an aspect of severity  it is the wholesomest juice that ever was squeezed out of the grape said she for instead of disguising a man as other liquor is apt to do it brings him to his true self and shows him as he ought to be  the chief butler liked nothing better than to see people turned into swine or making any kind of a beast of themselves so he made haste to bring the royal goblet filled with a liquid as bright as gold and which kept sparkling upward and throwing a sunny spray over the brim but delightfully as the wine looked it was mingled with the most potent enchantments that circe knew how to concoct for every drop of the pure grape juice there were two drops of the pure mischief and the danger of the thing was that the mischief made it taste all the better the mere smell of the bubbles which effervesced at the brim was enough to turn a mans beard into pigs bristles or make a lions claws grow out of his fingers or a foxs brush behind him  drink my noble guest said circe smiling as she presented him with the goblet you will find in this draught a solace for all your troubles  king ulysses took the goblet with his right hand while with his left he held the snowwhite flower to his nostrils and drew in so long a breath that his lungs were quite filled with its pure and simple fragrance then drinking off all the wine he looked the enchantress calmly in the face  wretch cried circe giving him a smart stroke with her wand how dare you keep your human shape a moment longer take the form of the brute whom you most resemble if a hog go join your fellowswine in the sty if a lion a wolf a tiger go howl with the wild beasts on the lawn if a fox go exercise your craft in stealing poultry thou hast quaffed off my wine and canst be man no longer  but such was the virtue of the snowwhite flower instead of wallowing down from his throne in swinish shape or taking any other brutal form ulysses looked even more manly and kinglike than before he gave the magic goblet a toss and sent it clashing over the marble floor to the farthest end of the saloon then drawing his sword he seized the enchantress by her beautiful ringlets and made a gesture as if he meant to strike off her head at one blow  wicked circe cried he in a terrible voice this sword shall put an end to thy enchant meets thou shalt die vile wretch and do no more mischief in the world by tempting human beings into the vices which make beasts of them  the tone and countenance of ulysses were so awful and his sword gleamed so brightly and seemed to have so intolerably keen an edge that circe was almost killed by the mere fright without waiting for a blow the chief butler scrambled out of the saloon picking up the golden goblet as he went and the enchantress and the four maidens fell on their knees wringing their hands and screaming for mercy  spare me cried circe spare me royal and wise ulysses for now i know that thou art he of whom quicksilver forewarned me the most prudent of mortals against whom no enchantments can prevail thou only couldst have conquered circe spare me wisest of men i will show thee true hospitality and even give myself to be thy slave and this magnificent palace to be henceforth thy home  the four nymphs meanwhile were making a most piteous ado and especially the ocean nymph with the seagreen hair wept a great deal of salt water and the fountain nymph besides scattering dewdrops from her fingers ends nearly melted away into tears but ulysses would not be pacified until circe had taken a solemn oath to change back his companions and as many others as he should direct from their present forms of beast or bird into their former shapes of men  on these conditions said he i consent to spare your life otherwise you must die upon the spot  with a drawn sword hanging over her the enchantress would readily have consented to do as much good as she had hitherto done mischief however little she might like such employment she therefore led ulysses out of the back entrance of the palace and showed him the swine in their sty there were about fifty of these unclean beasts in the whole herd and though the greater part were hogs by birth and education there was wonderfully little difference to be seen betwixt them and their new brethren who had so recently worn the human shape to speak critically indeed the latter rather carried the thing to excess and seemed to make it a point to wallow in the miriest part of the sty and otherwise to outdo the original swine in their own natural vocation when men once turn to brutes the trifle of mans wit that remains in them adds tenfold to their brutality  the comrades of ulysses however had not quite lost the remembrance of having formerly stood erect when he approached the sty two and twenty enormous swine separated themselves from the herd and scampered towards him with such a chorus of horrible squealing as made him clap both hands to his ears and yet they did not seem to know what they wanted nor whether they were merely hungry or miserable from some other cause it was curious in the midst of their distress to observe them thrusting their noses into the mire in quest of something to eat the nymph with the bodice of oaken bark she was the hamadryad of an oak threw a handful of acorns among them and the two and twenty hogs scrambled and fought for the prize as if they had tasted not so much as a noggin of sour milk for a twelvemonth  these must certainly be my comrades said ulysses i recognize their dispositions they are hardly worth the trouble of changing them into the human form again nevertheless we will have it done lest their bad example should corrupt the other hogs let them take their original shapes therefore dame circe if your skill is equal to the task it will require greater magic i trow than it did to make swine of them  so circe waved her wand again and repeated a few magic words at the sound of which the two and twenty hogs pricked up their pendulous ears it was a wonder to behold how their snouts grew shorter and shorter and their mouths which they seemed to be sorry for because they could not gobble so expeditiously smaller and smaller and how one and another began to stand upon his hind legs and scratch his nose with his fore trotters at first the spectators hardly knew whether to call them hogs or men but by and by came to the conclusion that they rather resembled the latter finally there stood the twentytwo comrades of ulysses looking pretty much the same as when they left the vessel  you must not imagine however that the swinish quality had entirely gone out of them when once it fastens itself into a persons character it is very difficult getting rid of it this was proved by the hamadryad who being exceedingly fond of mischief threw another handful of acorns before the twentytwo newlyrestored people whereupon down they wallowed in a moment and gobbled them up in a very shameful way then recollecting themselves they scrambled to their feet and looked more than commonly foolish  thanks noble ulysses they cried from brute beasts you have restored us to the condition of men again  do not put yourselves to the trouble of thanking me said the wise king i fear i have done but little for you  to say the truth there was a suspicious kind of a grunt in their voices and for a long time afterwards they spoke gruffly and were apt to set up a squeal  it must depend on your own future behavior added ulysses whether you do not find your way back to the sty  at this moment the note of a bird sounded from the branch of a neighboring tree  peep peep peweee  it was the purple bird who all this while had been sitting over their heads watching what was going forward and hoping that ulysses would remember how he had done his utmost to keep him and his followers out of harms way ulysses ordered circe instantly to make a king of this good little fowl and leave him exactly as she found him hardly were the words spoken and before the bird had time to utter another peweep king picus leaped down from the bough of a tree as majestic a sovereign as any in the world dressed in a long purple robe and gorgeous yellow stockings with a splendidly wrought collar about his neck and a golden crown upon his head he and king ulysses exchanged with one another the courtesies which belong to their elevated rank but from that time forth king picus was no longer proud of his crown and his trappings of royalty nor of the fact of his being a king he felt himself merely the upper servant of his people and that it must be his lifelong labor to make them better and happier  as for the lions tigers and wolves though circe would have restored them to their former shapes at his slightest word ulysses thought it advisable that they should remain as they now were and thus give warning of their cruel dispositions instead of going about under the guise of men and pretending to human sympathies while their hearts had the bloodthirstiness of wild beasts so he let them howl as much as they liked but never troubled his head about them and when everything was settled according to his pleasure he sent to summon the remainder of his comrades whom he had left at the seashore these being arrived with the prudent eurylochus at their head they all made themselves comfortable in circes enchanted palace until quite rested and refreshed from the toils and hardships of their voyage     the pomegranate seeds  mother ceres was exceedingly fond of her daughter proserpina and seldom let her go alone into the fields but just at the time when my story begins the good lady was very busy because she had the care of the wheat and the indian corn and the rye and barley and in short of the crops of every kind all over the earth and as the season had thus far been uncommonly backward it was necessary to make the harvest ripen more speedily than usual so she put on her turban made of poppies a kind of flower which she was always noted for wearing and got into her car drawn by a pair of winged dragons and was just ready to set off  dear mother said proserpina i shall be very lonely while you are away may i not run down to the shore and ask some of the sea nymphs to come up out of the waves and play with me  yes child answered mother ceres the sea nymphs are good creatures and will never lead you into any harm but you must take care not to stray away from them nor go wandering about the fields by yourself young girls without their mothers to take care of them are very apt to get into mischief  the child promised to be as prudent as if she were a grownup woman and by the time the winged dragons had whirled the car out of sight she was already on the shore calling to the sea nymphs to come and play with her they knew proserpinas voice and were not long in showing their glistening faces and seagreen hair above the water at the bottom of which was their home they brought along with them a great many beautiful shells and sitting down on the moist sand where the surf wave broke over them they busied themselves in making a necklace which they hung round proserpinas neck by way of showing her gratitude the child besought them to go with her a little way into the fields so that they might gather abundance of flowers with which she would make each of her kind playmates a wreath  o no dear proserpina cried the sea nymphs we dare not go with you upon the dry land we are apt to grow faint unless at every breath we can snuff up the salt breeze of the ocean and dont you see how careful we are to let the surf wave break over us every moment or two so as to keep ourselves comfortably moist if it were not for that we should look like bunches of uprooted seaweed dried in the sun  it is a great pity said proserpina but do you wait for me here and i will run and gather my apron full of flowers and be back again before the surf wave has broken ten times over you i long to make you some wreaths that shall be as lovely as this necklace of many colored shells  we will wait then answered the sea nymphs but while you are gone we may as well lie down on a bank of soft sponge under the water the air today is a little too dry for our comfort but we will pop up our heads every few minutes to see if you are coming  the young proserpina ran quickly to a spot where only the day before she had seen a great many flowers these however were now a little past their bloom and wishing to give her friends the freshest and loveliest blossoms she strayed farther into the fields and found some that made her scream with delight never had she met with such exquisite flowers beforeviolets so large and fragrantroses with so rich and delicate a blushsuch superb hyacinths and such aromatic pinksand many others some of which seemed to be of new shapes and colors two or three times moreover she could not help thinking that a tuft of most splendid flowers had suddenly sprouted out of the earth before her very eyes as if on purpose to tempt her a few steps farther proserpinas apron was soon filled and brimming over with delightful blossoms she was on the point of turning back in order to rejoin the sea nymphs and sit with them on the moist sands all twining wreaths together but a little farther on what should she behold it was a large shrub completely covered with the most magnificent flowers in the world  the darlings cried proserpina and then she thought to herself i was looking at that spot only a moment ago how strange it is that i did not see the flowers  the nearer she approached the shrub the more attractive it looked until she came quite close to it and then although its beauty was richer than words can tell she hardly knew whether to like it or not it bore above a hundred flowers of the most brilliant hues and each different from the others but all having a kind of resemblance among themselves which showed them to be sister blossoms but there was a deep glossy luster on the leaves of the shrub and on the petals of the flowers that made proserpina doubt whether they might not be poisonous to tell you the truth foolish as it may seem she was half inclined to turn round and run away  what a silly child i am thought she taking courage it is really the most beautiful shrub that ever sprang out of the earth i will pull it up by the roots and carry it home and plant it in my mothers garden  holding up her apron full of flowers with her left hand proserpina seized the large shrub with the other and pulled and pulled but was hardly able to loosen the soil about its roots what a deeprooted plant it was again the girl pulled with all her might and observed that the earth began to stir and crack to some distance around the stem she gave another pull but relaxed her hold fancying that there was a rumbling sound right beneath her feet did the roots extend down into some enchanted cavern then laughing at herself for so childish a notion she made another effort up came the shrub and proserpina staggered back holding the stem triumphantly in her hand and gazing at the deep hole which its roots had left in the soil  much to her astonishment this hole kept spreading wider and wider and growing deeper and deeper until it really seemed to have no bottom and all the while there came a rumbling noise out of its depths louder and louder and nearer and nearer and sounding like the tramp of horses hoofs and the rattling of wheels too much frightened to run away she stood straining her eyes into this wonderful cavity and soon saw a team of four sable horses snorting smoke out of their nostrils and tearing their way out of the earth with a splendid golden chariot whirling at their heels they leaped out of the bottomless hole chariot and all and there they were tossing their black manes flourishing their black tails and curvetting with every one of their hoofs off the ground at once close by the spot where proserpina stood in the chariot sat the figure of a man richly dressed with a crown on his head all flaming with diamonds he was of a noble aspect and rather handsome but looked sullen and discontented and he kept rubbing his eyes and shading them with his hand as if he did not live enough in the sunshine to be very fond of its light  as soon as this personage saw the affrighted proserpina he beckoned her to come a little nearer  do not be afraid said he with as cheerful a smile as he knew how to put on come will you not like to ride a little way with me in my beautiful chariot  but proserpina was so alarmed that she wished for nothing but to get out of his reach and no wonder the stranger did not look remarkably goodnatured in spite of his smile and as for his voice its tones were deep and stern and sounded as much like the rumbling of an earthquake underground than anything else as is always the case with children in trouble proserpinas first thought was to call for her mother  mother mother ceres cried she all in a tremble come quickly and save me  but her voice was too faint for her mother to hear indeed it is most probable that ceres was then a thousand miles off making the corn grow in some far distant country nor could it have availed her poor daughter even had she been within hearing for no sooner did proserpina begin to cry out than the stranger leaped to the ground caught the child in his arms and again mounted the chariot shook the reins and shouted to the four black horses to set off they immediately broke into so swift a gallop that it seemed rather like flying through the air than running along the earth in a moment proserpina lost sight of the pleasant vale of enna in which she had always dwelt another instant and even the summit of mount aetna had become so blue in the distance that she could scarcely distinguish it from the smoke that gushed out of its crater but still the poor child screamed and scattered her apron full of flowers along the way and left a long cry trailing behind the chariot and many mothers to whose ears it came ran quickly to see if any mischief had befallen their children but mother ceres was a great way off and could not hear the cry  as they rode on the stranger did his best to soothe her  why should you be so frightened my pretty child said he trying to soften his rough voice i promise not to do you any harm what you have been gathering flowers wait till we come to my palace and i will give you a garden full of prettier flowers than those all made of pearls and diamonds and rubies can you guess who i am they call my name pluto and i am the king of diamonds and all other precious stones every atom of the gold and silver that lies under the earth belongs to me to say nothing of the copper and iron and of the coal mines which supply me with abundance of fuel do you see this splendid crown upon my head you may have it for a plaything o we shall be very good friends and you will find me more agreeable than you expect when once we get out of this troublesome sunshine  let me go home cried proserpina let me go home  my home is better than your mothers answered king pluto it is a palace all made of gold with crystal windows and because there is little or no sunshine thereabouts the apartments are illuminated with diamond lamps you never saw anything half so magnificent as my throne if you like you may sit down on it and be my little queen and i will sit on the footstool  i dont care for golden palaces and thrones sobbed proserpina oh my mother my mother carry me back to my mother  but king pluto as he called himself only shouted to his steeds to go faster  pray do not be foolish proserpina said he in rather a sullen tone i offer you my palace and my crown and all the riches that are under the earth and you treat me as if i were doing you an injury the one thing which my palace needs is a merry little maid to run upstairs and down and cheer up the rooms with her smile and this is what you must do for king pluto  never answered proserpina looking as miserable as she could i shall never smile again till you set me down at my mothers door  but she might just as well have talked to the wind that whistled past them for pluto urged on his horses and went faster than ever proserpina continued to cry out and screamed so long and so loudly that her poor little voice was almost screamed away and when it was nothing but a whisper she happened to cast her eyes over a great broad field of waving grainand whom do you think she saw who but mother ceres making the corn grow and too busy to notice the golden chariot as it went rattling along the child mustered all her strength and gave one more scream but was out of sight before ceres had time to turn her head  king pluto had taken a road which now began to grow excessively gloomy it was bordered on each side with rocks and precipices between which the rumbling of the chariot wheels was reverberated with a noise like rolling thunder the trees and bushes that grew in the crevices of the rocks had very dismal foliage and by and by although it was hardly noon the air became obscured with a gray twilight the black horses had rushed along so swiftly that they were already beyond the limits of the sunshine but the duskier it grew the more did plutos visage assume an air of satisfaction after all he was not an illlooking person especially when he left off twisting his features into a smile that did not belong to them proserpina peeped at his face through the gathering dusk and hoped that he might not be so very wicked as she at first thought him  ah this twilight is truly refreshing said king pluto after being so tormented with that ugly and impertinent glare of the sun how much more agreeable is lamplight or torchlight more particularly when reflected from diamonds it will be a magnificent sight when we get to my palace  is it much farther asked proserpina and will you carry me back when i have seen it  we will talk of that by and by answered pluto we are just entering my dominions do you see that tall gateway before us when we pass those gates we are at home and there lies my faithful mastiff at the threshold cerberus cerberus come hither my good dog  so saying pluto pulled at the reins and stopped the chariot right between the tall massive pillars of the gateway the mastiff of which he had spoken got up from the threshold and stood on his hinder legs so as to put his fore paws on the chariot wheel but my stars what a strange dog it was why he was a big rough uglylooking monster with three separate heads and each of them fiercer than the two others but fierce as they were king pluto patted them all he seemed as fond of his threeheaded dog as if it had been a sweet little spaniel with silken ears and curly hair cerberus on the other hand was evidently rejoiced to see his master and expressed his attachment as other dogs do by wagging his tail at a great rate proserpinas eyes being drawn to it by its brisk motion she saw that this tail was neither more nor less than a live dragon with fiery eyes and fangs that had a very poisonous aspect and while the threeheaded cerberus was fawning so lovingly on king pluto there was the dragon tail wagging against its will and looking as cross and illnatured as you can imagine on its own separate account  will the dog bite me asked proserpina shrinking closer to pluto what an ugly creature he is  o never fear answered her companion he never harms people unless they try to enter my dominions without being sent for or to get away when i wish to keep them here down cerberus now my pretty proserpina we will drive on  on went the chariot and king pluto seemed greatly pleased to find himself once more in his own kingdom he drew proserpinas attention to the rich veins of gold that were to be seen among the rocks and pointed to several places where one stroke of a pickaxe would loosen a bushel of diamonds all along the road indeed there were sparkling gems which would have been of inestimable value above ground but which here were reckoned of the meaner sort and hardly worth a beggars stooping for  not far from the gateway they came to a bridge which seemed to be built of iron pluto stopped the chariot and bade proserpina look at the stream which was gliding so lazily beneath it never in her life had she beheld so torpid so black so muddylooking a stream its waters reflected no images of anything that was on the banks and it moved as sluggishly as if it had quite forgotten which way it ought to flow and had rather stagnate than flow either one way or the other  this is the river lethe observed king pluto is it not a very pleasant stream  i think it a very dismal one answered proserpina  it suits my taste however answered pluto who was apt to be sullen when anybody disagreed with him at all events its water has one excellent quality for a single draught of it makes people forget every care and sorrow that has hitherto tormented them only sip a little of it my dear proserpina and you will instantly cease to grieve for your mother and will have nothing in your memory that can prevent your being perfectly happy in my palace i will send for some in a golden goblet the moment we arrive  o no no no cried proserpina weeping afresh i had a thousand times rather be miserable with remembering my mother than be happy in forgetting her that dear dear mother i never never will forget her  we shall see said king pluto you do not know what fine times we will have in my palace here we are just at the portal these pillars are solid gold i assure you  he alighted from the chariot and taking proserpina in his arms carried her up a lofty flight of steps into the great hall of the palace it was splendidly illuminated by means of large precious stones of various hues which seemed to burn like so many lamps and glowed with a hundredfold radiance all through the vast apartment and yet there was a kind of gloom in the midst of this enchanted light nor was there a single object in the hall that was really agreeable to behold except the little proserpina herself a lovely child with one earthly flower which she had not let fall from her hand it is my opinion that even king pluto had never been happy in his palace and that this was the true reason why he had stolen away proserpina in order that he might have something to love instead of cheating his heart any longer with this tiresome magnificence and though he pretended to dislike the sunshine of the upper world yet the effect of the childs presence bedimmed as she was by her tears was as if a faint and watery sunbeam had somehow or other found its way into the enchanted hall  pluto now summoned his domestics and bade them lose no time in preparing a most sumptuous banquet and above all things not to fail of setting a golden beaker of the water of lethe by proserpinas plate  i will neither drink that nor anything else said proserpina nor will i taste a morsel of food even if you keep me forever in your palace  i should be sorry for that replied king pluto patting her cheek for he really wished to be kind if he had only known how you are a spoiled child i perceive my little proserpina but when you see the nice things which my cook will make for you your appetite will quickly come again  then sending for the head cook he gave strict orders that all sorts of delicacies such as young people are usually fond of should be set before proserpina he had a secret motive in this for you are to understand it is a fixed law that when persons are carried off to the land of magic if they once taste any food there they can never get back to their friends now if king pluto had been cunning enough to offer proserpina some fruit or bread and milk which was the simple fare to which the child had always been accustomed it is very probable that she would soon have been tempted to eat it but he left the matter entirely to his cook who like all other cooks considered nothing fit to eat unless it were rich pastry or highlyseasoned meat or spiced sweet cakesthings which proserpinas mother had never given her and the smell of which quite took away her appetite instead of sharpening it  but my story must now clamber out of king plutos dominions and see what mother ceres had been about since she was bereft of her daughter we had a glimpse of her as you remember half hidden among the waving grain while the four black steeds were swiftly whirling along the chariot in which her beloved proserpina was so unwillingly borne away you recollect too the loud scream which proserpina gave just when the chariot was out of sight  of all the childs outcries this last shriek was the only one that reached the ears of mother ceres she had mistaken the rumbling of the chariot wheels for a peal of thunder and imagined that a shower was coming up and that it would assist her in making the corn grow but at the sound of proserpinas shriek she started and looked about in every direction not knowing whence it came but feeling almost certain that it was her daughters voice it seemed so unaccountable however that the girl should have strayed over so many lands and seas which she herself could not have traversed without the aid of her winged dragons that the good ceres tried to believe that it must be the child of some other parent and not her own darling proserpina who had uttered this lamentable cry nevertheless it troubled her with a vast many tender fears such as are ready to bestir themselves in every mothers heart when she finds it necessary to go away from her dear children without leaving them under the care of some maiden aunt or other such faithful guardian so she quickly left the field in which she had been so busy and as her work was not half done the grain looked next day as if it needed both sun and rain and as if it were blighted in the ear and had something the matter with its roots  the pair of dragons must have had very nimble wings for in less than an hour mother ceres had alighted at the door of her home and found it empty knowing however that the child was fond of sporting on the seashore she hastened thither as fast as she could and there beheld the wet faces of the poor sea nymphs peeping over a wave all this while the good creatures had been waiting on the bank of sponge and once every half minute or so had popped up their four heads above water to see if their playmate were yet coming back when they saw mother ceres they sat down on the crest of the surf wave and let it toss them ashore at her feet  where is proserpina cried ceres where is my child tell me you naughty sea nymphs have you enticed her under the sea  o no good mother ceres said the innocent sea nymphs tossing back their green ringlets and looking her in the face we never should dream of such a thing proserpina has been at play with us it is true but she left us a long while ago meaning only to run a little way upon the dry land and gather some flowers for a wreath this was early in the day and we have seen nothing of her since  ceres scarcely waited to hear what the nymphs had to say before she hurried off to make inquiries all through the neighborhood but nobody told her anything that would enable the poor mother to guess what had become of proserpina a fisherman it is true had noticed her little footprints in the sand as he went homeward along the beach with a basket of fish a rustic had seen the child stooping to gather flowers several persons had heard either the rattling of chariot wheels or the rumbling of distant thunder and one old woman while plucking vervain and catnip had heard a scream but supposed it to be some childish nonsense and therefore did not take the trouble to look up the stupid people it took them such a tedious while to tell the nothing that they knew that it was dark night before mother ceres found out that she must seek her daughter elsewhere so she lighted a torch and set forth resolving never to come back until proserpina was discovered  in her haste and trouble of mind she quite forgot her car and the winged dragons or it may be she thought that she could follow up the search more thoroughly on foot at all events this was the way in which she began her sorrowful journey holding her torch before her and looking carefully at every object along the path and as it happened she had not gone far before she found one of the magnificent flowers which grew on the shrub that proserpina had pulled up  ha thought mother ceres examining it by torchlight here is mischief in this flower the earth did not produce it by any help of mine nor of its own accord it is the work of enchantment and is therefore poisonous and perhaps it has poisoned my poor child  but she put the poisonous flower in her bosom not knowing whether she might ever find any other memorial of proserpina  all night long at the door of every cottage and farmhouse ceres knocked and called up the weary laborers to inquire if they had seen her child and they stood gaping and halfasleep at the threshold and answered her pityingly and besought her to come in and rest at the portal of every palace too she made so loud a summons that the menials hurried to throw open the gate thinking that it must be some great king or queen who would demand a banquet for supper and a stately chamber to repose in and when they saw only a sad and anxious woman with a torch in her hand and a wreath of withered poppies on her head they spoke rudely and sometimes threatened to set the dogs upon her but nobody had seen proserpina nor could give mother ceres the least hint which way to seek her thus passed the night and still she continued her search without sitting down to rest or stopping to take food or even remembering to put out the torch although first the rosy dawn and then the glad light of the morning sun made its red flame look thin and pale but i wonder what sort of stuff this torch was made of for it burned dimly through the day and at night was as bright as ever and never was extinguished by the rain or wind in all the weary days and nights while ceres was seeking for proserpina  it was not merely of human beings that she asked tidings of her daughter in the woods and by the streams she met creatures of another nature who used in those old times to haunt the pleasant and solitary places and were very sociable with persons who understood their language and customs as mother ceres did sometimes for instance she tapped with her finger against the knotted trunk of a majestic oak and immediately its rude bark would cleave asunder and forth would step a beautiful maiden who was the hamadryad of the oak dwelling inside of it and sharing its long life and rejoicing when its green leaves sported with the breeze but not one of these leafy damsels had seen proserpina then going a little farther ceres would perhaps come to a fountain gushing out of a pebbly hollow in the earth and would dabble with her hand in the water behold up through its sandy and pebbly bed along with the fountains gush a young woman with dripping hair would arise and stand gazing at mother ceres half out of the water and undulating up and down with its everrestless motion but when the mother asked whether her poor lost child had stopped to drink out of the fountain the naiad with weeping eyes for these waternymphs had tears to spare for everybodys grief would answer no in a murmuring voice which was just like the murmur of the stream  often likewise she encountered fauns who looked like sunburnt country people except that they had hairy ears and little horns upon their foreheads and the hinder legs of goats on which they gamboled merrily about the woods and fields they were a frolicsome kind of creature but grew as sad as their cheerful dispositions would allow when ceres inquired for her daughter and they had no good news to tell but sometimes she same suddenly upon a rude gang of satyrs who had faces like monkeys and horses tails behind them and who were generally dancing in a very boisterous manner with shouts of noisy laughter when she stopped to question them they would only laugh the louder and make new merriment out of the lone womans distress how unkind of those ugly satyrs and once while crossing a solitary sheep pasture she saw a personage named pan seated at the foot of a tall rock and making music on a shepherds flute he too had horns and hairy ears and goats feet but being acquainted with mother ceres he answered her question as civilly as he knew how and invited her to taste some milk and honey out of a wooden bowl but neither could pan tell her what had become of proserpina any better than the rest of these wild people  and thus mother ceres went wandering about for nine long days and nights finding no trace of proserpina unless it were now and then a withered flower and these she picked up and put in her bosom because she fancied that they might have fallen from her poor childs hand all day she traveled onward through the hot sun and at night again the flame of the torch would redden and gleam along the pathway and she continued her search by its light without ever sitting down to rest  on the tenth day she chanced to espy the mouth of a cavern within which though it was bright noon everywhere else there would have been only a dusky twilight but it so happened that a torch was burning there it flickered and struggled with the duskiness but could not half light up the gloomy cavern with all its melancholy glimmer ceres was resolved to leave no spot without a search so she peeped into the entrance of the cave and lighted it up a little more by holding her own torch before her in so doing she caught a glimpse of what seemed to be a woman sitting on the brown leaves of the last autumn a great heap of which had been swept into the cave by the wind this woman if woman it were was by no means so beautiful as many of her sex for her head they tell me was shaped very much like a dogs and by way of ornament she wore a wreath of snakes around it but mother ceres the moment she saw her knew that this was an odd kind of a person who put all her enjoyment in being miserable and never would have a word to say to other people unless they were as melancholy and wretched as she herself delighted to be  i am wretched enough now thought poor ceres to talk with this melancholy hecate were she ten times sadder than ever she was yet so she stepped into the cave and sat down on the withered leaves by the dogheaded womans side in all the world since her daughters loss she had found no other companion  o hecate said she if ever you lose a daughter you will know what sorrow is tell me for pitys sake have you seen my poor child proserpina pass by the mouth of your cavern  no answered hecate in a cracked voice and sighing betwixt every word or two no mother ceres i have seen nothing of your daughter but my ears you must know are made in such a way that all cries of distress and affright all over the world are pretty sure to find their way to them and nine days ago as i sat in my cave making myself very miserable i heard the voice of a young girl shrieking as if in great distress something terrible has happened to the child you may rest assured as well as i could judge a dragon or some other cruel monster was carrying her away  you kill me by saying so cried ceres almost ready to faint where was the sound and which way did it seem to go  it passed very swiftly along said hecate and at the same time there was a heavy rumbling of wheels towards the eastward i can tell you nothing more except that in my honest opinion you will never see your daughter again the best advice i can give you is to take up your abode in this cavern where we will be the two most wretched women in the world  not yet dark hecate replied ceres but do you first come with your torch and help me to seek for my lost child and when there shall be no more hope of finding her if that black day is ordained to come then if you will give me room to fling myself down either on these withered leaves or on the naked rock i will show what it is to be miserable but until i know that she has perished from the face of the earth i will not allow myself space even to grieve  the dismal hecate did not much like the idea of going abroad into the sunny world but then she reflected that the sorrow of the disconsolate ceres would be like a gloomy twilight round about them both let the sun shine ever so brightly and that therefore she might enjoy her bad spirits quite as well as if she were to stay in the cave so she finally consented to go and they set out together both carrying torches although it was broad daylight and clear sunshine the torchlight seemed to make a gloom so that the people whom they met along the road could not very distinctly see their figures and indeed if they once caught a glimpse of hecate with the wreath of snakes round her forehead they generally thought it prudent to run away without waiting for a second glance  as the pair traveled along in this woebegone manner a thought struck ceres  there is one person she exclaimed who must have seen my poor child and can doubtless tell what has become of her why did not i think of him before it is phoebus  what said hecate the young man that always sits in the sunshine o pray do not think of going near him he is a gay light frivolous young fellow and will only smile in your face and besides there is such a glare of the sun about him that he will quite blind my poor eyes which i have almost wept away already  you have promised to be my companion answered ceres come let us make haste or the sunshine will be gone and phoebus along with it  accordingly they went along in quest of phoebus both of them sighing grievously and hecate to say the truth making a great deal worse lamentation than ceres for all the pleasure she had you know lay in being miserable and therefore she made the most of it by and by after a pretty long journey they arrived at the sunniest spot in the whole world there they beheld a beautiful young man with long curling ringlets which seemed to be made of golden sunbeams his garments were like light summer clouds and the expression of his face was so exceedingly vivid that hecate held her hands before her eyes muttering that he ought to wear a black veil phoebus for this was the very person whom they were seeking had a lyre in his hands and was making its chords tremble with sweet music at the same time singing a most exquisite song which he had recently composed for beside a great many other accomplishments this young man was renowned for his admirable poetry  as ceres and her dismal companion approached him phoebus smiled on them so cheerfully that hecates wreath of snakes gave a spiteful hiss and hecate heartily wished herself back in her cave but as for ceres she was too earnest in her grief either to know or care whether phoebus smiled or frowned  phoebus exclaimed she i am in great trouble and have come to you for assistance can you tell me what has become of my dear child proserpina  proserpina proserpina did you call her name answered phoebus endeavoring to recollect for there was such a continual flow of pleasant ideas in his mind that he was apt to forget what had happened no longer ago than yesterday ah yes i remember her now a very lovely child indeed i am happy to tell you my dear madam that i did see the little proserpina not many days ago you may make yourself perfectly easy about her she is safe and in excellent hands  o where is my dear child cried ceres clasping her hands and flinging herself at his feet  why said phoebusand as he spoke he kept touching his lyre so as to make a thread of music run in and out among his wordsas the little damsel was gathering flowers and she has really a very exquisite taste for flowers she was suddenly snatched up by king pluto and carried off to his dominions i have never been in that part of the universe but the royal palace i am told is built in a very noble style of architecture and of the most splendid and costly materials gold diamonds pearls and all manner of precious stones will be your daughters ordinary playthings i recommend to you my dear lady to give yourself no uneasiness proserpinas sense of beauty will be duly gratified and even in spite of the lack of sunshine she will lead a very enviable life  hush say not such a word answered ceres indignantly what is there to gratify her heart what are all the splendors you speak of without affection i must have her back again will you go with me you go with me phoebus to demand my daughter of this wicked pluto  pray excuse me replied phoebus with an elegant obeisance i certainly wish you success and regret that my own affairs are so immediately pressing that i cannot have the pleasure of attending you besides i am not upon the best of terms with king pluto to tell you the truth his threeheaded mastiff would never let me pass the gateway for i should be compelled to take a sheaf of sunbeams along with me and those you know are forbidden things in plutos kingdom  ah phoebus said ceres with bitter meaning in her words you have a harp instead of a heart farewell  will not you stay a moment asked phoebus and hear me turn the pretty and touching story of proserpina into extemporary verses  but ceres shook her head and hastened away along with hecate phoebus who as i have told you was an exquisite poet forthwith began to make an ode about the poor mothers grief and if we were to judge of his sensibility by this beautiful production he must have been endowed with a very tender heart but when a poet gets into the habit of using his heartstrings to make chords for his lyre he may thrum upon them as much as he will without any great pain to himself accordingly though phoebus sang a very sad song he was as merry all the while as were the sunbeams amid which he dwelt  poor mother ceres had now found out what had become of her daughter but was not a whit happier than before her case on the contrary looked more desperate than ever as long as proserpina was above ground there might have been hopes of regaining her but now that the poor child was shut up within the iron gates of the king of the mines at the threshold of which lay the threeheaded cerberus there seemed no possibility of her ever making her escape the dismal hecate who loved to take the darkest view of things told ceres that she had better come with her to the cavern and spend the rest of her life in being miserable ceres answered that hecate was welcome to go back thither herself but that for her part she would wander about the earth in quest of the entrance to king plutos dominions and hecate took her at her word and hurried back to her beloved cave frightening a great many little children with a glimpse of her dogs face as she went  poor mother ceres it is melancholy to think of her pursuing her toilsome way all alone and holding up that neverdying torch the flame of which seemed an emblem of the grief and hope that burned together in her heart  so much did she suffer that though her aspect had been quite youthful when her troubles began she grew to look like an elderly person in a very brief time she cared not how she was dressed nor had she ever thought of flinging away the wreath of withered poppies which she put on the very morning of proserpinas disappearance she roamed about in so wild a way and with her hair so disheveled that people took her for some distracted creature and never dreamed that this was mother ceres who had the oversight of every seed which the husbandman planted nowadays however she gave herself no trouble about seed time nor harvest but left the farmers to take care of their own affairs and the crops to fade or flourish as the case might be there was nothing now in which ceres seemed to feel an interest unless when she saw children at play or gathering flowers along the wayside then indeed she would stand and gaze at them with tears in her eyes the children too appeared to have a sympathy with her grief and would cluster themselves in a little group about her knees and look up wistfully in her face and ceres after giving them a kiss all round would lead them to their homes and advise their mothers never to let them stray out of sight  for if they do said she it may happen to you as it has to me that the ironhearted king pluto will take a liking to your darlings and snatch them up in his chariot and carry them away  one day during her pilgrimage in quest of the entrance to plutos kingdom she came to the palace of king cereus who reigned at eleusis ascending a lofty flight of steps she entered the portal and found the royal household in very great alarm about the queens baby the infant it seems was sickly being troubled with its teeth i suppose and would take no food and was all the time moaning with pain the queenher name was metanirawas desirous of funding a nurse and when she beheld a woman of matronly aspect coming up the palace steps she thought in her own mind that here was the very person whom she needed so queen metanira ran to the door with the poor wailing baby in her arms and besought ceres to take charge of it or at least to tell her what would do it good  will you trust the child entirely to me asked ceres  yes and gladly too answered the queen if you will devote all your time to him for i can see that you have been a mother  you are right said ceres i once had a child of my own well i will be the nurse of this poor sickly boy but beware i warn you that you do not interfere with any kind of treatment which i may judge proper for him if you do so the poor infant must suffer for his mothers folly  then she kissed the child and it seemed to do him good for he smiled and nestled closely into her bosom  so mother ceres set her torch in a corner where it kept burning all the while and took up her abode in the palace of king cereus as nurse to the little prince demophoon she treated him as if he were her own child and allowed neither the king nor the queen to say whether he should be bathed in warm or cold water or what he should eat or how often he should take the air or when he should be put to bed you would hardly believe me if i were to tell how quickly the baby prince got rid of his ailments and grew fat and rosy and strong and how he had two rows of ivory teeth in less time than any other little fellow before or since instead of the palest and wretchedest and puniest imp in the world as his own mother confessed him to be when ceres first took him in charge he was now a strapping baby crowing laughing kicking up his heels and rolling from one end of the room to the other all the good women of the neighborhood crowded to the palace and held up their hands in unutterable amazement at the beauty and wholesomeness of this darling little prince their wonder was the greater because he was never seen to taste any food not even so much as a cup of milk  pray nurse the queen kept saying how is it that you make the child thrive so  i was a mother once ceres always replied and having nursed my own child i know what other children need  but queen metanira as was very natural had a great curiosity to know precisely what the nurse did to her child one night therefore she hid herself in the chamber where ceres and the little prince were accustomed to sleep there was a fire in the chimney and it had now crumbled into great coals and embers which lay glowing on the hearth with a blaze flickering up now and then and flinging a warm and ruddy light upon the walls ceres sat before the hearth with the child in her lap and the firelight making her shadow dance upon the ceiling overhead she undressed the little prince and bathed him all over with some fragrant liquid out of a vase the next thing she did was to rake back the red embers and make a hollow place among them just where the backlog had been at last while the baby was crowing and clapping its fat little hands and laughing in the nurses face just as you may have seen your little brother or sister do before going into its warm bath ceres suddenly laid him all naked as he was in the hollow among the redhot embers she then raked the ashes over him and turned quietly away  you may imagine if you can how queen metanira shrieked thinking nothing less than that her dear child would be burned to a cinder she burst forth from her hidingplace and running to the hearth raked open the fire and snatched up poor little prince demophoon out of his bed of live coals one of which he was gripping in each of his fists he immediately set up a grievous cry as babies are apt to do when rudely startled out of a sound sleep to the queens astonishment and joy she could perceive no token of the childs being injured by the hot fire in which he had lain she now turned to mother ceres and asked her to explain the mystery  foolish woman answered ceres did you not promise to intrust this poor infant entirely to me you little know the mischief you have done him had you left him to my care he would have grown up like a child of celestial birth endowed with superhuman strength and intelligence and would have lived forever do you imagine that earthly children are to become immortal without being tempered to it in the fiercest heat of the fire but you have ruined your own son for though he will be a strong man and a hero in his day yet on account of your folly he will grow old and finally die like the sons of other women the weak tenderness of his mother has cost the poor boy an immortality farewell  saying these words she kissed the little prince demophoon and sighed to think what he had lost and took her departure without heeding queen metanira who entreated her to remain and cover up the child among the hot embers as often as she pleased poor baby he never slept so warmly again  while she dwelt in the kings palace mother ceres had been so continually occupied with taking care of the young prince that her heart was a little lightened of its grief for proserpina but now having nothing else to busy herself about she became just as wretched as before at length in her despair she came to the dreadful resolution that not a stalk of grain nor a blade of grass not a potato nor a turnip nor any other vegetable that was good for man or beast to eat should be suffered to grow until her daughter were restored she even forbade the flowers to bloom lest somebodys heart should be cheered by their beauty  now as not so much as a head of asparagus ever presumed to poke itself out of the ground without the especial permission of ceres you may conceive what a terrible calamity had here fallen upon the earth the husbandmen plowed and planted as usual but there lay the rich black furrows all as barren as a desert of sand the pastures looked as brown in the sweet month of june as ever they did in chill november the rich mans broad acres and the cottagers small garden patch were equally blighted every little girls flower bed showed nothing but dry stalks the old people shook their white heads and said that the earth had grown aged like themselves and was no longer capable of wearing the warm smile of summer on its face it was really piteous to see the poor starving cattle and sheep how they followed behind ceres lowing and bleating as if their instinct taught them to expect help from her and everybody that was acquainted with her power besought her to have mercy on the human race and at all events to let the grass grow but mother ceres though naturally of an affectionate disposition was now inexorable  never said she if the earth is ever again to see any verdure it must first grow along the path which my daughter will tread in coming back to me  finally as there seemed to be no other remedy our old friend quicksilver was sent posthaste to king pluto in hopes that he might be persuaded to undo the mischief he had done and to set everything right again by giving up proserpina quicksilver accordingly made the best of his way to the great gate took a flying leap right over the threeheaded mastiff and stood at the door of the palace in an inconceivably short time the servants knew him both by his face and garb for his short cloak and his winged cap and shoes and his snaky staff had often been seen thereabouts in times gone by he requested to be shown immediately into the kings presence and pluto who heard his voice from the top of the stairs and who loved to recreate himself with quicksilvers merry talk called out to him to come up and while they settle their business together we must inquire what proserpina had been doing ever since we saw her last  the child had declared as you may remember that she would not taste a mouthful of food as long as she should be compelled to remain in king plutos palace how she contrived to maintain her resolution and at the same time to keep herself tolerably plump and rosy is more than i can explain but some young ladies i am given to understand possess the faculty of living on air and proserpina seems to have possessed it too at any rate it was now six months since she left the outside of the earth and not a morsel so far as the attendants were able to testify had yet passed between her teeth this was the more creditable to proserpina inasmuch as king pluto had caused her to be tempted day by day with all manner of sweetmeats and richlypreserved fruits and delicacies of every sort such as young people are generally most fond of but her good mother had often told her of the hurtfulness of these things and for that reason alone if there had been no other she would have resolutely refused to taste them  all this time being of a cheerful and active disposition the little damsel was not quite so unhappy as you may have supposed the immense palace had a thousand rooms and was full of beautiful and wonderful objects there was a neverceasing gloom it is true which half hid itself among the innumerable pillars gliding before the child as she wandered among them and treading stealthily behind her in the echo of her footsteps neither was all the dazzle of the precious stones which flamed with their own light worth one gleam of natural sunshine nor could the most brilliant of the manycolored gems which proserpina had for playthings vie with the simple beauty of the flowers she used to gather but still whenever the girl went among those gilded halls and chambers it seemed as if she carried nature and sunshine along with her and as if she scattered dewy blossoms on her right hand and on her left after proserpina came the palace was no longer the same abode of stately artifice and dismal magnificence that it had before been the inhabitants all felt this and king pluto more than any of them  my own little proserpina he used to say i wish you could like me a little better we gloomy and cloudynatured persons have often as warm hearts at bottom as those of a more cheerful character if you would only stay with me of your own accord it would make me happier than the possession of a hundred such palaces as this  ah said proserpina you should have tried to make me like you before carrying me off and the best thing you can now do is to let me go again then i might remember you sometimes and think that you were as kind as you knew how to be perhaps too one day or other i might come back and pay you a visit  no no answered pluto with his gloomy smile i will not trust you for that you are too fond of living in the broad daylight and gathering flowers what an idle and childish taste that is are not these gems which i have ordered to be dug for you and which are richer than any in my crownare they not prettier than a violet  not half so pretty said proserpina snatching the gems from plutos hand and flinging them to the other end of the hall o my sweet violets shall i never see you again  and then she burst into tears but young peoples tears have very little saltness or acidity in them and do not inflame the eyes so much as those of grown persons so that it is not to be wondered at if a few moments afterwards proserpina was sporting through the hall almost as merrily as she and the four sea nymphs had sported along the edge of the surf wave king pluto gazed after her and wished that he too was a child and little proserpina when she turned about and beheld this great king standing in his splendid hall and looking so grand and so melancholy and so lonesome was smitten with a kind of pity she ran back to him and for the first time in all her life put her small soft hand in his  i love you a little whispered she looking up in his face  do you indeed my dear child cried pluto bending his dark face down to kiss her but proserpina shrank away from the kiss for though his features were noble they were very dusky and grim well i have not deserved it of you after keeping you a prisoner for so many months and starving you besides are you not terribly hungry is there nothing which i can get you to eat  in asking this question the king of the mines had a very cunning purpose for you will recollect if proserpina tasted a morsel of food in his dominions she would never afterwards be at liberty to quit them  no indeed said proserpina your head cook is always baking and stewing and roasting and rolling out paste and contriving one dish or another which he imagines may be to my liking but he might just as well save himself the trouble poor fat little man that he is i have no appetite for anything in the world unless it were a slice of bread of my mothers own baking or a little fruit out of her garden  when pluto heard this he began to see that he had mistaken the best method of tempting proserpina to eat the cooks made dishes and artificial dainties were not half so delicious in the good childs opinion as the simple fare to which mother ceres had accustomed her wondering that he had never thought of it before the king now sent one of his trusty attendants with a large basket to get some of the finest and juiciest pears peaches and plums which could anywhere be found in the upper world unfortunately however this was during the time when ceres had forbidden any fruits or vegetables to grow and after seeking all over the earth king plutos servant found only a single pomegranate and that so dried up as not to be worth eating nevertheless since there was no better to be had he brought this dry old withered pomegranate home to the palace put it on a magnificent golden salver and carried it up to proserpina now it happened curiously enough that just as the servant was bringing the pomegranate into the back door of the palace our friend quicksilver had gone up the front steps on his errand to get proserpina away from king pluto  as soon as proserpina saw the pomegranate on the golden salver she told the servant he had better take it away again  i shall not touch it i assure you said she if i were ever so hungry i should never think of eating such a miserable dry pomegranate as that  it is the only one in the world said the servant  he set down the golden salver with the wizened pomegranate upon it and left the room when he was gone proserpina could not help coming close to the table and looking at this poor specimen of dried fruit with a great deal of eagerness for to say the truth on seeing something that suited her taste she felt all the six months appetite taking possession of her at once to be sure it was a very wretchedlooking pomegranate and seemed to have no more juice in it than an oyster shell but there was no choice of such things in king plutos palace this was the first fruit she had seen there and the last she was ever likely to see and unless she ate it up immediately it would grow drier than it already was and be wholly unfit to eat  at least i may smell it thought proserpina  so she took up the pomegranate and applied it to her nose and somehow or other being in such close neighborhood to her mouth the fruit found its way into that little red cave dear me what an everlasting pity before proserpina knew what she was about her teeth had actually bitten it of their own accord just as this fatal deed was done the door of the apartment opened and in came king pluto followed by quicksilver who had been urging him to let his little prisoner go at the first noise of their entrance proserpina withdrew the pomegranate from her mouth but quicksilver whose eyes were very keen and his wits the sharpest that ever anybody had perceived that the child was a little confused and seeing the empty salver he suspected that she had been taking a sly nibble of something or other as for honest pluto he never guessed at the secret  my little proserpina said the king sitting down and affectionately drawing her between his knees here is quicksilver who tells me that a great many misfortunes have befallen innocent people on account of my detaining you in my dominions to confess the truth i myself had already reflected that it was an unjustifiable act to take you away from your good mother but then you must consider my dear child that this vast palace is apt to be gloomy although the precious stones certainly shine very bright and that i am not of the most cheerful disposition and that therefore it was a natural thing enough to seek for the society of some merrier creature than myself i hoped you would take my crown for a plaything and meah you laugh naughty proserpiname grim as i am for a playmate it was a silly expectation  not so extremely silly whispered proserpina you have really amused me very much sometimes  thank you said king pluto rather dryly but i can see plainly enough that you think my palace a dusky prison and me the ironhearted keeper of it and an iron heart i should surely have if i could detain you here any longer my poor child when it is now six months since you tasted food i give you your liberty go with quicksilver hasten home to your dear mother  now although you may not have supposed it proserpina found it impossible to take leave of poor king pluto without some regrets and a good deal of compunction for not telling him about the pomegranate she even shed a tear or two thinking how lonely and cheerless the great palace would seem to him with all its ugly glare of artificial light after she herselfhis one little ray of natural sunshine whom he had stolen to be sure but only because he valued her so muchafter she should have departed i know not how many kind things she might have said to the disconsolate king of the mines had not quicksilver hurried her way  come along quickly whispered he in her ear or his majesty may change his royal mind and take care above all things that you say nothing of what was brought you on the golden salver  in a very short time they had passed the great gateway leaving the threeheaded cerberus barking and yelping and growling with threefold din behind them and emerged upon the surface of the earth it was delightful to behold as proserpina hastened along how the path grew verdant behind and on either side of her wherever she set her blessed foot there was at once a dewy flower the violets gushed up along the wayside the grass and the grain began to sprout with tenfold vigor and luxuriance to make up for the dreary months that had been wasted in barrenness the starved cattle immediately set to work grazing after their long fast and ate enormously all day and got up at midnight to eat more  but i can assure you it was a busy time of year with the farmers when they found the summer coming upon them with such a rush nor must i forget to say that all the birds in the whole world hopped about upon the newlyblossoming trees and sang together in a prodigious ecstasy of joy  mother ceres had returned to her deserted home and was sitting disconsolately on the doorstep with her torch burning in her hand she had been idly watching the flame for some moments past when all at once it flickered and went out  what does this mean thought she it was an enchanted torch and should have kept burning till my child came back  lifting her eyes she was surprised to see a sudden verdure flashing over the brown and barren fields exactly as you may have observed a golden hue gleaming far and wide across the landscape from the just risen sun  does the earth disobey me exclaimed mother ceres indignantly does it presume to be green when i have bidden it be barren until my daughter shall be restored to my arms  then open your arms dear mother cried a wellknown voice and take your little daughter into them  and proserpina came running and flung herself upon her mothers bosom their mutual transport is not to be described the grief of their separation had caused both of them to shed a great many tears and now they shed a great many more because their joy could not so well express itself in any other way  when their hearts had grown a little more quiet mother ceres looked anxiously at proserpina  my child said she did you taste any food while you were in king plutos palace  dearest mother exclaimed proserpina i will tell you the whole truth until this very morning not a morsel of food had passed my lips but today they brought me a pomegranate a very dry one it was and all shriveled up till there was little left of it but seeds and skin and having seen no fruit for so long a time and being faint with hunger i was tempted just to bite it the instant i tasted it king pluto and quicksilver came into the room i had not swallowed a morsel butdear mother i hope it was no harmbut six of the pomegranate seeds i am afraid remained in my mouth  ah unfortunate child and miserable me exclaimed ceres for each of those six pomegranate seeds you must spend one month of every year in king plutos palace you are but half restored to your mother only six months with me and six with that goodfornothing king of darkness  do not speak so harshly of poor king pluto said prosperina kissing her mother he has some very good qualities and i really think i can bear to spend six months in his palace if he will only let me spend the other six with you he certainly did very wrong to carry me off but then as he says it was but a dismal sort of life for him to live in that great gloomy place all alone and it has made a wonderful change in his spirits to have a little girl to run up stairs and down there is some comfort in making him so happy and so upon the whole dearest mother let us be thankful that he is not to keep me the whole year round     the golden fleece  when jason the son of the dethroned king of iolchos was a little boy he was sent away from his parents and placed under the queerest schoolmaster that ever you heard of this learned person was one of the people or quadrupeds called centaurs he lived in a cavern and had the body and legs of a white horse with the head and shoulders of a man his name was chiron and in spite of his odd appearance he was a very excellent teacher and had several scholars who afterwards did him credit by making a great figure in the world the famous hercules was one and so was achilles and philoctetes likewise and aesculapius who acquired immense repute as a doctor the good chiron taught his pupils how to play upon the harp and how to cure diseases and how to use the sword and shield together with various other branches of education in which the lads of those days used to be instructed instead of writing and arithmetic  i have sometimes suspected that master chiron was not really very different from other people but that being a kindhearted and merry old fellow he was in the habit of making believe that he was a horse and scrambling about the schoolroom on all fours and letting the little boys ride upon his back and so when his scholars had grown up and grown old and were trotting their grandchildren on their knees they told them about the sports of their school days and these young folks took the idea that their grandfathers had been taught their letters by a centaur half man and half horse little children not quite understanding what is said to them often get such absurd notions into their heads you know  be that as it may it has always been told for a fact and always will be told as long as the world lasts that chiron with the head of a schoolmaster had the body and legs of a horse just imagine the grave old gentleman clattering and stamping into the schoolroom on his four hoofs perhaps treading on some little fellows toes flourishing his switch tail instead of a rod and now and then trotting out of doors to eat a mouthful of grass i wonder what the blacksmith charged him for a set of iron shoes  so jason dwelt in the cave with this fourfooted chiron from the time that he was an infant only a few months old until he had grown to the full height of a man he became a very good harper i suppose and skilful in the use of weapons and tolerably acquainted with herbs and other doctors stuff and above all an admirable horseman for in teaching young people to ride the good chiron must have been without a rival among schoolmasters at length being now a tall and athletic youth jason resolved to seek his fortune in the world without asking chirons advice or telling him anything about the matter this was very unwise to be sure and i hope none of you my little hearers will ever follow jasons example  but you are to understand he had heard how that he himself was a prince royal and how his father king jason had been deprived of the kingdom of iolchos by a certain pelias who would also have killed jason had he not been hidden in the centaurs cave and being come to the strength of a man jason determined to set all this business to rights and to punish the wicked pelias for wronging his dear father and to cast him down from the throne and seat himself there instead  with this intention he took a spear in each hand and threw a leopards skin over his shoulders to keep off the rain and set forth on his travels with his long yellow ringlets waving in the wind the part of his dress on which he most prided himself was a pair of sandals that had been his fathers they were handsomely embroidered and were tied upon his feet with strings of gold but his whole attire was such as people did not very often see and as he passed along the women and children ran to the doors and windows wondering whither this beautiful youth was journeying with his leopards skin and his goldentied sandals and what heroic deeds he meant to perform with a spear in his right hand and another in his left  i know not how far jason had traveled when he came to a turbulent river which rushed right across his pathway with specks of white foam among its black eddies hurrying tumultuously onward and roaring angrily as it went though not a very broad river in the dry seasons of the year it was now swollen by heavy rains and by the melting of the snow on the sides of mount olympus and it thundered so loudly and looked so wild and dangerous that jason bold as he was thought it prudent to pause upon the brink the bed of the stream seemed to be strewn with sharp and rugged rocks some of which thrust themselves above the water by and by an uprooted tree with shattered branches came drifting along the current and got entangled among the rocks now and then a drowned sheep and once the carcass of a cow floated past  in short the swollen river had already done a great deal of mischief it was evidently too deep for jason to wade and too boisterous for him to swim he could see no bridge and as for a boat had there been any the rocks would have broken it to pieces in an instant  see the poor lad said a cracked voice close to his side he must have had but a poor education since he does not know how to cross a little stream like this or is he afraid of wetting his fine goldenstringed sandals it is a pity his fourfooted schoolmaster is not here to carry him safely across on his back  jason looked round greatly surprised for he did not know that anybody was near but beside him stood an old woman with a ragged mantle over her head leaning on a staff the top of which was carved into the shape of a cuckoo she looked very aged and wrinkled and infirm and yet her eyes which were as brown as those of an ox were so extremely large and beautiful that when they were fixed on jasons eyes he could see nothing else but them the old woman had a pomegranate in her hand although the fruit was then quite out of season  whither are you going jason she now asked  she seemed to know his name you will observe and indeed those great brown eyes looked as if they had a knowledge of everything whether past or to come while jason was gazing at her a peacock strutted forward and took his stand at the old womans side  i am going to iolchos answered the young man to bid the wicked king pelias come down from my fathers throne and let me reign in his stead  ah well then said the old woman still with the same cracked voice if that is all your business you need not be in a very great hurry just take me on your back theres a good youth and carry me across the river i and my peacock have something to do on the other side as well as yourself  good mother replied jason your business can hardly be so important as the pulling down a king from his throne besides as you may see for yourself the river is very boisterous and if i should chance to stumble it would sweep both of us away more easily than it has carried off yonder uprooted tree i would gladly help you if i could but i doubt whether i am strong enough to carry you across  then said she very scornfully neither are you strong enough to pull king pelias off his throne and jason unless you will help an old woman at her need you ought not to be a king what are kings made for save to succor the feeble and distressed but do as you please either take me on your back or with my poor old limbs i shall try my best to struggle across the stream  saying this the old woman poked with her staff in the river as if to find the safest place in its rocky bed where she might make the first step but jason by this time had grown ashamed of his reluctance to help her he felt that he could never forgive himself if this poor feeble creature should come to any harm in attempting to wrestle against the headlong current the good chiron whether half horse or no had taught him that the noblest use of his strength was to assist the weak and also that he must treat every young woman as if she were his sister and every old one like a mother remembering these maxims the vigorous and beautiful young man knelt down and requested the good dame to mount upon his back  the passage seems to me not very safe he remarked but as your business is so urgent i will try to carry you across if the river sweeps you away it shall take me too  that no doubt will be a great comfort to both of us quoth the old woman but never fear we shall get safely across  so she threw her arms around jasons neck and lifting her from the ground he stepped boldly into the raging and foaming current and began to stagger away from the shore as for the peacock it alighted on the old dames shoulder jasons two spears one in each hand kept him from stumbling and enabled him to feel his way among the hidden rocks although every instant he expected that his companion and himself would go down the stream together with the driftwood of shattered trees and the carcasses of the sheep and cow down came the cold snowy torrent from the steep side of olympus raging and thundering as if it had a real spite against jason or at all events were determined to snatch off his living burden from his shoulders when he was half way across the uprooted tree which i have already told you about broke loose from among the rocks and bore down upon him with all its splintered branches sticking out like the hundred arms of the giant briareus it rushed past however without touching him but the next moment his foot was caught in a crevice between two rocks and stuck there so fast that in the effort to get free he lost one of his goldenstringed sandals  at this accident jason could not help uttering a cry of vexation  what is the matter jason asked the old woman  matter enough said the young man i have lost a sandal here among the rocks and what sort of a figure shall i cut at the court of king pelias with a goldenstringed sandal on one foot and the other foot bare  do not take it to heart answered his companion cheerily you never met with better fortune than in losing that sandal it satisfies me that you are the very person whom the speaking oak has been talking about  there was no time just then to inquire what the speaking oak had said but the briskness of her tone encouraged the young man and besides he had never in his life felt so vigorous and mighty as since taking this old woman on his back instead of being exhausted he gathered strength as he went on and struggling up against the torrent he at last gained the opposite shore clambered up the bank and set down the old dame and her peacock safely on the grass as soon as this was done however he could not help looking rather despondently at his bare foot with only a remnant of the golden string of the sandal clinging round his ankle  you will get a handsomer pair of sandals by and by said the old woman with a kindly look out of her beautiful brown eyes only let king pelias get a glimpse of that bare foot and you shall see him turn as pale as ashes i promise you there is your path go along my good jason and my blessing go with you and when you sit on your throne remember the old woman whom you helped over the river  with these words she hobbled away giving him a smile over her shoulder as she departed  whether the light of her beautiful brown eyes threw a glory round about her or whatever the cause might be jason fancied that there was something very noble and majestic in her figure after all and that though her gait seemed to be a rheumatic hobble yet she moved with as much grace and dignity as any queen on earth her peacock which had now fluttered down from her shoulder strutted behind her in a prodigious pomp and spread out its magnificent tail on purpose for jason to admire it  when the old dame and her peacock were out of sight jason set forward on his journey after traveling a pretty long distance he came to a town situated at the foot of a mountain and not a great way from the shore of the sea on the outside of the town there was an immense crowd of people not only men and women but children too all in their best clothes and evidently enjoying a holiday the crowd was thickest towards the seashore and in that direction over the peoples heads jason saw a wreath of smoke curling upward to the blue sky he inquired of one of the multitude what town it was near by and why so many persons were here assembled together  this is the kingdom of iolchos answered the man and we are the subjects of king pelias our monarch has summoned us together that we may see him sacrifice a black bull to neptune who they say is his majestys father yonder is the king where you see the smoke going up from the altar  while the man spoke he eyed jason with great curiosity for his garb was quite unlike that of the iolchians and it looked very odd to see a youth with a leopards skin over his shoulders and each hand grasping a spear jason perceived too that the man stared particularly at his feet one of which you remember was bare while the other was decorated with his fathers goldenstringed sandal  look at him only look at him said the man to his next neighbor do you see he wears but one sandal  upon this first one person and then another began to stare at jason and everybody seemed to be greatly struck with something in his aspect though they turned their eyes much oftener towards his feet than to any other part of his figure besides he could hear them whispering to one another  one sandal one sandal they kept saying the man with one sandal here he is at last whence has he come what does he mean to do what will the king say to the onesandaled man  poor jason was greatly abashed and made up his mind that the people of iolchos were exceedingly illbred to take such public notice of an accidental deficiency in his dress meanwhile whether it were that they hustled him forward or that jason of his own accord thrust a passage through the crowd it so happened that he soon found himself close to the smoking altar where king pelias was sacrificing the black bull the murmur and hum of the multitude in their surprise at the spectacle of jason with his one bare foot grew so loud that it disturbed the ceremonies and the king holding the great knife with which he was just going to cut the bulls throat turned angrily about and fixed his eyes on jason the people had now withdrawn from around him so that the youth stood in an open space near the smoking altar front to front with the angry king pelias  who are you cried the king with a terrible frown and how dare you make this disturbance while i am sacrificing a black bull to my father neptune  it is no fault of mine answered jason your majesty must blame the rudeness of your subjects who have raised all this tumult because one of my feet happens to be bare  when jason said this the king gave a quick startled glance down at his feet  ha muttered he here is the onesandaled fellow sure enough what can i do with him  and he clutched more closely the great knife in his hand as if he were half a mind to slay jason instead of the black bull the people round about caught up the kings words indistinctly as they were uttered and first there was a murmur amongst them and then a loud shout  the onesandaled man has come the prophecy must be fulfilled  for you are to know that many years before king pelias had been told by the speaking oak of dodona that a man with one sandal should cast him down from his throne on this account he had given strict orders that nobody should ever come into his presence unless both sandals were securely tied upon his feet and he kept an officer in his palace whose sole business it was to examine peoples sandals and to supply them with a new pair at the expense of the royal treasury as soon as the old ones began to wear out in the whole course of the kings reign he had never been thrown into such a fright and agitation as by the spectacle of poor jasons bare foot but as he was naturally a bold and hardhearted man he soon took courage and began to consider in what way he might rid himself of this terrible onesandaled stranger  my good young man said king pelias taking the softest tone imaginable in order to throw jason off his guard you are excessively welcome to my kingdom judging by your dress you must have traveled a long distance for it is not the fashion to wear leopard skins in this part of the world pray what may i call your name and where did you receive your education  my name is jason answered the young stranger ever since my infancy i have dwelt in the cave of chiron the centaur he was my instructor and taught me music and horsemanship and how to cure wounds and likewise how to inflict wounds with my weapons  i have heard of chiron the schoolmaster replied king pelias and how that there is an immense deal of learning and wisdom in his head although it happens to be set on a horses body it gives me great delight to see one of his scholars at my court but to test how much you have profited under so excellent a teacher will you allow me to ask you a single question  i do not pretend to be very wise said jason but ask me what you please and i will answer to the best of my ability  now king pelias meant cunningly to entrap the young man and to make him say something that should be the cause of mischief and distraction to himself so with a crafty and evil smile upon his face he spoke as follows  what would you do brave jason asked he if there were a man in the world by whom as you had reason to believe you were doomed to be ruined and slainwhat would you do i say if that man stood before you and in your power  when jason saw the malice and wickedness which king pelias could not prevent from gleaming out of his eyes he probably guessed that the king had discovered what he came for and that he intended to turn his own words against himself still he scorned to tell a falsehood like an upright and honorable prince as he was he determined to speak out the real truth since the king had chosen to ask him the question and since jason had promised him an answer there was no right way save to tell him precisely what would be the most prudent thing to do if he had his worst enemy in his power  therefore after a moments consideration he spoke up with a firm and manly voice  i would send such a man said he in quest of the golden fleece  this enterprise you will understand was of all others the most difficult and dangerous in the world in the first place it would be necessary to make a long voyage through unknown seas there was hardly a hope or a possibility that any young man who should undertake this voyage would either succeed in obtaining the golden fleece or would survive to return home and tell of the perils he had run the eyes of king pelias sparkled with joy therefore when he heard jasons reply  well said wise man with the one sandal cried he go then and at the peril of your life bring me back the golden fleece  i go answered jason composedly if i fail you need not fear that i will ever come back to trouble you again but if i return to iolchos with the prize then king pelias you must hasten down from your lofty throne and give me your crown and sceptre  that i will said the king with a sneer meantime i will keep them very safely for you  the first thing that jason thought of doing after he left the kings presence was to go to dodona and inquire of the talking oak what course it was best to pursue this wonderful tree stood in the center of an ancient wood its stately trunk rose up a hundred feet into the air and threw a broad and dense shadow over more than an acre of ground standing beneath it jason looked up among the knotted branches and green leaves and into the mysterious heart of the old tree and spoke aloud as if he were addressing some person who was hidden in the depths of the foliage  what shall i do said he in order to win the golden fleece  at first there was a deep silence not only within the shadow of the talking oak but all through the solitary wood in a moment or two however the leaves of the oak began to stir and rustle as if a gentle breeze were wandering amongst them although the other trees of the wood were perfectly still the sound grew louder and became like the roar of a high wind by and by jason imagined that he could distinguish words but very confusedly because each separate leaf of the tree seemed to be a tongue and the whole myriad of tongues were babbling at once but the noise waxed broader and deeper until it resembled a tornado sweeping through the oak and making one great utterance out of the thousand and thousand of little murmurs which each leafy tongue had caused by its rustling and now though it still had the tone of a mighty wind roaring among the branches it was also like a deep bass voice speaking as distinctly as a tree could be expected to speak the following words  go to argus the shipbuilder and bid him build a galley with fifty oars  then the voice melted again into the indistinct murmur of the rustling leaves and died gradually away when it was quite gone jason felt inclined to doubt whether he had actually heard the words or whether his fancy had not shaped them out of the ordinary sound made by a breeze while passing through the thick foliage of the tree  but on inquiry among the people of iolchos he found that there was really a man in the city by the name of argus who was a very skilful builder of vessels this showed some intelligence in the oak else how should it have known that any such person existed at jasons request argus readily consented to build him a galley so big that it should require fifty strong men to row it although no vessel of such a size and burden had heretofore been seen in the world so the head carpenter and all his journeymen and apprentices began their work and for a good while afterwards there they were busily employed hewing out the timbers and making a great clatter with their hammers until the new ship which was called the argo seemed to be quite ready for sea and as the talking oak had already given him such good advice jason thought that it would not be amiss to ask for a little more he visited it again therefore and standing beside its huge rough trunk inquired what he should do next  this time there was no such universal quivering of the leaves throughout the whole tree as there had been before but after a while jason observed that the foliage of a great branch which stretched above his head had begun to rustle as if the wind were stirring that one bough while all the other boughs of the oak were at rest  cut me off said the branch as soon as it could speak distinctly cut me off cut me off and carve me into a figurehead for your galley  accordingly jason took the branch at its word and lopped it off the tree a carver in the neighborhood engaged to make the figurehead he was a tolerably good workman and had already carved several figureheads in what he intended for feminine shapes and looking pretty much like those which we see nowadays stuck up under a vessels bowsprit with great staring eyes that never wink at the dash of the spray but what was very strange the carver found that his hand was guided by some unseen power and by a skill beyond his own and that his tools shaped out an image which he had never dreamed of when the work was finished it turned out to be the figure of a beautiful woman with a helmet on her head from beneath which the long ringlets fell down upon her shoulders on the left arm was a shield and in its center appeared a lifelike representation of the head of medusa with the snaky locks the right arm was extended as if pointing onward the face of this wonderful statue though not angry or forbidding was so grave and majestic that perhaps you might call it severe and as for the mouth it seemed just ready to unclose its lips and utter words of the deepest wisdom  jason was delighted with the oaken image and gave the carver no rest until it was completed and set up where a figurehead has always stood from that time to this in the vessels prow  and now cried he as he stood gazing at the calm majestic face of the statue i must go to the talking oak and inquire what next to do  there is no need of that jason said a voice which though it was far lower reminded him of the mighty tones of the great oak when you desire good advice you can seek it of me  jason had been looking straight into the face of the image when these words were spoken but he could hardly believe either his ears or his eyes the truth was however that the oaken lips had moved and to all appearance the voice had proceeded from the statues mouth recovering a little from his surprise jason bethought himself that the image had been carved out of the wood of the talking oak and that therefore it was really no great wonder but on the contrary the most natural thing in the world that it should possess the faculty of speech it would have been very odd indeed if it had not but certainly it was a great piece of good fortune that he should be able to carry so wise a block of wood along with him in his perilous voyage  tell me wondrous image exclaimed jasonsince you inherit the wisdom of the speaking oak of dodona whose daughter you aretell me where shall i find fifty bold youths who will take each of them an oar of my galley they must have sturdy arms to row and brave hearts to encounter perils or we shall never win the golden fleece  go replied the oaken image go summon all the heroes of greece  and in fact considering what a great deed was to be done could any advice be wiser than this which jason received from the figurehead of his vessel he lost no time in sending messengers to all the cities and making known to the whole people of greece that prince jason the son of king jason was going in quest of the fleece of gold and that he desired the help of fortynine of the bravest and strongest young men alive to row his vessel and share his dangers and jason himself would be the fiftieth  at this news the adventurous youths all over the country began to bestir themselves some of them had already fought with giants and slain dragons and the younger ones who had not yet met with such good fortune thought it a shame to have lived so long without getting astride of a flying serpent or sticking their spears into a chimaera or at least thrusting their right arms down a monstrous lions throat there was a fair prospect that they would meet with plenty of such adventures before finding the golden fleece as soon as they could furbish up their helmets and shields therefore and gird on their trusty swords they came thronging to iolchos and clambered on board the new galley shaking hands with jason they assured him that they did not care a pin for their lives but would help row the vessel to the remotest edge of the world and as much farther as he might think it best to go  many of these brave fellows had been educated by chiron the fourfooted pedagogue and were therefore old schoolmates of jason and knew him to be a lad of spirit the mighty hercules whose shoulders afterwards upheld the sky was one of them and there were castor and pollux the twin brothers who were never accused of being chickenhearted although they had been hatched out of an egg and theseus who was so renowned for killing the minotaur and lynceus with his wonderfully sharp eyes which could see through a millstone or look right down into the depths of the earth and discover the treasures that were there and orpheus the very best of harpers who sang and played upon his lyre so sweetly that the brute beasts stood upon their hind legs and capered merrily to the music yes and at some of his more moving tunes the rocks bestirred their mossgrown bulk out of the ground and a grove of forest trees uprooted themselves and nodding their tops to one another performed a country dance  one of the rowers was a beautiful young woman named atalanta who had been nursed among the mountains by a bear so light of foot was this fair damsel that she could step from one foamy crest of a wave to the foamy crest of another without wetting more than the sole of her sandal she had grown up in a very wild way and talked much about the rights of women and loved hunting and war far better than her needle but in my opinion the most remarkable of this famous company were two sons of the north wind airy youngsters and of rather a blustering disposition who had wings on their shoulders and in case of a calm could puff out their cheeks and blow almost as fresh a breeze as their father i ought not to forget the prophets and conjurors of whom there were several in the crew and who could foretell what would happen tomorrow or the next day or a hundred years hence but were generally quite unconscious of what was passing at the moment  jason appointed tiphys to be helmsman because he was a stargazer and knew the points of the compass lynceus on account of his sharp sight was stationed as a lookout in the prow where he saw a whole days sail ahead but was rather apt to overlook things that lay directly under his nose if the sea only happened to be deep enough however lynceus could tell you exactly what kind of rocks or sands were at the bottom of it and he often cried out to his companions that they were sailing over heaps of sunken treasure which yet he was none the richer for beholding to confess the truth few people believed him when he said it  well but when the argonauts as these fifty brave adventurers were called had prepared everything for the voyage an unforeseen difficulty threatened to end it before it was begun the vessel you must understand was so long and broad and ponderous that the united force of all the fifty was insufficient to shove her into the water hercules i suppose had not grown to his full strength else he might have set her afloat as easily as a little boy launches his boat upon a puddle but here were these fifty heroes pushing and straining and growing red in the face without making the argo start an inch at last quite wearied out they sat themselves down on the shore exceedingly disconsolate and thinking that the vessel must be left to rot and fall in pieces and that they must either swim across the sea or lose the golden fleece  all at once jason bethought himself of the galleys miraculous figurehead  o daughter of the talking oak cried he how shall we set to work to get our vessel into the water  seat yourselves answered the image for it had known what had ought to be done from the very first and was only waiting for the question to be putseat yourselves and handle your oars and let orpheus play upon his harp  immediately the fifty heroes got on board and seizing their oars held them perpendicularly in the air while orpheus who liked such a task far better than rowing swept his fingers across the harp at the first ringing note of the music they felt the vessel stir orpheus thrummed away briskly and the galley slid at once into the sea dipping her prow so deeply that the figurehead drank the wave with its marvelous lips and rising again as buoyant as a swan the rowers plied their fifty oars the white foam boiled up before the prow the water gurgled and bubbled in their wake while orpheus continued to play so lively a strain of music that the vessel seemed to dance over the billows by way of keeping time to it thus triumphantly did the argo sail out of the harbor amidst the huzzas and good wishes of everybody except the wicked old pelias who stood on a promontory scowling at her and wishing that he could blow out of his lungs the tempest of wrath that was in his heart and so sink the galley with all on board when they had sailed above fifty miles over the sea lynceus happened to cast his sharp eyes behind and said that there was this badhearted king still perched upon the promontory and scowling so gloomily that it looked like a black thundercloud in that quarter of the horizon  in order to make the time pass away more pleasantly during the voyage the heroes talked about the golden fleece it originally belonged it appears to a boeotian ram who had taken on his back two children when in danger of their lives and fled with them over land and sea as far as colchis one of the children whose name was helle fell into the sea and was drowned but the other a little boy named phrixus was brought safe ashore by the faithful ram who however was so exhausted that he immediately lay down and died in memory of this good deed and as a token of his true heart the fleece of the poor dead ram was miraculously changed to gold and became one of the most beautiful objects ever seen on earth it was hung upon a tree in a sacred grove where it had now been kept i know not how many years and was the envy of mighty kings who had nothing so magnificent in any of their palaces  if i were to tell you all the adventures of the argonauts it would take me till nightfall and perhaps a great deal longer there was no lack of wonderful events as you may judge from what you have already heard at a certain island they were hospitably received by king cyzicus its sovereign who made a feast for them and treated them like brothers but the argonauts saw that this good king looked downcast and very much troubled and they therefore inquired of him what was the matter king cyzicus hereupon informed them that he and his subjects were greatly abused and incommoded by the inhabitants of a neighboring mountain who made war upon them and killed many people and ravaged the country and while they were talking about it cyzicus pointed to the mountain and asked jason and his companions what they saw there  i see some very tall objects answered jason but they are at such a distance that i cannot distinctly make out what they are to tell your majesty the truth they look so very strangely that i am inclined to think them clouds which have chanced to take something like human shapes  i see them very plainly remarked lynceus whose eyes you know were as farsighted as a telescope they are a band of enormous giants all of whom have six arms apiece and a club a sword or some other weapon in each of their hands  you have excellent eyes said king cyzicus yes they are sixarmed giants as you say and these are the enemies whom i and my subjects have to contend with  the next day when the argonauts were about setting sail down came these terrible giants stepping a hundred yards at a stride brandishing their six arms apiece and looking formidable so far aloft in the air each of these monsters was able to carry on a whole war by himself for with one arm he could fling immense stones and wield a club with another and a sword with a third while the fourth was poking a long spear at the enemy and the fifth and sixth were shooting him with a bow and arrow but luckily though the giants were so huge and had so many arms they had each but one heart and that no bigger nor braver than the heart of an ordinary man besides if they had been like the hundredarmed briareus the brave argonauts would have given them their hands full of fight jason and his friends went boldly to meet them slew a great many and made the rest take to their heels so that if the giants had had six legs apiece instead of six arms it would have served them better to run away with  another strange adventure happened when the voyagers came to thrace where they found a poor blind king named phineus deserted by his subjects and living in a very sorrowful way all by himself on jasons inquiring whether they could do him any service the king answered that he was terribly tormented by three great winged creatures called harpies which had the faces of women and the wings bodies and claws of vultures these ugly wretches were in the habit of snatching away his dinner and allowed him no peace of his life upon hearing this the argonauts spread a plentiful feast on the seashore well knowing from what the blind king said of their greediness that the harpies would snuff up the scent of the victuals and quickly come to steal them away and so it turned out for hardly was the table set before the three hideous vulture women came flapping their wings seized the food in their talons and flew off as fast as they could but the two sons of the north wind drew their swords spread their pinions and set off through the air in pursuit of the thieves whom they at last overtook among some islands after a chase of hundreds of miles the two winged youths blustered terribly at the harpies for they had the rough temper of their father and so frightened them with their drawn swords that they solemnly promised never to trouble king phineus again  then the argonauts sailed onward and met with many other marvelous incidents any one of which would make a story by itself at one time they landed on an island and were reposing on the grass when they suddenly found themselves assailed by what seemed a shower of steelheaded arrows some of them stuck in the ground while others hit against their shields and several penetrated their flesh the fifty heroes started up and looked about them for the hidden enemy but could find none nor see any spot on the whole island where even a single archer could lie concealed still however the steelheaded arrows came whizzing among them and at last happening to look upward they beheld a large flock of birds hovering and wheeling aloft and shooting their feathers down upon the argonauts these feathers were the steelheaded arrows that had so tormented them there was no possibility of making any resistance and the fifty heroic argonauts might all have been killed or wounded by a flock of troublesome birds without ever setting eyes on the golden fleece if jason had not thought of asking the advice of the oaken image  so he ran to the galley as fast as his legs would carry him  o daughter of the speaking oak cried he all out of breath we need your wisdom more than ever before we are in great peril from a flock of birds who are shooting us with their steelpointed feathers what can we do to drive them away  make a clatter on your shields said the image  on receiving this excellent counsel jason hurried back to his companions who were far more dismayed than when they fought with the sixarmed giants and bade them strike with their swords upon their brazen shields forthwith the fifty heroes set heartily to work banging with might and main and raised such a terrible clatter that the birds made what haste they could to get away and though they had shot half the feathers out of their wings they were soon seen skimming among the clouds a long distance off and looking like a flock of wild geese orpheus celebrated this victory by playing a triumphant anthem on his harp and sang so melodiously that jason begged him to desist lest as the steelfeathered birds had been driven away by an ugly sound they might be enticed back again by a sweet one  while the argonauts remained on this island they saw a small vessel approaching the shore in which were two young men of princely demeanor and exceedingly handsome as young princes generally were in those days now who do you imagine these two voyagers turned out to be why if you will believe me they were the sons of that very phrixus who in his childhood had been carried to colchis on the back of the goldenfleeced ram since that time phrixus had married the kings daughter and the two young princes had been born and brought up at colchis and had spent their playdays in the outskirts of the grove in the center of which the golden fleece was hanging upon a tree they were now on their way to greece in hopes of getting back a kingdom that had been wrongfully taken from their father  when the princes understood whither the argonauts were going they offered to turn back and guide them to colchis at the same time however they spoke as if it were very doubtful whether jason would succeed in getting the golden fleece according to their account the tree on which it hung was guarded by a terrible dragon who never failed to devour at one mouthful every person who might venture within his reach  there are other difficulties in the way continued the young princes but is not this enough ah brave jason turn back before it is too late it would grieve us to the heart if you and your nine and forty brave companions should be eaten up at fifty mouthfuls by this execrable dragon  my young friends quietly replied jason i do not wonder that you think the dragon very terrible you have grown up from infancy in the fear of this monster and therefore still regard him with the awe that children feel for the bugbears and hobgoblins which their nurses have talked to them about but in my view of the matter the dragon is merely a pretty large serpent who is not half so likely to snap me up at one mouthful as i am to cut off his ugly head and strip the skin from his body at all events turn back who may i will never see greece again unless i carry with me the golden fleece  we will none of us turn back cried his nine and forty brave comrades let us get on board the galley this instant and if the dragon is to make a breakfast of us much good may it do him  and orpheus whose custom it was to set everything to music began to harp and sing most gloriously and made every mothers son of them feel as if nothing in this world were so delectable as to fight dragons and nothing so truly honorable as to be eaten up at one mouthful in case of the worst  after this being now under the guidance of the two princes who were well acquainted with the way they quickly sailed to colchis when the king of the country whose name was aetes heard of their arrival he instantly summoned jason to court the king was a stern and cruel looking potentate and though he put on as polite and hospitable an expression as he could jason did not like his face a whit better than that of the wicked king pelias who dethroned his father you are welcome brave jason said king aetes pray are you on a pleasure voyageor do you meditate the discovery of unknown islandsor what other cause has procured me the happiness of seeing you at my court  great sir replied jason with an obeisancefor chiron had taught him how to behave with propriety whether to kings or beggarsi have come hither with a purpose which i now beg your majestys permission to execute king pelias who sits on my fathers throne to which he has no more right than to the one on which your excellent majesty is now seated has engaged to come down from it and to give me his crown and sceptre provided i bring him the golden fleece this as your majesty is aware is now hanging on a tree here at colchis and i humbly solicit your gracious leave to take it away in spite of himself the kings face twisted itself into an angry frown for above all things else in the world he prized the golden fleece and was even suspected of having done a very wicked act in order to get it into his own possession it put him into the worst possible humor therefore to hear that the gallant prince jason and fortynine of the bravest young warriors of greece had come to colchis with the sole purpose of taking away his chief treasure  do you know asked king aetes eyeing jason very sternly what are the conditions which you must fulfill before getting possession of the golden fleece  i have heard rejoined the youth that a dragon lies beneath the tree on which the prize hangs and that whoever approaches him runs the risk of being devoured at a mouthful  true said the king with a smile that did not look particularly goodnatured very true young man but there are other things as hard or perhaps a little harder to be done before you can even have the privilege of being devoured by the dragon for example you must first tame my two brazenfooted and brazenlunged bulls which vulcan the wonderful blacksmith made for me there is a furnace in each of their stomachs and they breathe such hot fire out of their mouths and nostrils that nobody has hitherto gone nigh them without being instantly burned to a small black cinder what do you think of this my brave jason  i must encounter the peril answered jason composedly since it stands in the way of my purpose  after taming the fiery bulls continued king aetes who was determined to scare jason if possible you must yoke them to a plow and must plow the sacred earth in the grove of mars and sow some of the same dragons teeth from which cadmus raised a crop of armed men they are an unruly set of reprobates those sons of the dragons teeth and unless you treat them suitably they will fall upon you sword in hand you and your nine and forty argonauts my bold jason are hardly numerous or strong enough to fight with such a host as will spring up  my master chiron replied jason taught me long ago the story of cadmus perhaps i can manage the quarrelsome sons of the dragons teeth as well as cadmus did  i wish the dragon had him muttered king aetes to himself and the fourfooted pedant his schoolmaster into the bargain why what a foolhardy selfconceited coxcomb he is well see what my firebreathing bulls will do for him well prince jason he continued aloud and as complaisantly as he could make yourself comfortable for today and tomorrow morning since you insist upon it you shall try your skill at the plow  while the king talked with jason a beautiful young woman was standing behind the throne she fixed her eyes earnestly upon the youthful stranger and listened attentively to every word that was spoken and when jason withdrew from the kings presence this young woman followed him out of the room  i am the kings daughter she said to him and my name is medea i know a great deal of which other young princesses are ignorant and can do many things which they would be afraid so much as to dream of if you will trust to me i can instruct you how to tame the fiery bulls and sow the dragons teeth and get the golden fleece  indeed beautiful princess answered jason if you will do me this service i promise to be grateful to you my whole life long gazing at medea he beheld a wonderful intelligence in her face she was one of those persons whose eyes are full of mystery so that while looking into them you seem to see a very great way as into a deep well yet can never be certain whether you see into the farthest depths or whether there be not something else hidden at the bottom if jason had been capable of fearing anything he would have been afraid of making this young princess his enemy for beautiful as she now looked she might the very next instant become as terrible as the dragon that kept watch over the golden fleece  princess he exclaimed you seem indeed very wise and very powerful but how can you help me to do the things of which you speak are you an enchantress  yes prince jason answered medea with a smile you have hit upon the truth i am an enchantress circe my fathers sister taught me to be one and i could tell you if i pleased who was the old woman with the peacock the pomegranate and the cuckoo staff whom you carried over the river and likewise who it is that speaks through the lips of the oaken image that stands in the prow of your galley i am acquainted with some of your secrets you perceive it is well for you that i am favorably inclined for otherwise you would hardly escape being snapped up by the dragon  i should not so much care for the dragon replied jason if i only knew how to manage the brazenfooted and fierylunged bulls  if you are as brave as i think you and as you have need to be said medea your own bold heart will teach you that there is but one way of dealing with a mad bull what it is i leave you to find out in the moment of peril as for the fiery breath of these animals i have a charmed ointment here which will prevent you from being burned up and cure you if you chance to be a little scorched  so she put a golden box into his hand and directed him how to apply the perfumed unguent which it contained and where to meet her at midnight  only be brave added she and before daybreak the brazen bulls shall be tamed  the young man assured her that his heart would not fail him he then rejoined his comrades and told them what had passed between the princess and himself and warned them to be in readiness in case there might be need of their help at the appointed hour he met the beautiful medea on the marble steps of the kings palace she gave him a basket in which were the dragons teeth just as they had been pulled out of the monsters jaws by cadmus long ago medea then led jason down the palace steps and through the silent streets of the city and into the royal pasture ground where the two brazenfooted bulls were kept it was a starry night with a bright gleam along the eastern edge of the sky where the moon was soon going to show herself after entering the pasture the princess paused and looked around  there they are said she reposing themselves and chewing their fiery cuds in that farthest corner of the field it will be excellent sport i assure you when they catch a glimpse of your figure my father and all his court delight in nothing so much as to see a stranger trying to yoke them in order to come at the golden fleece it makes a holiday in colchis whenever such a thing happens for my part i enjoy it immensely you cannot imagine in what a mere twinkling of an eye their hot breath shrivels a young man into a black cinder  are you sure beautiful medea asked jason quite sure that the unguent in the gold box will prove a remedy against those terrible burns  if you doubt if you are in the least afraid said the princess looking him in the face by the dim starlight you had better never have been born than to go a step nigher to the bulls  but jason had set his heart steadfastly on getting the golden fleece and i positively doubt whether he would have gone back without it even had he been certain of finding himself turned into a redhot cinder or a handful of white ashes the instant he made a step farther he therefore let go medeas hand and walked boldly forward in the direction whither she had pointed at some distance before him he perceived four streams of fiery vapor regularly appearing and again vanishing after dimly lighting up the surrounding obscurity these you will understand were caused by the breath of the brazen bulls which was quietly stealing out of their four nostrils as they lay chewing their cuds  at the first two or three steps which jason made the four fiery streams appeared to gush out somewhat more plentifully for the two brazen bulls had heard his foot tramp and were lifting up their hot noses to snuff the air he went a little farther and by the way in which the red vapor now spouted forth he judged that the creatures had got upon their feet now he could see glowing sparks and vivid jets of flame at the next step each of the bulls made the pasture echo with a terrible roar while the burning breath which they thus belched forth lit up the whole field with a momentary flash one other stride did bold jason make and suddenly as a streak of lightning on came these fiery animals roaring like thunder and sending out sheets of white flame which so kindled up the scene that the young man could discern every object more distinctly than by daylight most distinctly of all he saw the two horrible creatures galloping right down upon him their brazen hoofs rattling and ringing over the ground and their tails sticking up stiffly into the air as has always been the fashion with angry bulls their breath scorched the herbage before them so intensely hot it was indeed that it caught a dry tree under which jason was now standing and set it all in a light blaze but as for jason himself thanks to medeas enchanted ointment the white flame curled around his body without injuring him a jot more than if he had been made of asbestos  greatly encouraged at finding himself not yet turned into a cinder the young man awaited the attack of the bulls just as the brazen brutes fancied themselves sure of tossing him into the air he caught one of them by the horn and the other by his screwedup tail and held them in a gripe like that of an iron vice one with his right hand the other with his left well he must have been wonderfully strong in his arms to be sure but the secret of the matter was that the brazen bulls were enchanted creatures and that jason had broken the spell of their fiery fierceness by his bold way of handling them and ever since that time it has been the favorite method of brave men when danger assails them to do what they call taking the bull by the horns and to gripe him by the tail is pretty much the same thingthat is to throw aside fear and overcome the peril by despising it it was now easy to yoke the bulls and to harness them to the plow which had lain rusting on the ground for a great many years gone by so long was it before anybody could be found capable of plowing that piece of land jason i suppose had been taught how to draw a furrow by the good old chiron who perhaps used to allow himself to be harnessed to the plow at any rate our hero succeeded perfectly well in breaking up the greensward and by the time that the moon was a quarter of her journey up the sky the plowed field lay before him a large tract of black earth ready to be sown with the dragons teeth so jason scattered them broadcast and harrowed them into the soil with a brushharrow and took his stand on the edge of the field anxious to see what would happen next  must we wait long for harvest time he inquired of medea who was now standing by his side  whether sooner or later it will be sure to come answered the princess a crop of armed men never fails to spring up when the dragons teeth have been sown  the moon was now high aloft in the heavens and threw its bright beams over the plowed field where as yet there was nothing to be seen any farmer on viewing it would have said that jason must wait weeks before the green blades would peep from among the clods and whole months before the yellow grain would be ripened for the sickle but by and by all over the field there was something that glistened in the moonbeams like sparkling drops of dew these bright objects sprouted higher and proved to be the steel heads of spears then there was a dazzling gleam from a vast number of polished brass helmets beneath which as they grew farther out of the soil appeared the dark and bearded visages of warriors struggling to free themselves from the imprisoning earth the first look that they gave at the upper world was a glare of wrath and defiance next were seen their bright breastplates in every right hand there was a sword or a spear and on each left arm a shield and when this strange crop of warriors had but half grown out of the earth they struggledsuch was their impatience of restraintand as it were tore themselves up by the roots wherever a dragons tooth had fallen there stood a man armed for battle they made a clangor with their swords against their shields and eyed one another fiercely for they had come into this beautiful world and into the peaceful moonlight full of rage and stormy passions and ready to take the life of every human brother in recompense of the boon of their own existence  there have been many other armies in the world that seemed to possess the same fierce nature with the one which had now sprouted from the dragons teeth but these in the moonlit field were the more excusable because they never had women for their mothers and how it would have rejoiced any great captain who was bent on conquering the world like alexander or napoleon to raise a crop of armed soldiers as easily as jason did for a while the warriors stood flourishing their weapons clashing their swords against their shields and boiling over with the redhot thirst for battle then they began to shoutshow us the enemy lead us to the charge death or victory come on brave comrades conquer or die and a hundred other outcries such as men always bellow forth on a battle field and which these dragon people seemed to have at their tongues ends at last the front rank caught sight of jason who beholding the flash of so many weapons in the moonlight had thought it best to draw his sword in a moment all the sons of the dragons teeth appeared to take jason for an enemy and crying with one voice guard the golden fleece they ran at him with uplifted swords and protruded spears jason knew that it would be impossible to withstand this bloodthirsty battalion with his single arm but determined since there was nothing better to be done to die as valiantly as if he himself had sprung from a dragons tooth  medea however bade him snatch up a stone from the ground  throw it among them quickly cried she it is the only way to save yourself  the armed men were now so nigh that jason could discern the fire flashing out of their enraged eyes when he let fly the stone and saw it strike the helmet of a tall warrior who was rushing upon him with his blade aloft the stone glanced from this mans helmet to the shield of his nearest comrade and thence flew right into the angry face of another hitting him smartly between the eyes each of the three who had been struck by the stone took it for granted that his next neighbor had given him a blow and instead of running any farther towards jason they began to fight among themselves the confusion spread through the host so that it seemed scarcely a moment before they were all hacking hewing and stabbing at one another lopping off arms heads and legs and doing such memorable deeds that jason was filled with immense admiration although at the same time he could not help laughing to behold these mighty men punishing each other for an offense which he himself had committed in an incredibly short space of time almost as short indeed as it had taken them to grow up all but one of the heroes of the dragons teeth were stretched lifeless on the field the last survivor the bravest and strongest of the whole had just force enough to wave his crimson sword over his head and give a shout of exultation crying victory victory immortal fame when he himself fell down and lay quietly among his slain brethren  and there was the end of the army that had sprouted from the dragons teeth that fierce and feverish fight was the only enjoyment which they had tasted on this beautiful earth  let them sleep in the bed of honor said the princess medea with a sly smile at jason the world will always have simpletons enough just like them fighting and dying for they know not what and fancying that posterity will take the trouble to put laurel wreaths on their rusty and battered helmets could you help smiling prince jason to see the selfconceit of that last fellow just as he tumbled down  it made me very sad answered jason gravely and to tell you the truth princess the golden fleece does not appear so well worth the winning after what i have here beheld  you will think differently in the morning said medea true the golden fleece may not be so valuable as you have thought it but then there is nothing better in the world and one must needs have an object you know come your nights work has been well performed and tomorrow you can inform king aetes that the first part of your allotted task is fulfilled  agreeably to medeas advice jason went betimes in the morning to the palace of king aetes entering the presence chamber he stood at the foot of the throne and made a low obeisance  your eyes look heavy prince jason observed the king you appear to have spent a sleepless night i hope you have been considering the matter a little more wisely and have concluded not to get yourself scorched to a cinder in attempting to tame my brazenlunged bulls  that is already accomplished may it please your majesty replied jason the bulls have been tamed and yoked the field has been plowed the dragons teeth have been sown broadcast and harrowed into the soil the crop of armed warriors have sprung up and they have slain one another to the last man and now i solicit your majestys permission to encounter the dragon that i may take down the golden fleece from the tree and depart with my nine and forty comrades  king aetes scowled and looked very angry and excessively disturbed for he knew that in accordance with his kingly promise he ought now to permit jason to win the fleece if his courage and skill should enable him to do so but since the young man had met with such good luck in the matter of the brazen bulls and the dragons teeth the king feared that he would be equally successful in slaying the dragon and therefore though he would gladly have seen jason snapped up at a mouthful he was resolved and it was a very wrong thing of this wicked potentate not to run any further risk of losing his beloved fleece  you never would have succeeded in this business young man said he if my undutiful daughter medea had not helped you with her enchantments had you acted fairly you would have been at this instant a black cinder or a handful of white ashes i forbid you on pain of death to make any more attempts to get the golden fleece to speak my mind plainly you shall never set eyes on so much as one of its glistening locks  jason left the kings presence in great sorrow and anger he could think of nothing better to be done than to summon together his fortynine brave argonauts march at once to the grove of mars slay the dragon take possession of the golden fleece get on board the argo and spread all sail for iolchos the success of this scheme depended it is true on the doubtful point whether all the fifty heroes might not be snapped up at so many mouthfuls by the dragon but as jason was hastening down the palace steps the princess medea called after him and beckoned him to return her black eyes shone upon him with such a keen intelligence that he felt as if there were a serpent peeping out of them and although she had done him so much service only the night before he was by no means very certain that she would not do him an equally great mischief before sunset these enchantresses you must know are never to be depended upon  what says king aetes my royal and upright father inquired medea slightly smiling will he give you the golden fleece without any further risk or trouble  on the contrary answered jason he is very angry with me for taming the brazen bulls and sowing the dragons teeth and he forbids me to make any more attempts and positively refuses to give up the golden fleece whether i slay the dragon or no  yes jason said the princess and i can tell you more unless you set sail from colchis before tomorrows sunrise the king means to burn your fiftyoared galley and put yourself and your fortynine brave comrades to the sword but be of good courage the golden fleece you shall have if it lies within the power of my enchantments to get it for you wait for me here an hour before midnight  at the appointed hour you might again have seen prince jason and the princess medea side by side stealing through the streets of colchis on their way to the sacred grove in the center of which the golden fleece was suspended to a tree while they were crossing the pasture ground the brazen bulls came towards jason lowing nodding their heads and thrusting forth their snouts which as other cattle do they loved to have rubbed and caressed by a friendly hand their fierce nature was thoroughly tamed and with their fierceness the two furnaces in their stomachs had likewise been extinguished insomuch that they probably enjoyed far more comfort in grazing and chewing their cuds than ever before indeed it had heretofore been a great inconvenience to these poor animals that whenever they wished to eat a mouthful of grass the fire out of their nostrils had shriveled it up before they could manage to crop it how they contrived to keep themselves alive is more than i can imagine but now instead of emitting jets of flame and streams of sulphurous vapor they breathed the very sweetest of cow breath  after kindly patting the bulls jason followed medeas guidance into the grove of mars where the great oak trees that had been growing for centuries threw so thick a shade that the moonbeams struggled vainly to find their way through it only here and there a glimmer fell upon the leafstrewn earth or now and then a breeze stirred the boughs aside and gave jason a glimpse of the sky lest in that deep obscurity he might forget that there was one overhead at length when they had gone farther and farther into the heart of the duskiness medea squeezed jasons hand  look yonder she whispered do you see it  gleaming among the venerable oaks there was a radiance not like the moonbeams but rather resembling the golden glory of the setting sun it proceeded from an object which appeared to be suspended at about a mans height from the ground a little farther within the wood  what is it asked jason  have you come so far to seek it exclaimed medea and do you not recognize the meed of all your toils and perils when it glitters before your eyes it is the golden fleece  jason went onward a few steps farther and then stopped to gaze o how beautiful it looked shining with a marvelous light of its own that inestimable prize which so many heroes had longed to behold but had perished in the quest of it either by the perils of their voyage or by the fiery breath of the brazenlunged bulls  how gloriously it shines cried jason in a rapture it has surely been dipped in the richest gold of sunset let me hasten onward and take it to my bosom  stay said medea holding him back have you forgotten what guards it  to say the truth in the joy of beholding the object of his desires the terrible dragon had quite slipped out of jasons memory soon however something came to pass that reminded him what perils were still to be encountered an antelope that probably mistook the yellow radiance for sunrise came bounding fleetly through the grove he was rushing straight towards the golden fleece when suddenly there was a frightful hiss and the immense head and half the scaly body of the dragon was thrust forth for he was twisted round the trunk of the tree on which the fleece hung and seizing the poor antelope swallowed him with one snap of his jaws  after this feat the dragon seemed sensible that some other living creature was within reach on which he felt inclined to finish his meal in various directions he kept poking his ugly snout among the trees stretching out his neck a terrible long way now here now there and now close to the spot where jason and the princess were hiding behind an oak upon my word as the head came waving and undulating through the air and reaching almost within arms length of prince jason it was a very hideous and uncomfortable sight the gape of his enormous jaws was nearly as wide as the gateway of the kings palace  well jason whispered medea for she was ill natured as all enchantresses are and wanted to make the bold youth tremble what do you think now of your prospect of winning the golden fleece  jason answered only by drawing his sword and making a step forward  stay foolish youth said medea grasping his arm do not you see you are lost without me as your good angel in this gold box i have a magic potion which will do the dragons business far more effectually than your sword  the dragon had probably heard the voices for swift as lightning his black head and forked tongue came hissing among the trees again darting full forty feet at a stretch as it approached medea tossed the contents of the gold box right down the monsters wideopen throat immediately with an outrageous hiss and a tremendous wriggleflinging his tail up to the tiptop of the tallest tree and shattering all its branches as it crashed heavily down againthe dragon fell at full length upon the ground and lay quite motionless  it is only a sleeping potion said the enchantress to prince jason one always finds a use for these mischievous creatures sooner or later so i did not wish to kill him outright quick snatch the prize and let us begone you have won the golden fleece  jason caught the fleece from the tree and hurried through the grove the deep shadows of which were illuminated as he passed by the golden glory of the precious object that he bore along a little way before him he beheld the old woman whom he had helped over the stream with her peacock beside her she clapped her hands for joy and beckoning him to make haste disappeared among the duskiness of the trees espying the two winged sons of the north wind who were disporting themselves in the moonlight a few hundred feet aloft jason bade them tell the rest of the argonauts to embark as speedily as possible but lynceus with his sharp eyes had already caught a glimpse of him bringing the golden fleece although several stone walls a hill and the black shadows of the grove of mars intervened between by his advice the heroes had seated themselves on the benches of the galley with their oars held perpendicularly ready to let fall into the water  as jason drew near he heard the talking image calling to him with more than ordinary eagerness in its grave sweet voice  make haste prince jason for your life make haste  with one bound he leaped aboard at sight of the glorious radiance of the golden fleece the nine and forty heroes gave a mighty shout and orpheus striking his harp sang a song of triumph to the cadence of which the galley flew over the water homeward bound as if careering along with wings
