three cherry trees once   grew in a garden all shady and there for delight of so gladsome a sight   walked a most beautiful lady   dreamed a most beautiful lady    birds in those branches did sing   blackbird and throstle and linnet but she walking there was by far the most fair   lovelier than all else within it   blackbird and throstle and linnet    but blossoms to berries do come   all hanging on stalks light and slender and one long summers day charmed that lady away   with vows sweet and merry and tender   a lover with voice low and tender    moss and lichen the green branches deck   weeds nod in its paths green and shady yet a light footstep seems there to wander in dreams   the ghost of that beautiful lady   that happy and beautiful lady     old susan   when susans work was done shed sit with one fat guttering candle lit and window opened wide to win the sweet night air to enter in there with a thumb to keep her place shed read with stern and wrinkled face her mild eyes gliding very slow across the letters to and fro while wagged the guttering candle flame in the wind that through the window came and sometimes in the silence she would mumble a sentence audibly or shake her head as if to say you silly souls to act this way and never a sound from night id hear unless some faroff cock crowed clear or her old shuffling thumb should turn another page and rapt and stern through her great glasses bent on me shed glance into reality and shake her round old silvery head withyoui thought you was in bed only to tilt her book again and rooted in romance remain     old ben   sad is old ben thistlewaite   now his day is done and all his children   far away are gone  he sits beneath his jasmined porch   his stick between his knees his eyes fixed vacant   on his mossgrown trees  grass springs in the green path   his flowers are lean and dry his thatch hangs in wisps against   the evening sky  he has no heart to care now   though the winds will blow whistling in his casement   and the rain drip thro  he thinks of his old bettie   how shed shake her head and say youll live to wish my sharp old tongue   could scoldsome day  but as in pale high autumn skies   the swallows float and play his restless thoughts pass to and fro   but nowhere stay  soft on the morrow they are gone   his garden then will be denser and shadier and greener   greener the mossgrown tree     miss loo   when thinstrewn memory i look through i see most clearly poor miss loo her tabby cat her cage of birds her nose her hairher muffled words and how shed open her green eyes as if in some immense surprise whenever as we sat at tea she made some small remark to me  its always drowsy summer when from out the past she comes again the westering sunshine in a pool floats in her parlour still and cool while the slim bird its lean wires shakes as into piercing song it breaks till peters palegreen eyes ajar dream wake wake dream in one brief bar  and i am sitting dull and shy and she with gaze of vacancy and large hands folded on the tray musing the afternoon away her satin bosom heaving slow with sighs that softly ebb and flow and her plain face in such dismay it seems unkind to look her way until all cheerful back will come her cheerful gleaming spirit home and one would think that poor miss loo asked nothing else if she had you     the tailor   few footsteps stray when dusk droops oer the tailors old stonelintelled door there sits he stitching half asleep beside his smoky tallow dip click click his needle hastes and shrill cries back the cricket neath the sill sometimes he stays and oer his thread leans sidelong his old tousled head or stoops to peer with halfshut eye when some strange footfall echoes by till clearer gleams his candles spark into the dusty summer dark then from his crosslegs he gets down to find how dark the evenings grown and hunchedup in his door hell hear the cricket whistling crisp and clear and so beneath the starry grey will mutter half a seam away     martha   once  once upon a time    over and over again martha would tell us her stories   in the hazel glen  hers were those clear grey eyes   you watch and the story seems told by their beautifulness   tranquil as dreams  shed sit with her two slim hands   clasped round her bended knees while we on our elbows lolled   and stared at ease  her voice and her narrow chin   her grave small lovely head seemed half the meaning   of the words she said  once  once upon a time    like a dream you dream in the night fairies and gnomes stole out   in the leafgreen light  and her beauty far away   would fade as her voice ran on till hazel and summer sun   and all were gone  all fordone and forgot   and like clouds in the height of the sky our hearts stood still in the hush   of an age gone by     the sleeper   as ann came in one summers day   she felt that she must creep so silent was the clear cool house   it seemed a house of sleep and sure when she pushed open the door   rapt in the stillness there her mother sat with stooping head   asleep upon a chair fastfast asleep her two hands laid   loosefolded on her knee so that her small unconscious face   looked half unreal to be so calmly lit with sleeps pale light   each feature was so fair her foreheadevery trouble was   smoothd out beneath her hair but though her mind in dream now moved   still seemed her gaze to rest from out beneath her fastsealed lids   above her moving breast on ann as quite quite still she stood   yet slumber lay so deep even her hands upon her lap   seemed saturate with sleep and as ann peeped a cloudlike dread   stole over her and then on stealthy mouselike feet she trod   and tiptoed out again     the keys of morning   while at her bedroom window once   learning her task for school little louisa lonely sat   in the morning clear and cool she slanted her small beadbrown eyes   across the empty street and saw death softly watching her   in the sunshine pale and sweet his was a long lean sallow face   he sat with halfshut eyes like an old sailor in a ship   becalmed neath tropic skies beside him in the dust hed set   his staff and shady hat these peeping small louisa saw   quite clearly where she sat the thinness of his coalblack locks   his hands so long and lean they scarcely seemed to grasp at all   the keys that hung between both were of gold but one was small   and with this last did he wag in the air as if to say   come hither child to me  louisa laid her lesson book   on the cold windowsill and in the sleepy sunshine house   went softly down until she stood in the halfopened door   and peeped but strange to say where death just now had sunning sat   only a shadow lay just the tall chimneys roundtopped cowl   and the small sun behind had with its shadow in the dust   called sleepy death to mind but most she thought how strange it was   two keys that he should bear and that when beckoning he should wag   the littlest in the air     rachel   rachel sings sweet   oh yes at night her pale face bent   in the candlelight her slim hands touch   the answering keys and she sings of hope   and of memories sings to the little   boy that stands watching those slim   light heedful hands he looks in her face   her dark eyes seem dark with a beautiful   distant dream and still she plays   sings tenderly to him of hope   and of memory     alone   a very old woman lives in yon house the squeak of the cricket the stir of the mouse are all she knows of the earth and us  once she was young would dance and play like many another young popinjay and run to her mother at dusk of day  and colours bright she delighted in the fiddle to hear and to lift her chin and sing as small as a twittering wren  but age apace comes at last to all and a lone house filled with the crickets call and the scampering mouse in the hollow wall     the bells   shadow and light both strove to be the eight bellringers company as with his gliding rope in hand counting his changes each did stand while rang and trembled every stone to music by the bellmouths blown till the bright clouds that towered on high seemed to reecho cry with cry still swang the clappers to and fro when in the farspread fields below i saw a ploughman with his team lift to the bells and fix on them his distant eyes as if he would drink in the utmost sound he could while near him sat his children three and in the green grass placidly played undistracted on as if what music earthly bells might give could only faintly stir their dream and stillness make more lovely seem soon night hid horses children all in sleep deep and ambrosial yet yet it seemed from star to star welling now near now faint and far those echoing bells rang on in dream and stillness made even lovelier seem     the scarecrow   all winter through i bow my head   beneath the driving rain the north wind powders me with snow   and blows me black again at midnight neath a maze of stars   i flame with glittering rime and stand above the stubble stiff   as mail at morningprime but when that child called spring and all   his host of children come scattering their buds and dew upon   those acres of my home some rapture in my rags awakes   i lift void eyes and scan the skies for crows those ravening foes   of my strange master man i watch him striding lank behind   his clashing team and know soon will the wheat swish body high   where once lay sterile snow soon shall i gaze across a sea   of sunbegotten grain which my unflinching watch hath sealed   for harvest once again     nod   softly along the road of evening   in a twilight dim with rose wrinkled with age and drenched with dew   old nod the shepherd goes  his drowsy flock streams on before him   their fleeces charged with gold to where the suns last beam leans low   on nod the shepherds fold  the hedge is quick and green with briar   from their sand the conies creep and all the birds that fly in heaven   flock singing home to sleep  his lambs outnumber a noons roses   yet when nights shadows fall his blind old sheepdog slumbersoon   misses not one of all  his are the quiet steeps of dreamland   the waters of nomorepain his rams bell rings neath an arch of stars   rest rest and rest again     the bindweed   the bindweed roots pierce down deeper than men do lie laid in their darkshut graves their slumbering kinsmen by  yet what frail thinspun flowers she casts into the air to breathe the sunshine and to leave her fragrance there  but when the sweet moon comes showering her silver down halfwreathèd in faint sleep they droop where they have blown  so all the grass is set beneath her trembling ray with buds that have been flowers brimmed with reflected day     winter     clouded with snow   the cold winds blow and shrill on leafless bough the robin with its burning breast   alone sings now    the rayless sun   days journey done sheds its last ebbing light on fields in leagues of beauty spread   unearthly white    thick draws the dark   and spark by spark the frostfires kindle and soon over that sea of frozen foam   floats the white moon     there blooms no bud in may   there blooms no bud in may can for its white compare with snow at break of day on fields forlorn and bare  for shadow it hath rose azure and amethyst and every air that blows dies out in beauteous mist  it hangs the frozen bough with flowers on which the night wheeling her darkness through scatters a starry light  fearful of its pale glare in flocks the starlings rise slide through the frosty air and perch with plaintive cries  only the inky rook hunched cold in ruffled wings its snowy nest forsook caws of unnumbered springs     noon and night flower     not any flower that blows   but shining watch doth keep every swift changing chequered hour it knows now to break forth in beauty now to sleep    this for the roving bee   keeps open house and this stainless and clear is that in darkness she may lure the moth to where her nectar is    lovely beyond the rest   are these of all delight the tiny pimpernel that noon loves best the primrose palely burning through the night    one neath days burning sky   with ruby decks her place the other when eves chariot glideth by lifts her dim torch to light that dreaming face     estranged   no one was with me there happy i wasalone yet from the sunshine suddenly   a joy was gone  a bird in an empty house sad echoes makes to ring flitting from room to room   on restless wing  till from its shades he flies and leaves forlorn and dim the narrow solitudes   so strange to him  so when with fickle heart i joyed in the passing day a presence my mood estranged   went grieved away     the tired cupid   the thin moonlight with trickling ray thridding the boughs of silver may trembles in beauty pale and cool on folded flower and mantled pool all in a haze the rushes lean and hehe sits with chin between his two cold hands his bare feet set deep in the grasses green and wet about his head a hundred rings of gold loop down to meet his wings whose feathers arched their stillness through gleam with slowgathering drops of dew the mousebat peers the stealthy vole creeps from the covert of its hole a shimmering moth its pinions furls grey in the moonshine of his curls neath the faint stars the nightairs stray scattering the fragrance of the may and with each stirring of the bough shadow beclouds his childlike brow     dreams   be gentle o hands of a child be true like a shadowy sea in the starry darkness of night   are your eyes to me  but words are shallow and soon dreams fade that the heart once knew and youth fades out in the mind   in the dark eyes too  what can a tired heart say which the wise of the world have made dumb save to the lonely dreams of a child   return again come     faithless   the words you said grow faint the lamp you lit burns dim yet still be near your faithless friend to urge and counsel him  still with returning feet to where lifes shadows brood with steadfast eyes made clear in death haunt his vague solitude  so he beguiled with earth yet with its vain things vexed keep even to his own heart unknown your memory unperplexed     the shade   darker than night and oh much darker she whose eyes in deep night darkness gaze on me no stars surround her yet the moon seems hid afar somewhere beneath that narrow lid she darkens against the darkness and her face only by adding thought to thought i trace limned shadowily o dream return once more to gloomy hades and the whispering shore     be angry now no more   be angry now no more if i have grieved theeif thy kindness mine before no hope may now restore only forgive forgive  if still resentment burns in thy cold breast oh if no more to pity turns no more once tender yearns thy love oh yet forgive  ask of the winter rain junes withered rose again ask grace of the salt sea she will not answer thee god would ten times have shriven a heart so riven in her cold care thoudst be still unforgiven     spring   once when my life was young i too with springs bright face by mine walked softly along   pace to his pace  then burned his crimson may like a clear flame outspread arching our happy way   then would he shed  strangely from his wild face wonderful light on me like hounds that keen in chase   their quarry see  oh sorrow now to know what shafts what keenness cold his are to pierce me through   now that im old     exile   had the gods loved me i had lain   where darnel is and thorn and the wild nightbirds nightlong strain   trembles in boughs forlorn  nay but they loved me not and i   must needs a stranger be whose every exiled day gone by   aches with their memory     where         where is my love     in silence and shadow she lies under the aprilgrey calm waste of the skies       and a bird above     in the darkness tender and clear keeps saying over and over love lies here        not that shes dead     only her soul is flown out of its last pure earthly mansion       and cries instead     in the darkness tender and clear like the voice of a bird in the leaves lovelove lies here     music unheard   sweet sounds begone whose music on my ear stirs foolish discontent of lingering here when if i crossed the crystal verge of death him i should see who these sounds murmureth  sweet sounds begone ask not my heart to break its bond of bravery for sweet quiets sake lure not my feet to leave the path they must tread on unfaltering till i sleep in dust  sweet sounds begone though silence brings apace deadly disquiet of this homeless place and all i love in beauty cries to me we but vain shadows and reflections be     all thats past   very old are the woods   and the buds that break out of the briars boughs   when march winds wake so old with their beauty are   oh no man knows through what wild centuries   roves back the rose  very old are the brooks   and the rills that rise where snow sleeps cold beneath   the azure skies sing such a history   of come and gone their every drop is as wise   as solomon  very old are we men   our dreams are tales told in dim eden   by eves nightingales we wake and whisper awhile   but the day gone by silence and sleep like fields   of amaranth lie     when the rose is faded   when the rose is faded memory may still dwell on her beauty shadowed and the sweet smell gone  that vanishing loveliness that burdening breath no bond of life hath then nor grief of death  tis the immortal thought whose passion still makes of the changing the unchangeable  oh thus thy beauty loveliest on earth to me dark with no sorrow shines and burns with thee     sleep   men all and birds and creeping beasts when the dark of night is deep from the moving wonder of their lives commit themselves to sleep  without a thought or fear they shut the narrow gates of sense heedless and quiet in slumber turn their strength to impotence  the transient strangeness of the earth their spirits no more see within a silent gloom withdrawn they slumber in secrecy  two worlds they havea globe forgot wheeling from dark to light and all the enchanted realm of dream that burgeons out of night     the stranger     halfhidden in a graveyard   in the blackness of a yew where never living creature stirs   nor sunbeam pierces through    is a tombstone green and crooked   its faded legend gone and but one rainworn cherubs head   to sing of the unknown    there when the dusk is falling   silence broods so deep it seems that every wind that breathes   blows from the fields of sleep    day breaks in heedless beauty   kindling each drop of dew but unforsaking shadow dwells   beneath this lonely yew    and all else lost and faded   only this listening head keeps with a strange unanswering smile   its secret with the dead     never more sailor   never more sailor shalt thou be tossed on the windridden restless sea its tides may labour all the world shake neath that weight of waters hurled but its whole shock can only stir thy dust to a quiet even quieter thou mockdst at land who now art come to such a small and shallow home yet bore the sea full many a care for bones that once a sailors were and though the graves deep soundlessness thy once seadeafened ear distress no robin ever on the deep hopped with his song to haunt thy sleep     the witch   weary went the old witch weary of her pack she sat her down by the churchyard wall and jerked it off her back  the cord brake yes the cord brake just where the dead did lie and charms and spells and sorceries spilled out beneath the sky  weary was the old witch she rested her old eyes from the lanternfruited yew trees and the scarlet of the skies  and out the dead came stumbling from every rift and crack silent as moss and plundered the gaping pack  they wish them three times over away they skip full soon bat and mole and leveret under the rising moon  owl and newt and nightjar they take their shapes and creep silent as churchyard lichen while she squats asleep  all of these dead were stirring each unto each did call a witch a witch is sleeping under the churchyard wall  a witch a witch is sleeping the shrillness ebbed away and up the wayworn moon clomb bright hard on the track of day  she shone high wan and silvery days colours paled and died and save the mute and creeping worm nought else was there beside  names may be writ and mounds rise purporting here be bones but empty is that churchyard of all save stones  owl and newt and nightjar leveret bat and mole haunt and call in the twilight where she slept poor soul     arabia   far are the shades of arabia where the princes ride at noon mid the verdurous vales and thickets under the ghost of the moon and so dark is that vaulted purple flowers in the forest rise and toss into blossom gainst the phantom stars pale in the noonday skies  sweet is the music of arabia in my heart when out of dreams i still in the thin clear mirk of dawn descry her gliding streams hear her strange lutes on the green banks ring loud with the grief and delight of the dimsilked darkhaired musicians in the brooding silence of night  they haunt meher lutes and her forests no beauty on earth i see but shadowed with that dream recalls her loveliness to me still eyes look coldly upon me cold voices whisper and say he is crazed with the spell of far arabia they have stolen his wits away     the mountains   still and blanched and cold and lone the icy hills far off from me with frosty ulys overgrown stand in their sculptured secrecy  no path of theirs the chamois fleet treads with a nostril to the wind oer their icemarbled glaciers beat no wings of eagles in my mind  yea in my mind these mountains rise their perils dyed with evenings rose and still my ghost sits at my eyes and thirsts for their untroubled snows     queen djenira   when queen djenira slumbers through   the sultry noons repose from out her dreams as soft she lies   a faint thin music flows  her lovely hands lie narrow and pale   with gilded nails her head couched in its banded nets of gold   lies pillowed on her bed  the little nubian boys who fan   her cheeks and tresses clear wonderful wonderful wonderful voices   seem afar to hear  they slide their eyes and nodding say   queen djenira walks today the courts of the lord pthamasar   where the sweet birds of psuthys are  and those of earth about her porch   of shadow cool and grey their sidelong beaks in silence lean   and silent flit away     nevertobe   down by the waters of the sea reigns the king of nevertobe his palace walls are black with night his torches star and moonès light and for his timepiece deep and grave beats on the green unhastening wave  windswept are his high corridors his pleasance the seamantled shores for sentinel a shadow stands with hair in heaven and cloudy hands and round his bed kings guards to be watch pines in iron solemnity  his hound is mute his steed at will roams pastures deep with asphodel his queen is to her slumber gone his courtiers mute lie hewn in stone he hath forgot where he did hide his sceptre in the mountainside  greycapped and muttering mad is he the childless king of nevertobe for all his people in the deep keep everlasting fast asleep and all his realm is foam and rain whispering of what comes not again     the dark chateau   in dreams a dark château   stands ever open to me in far ravines dreamwaters flow   descending soundlessly above its peaks the eagle floats   lone in a sunless sky mute are the golden woodland throats   of the birds flitting by  no voice is audible the wind   sleeps in its peace no flower of the light can find   refuge neath its trees only the darkening ivy climbs   mingled with wilding rose and cypress morn and evening times   black shadow throws  all vacant and unknown   only the dreamer steps from stone to hollow stone   where the green moss sleeps peers at the river in its deeps   the eagle lone in the sky while the dew of evening drips   coldly and silently  would that i could press in   into each secret room would that my sleepbright eyes could win   to the inner gloom gaze from its high windows   far down its mouldering walls where amberclear still lethe flows   and foaming falls  but ever as i gaze   from slumber soft doth come some touch my stagnant sense to raise   to its old earthly home fades then that sky serene   and peak of ageless snow fades to a paling dawnlit green   my dark château     the dwellingplace   deep in a forest where the kestrel screamed beside a lake of water clear as glass the timeworn windows of a stone house gleamed       named only alas  yet happy as the wild birds in the glades of that green forest thridding the still air with low continued heedless serenades       its heedless people were  the throbbing chords of violin and lute the lustre of lean tapers in dark eyes fair colours beauteous flowers dainty fruit       made earth seem paradise  to them that dwelt within this lonely house like children of the gods in lasting peace they ate sang danced as if each days carouse       need never pause nor cease  some might cry vanity to a weeping lyre some in that deep pool mock their longings vain came yet at last long silence to the wire       and dark did dark remain  some to the hunt would wend with hound and horn and clash of silver beauty bravery pride heeding not one who on white horse upborne       with soundless hoofs did ride  dreamers there were who watched the hours away beside a fountains foam and in the sweet of phantom evening neath the nightbirds lay       did loved with lovedone meet  all all were children for the long day done they barred the heavy door gainst lightfoot fear and few words spake though one known face was gone       yet still seemed hovering near  they heaped the bright fire higher poured dark wine and in long revelry dazed the questioning eye curtained threefold the heartdismaying shine       of midnight streaming by  they shut the dark out from the painted wall with candles dared the shadow at the door sang down the faint reiterated call       of those who came no more  yet clear above that portal plain was writ confronting each at length alone to pass out of its beauty into night starlit       that worn alas     the listeners   is there anybody there said the traveller   knocking on the moonlit door and his horse in the silence champed the grasses   of the forests ferny floor and a bird flew up out of the turret   above the travellers head and he smote upon the door again a second time   is there anybody there he said but no one descended to the traveller   no head from the leaffringed sill leaned over and looked into his grey eyes   where he stood perplexed and still but only a host of phantom listeners   that dwelt in the lone house then stood listening in the quiet of the moonlight   to that voice from the world of men stood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair   that goes down to the empty hall hearkening in an air stirred and shaken   by the lonely travellers call and he felt in his heart their strangeness   their stillness answering his cry while his horse moved cropping the dark turf   neath the starred and leafy sky for he suddenly smote on the door even   louder and lifted his head tell them i came and no one answered   that i kept my word he said never the least stir made the listeners   though every word he spake fell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house   from the one man left awake ay they heard his foot upon the stirrup   and the sound of iron on stone and how the silence surged softly backward   when the plunging hoofs were gone     time passes       there was nought in the valley     but a tower of ivory its base enwreathed with red     flowers that at evening     caught the suns crimson as to ocean low he sped      lucent and lovely     it stood in the morning under a trackless hill     with snows eternal     muffling its summit and silence ineffable      sighing of solitude     winds from the cold heights haunted its yellowing stone     at noon its shadow     stretched athwart cedars whence every bird was flown      its stair was broken     its starlit walls were fretted its flowers shone     wide at the portal     fullblown and fading their last faint fragrance gone      and on high in its lantern     a shape of the living watched oer a shoreless sea     from a tower rotting     with age and weakness once lovely as ivory     beware   an ominous bird sang from its branch   beware o wanderer night mid her flowers of glamourie spilled   draws swiftly near  night with her darkened caravans   piled deep with silver and myrrh draws from the portals of the east   o wanderer near  night who walks plumèd through the fields   of stars that strangely stir smitten to fire by the sandals of him   who walks with her     the journey   heartsick of his journey was the wanderer   footsore and sad was he and a witch who long had lurked by the wayside   looked out of sorcery  lift up your eyes you lonely wanderer   she peeped from her casement small heres shelter and quiet to give you rest young man   and apples for thirst withal  and he looked up out of his sad reverie   and saw all the woods in green with birds that flitted feathered in the dappling   the jewelbright leaves between  and he lifted up his face towards her lattice   and there alluringwise slanting through the silence of the long past   dwelt the still green witchs eyes  and vaguely from the hidingplace of memory   voices seemed to cry what is the darkness of one brief lifetime   to the deaths thou hast made us die  heed not the words of the enchantress   who would us still betray and sad with the echo of their reproaches   doubting he turned away  i may not shelter neath your roof lady   nor in this woods green shadow seek repose nor will your apples quench the thirst   a homesick wanderer knows  homesick forsooth she softly mocked him   and the beauty in her face made in the sunshine pale and trembling   a stillness in that place  and he sighed as if in fear the young wanderer   looking to left and to right where the endless narrow road swept onward   in the distance lost to sight  and there fell upon his sense the briar   haunting the air with its breath and the faint shrill sweetness of the birds throats   their tent of leaves beneath  and there was the witch in no wise heeding   her arbour and fruitfilled dish her pitcher of wellwater and clear damask   all that the weary wish  and the last gold beam across the green world   faltered and failed as he remembered his solitude and the dark nights   inhospitality  his shoulders were bowed with his knapsack   his staff trailed heavy in the dust his eyes were dazed and hopeless of the white road   which tread all pilgrims must  and he looked upon the witch with eyes of sorrow   in the darkening of the day and turned him aside into oblivion   and the voices died away  and the witch stepped down from her casement   in the hush of night he heard the calling and wailing in dewy thicket   of bird to hidden bird  and gloom stole all her burning crimson   remote and faint in space as stars in gathering shadow of the evening   seemed now her phantom face  and one nights rest shall be a myriad   midst dreams that come and go till heedless fate unmoved by weakness bring him   this same strange byway through  to the beauty of earth that fades in ashes   the lips of welcome and the eyes more beauteous than the feeble shine of hesper   lone in the lightening skies  till once again the witchs guile entreat him   but worn with wisdom he steadfast and cold shall choose the dark nights   inhospitality     haunted   the rabbit in his burrow keeps no guarded watch in peace he sleeps the wolf that howls into the night cowers to her lair at morning light the simplest bird entwines a nest where she may lean her lovely breast couched in the silence of the bough but thou o man what rest hast thou  the deepest solitude can bring only a subtler questioning in thy divided heart thy bed recalls at dawn what midnight said seek how thou wilt to feign content thy flaming ardours quickly spent soon thy last company is gone and leaves theewith thyselfalone  pomp and great friends may hem thee round a thousand busy tasks be found earths thronging beauties may beguile thy longing lovesick heart awhile and pride like clouds of sunset spread a changing glory round thy head but fade will all and thou must come hating thy journey homeless home  rave how thou wilt unmoved remote that inward presence slumbers not frets out each secret from thy breast gives thee no rally pause nor rest scans close thy very thoughts lest they should sap his patient power away answers thy wrath with peace thy cry with tenderest taciturnity     silence   with changeful sound life beats upon the ear   yet striving for release   the most delighting strings     sweet jargonings     the happiest throats   most easeful lovely notes fall back into a veiling silentness  even mid the rumour of a moving host   blackening the clear green earth   vainly gainst that thin wall     the trumpets call     or with loud hum   the smokebemuffled drum from that high quietness no reply comes forth  when all at peace two friends at ease alone   talk out their heartsyet still   between the gracenotes of     the voice of love     from each to each   trembles a rarer speech and with its presence every pause doth fill  unmoved it broods this allencompassing hush   of one who stooping near   no smallest stir will make     our fear to wake     but yet intent   upon some mystery bent hearkens the lightest word we say or hear     winter dusk   dark frost was in the air without the dusk was still with cold and gloom when less than even a shadow came   and stood within the room  but of the three around the fire none turned a questioning head to look still read a clear voice on and on   still stooped they oer their book  the children watched their mothers eyes moving on softly line to line it seemed to listen toothat shade   yet made no outward sign  the fireflames crooned a tiny song no cold wind moved the wintry tree the children both in faërie dreamed   beside their mothers knee  and nearer yet that spirit drew above that heedless one intent only on what the simple words   of her small story meant  no voiceless sorrow grieved her mind no memory her bosom stirred nor dreamed she as she read to two   twas surely three who heard  yet when the story done she smiled from face to face serene and clear a love half dread sprang up as she   leaned close and drew them near     ages ago   launcelot loved guinevere   ages and ages ago beautiful as a bird was she preening its wings in a cypress tree happy in sadness she and he   they loved each other so  helen of troy was beautiful   as tender flower in may her

the dark sky like buds on thorny branches lie so seemed she too to antony   that agegone prince of men  the pyramids are old stones   scarred is that grey face that by the greenness of old nile gazes
