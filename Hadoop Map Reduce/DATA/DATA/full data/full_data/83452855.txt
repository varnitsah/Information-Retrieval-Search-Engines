83452855	the lady of the barge  and other stories  by w w jacobs     captain rogers   a man came slowly over the old stone bridge and averting his gaze from the dark river with its silent craft looked with some satisfaction toward the feeble lights of the small town on the other side  he walked with the painful forced step of one who has already trudged far  his worsted hose where they were not darned were in holes and his coat and kneebreeches were rusty with much wear but he straightened himself as he reached the end of the bridge and stepped out bravely to the taverns which stood in a row facing the quay  he passed the queen annea mere beershopwithout pausing and after a glance apiece at the royal george and the trusty anchor kept on his way to where the golden key hung out a gilded emblem  it was the best house in riverstone and patronized by the gentry but he adjusted his faded coat and with a swaggering air entered and walked boldly into the coffeeroom  the room was empty but a bright fire afforded a pleasant change to the chill october air outside  he drew up a chair and placing his feet on the fender exposed his tattered soles to the blaze as a waiter who had just seen him enter the room came and stood aggressively inside the door  brandy and water said the stranger hot  the coffeeroom is for gentlemen staying in the house said the waiter  the stranger took his feet from the fender and rising slowly walked toward him  he was a short man and thin but there was something so menacing in his attitude and something so fearsome in his stony brown eyes that the other despite his disgust for illdressed people moved back uneasily  brandy and water hot repeated the stranger and plenty of it  dye hear  the man turned slowly to depart  stop said the other imperiously  whats the name of the landlord here  mullet said the fellow sulkily  send him to me said the other resuming his seat and hark you my friend more civility or twill be the worse for you  he stirred the log on the fire with his foot until a shower of sparks whirled up the chimney  the door opened and the landlord with the waiter behind him entered the room but he still gazed placidly at the glowing embers  what do you want  demanded the landlord in a deep voice  the stranger turned a little weazened yellow face and grinned at him familiarly  send that fat rascal of yours away he said slowly  the landlord started at his voice and eyed him closely then he signed to the man to withdraw and closing the door behind him stood silently watching his visitor  you didnt expect to see me rogers said the latter  my names mullet said the other sternly  what do you want  oh mullet said the other in surprise  im afraid ive made a mistake then  i thought you were my old shipmate captain rogers  its a foolish mistake of mine as ive no doubt rogers was hanged years ago you never had a brother named rogers did you  i say again what do you want  demanded the other advancing upon him  since youre so good said the other  i want new clothes food and lodging of the best and my pockets filled with money  you had better go and look for all those things then said mullet you wont find them here  ay  said the other rising  well wellthere was a hundred guineas on the head of my old shipmate rogers some fifteen years ago  ill see whether it has been earned yet  if i gave you a hundred guineas said the innkeeper repressing his passion by a mighty effort you would not be satisfied  reads like a book said the stranger in tones of pretended delight what a man it is  he fell back as he spoke and thrusting his hand into his pocket drew forth a long pistol as the innkeeper a man of huge frame edged toward him  keep your distance he said in a sharp quick voice  the innkeeper in no wise disturbed at the pistol turned away calmly and ringing the bell ordered some spirits  then taking a chair he motioned to the other to do the same and they sat in silence until the staring waiter had left the room again  the stranger raised his glass  my old friend captain rogers he said solemnly and may he never get his deserts  from what jail have you come  inquired mullet sternly  pon my soul said the other i have been in so manylooking for captain rogersthat i almost forget the last but i have just tramped from london two hundred and eighty odd miles for the pleasure of seeing your damned ugly figurehead again and now ive found it im going to stay  give me some money  the innkeeper without a word drew a little gold and silver from his pocket and placing it on the table pushed it toward him  enough to go on with said the other pocketing it in future it is halves  dye hear me  halves  and ill stay here and see i get it  he sat back in his chair and meeting the others hatred with a gaze as steady as his own replaced his pistol  a nice snug harbor after our many voyages he continued  shipmates we were shipmates well be while nick gunn is alive you shall never want for company  lord  do you remember the dutch brig and the fat frightened mate  i have forgotten it said the other still eyeing him steadfastly i have forgotten many things  for fifteen years i have lived a decent honest life  pray god for your own sinful soul that the devil in me does not wake again  fifteen years is a long nap said gunn carelessly what a godsend it ll be for you to have me by you to remind you of old times  why youre looking smug man the honest innkeeper to the life  gad whos the girl  illustration gunn placed a hand which lacked two fingers on his breast and bowed again  he rose and made a clumsy bow as a girl of eighteen after a moments hesitation at the door crossed over to the innkeeper  im busy my dear said the latter somewhat sternly  our business said gunn with another bow is finished  is this your daughter rog mullet  my stepdaughter was the reply  gunn placed a hand which lacked two fingers on his breast and bowed again  one of your fathers oldest friends he said smoothly and fallen on evil days im sure your gentle heart will be pleased to hear that your good father has requested mefor a timeto make his house my home  any friend of my fathers is welcome to me sir said the girl coldly she looked from the innkeeper to his oddlooking guest and conscious of something strained in the air gave him a little bow and quitted the room  you insist upon staying then  said mullet after a pause  more than ever replied gunn with a leer toward the door  why you dont think im afraid captain  you should know me better than that  life is sweet said the other  ay assented gunn so sweet that you will share things with me to keep it  no said the other with great calm  i am man enough to have a better reason  no psalm singing said gunn coarsely  and look cheerful you old buccaneer  look as a man should look who has just met an old friend never to lose him again  he eyed his man expectantly and put his hand to his pocket again but the innkeepers face was troubled and he gazed stolidly at the fire  see what fifteen years honest decent life does for us grinned the intruder  the other made no reply but rising slowly walked to the door without a word  landlord cried gunn bringing his maimed hand sharply down on the table  the innkeeper turned and regarded him  send me in some supper said gunn the best you have and plenty of it and have a room prepared  the best  the door closed silently and was opened a little later by the dubious george coming in to set a bountiful repast  gunn after cursing him for his slowness and awkwardness drew his chair to the table and made the meal of one seldom able to satisfy his hunger  he finished at last and after sitting for some time smoking with his legs sprawled on the fender rang for a candle and demanded to be shown to his room  his proceedings when he entered it were but a poor compliment to his host  not until he had poked and pried into every corner did he close the door  then not content with locking it he tilted a chair beneath the handle and placing his pistol beneath his pillow fell fast asleep  despite his fatigue he was early astir next morning  breakfast was laid for him in the coffeeroom and his brow darkened  he walked into the hall and after trying various doors entered a small sittingroom where his host and daughter sat at breakfast and with an easy assurance drew a chair to the table  the innkeeper helped him without a word but the girls hand shook under his gaze as she passed him some coffee  as soft a bed as ever i slept in he remarked  i hope that you slept well said the girl civilly  like a child said gunn gravely an easy conscience  eh mullet  the innkeeper nodded and went on eating  the other after another remark or two followed his example glancing occasionally with warm approval at the beauty of the girl who sat at the head of the table  a sweet girl he remarked as she withdrew at the end of the meal and no mother i presume  no mother repeated the other  gunn sighed and shook his head  a sad case truly he murmured  no mother and such a guardian  poor soul if she but knew  well we must find her a husband  he looked down as he spoke and catching sight of his rusty clothes and broken shoes clapped his hand to his pocket and with a glance at his host sallied out to renew his wardrobe  the innkeeper with an inscrutable face watched him down the quay then with bent head he returned to the house and fell to work on his accounts  in this work gunn returning an hour later clad from head to foot in new apparel offered to assist him  mullett hesitated but made no demur neither did he join in the ecstasies which his new partner displayed at the sight of the profits  gunn put some more gold into his new pockets and throwing himself back in a chair called loudly to george to bring him some drink  in less than a month the intruder was the virtual master of the golden key  resistance on the part of the legitimate owner became more and more feeble the slightest objection on his part drawing from the truculent gunn dark allusions to his past and threats against his future which for the sake of his daughter he could not ignore  his health began to fail and joan watched with perplexed terror the growth of a situation which was in a fair way of becoming unbearable  the arrogance of gunn knew no bounds  the maids learned to tremble at his polite grin or his worse freedom and the men shrank appalled from his profane wrath  george after ten years service was brutally dismissed and refusing to accept dismissal from his hands appealed to his master  the innkeeper confirmed it and with lacklustre eyes fenced feebly when his daughter regardless of gunns presence indignantly appealed to him  the man was rude to my friend my dear he said dispiritedly  if he was rude it was because mr gunn deserved it said joan hotly  gunn laughed uproariously  gad my dear i like you  he cried slapping his leg  youre a girl of spirit  now i will make you a fair offer  if you ask for george to stay stay he shall as a favour to your sweet self  the girl trembled  who is master here  she demanded turning a full eye on her father  mullet laughed uneasily  this is business he said trying to speak lightly and women cant understand it  gunn isis valuable to me and george must go  unless you plead for him sweet one  said gunn  the girl looked at her father again but he turned his head away and tapped on the floor with his foot  then in perplexity akin to tears she walked from the room carefully drawing her dress aside as gunn held the door for her  a fine girl said gunn his thin lips working a fine spirit  twill be pleasant to break it but she does not know who is master here  she is young yet said the other hurriedly  i will soon age her if she looks like that at me again said gunn  by  ill turn out the whole crew into the street and her with them an i wish it  ill lie in my bed warm o nights and think of her huddled on a doorstep  his voice rose and his fists clenched but he kept his distance and watched the other warily  the innkeepers face was contorted and his brow grew wet  for one moment something peeped out of his eyes the next he sat down in his chair again and nervously fingered his chin  i have but to speak said gunn regarding him with much satisfaction and you will hang and your money go to the crown  what will become of her then think you  the other laughed nervously  twould be stopping the golden eggs he ventured  dont think too much of that said gunn in a hard voice  i was never one to be baulked as you know  come come  let us be friends said mullet the girl is young and has had her way  he looked almost pleadingly at the other and his voice trembled  gunn drew himself up and regarding him with a satisfied sneer quitted the room without a word  affairs at the golden key grew steadily worse and worse  gunn dominated the place and his vile personality hung over it like a shadow appeals to the innkeeper were in vain his health was breaking fast and he moodily declined to interfere  gunn appointed servants of his own choosingbrazen maids and foulmouthed men  the old patrons ceased to frequent the golden key and its bedrooms stood empty  the maids scarcely deigned to take an order from joan and the men spoke to her familiarly  in the midst of all this the innkeeper who had complained once or twice of vertigo was seized with a fit  joan flying to him for protection against the brutal advances of gunn found him lying in a heap behind the door of his small office and in her fear called loudly for assistance  a little knot of servants collected and stood regarding him stupidly  one made a brutal jest  gunn pressing through the throng turned the senseless body over with his foot and cursing vilely ordered them to carry it upstairs  until the surgeon came joan kneeling by the bed held on to the senseless hand as her only protection against the evil faces of gunn and his proteges  gunn himself was taken aback the innkeepers death at that time by no means suiting his aims  the surgeon was a man of few words and fewer attainments but under his ministrations the innkeeper after a long interval rallied  the half closed eyes opened and he looked in a dazed fashion at his surroundings gunn drove the servants away and questioned the man of medicine  the answers were vague and interspersed with latin  freedom from noise and troubles of all kinds was insisted upon and joan was installed as nurse with a promise of speedy assistance  the assistance arrived late in the day in the shape of an elderly woman whose spartan treatment of her patients had helped many along the silent road  she commenced her reign by punching the sick mans pillows and having shaken him into consciousness by this means gave him a dose of physic after first tasting it herself from the bottle  after the first rally the innkeeper began to fail slowly  it was seldom that he understood what was said to him and pitiful to the beholder to see in his intervals of consciousness his timid anxiety to earn the good will of the allpowerful gunn  his strength declined until assistance was needed to turn him in the bed and his great sinewy hands were forever trembling and fidgeting on the coverlet  joan pale with grief and fear tended him assiduously  her stepfathers strength had been a proverb in the town and many a hasty citizen had felt the strength of his arm  the increasing lawlessness of the house filled her with dismay and the coarse attentions of gunn became more persistent than ever  she took her meals in the sickroom and divided her time between that and her own  gunn himself was in a dilemma  with mullet dead his power was at an end and his visions of wealth dissipated  he resolved to feather his nest immediately and interviewed the surgeon  the surgeon was ominously reticent the nurse cheerfully ghoulish  four days i give him she said calmly four blessed days not but what he might slip away at any moment  gunn let one day of the four pass and then choosing a time when joan was from the room entered it for a little quiet conversation  the innkeepers eyes were open and what was more to the purpose intelligent  youre cheating the hangman after all snarled gunn  im off to swear an information  the other by a great effort turned his heavy head and fixed his wistful eyes on him  mercy  he whispered  for her sakegive mea little time  to slip your cable i suppose quoth gunn  wheres your money wheres your hoard you miser  mullet closed his eyes  he opened them again slowly and strove to think while gunn watched him narrowly  when he spoke his utterance was thick and labored  come tonight he muttered slowly  give metimei will make your your fortune  but the nursewatches  ill see to her said gunn with a grin  but tell me now lest you die first  you willlet joanhave a share  panted the innkeeper  yes yes said gunn hastily  the innkeeper strove to raise himself in the bed and then fell back again exhausted as joans step was heard on the stairs  gunn gave a savage glance of warning at him and barring the progress of the girl at the door attempted to salute her  joan came in pale and trembling and falling on her knees by the bedside took her fathers hand in hers and wept over it  the innkeeper gave a faint groan and a shiver ran through his body  it was nearly an hour after midnight that nick gunn kicking off his shoes went stealthily out onto the landing  a little light came from the partly open door of the sickroom but all else was in blackness  he moved along and peered in  the nurse was siting in a highbacked oak chair by the fire  she had slipped down in the seat and her untidy head hung on her bosom  a glass stood on the small oak table by her side and a solitary candle on the high mantelpiece diffused a sickly light  gunn entered the room and finding that the sick man was dozing shook him roughly  the innkeeper opened his eyes and gazed at him blankly  wake you fool said gunn shaking him again  the other roused and muttered something incoherently  then he stirred slightly  the nurse he whispered  shes safe enow said gunn  ive seen to that  he crossed the room lightly and standing before the unconscious woman inspected her closely and raised her in the chair  her head fell limply over the arm  dead inquired mullet in a fearful whisper  drugged said gunn shortly  now speak up and be lively  the innkeepers eyes again travelled in the direction of the nurse  the men he whispered the servants  dead drunk and asleep said gunn biting the words  the last day would hardly rouse them  now will you speak damn you  i musttake careof joan said the father  gunn shook his clenched hand at him  my moneyisis said the other  promise me onyour oathjoan  ay ay growled gunn how many more times  ill marry her and she shall have what i choose to give her  speak up you fool  its not for you to make terms  where is it  he bent over but mullet exhausted with his efforts had closed his eyes again and half turned his head  where is it damn you  said gunn from between his teeth  mullet opened his eyes again glanced fearfully round the room and whispered  gunn with a stifled oath bent his ear almost to his mouth and the next moment his neck was in the grip of the strongest man in riverstone and an arm like a bar of iron over his back pinned him down across the bed  you dog  hissed a fierce voice in his ear  ive got youcaptain rogers at your service and now you may tell his name to all you can shout it you spawn of hell  shout it  he rose in bed and with a sudden movement flung the other over on his back  gunns eyes were starting from his head and he writhed convulsively  i thought you were a sharper man gunn said rogers still in the same hot whisper as he relaxed his grip a little you are too simple you hound  when you first threatened me i resolved to kill you  then you threatened my daughter  i wish that you had nine lives that i might take them all  keep still  he gave a halfglance over his shoulder at the silent figure of the nurse and put his weight on the twisting figure on the bed  you drugged the hag good gunn he continued  tomorrow morning gunn they will find you in your room dead and if one of the scum you brought into my house be charged with the murder so much the better when i am well they will go  i am already feeling a little bit stronger gunn as you see and in a month i hope to be about again  he averted his face and for a time gazed sternly and watchfully at the door  then he rose slowly to his feet and taking the dead man in his arms bore him slowly and carefully to his room and laid him a huddled heap on the floor  swiftly and noiselessly he put the dead mans shoes on and turned his pockets inside out kicked a rug out of place and put a guinea on the floor  then he stole cautiously down stairs and set a small door at the back open  a dog barked frantically and he hurried back to his room  the nurse still slumbered by the fire  she awoke in the morning shivering with the cold and being jealous of her reputation rekindled the fire and measuring out the dose which the invalid should have taken threw it away  on these unconscious preparations for an alibi captain rogers gazed through halfclosed lids and then turning his grim face to the wall waited for the inevitable alarm
