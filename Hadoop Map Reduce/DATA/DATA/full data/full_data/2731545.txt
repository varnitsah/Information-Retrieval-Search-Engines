sal      the great shadow    chapter i   the night of the beacons  it is strange to me jock calder of west inch to feel that though now in the very centre of the nineteenth century i am but fiveandfifty years of age and though it is only once in a week perhaps that my wife can pluck out a little grey bristle from over my ear yet i have lived in a time when the thoughts and the ways of men were as different as though it were another planet from this  for when i walk in my fields i can see down berwick way the little fluffs of white smoke which tell me of this strange new hundredlegged beast with coals for food and a thousand men in its belly for ever crawling over the border on a shiny day i can see the glint of the brass work as it takes the curve near corriemuir and then as i look out to sea there is the same beast again or a dozen of them maybe leaving a trail of black in the air and of white in the water and swimming in the face of the wind as easily as a salmon up the tweed  such a sight as that would have struck my good old father speechless with wrath as well as surprise for he was so stricken with the fear of offending the creator that he was chary of contradicting nature and always held the new thing to be nearly akin to the blasphemous  as long as god made the horse and a man down birmingham way the engine my good old dad would have stuck by the saddle and the spurs  but he would have been still more surprised had he seen the peace and kindliness which reigns now in the hearts of men and the talk in the papers and at the meetings that there is to be no more warsave of course with blacks and such like  for when he died we had been fighting with scarce a break save only during two short years for very nearly a quarter of a century  think of it you who live so quietly and peacefully now  babies who were born in the war grew to be bearded men with babies of their own and still the war continued  those who had served and fought in their stalwart prime grew stiff and bent and yet the ships and the armies were struggling  it was no wonder that folk came at last to look upon it as the natural state and thought how queer it must seem to be at peace  during that long time we fought the dutch we fought the danes we fought the spanish we fought the turks we fought the americans we fought the montevideans until it seemed that in this universal struggle no race was too near of kin or too far away to be drawn into the quarrel  but most of all it was the french whom we fought and the man whom of all others we loathed and feared and admired was the great captain who ruled them  it was very well to draw pictures of him and sing songs about him and make as though he were an impostor but i can tell you that the fear of that man hung like a black shadow over all europe and that there was a time when the glint of a fire at night upon the coast would set every woman upon her knees and every man gripping for his musket  he had always won that was the terror of it  the fates seemed to be behind him  and now we knew that he lay upon the northern coast with a hundred and fifty thousand veterans and the boats for their passage  but it is an old story how a third of the grown folk of our country took up arms and how our little oneeyed onearmed man crushed their fleet there was still to be a land of free thinking and free speaking in europe  there was a great beacon ready on the hill by tweedmouth built up of logs and tarbarrels and i can well remember how night after night i strained my eyes to see if it were ablaze  i was only eight at the time but it is an age when one takes a grief to heart and i felt as though the fate of the country hung in some fashion upon me and my vigilance  and then one night as i looked i suddenly saw a little flicker on the beacon hilla single red tongue of flame in the darkness  i remember how i rubbed my eyes and pinched myself and rapped my knuckles against the stone windowsill to make sure that i was indeed awake  and then the flame shot higher and i saw the red quivering line upon the water between and i dashed into the kitchen screeching to my father that the french had crossed and the tweedmouth light was aflame  he had been talking to mr mitchell the law student from edinburgh and i can see him now as he knocked his pipe out at the side of the fire and looked at me from over the top of his horn spectacles  are you sure jock says he  sure as death i gasped  he reached out his hand for the bible upon the table and opened it upon his knee as though he meant to read to us but he shut it again in silence and hurried out  we went too the law student and i and followed him down to the gate which opens out upon the highway  from there we could see the red light of the big beacon and the glimmer of a smaller one to the north of us at ayton  my mother came down with two plaids to keep the chill from us and we all stood there until morning speaking little to each other and that little in a whisper  the road had more folk on it than ever passed along it at night before for many of the yeomen up our way had enrolled themselves in the berwick volunteer regiments and were riding now as fast as hoof could carry them for the muster  some had a stirrup cup or two before parting and i cannot forget one who tore past on a huge white horse brandishing a great rusty sword in the moonlight  they shouted to us as they passed that the north berwick law fire was blazing and that it was thought that the alarm had come from edinburgh castle  there were a few who galloped the other way couriers for edinburgh and the lairds son and master clayton the deputy sheriff and such like  and among others there was one a fine built heavy man on a roan horse who pulled up at our gate and asked some question about the road  he took off his hat to ease himself and i saw that he had a kindly longdrawn face and a great high brow that shot away up into tufts of sandy hair  i doubt its a false alarm said he  maybe id ha done well to bide where i was but now ive come so far ill break my fast with the regiment  he clapped spurs to his horse and away he went down the brae  i ken him weel said our student nodding after him  hes a lawyer in edinburgh and a braw hand at the stringin of verses  wattie scott is his name  none of us had heard of it then but it was not long before it was the best known name in scotland and many a time we thought of how he speered his way of us on the night of the terror  but early in the morning we had our minds set at ease  it was grey and cold and my mother had gone up to the house to make a pot of tea for us when there came a gig down the road with dr horscroft of ayton in it and his son jim  the collar of the doctors brown coat came over his ears and he looked in a deadly black humour for jim who was but fifteen years of age had trooped off to berwick at the first alarm with his fathers new fowling piece  all night his dad had chased him and now there he was a prisoner with the barrel of the stolen gun sticking out from behind the seat  he looked as sulky as his father with his hands thrust into his sidepockets his brows drawn down and his lower lip thrusting out  its all a lie shouted the doctor as he passed  there has been no landing and all the fools in scotland have been gadding about the roads for nothing  his son jim snarled something up at him on this and his father struck him a blow with his clenched fist on the side of his head which sent the boys chin forward upon his breast as though he had been stunned my father shook his head for he had a liking for jim but we all walked up to the house again nodding and blinking and hardly able to keep our eyes open now that we knew that all was safe but with a thrill of joy at our hearts such as i have only matched once or twice in my lifetime  now all this has little enough to do with what i took my pen up to tell about but when a man has a good memory and little skill he cannot draw one thought from his mind without a dozen others trailing out behind it and yet now that i come to think of it this had something to do with it after all for jim horscroft had so deadly a quarrel with his father that he was packed off to the berwick academy and as my father had long wished me to go there he took advantage of this chance to send me also  but before i say a word about this school i shall go back to where i should have begun and give you a hint as to who i am for it may be that these words of mine may be read by some folk beyond the border country who never heard of the calders of  west inch  it has a brave sound west inch but it is not a fine estate with a braw house upon it but only a great hardbitten windswept sheep run fringing off into links along the seashore where a frugal man might with hard work just pay his rent and have butter instead of treacle on sundays  in the centre there is a greystoned slateroofed house with a byre behind it and 1703 scrawled in stonework over the lintel of the door  there for more than a hundred years our folk have lived until for all their poverty they came to take a good place among the people for in the country parts the old yeoman is often better thought of than the new laird  there was one queer thing about the house of west inch  it has been reckoned by engineers and other knowing folk that the boundary line between the two countries ran right through the middle of it splitting our secondbest bedroom into an english half and a scotch half  now the cot in which i always slept was so placed that my head was to the north of the line and my feet to the south of it  my friends say that if i had chanced to lie the other way my hair might not have been so sandy nor my mind of so solemn a cast  this i know that more than once in my life when my scotch head could see no way out of a danger my good thick english legs have come to my help and carried me clear away but at school i never heard the end of this for they would call me halfandhalf and the great britain and sometimes union jack when there was a battle between the scotch and english boys one side would kick my shins and the other cuff my ears and then they would both stop and laugh as though it were something funny  at first i was very miserable at the berwick academy  birtwhistle was the first master and adams the second and i had no love for either of them  i was shy and backward by nature and slow at making a friend either among masters or boys  it was nine miles as the crow flies and eleven and a half by road from berwick to west inch and my heart grew heavy at the weary distance that separated me from my mother for mark you a lad of that age pretends that he has no need of his mothers caresses but ah how sad he is when he is taken at his word  at last i could stand it no longer and i determined to run away from the school and make my way home as fast as i might  at the very last moment however i had the good fortune to win the praise and admiration of every one from the headmaster downwards and to find my school life made very pleasant and easy to me  and all this came of my falling by accident out of a secondfloor window  this was how it happened  one evening i had been kicked by ned barton who was the bully of the school and this injury coming on the top of all my other grievances caused my little cup to overflow  i vowed that night as i buried my tearstained face beneath the blankets that the next morning would either find me at west inch or well on the way to it our dormitory was on the second floor but i was a famous climber and had a fine head for heights i used to think little young as i was of swinging myself with a rope round my thigh off the west inch gable and that stood threeandfifty feet above the ground  there was not much fear then but that i could make my way out of birtwhistles dormitory i waited a weary while until the coughing and tossing had died away and there was no sound of wakefulness from the long line of wooden cots then i very softly rose slipped on my clothes took my shoes in my hand and walked tiptoe to the window  i opened the casement and looked out  underneath me lay the garden and close by my hand was the stout branch of a pear tree an active lad could ask no better ladder once in the garden i had but a fivefoot wall to get over and then there was nothing but distance between me and home  i took a firm grip of a branch with one hand placed my knee upon another one and was about to swing myself out of the window when in a moment i was as silent and as still as though i had been turned to stone  there was a face looking at me from over the coping of the wall  a chill of fear struck to my heart at its whiteness and its stillness the moon shimmered upon it and the eyeballs moved slowly from side to side though i was hid from them behind the screen of the pear tree then in a jerky fashion this white face ascended until the neck shoulders waist and knees of a man became visible  he sat himself down on the top of the wall and with a great heave he pulled up after him a boy about my own size who caught his breath from time to time as though to choke down a sob  the man gave him a shake with a few rough whispered words and then the two dropped together down into the garden i was still standing balanced with one foot upon the bough and one upon the casement not daring to budge for fear of attracting their attention for i could hear them moving stealthily about in the long shadow of the house  suddenly from immediately beneath my feet i heard a low grating noise and the sharp tinkle of falling glass  thats done it said the mans eager whisper  there is room for you  but the edge is all jagged cried the other in a weak quaver  the fellow burst out into an oath that made my skin pringle  in with you you cub he snarled or  i could not see what he did but there was a short quick gasp of pain  ill go  ill go cried the little lad  but i heard no more for my head suddenly swam my heel shot off the branch i gave a dreadful yell and came down with my ninetyfive pounds of weight right upon the bent back of the burglar  if you ask me i can only say that to this day i am not quite certain whether it was an accident or whether i designed it  it may be that while i was thinking of doing it chance settled the matter for me  the fellow was stooping with his head forward thrusting the boy through a tiny window when i came down upon him just where the neck joins the spine  he gave a kind of whistling cry dropped upon his face and rolled three times over drumming on the grass with his heels  his little companion flashed off in the moonlight and was over the wall in a trice  as for me i sat yelling at the pitch of my lungs and nursing one of my legs which felt as if a redhot ring were welded round it  it was not long as may be imagined before the whole household from the headmaster to the stable boy were out in the garden with lamps and lanterns  the matter was soon cleared the man carried off upon a shutter and i borne in much state and solemnity to a special bedroom where the small bone of my leg was set by surgeon purdie the younger of the two brothers of that name  as to the robber it was found that his legs were palsied and the doctors were of two minds as to whether he would recover the use of them or no but the law never gave them a chance of settling the matter for he was hanged after carlisle assizes some six weeks later  it was proved that he was the most desperate rogue in the north of england for he had done three murders at the least and there were charges enough against him upon the sheet to have hanged him ten times over  well now i could not pass over my boyhood without telling you about this which was the most important thing that happened to me  but i will go off upon no more side tracks for when i think of all that is coming i can see very well that i shall have more than enough to do before i have finished  for when a man has only his own little private tale to tell it often takes him all his time but when he gets mixed up in such great matters as i shall have to speak about then it is hard on him if he has not been brought up to it to get it all set down to his liking  but my memory is as good as ever thank god and i shall try to get it all straight before i finish  it was this business of the burglar that first made a friendship between jim horscroft the doctors son and me  he was cock boy of the school from the day he came for within the hour he had thrown barton who had been cock before him right through the big blackboard in the classroom  jim always ran to muscle and bone and even then he was square and tall short of speech and long in the arm much given to lounging with his broad back against walls and his hands deep in his breeches pockets  i can even recall that he had a trick of keeping a straw in the corner of his mouth just where he used afterwards to hold his pipe  jim was always the same for good and for bad since first i knew him  heavens how we all looked up to him  we were but young savages and had a savages respect for power  there was tom carndale of appleby who could write alcaics as well as mere pentameters and hexameters yet nobody would give a snap for tom and there was willie earnshaw who had every date from the killing of abel on the tip of his tongue so that the masters themselves would turn to him if they were in doubt yet he was but a narrowchested lad over long for his breadth and what did his dates help him when jack simons of the lower third chivied him down the passage with the buckle end of a strap  but you didnt do things like that with jim horscroft  what tales we used to whisper about his strength  how he put his fist through the oakpanel of the gameroom door how when long merridew was carrying the ball he caught up merridew ball and all and ran swiftly past every opponent to the goal  it did not seem fit to us that such a one as he should trouble his head about spondees and dactyls or care to know who signed the magna charta  when he said in open class that king alfred was the man we little boys all felt that very likely it was so and that perhaps jim knew more about it than the man who wrote the book  well it was this business of the burglar that drew his attention to me for he patted me on my head and said that i was a spunky little devil which blew me out with pride for a week on end  for two years we were close  friends for all the gap that the years had made between us and though in passion or in want of thought he did many a thing that galled me yet i loved him like a brother and wept as much as would have filled an ink bottle when at last he went off to edinburgh to study his fathers profession  five years after that did i tide at birtwhistles and when i left had become cock myself for i was wiry and as tough as whalebone though i never ran to weight and sinew like my great predecessor  it was in jubilee year that i left birtwhistles and then for three years i stayed at home learning the ways of the cattle but still the ships and the armies were wrestling and still the great shadow of bonaparte lay across the country  how could i guess that i too should have a hand in lifting that shadow for ever from our people   chapter ii   cousin edie of eyemouth  some years before when i was still but a lad there had come over to us upon a five weeks visit the only daughter of my fathers brother willie calder had settled at eyemouth as a maker of fishing nets and he had made more out of twine than ever we were like to do out of the whinbushes and sandlinks of west inch  so his daughter edie calder came over with a braw red frock and a five shilling bonnet and a kist full of things that brought my dear mothers eyes out like a partans it was wonderful to see her so free with money and she but a slip of a girl paying the carrier man all that he asked and a whole twopence over to which he had no claim  she made no more of drinking gingerbeer than we did of water and she would have her sugar in her tea and butter with her bread just as if she had been english  i took no great stock of girls at that time for it was hard for me to see what they had been made for  there were none of us at birtwhistles that thought very much of them but the smallest laddies seemed to have the most sense for after they began to grow bigger they were not so sure about it  we little ones were all of one mind that a creature that couldnt fight and was aye carrying tales and couldnt so much as shy a stone without flapping its arm like a rag in the wind was no use for anything  and then the airs that they would put on as if they were mother and father rolled into one for ever breaking into a game with jimmy your toes come through your boot or go home you dirty boy and clean yourself until the very sight of them was weariness  so when this one came to the steading at west inch i was not best pleased to see her  i was twelve at the time it was in the holidays and she eleven a thin tallish girl with black eyes and the queerest ways  she was for ever staring out in front of her with her lips parted as if she saw something wonderful but when i came behind her and looked the same way i could see nothing but the sheeps trough or the midden or fathers breeches hanging on a clothesline  and then if she saw a lump of heather or bracken or any common stuff of that sort she would mope over it as if it had struck her sick and cry how sweet how perfect just as though it had been a painted picture she didnt like games but i used to make her play tig and such like but it was no fun for i could always catch her in three jumps and she could never catch me though she would come with as much rustle and flutter as ten boys would make  when i used to tell her that she was good for nothing and that her father was a fool to bring her up like that she would begin to cry and say that i was a rude boy and that she would go home that very night and never forgive me as long as she lived  but in five minutes she had forgot all about it  what was strange was that she liked me a deal better than i did her and she would never leave me alone but she was always watching me and running after me and then saying oh here you are as if it were a surprise  but soon i found that there was good in her too  she used sometimes to give me pennies so that once i had four in my pocket all at the same time  but the best part of her was the stories that she could tell she was sore frightened of frogs so i would bring one to her and tell her that i would put it down her neck unless she told a story that always helped her to begin but when once she was started it was wonderful how she would carry on  and the things that had happened to her they were enough to take your breath away  there was a barbary rover that had been at eyemouth and he was coming back in five years in a ship full of gold to make her his wife  and then there was a wandering knight who had been there also and he had given her a ring which he said he would redeem when the time came  she showed me the ring which was very like the ones upon my bed curtain but she said that this one was virgin gold  i asked her what the knight would do if he met the barbary rover and she told me that he would sweep his head from his shoulders   what they could all see in her was more than i could think  and then she told me that she had been followed on her way to west inch by a disguised prince  i asked her how she knew it was a prince and she said by his disguise  another day she said that her father was preparing a riddle and that when it was ready it would be put in the papers and anyone who guessed it would have half his fortune and his daughter  i said that i was good at riddles and that she must send it to me when it was ready  she said it would be in the berwick gazette and wanted to know what i would do with her when i won her  i said i would sell her by public roup for what she would fetch but she would tell no more stories that evening for she was very techy about some things  jim horscroft was away when cousin edie was with us but he came back the very week she went and i mind how surprised i was that he should ask any questions or take any interest in a mere lassie  he asked me if she were pretty and when i said i hadnt noticed he laughed and called me a mole and said my eyes would be opened some day  but very soon he came to be interested in something else and i never gave edie another thought until one day she just took my life in her hands and twisted it as i could twist this quill  that was in 1813 after i had left school when i was already eighteen years of age with a good forty hairs on my upper lip and every hope of more  i had changed since i left school and was not so keen on games as i had been but found myself instead lying about on the sunny side of the braes with my own lips parted and my eyes staring just the same as cousin edies used to do  it had satisfied me and filled my whole life that i could run faster and jump higher than my neighbour but now all that seemed such a little thing and i yearned and yearned and looked up at the big arching sky and down at the flat blue sea and felt that there was something wanting but could never lay my tongue to what that something was  and i became quick of temper too for my nerves seemed all of a fret and when my mother would ask me what ailed me or my father would speak of my turning my hand to work i would break into such sharp bitter answers as i have often grieved over since  ah a man may have more than one wife and more than one child and more than one friend but he can never have but the one mother so let him cherish her while he may  one day when i came in from the sheep there was my father sitting with a letter in his hands which was a very rare thing with us except when the factor wrote for the rent  then as i came nearer to him i saw that he was crying and i stood staring for i had always thought that it was not a thing that a man could do  i can see him now for he had so deep a crease across his brown cheek that no tear could pass it but must trickle away sideways and so down to his ear hopping off on to the sheet of paper  my mother sat beside him and stroked his hands like she did the cats back when she would soothe it  aye jeannie said he poor willies gone  its from the lawyer and it was sudden or theyd ha sent word of it  carbuncle he says and a flush o blood to the head  ah well his troubles over said my mother  my father rubbed his ears with the tablecloth  hes left a his savings to his lassie said he and by gom if shes not changed from what she promised to be shell soon gar them flee you mind what she said of weak tea under this very roof and it at seven shillings the pound  my mother shook her head and looked up at the flitches of bacon that hung from the ceiling  he doesnt say how much but shell have enough and to spare he says and shes to come and bide with us for that was his last wish  to pay for her keep cried my mother sharply  i was sorry that she should have spoken of money at that moment but then if she had not been sharp we would all have been on the roadside in a twelvemonth  aye shell pay and shes coming this very day  jock lad ill want you to drive to ayton and meet the evening coach  your cousin edie will be in it and you can fetch her over to west inch  and so off i started at quarter past five with souter johnnie the longhaired fifteenyearold and our cart with the newpainted tailboard that we only used on great days  the coach was in just as i came and i like a foolish country lad taking no heed to the years that had passed was looking about among the folk in the inn front for a slip of a girl with her petticoats just under her knees  and as i slouched past and craned my neck there came a touch to my elbow and there was a lady dressed all in black standing by the steps and i knew that it was my  cousin edie  i knew it i say and yet had she not touched me i might have passed her a score of times and never known it  my word if jim horscroft had asked me then if she were pretty or no i should have known how to answer him  she was dark much darker than is common among our border lasses and yet with such a faint blush of pink breaking through her dainty colour like the deeper flush at the heart of a sulphur rose her lips were red and kindly and firm and even then at the first glance i saw that light of mischief and mockery that danced away at the back of her great dark eyes  she took me then and there as though i had been her heritage put out her hand and plucked me  she was as i have said in black dressed in what seemed to me to be a wondrous fashion with a black veil pushed up from her brow  ah jack said she in a mincing english fashion that she had learned at the boarding school  no no we are rather old for thatthis because i in my awkward fashion was pushing my foolish brown face forward to kiss her as i had done when i saw her last  just hurry up like a good fellow and give a shilling to the conductor who has been exceedingly civil to me during the journey  i flushed up red to the ears for i had only a silver fourpenny piece in my pocket  never had my lack of pence weighed so heavily upon me as just at that moment  but she read me at a glance and there in an instant was a little moleskin purse with a silver clasp thrust into my hand  i paid the man and would have given it back but she still would have me keep it  you shall be my factor jack said she laughing  is this our carriage  how funny it looks  and where am i to sit  on the sacking said i  and how am i to get there  put your foot on the hub said i  ill help you  i sprang up and took her two little gloved hands in my own  as she came over the side her breath blew in my face sweet and warm and all that vagueness and unrest seemed in a moment to have been shredded away from my soul  i felt as if that instant had taken me out from myself and made me one of the race  it took but the time of the flicking of the horses tail and yet something had happened a barrier had gone down somewhere and i was leading a wider and a wiser life  i felt it all in a flush but shy and backward as i was i could do nothing but flatten out the sacking for her  her eyes were after the coach which was rattling away to berwick and suddenly she shook her handkerchief in the air  he took off his hat said she  i think he must have been an officer he was very distinguished looking  perhaps you noticed hima gentleman on the outside very handsome with a brown overcoat  i shook my head with all my flush of joy changed to foolish resentment  ah well i shall never see him again  here are all the green braes and the brown winding road just the same as ever  and you jack i dont see any great change in you either  i hope your manners are better than they used to be  you wont try to put any frogs down my back will you  i crept all over when i thought of such a thing  well do all we can to make you happy at west inch said i playing with the whip  im sure its very kind of you to take a poor lonely girl in said she  its very kind of you to come cousin edie i stammered  youll find it very dull i fear  i suppose it is a little quiet jack eh  not many men about as i remember it  there is major elliott up at corriemuir  he comes down of an evening a real brave old soldier who had a ball in his knee under wellington  ah when i speak of men  jack i dont mean old folk with balls in their knees  i meant people of our own age that we could make friends of  by the way that crabbed old doctor had a son had he not  oh yes thats jim horscroft my best friend  is he at home  no  hell be home soon  hes still at edinburgh studying  ah then well keep each other company until he comes jack  and im very tired and i wish i was at west inch  i made old souter johnnie cover the ground as he has never done before or since and in an hour she was seated at the supper table where my mother had laid out not only butter but a glass dish of gooseberry jam which sparkled and looked fine in the candlelight  i could see that my parents were as overcome as i was at the difference in her though not in the same way  my mother was so set back by the feather thing that she had round her neck that she called her miss calder instead of edie until my cousin in her pretty flighty way would lift her forefinger to her whenever she did it  after supper when she had gone to bed they could talk of nothing but her looks and her breeding  by the way though says my father it does not look as if she were heartbroke about my brothers death  and then for the first time i remembered that she had never said a word about the matter since i had met her    chapter iii   the shadow on the waters  it was not very long before cousin edie was queen of west inch and we all her devoted subjects from my father down  she had money and to spare though none of us knew how much  when my mother said that four shillings the week would cover all that she would cost she fixed on seven shillings and sixpence of her own free will  the south room which was the sunniest and had the honeysuckle round the window was for her and it was a marvel to see the things that she brought from berwick to put into it  twice a week she would drive over and the cart would not do for her for she hired a gig from angus whitehead whose farm lay over the hill  and it was seldom that she went without bringing something back for one or other of us  it was a wooden pipe for my father or a shetland plaid for my mother or a book for me or a brass collar for rob the collie  there was never a woman more freehanded  but the best thing that she gave us was just her own presence  to me it changed the whole countryside and the sun was brighter and the braes greener and the air sweeter from the day she came  our lives were common no longer now that we spent them with such a one as she and the old dull grey house was another place in my eyes since she had set her foot across the doormat  it was not her face though that was winsome enough nor her form though i never saw the lass that could match her but it was her spirit her queer mocking ways her fresh new fashion of talk her proud whisk of the dress and toss of the head which made one feel like the ground beneath her feet and then the quick challenge in her eye and the kindly word that brought one up to her level again  but never quite to her level either  to me she was always something above and beyond  i might brace myself and blame myself and do what i would but still i could not feel that the same blood ran in our veins and that she was but a country lassie as i was a country lad  the more i loved her the more frightened i was at her and she could see the fright long before she knew the love  i was uneasy to be away from her and yet when i was with her i was in a shiver all the time for fear my stumbling talk might weary her or give her offence  had i known more of the ways of women i might have taken less pains  youre a deal changed from what you used to be jack said she looking at me sideways from under her dark lashes  you said not when first we met says i  ah i was speaking of your looks then and of your ways now  you used to be so rough to me and so masterful and would have your own way like the little man that you were  i can see you now with your touzled brown hair and your mischievous eyes  and now you are so gentle and quiet and softspoken  one learns to behave says i  ah but jack i liked you so much better as you were  well when she said that i fairly stared at her for i had thought that she could never have quite forgiven me for the way i used to carry on that anyone out of a daft house could have liked it was clean beyond my understanding  i thought of how when she was reading by the door i would go up on the moor with a hazel switch and fix little clay balls at the end of it and sling them at her until i made her cry  and then i thought of how i caught an eel in the corriemuir burn and chivied her about with it until she ran screaming under my mothers apron half mad with fright and my father gave me one on the earhole with the porridge stick which knocked me and my eel under the kitchen dresser  and these were the things that she missed  well she must miss them for my hand would wither before i could do them now  but for the first time i began to understand the queerness that lies in a woman and that a man must not reason about one but just watch and try to learn  we found our level after a time when she saw that she had just to do what she liked and how she liked and that i was as much at her beck and call as old rob was at mine  youll think i was a fool to have had my head so turned and maybe i was but then you must think how little i was used to women and how much we were thrown together  besides she was a woman in a million and i can tell you that it was a strong head that would not be turned by her  why there was major elliott a man that had buried three wives and had twelve pitched battles to his name edie could have turned him round her finger like a damp ragshe only new from the boarding school  i met him hobbling from west inch the first time after she came with pink in his cheeks and a shine in his eye that took ten years from him  he was cocking up his grey moustaches at either end and curling them into his eyes and strutting out with his sound leg as proud as a piper  what she had said to him the lord knows but it was like old wine in his veins  ive been up to see you laddie said he but i must home again now my visit has not been wasted however as i had an opportunity of seeing la belle cousine  a most charming and engaging young lady laddie  he had a formal stiff way of talking and was fond of jerking in a bit of the french for he had picked some up in the peninsula  he would have gone on talking of cousin edie but i saw the corner of a newspaper thrusting out of his pocket and i knew that he had come over as was his way to give me some news for we heard little enough at west inch  what is fresh major i asked  he pulled the paper out with a flourish  the allies have won a great battle my lad says he  i dont think nap can stand up long against this  the saxons have thrown him over and hes been badly beat at leipzig  wellington is past the pyrenees and grahams folk will be at bayonne before long  i chucked up my hat  then the war will come to an end at last i cried  aye and time too said he shaking his head gravely  its been a bloody business  but it is hardly worth while for me to say now what was in my mind about you  what was that  well laddie you are doing no good here and now that my knee is getting more limber i was hoping that i might get on active service again  i wondered whether maybe you might like to do a little soldiering under me  my heart jumped at the thought  aye would i i cried  but itll be clear six months before ill be fit to pass a board and its long odds that boney will be under lock and key before that  and theres my mother said i i doubt shed never let me go  ah well shell never be asked to now he answered and hobbled on upon his way  i sat down among the heather with my chin on my hand turning the thing over in my mind and watching him in his old brown clothes with the end of a grey plaid flapping over his shoulder as he picked his way up the swell of the  hill  it was a poor life this at west inch waiting to fill my fathers shoes with the same heath and the same burn and the same sheep and the same grey house for ever before me  but over there over the blue sea ah there was a life fit for a man  there was the major a man past his prime wounded and spent and yet planning to get to work again whilst i with all the strength of my youth was wasting it upon these hillsides  a hot wave of shame flushed over me and i sprang up all in a tingle to be off and playing a mans part in the world  for two days i turned it over in my  mind and on the third there came something which first brought all my resolutions to a head and then blew them all to nothing like a puff of smoke in the wind  i had strolled out in the afternoon with cousin edie and rob until we found ourselves upon the brow of the slope which dips away down to the beach  it was late in the fall and the links were all bronzed and faded but the sun still shone warmly and a south breeze came in little hot pants rippling the broad blue sea with white curling lines i pulled an armful of bracken to make a couch for edie and there she lay in her listless fashion happy and contented for of all folk that i have ever met she had the most joy from warmth and light  i leaned on a tussock of grass with robs head upon my knee and there as we sat alone in peace in the wilderness even there we saw suddenly thrown upon the waters in front of us the shadow of that great man over yonder who had scrawled his name in red letters across the map of europe there was a ship coming up with the wind a black sedate old merchantman bound for leith as likely as not  her yards were square and she was running with all sail set  on the other tack coming from the northeast were two great ugly luggerlike craft with one high mast each and a big square brown sail  a prettier sight one would not wish than to see the three craft dipping along upon so fair a day but of a sudden there came a spurt of flame and a whirl of blue smoke from one lugger then the same from the second and a rap rap rap from the ship  in a twinkling hell had elbowed out heaven and there on the waters was hatred and savagery and the lust for blood  we had sprung to our feet at the outburst and edie put her hand all in a tremble upon my arm  they are fighting jack she cried  what are they  who are they  my heart was thudding with the guns and it was all that i could do to answer her for the catch of my breath  its two french privateers edie said i chassemarries they call them and yons one of our merchant ships and theyll take her as sure as death for the major says theyve always got heavy guns and are as full of men as an egg is full of meat  why doesnt the fool make back for tweedmouth bar  but not an inch of canvas did she lower but floundered on in her stolid fashion while a little black ball ran up to her peak and the rare old flag streamed suddenly out from the halliard  then again came the rap rap rap of her little guns and the boom boom of the big carronades in the bows of the lugger  an instant later the three ships met and the merchantman staggered on like a stag with two wolves hanging to its haunches  the three became but a dark blurr amid the smoke with the top spars thrusting out in a bristle and from the heart of that cloud came the quick red flashes of flame and such a devils racket of big guns and small cheering and screaming as was to din in my head for many a week  for a stricken hour the hellcloud moved slowly across the face of the water and still with our hearts in our mouths we watched the flap of the flag straining to see if it were yet there  and then suddenly the ship as proud and black and high as ever shot on upon her way and as the smoke cleared we saw one of the luggers squattering like a broken winged duck upon the water and the other working hard to get the crew from her before she sank  for all that hour i had lived for nothing but the fight  my cap had been whisked away by the wind but i had never given it a thought now with my heart full i turned upon my cousin edie and the sight of her took me back six years  there was the vacant staring eye and the parted lips just as i had seen them in her girlhood and her little hands were clenched until the knuckles gleamed like ivory  ah that captain said she talking to the heath and the whinbushes  there is a man so strong so resolute  what woman would not be proud of a man like that  aye he did well i cried with enthusiasm  she looked at me as if she had forgotten my existence  i would give a year of my life to meet such a man said she but that is what living in the country means  one never sees anybody but just those who are fit for nothing better  i do not know that she meant to hurt me though she was never very backward at that but whatever her intention her words seemed to strike straight upon a naked nerve  very well cousin edie i said trying to speak calmly that puts the cap on it  ill take the bounty in berwick tonight  what jack you be a soldier  yes if you think that every man that bides in the country must be a coward  oh youd look so handsome in a red coat jack and it improves you vastly when you are in a temper  i wish your eyes would always flash like that for it looks so nice and manly  but i am sure that you are joking about the soldiering  ill let you see if i am joking  then and there i set off running over the moor until i burst into the kitchen where my mother and father were sitting on either side of the ingle  mother i cried im off for a soldier  had i said i was off for a burglar they could not have looked worse over it for in those days among the decent canny country folks it was mostly the black sheep that were herded by the sergeant  but my word those same black sheep did their country some rare service too  my mother put up her mittens to her eyes and my father looked as black as a peat hole  hoots jock youre daft says he  daft or no im going  then youll have no blessing from me  then ill go without  at this my mother gives a screech and throws her arms about my neck i saw her hand all hard and worn and knuckly with the work she had done for my upbringing and it pleaded with me as words could not have done my heart was soft for her but my will was as hard as a flintedge i put her back in her chair with a kiss and then ran to my room to pack my bundle  it was already growing dark and i had a long walk before me so i thrust a few things together and hastened out  as i came through the side door someone touched my shoulder and there was edie in the gloaming  silly boy said she you are not really going  am i not  youll see  but your father does not wish it nor your mother  i know that  then why go  you ought to know  why then  because you make me  i dont want you to go jack  you said it  you said that the folk in the country were fit for nothing better  you always speak like that  you think no more of me than of those doos in the cot  you think i am nobody at all  ill show you different  all my troubles came out in hot little spurts of speech  she coloured up as i spoke and looked at me in her queer halfmocking halfpetting fashion  oh i think so little of you as that said she  and that is the reason why you are going away  well then jack will you stay if i amif i  am kind to you  we were face to face and close together and in an instant the thing was done  my arms were round her and i was kissing her and kissing her and kissing her on her mouth her cheeks her eyes and pressing her to my heart and whispering to her that she was all all to me and that i could not be without her  she said nothing but it was long before she turned her face aside and when she pushed me back it was not very hard  why you are quite your rude old impudent self said she patting her hair with her two hands  you have tossed me jack i had no idea that you would be so forward  but all my fear of her was gone and a love tenfold hotter than ever was boiling in my veins  i took her up again and kissed her as if it were my right  you are my very own now i cried  i shall not go to berwick but ill stay and marry you  but she laughed when i spoke of marriage  silly boy  silly boy said she with her forefinger up and then when i tried to lay hands on her again she gave a little dainty curtsy and was off into the house    chapter iv   the choosing of jim  and then there came those ten weeks which were like a dream and are so now to look back upon  i would weary you were i to tell you what passed between us but oh how earnest and fateful and allimportant it was at the time  her waywardness her evervarying moods now bright now dark like a meadow under drifting clouds her causeless angers her sudden repentances each in turn filling me with joy or sorrow these were my life and all the rest was but emptiness  but ever deep down behind all my other feelings was a vague disquiet a fear that i was like the man who set forth to lay hands upon the rainbow and that the real edie calder however near she might seem was in truth for ever beyond my reach  for she was so hard to understand or at least she was so for a dullwitted country lad like me  for if i would talk to her of my real prospects and how by taking in the whole of corriemuir we might earn a hundred good pounds over the extra rent and maybe be able to build out the parlour at west inch so as to make it fine for her when we married she would pout her lips and droop her eyes as though she scarce had patience to listen to me  but if i would let her build up dreams about what i might become how i might find a paper which proved me to be the true heir of the laird or how without joining the army which she would by no means hear of i showed myself to be a great warrior until my name was in all folks mouths then she would be as blithe as the may  i would keep up the play as well as i could but soon some luckless word would show that i was only plain jock calder of west inch and out would come her lip again in scorn of me  so we moved on she in the air and i on the ground and if the rift had not come in one way it must in another  it was after christmas but the winter had been mild with just frost enough to make it safe walking over the peat bogs  one fresh morning edie had been out early and she came back to breakfast with a fleck of colour on her cheeks  has your friend the doctors son come home jack says she  i heard that it was expected  ah then it must have been him that i met on the muir  what you met jim horscroft  i am sure it must be he  a splendidlooking mana hero with curly black hair a short straight nose and grey eyes  he had shoulders like a  statue and as to height why i suppose that your head jack would come up to his scarfpin  up to his ear edie said i indignantly  that is if it was jim but tell me  had he a brown wooden pipe stuck in the corner of his mouth  yes he was smoking  he was dressed in grey and he has a grand deep strong voice  ho ho you spoke to him said i  she coloured a little as if she had said more than she meant  i was going where the ground was a little soft and he warned me of it she said  ah it must have been dear old jim said i  he should have been a doctor years back if his brains had been as strong as his arm why heart alive here is the very man himself  i had seen him through the kitchen window and now i rushed out with my halfeaten bannock in my hand to greet him  he ran forward too with his great hand out and his eyes shining  ah jock he cried its good to see you again  there are no friends like the old ones  then suddenly he stuck in his speech and stared with his mouth open over my shoulder  i turned and there was edie with such a merry roguish smile standing in the door  how proud i felt of her and of myself too as i looked at her  this is my cousin miss edie calder jim said i  do you often take walks before breakfast mr horscroft she asked still with that roguish smile  yes said he staring at her with all his eyes  so do i and generally over yonder said she  but you are not very hospitable to your friend jack  if you do not do the honours i shall have to take your place for the credit of west inch  well in another minute we were in with the old folk and jim had his plate of porridge ladled out for him but hardly a word would he speak but sat with his spoon in his hand staring at cousin edie  she shot little twinkling glances across at him all the time and it seemed to me that she was amused at his backwardness and that she tried by what she said to give him heart  jack was telling me that you were studying to be a doctor said she but oh how hard it must be and how long it must take before one can gather so much learning as that  it takes me long enough jim answered ruefully but ill beat it yet  ah but you are brave  you are resolute  you fix your eyes on a point and you move on towards it and nothing can stop you  indeed ive little to boast of said he  many a one who began with me has put up his plate years ago and here am i but a student still  that is your modesty mr horscroft  they say that the bravest are always humble  but then when you have gained your end what a glorious careerto carry healing in your hands to raise up the suffering to have for ones sole end the good of humanity  honest jim wriggled in his chair at this  im afraid i have no such very high motives miss calder said he its to earn a living and to take over my fathers business that i do it  if i carry healing in one hand i have the other out for a crownpiece  how candid and truthful you are she cried and so they went on she decking him with every virtue and twisting his words to make him play the part in the way that i knew so well  before he was done i could see that his head was buzzing with her beauty and her kindly words i thrilled with pride to think that he should think so well of my kin  isnt she fine jim  i could not help saying when we stood outside the door he lighting his pipe before he set off home  fine he cried i never saw her match  were going to be married said i  the pipe fell out of his mouth and he stood staring at me  then he picked it up and walked off without a word  i thought that he would likely come back but he never did and i saw him far off up the brae with his chin on his chest  but i was not to forget him for cousin edie had a hundred questions to ask me about his boyhood about his strength about the women that he was likely to know there was no satisfying her  and then again later in the day i heard of him but in a less pleasant  fashion  it was my father who came home in  the evening with his mouth full of poor jim  he had been deadly drunk since midday had been down to westhouse links to fight the gipsy champion and it was not certain that the man would live through the night  my father had met jim on the highroad dour as a thundercloud and with an insult in his eye for every man that passed him  guid sakes said the old man  hell make a fine practice for himsel if breaking banes will do it  cousin edie laughed at all this and i laughed because she did but i was not so sure that it was funny  on the third day afterwards i was going up corriemuir by the sheeptrack when who should i see striding down but jim himself but he was a different man from the big kindly fellow who had supped his porridge with us the other morning  he had no collar nor tie his vest was open his hair matted and his face mottled like a man who has drunk heavily overnight  he carried an ash stick and he slashed at the whinbushes on either side of the path  why jim said i  but he looked at me in the way that i had often seen at school when the devil was strong in him and when he knew that he was in the wrong and yet set his will to brazen it out  not a word did he say but he brushed past me on the narrow path and swaggered  on still brandishing his ashplant and  cutting at the bushes  ah well i was not angry with him  i was sorry very sorry and that was all  of course i was not so blind but that i could see how the matter stood  he was in love with edie and he could not bear to think that i should have her  poor devil how could he help it  maybe i should have been the same  there was a time when i should have wondered that a girl could have turned a strong mans head like that but i knew more about it now  for a fortnight i saw nothing of jim horscroft and then came the thursday which was to change the whole current of my life  i had woke early that day and with a little thrill of joy which is a rare thing to feel when a man first opens his eyes  edie had been kinder than usual the night before and i had fallen asleep with the thought that maybe at last i had caught the rainbow and that without any imaginings or makebelieves she was learning to love plain rough jock calder of west inch  it was this thought still at my heart which had given me that little morning chirrup of joy  and then i remembered that if i hastened i might be in time for her for it was her custom to go out with the sunrise  but i was too late  when i came to her door it was halfopen and the room empty  well thought i at least i may meet her and have the homeward walk with her  from the top of corriemuir hill you may see all the country round so catching up my stick i swung off in that direction  it was bright but cold and the surf i remember was booming loudly though there had been no wind in our parts for days i zigzagged up the steep pathway breathing in the thin keen morning air and humming a lilt as i went until i came out a little short of breath among the whins upon the top  looking down the long slope of the farther side i saw cousin edie as i had expected and i saw jim horscroft walking by her side  they were not far away but too taken up with each other to see me  she was walking slowly with the little petulant cock of her dainty head which i knew so well casting her eyes away from him and shooting out a word from time to time  he paced along beside her looking down at her and bending his head in the eagerness of his talk  then as he said something she placed her hand with a caress upon his arm and he carried off his feet plucked her up and kissed her again and again at the sight i could neither cry out nor move but stood with a heart of lead and the face of a dead man staring down at them  i saw her hand passed over his shoulder and that his kisses were as welcome to her as ever mine had been  then he set her down again and i found that this had been their parting  for indeed in another hundred paces they would have come in view of the upper windows of the house   she walked slowly away with a wave back once or twice and he stood looking after her  i waited until she was some  way off and then down i came but so taken up was he that i was within a handstouch of him before he whisked round upon me he tried to smile as is eye met mine  ah jock says he early afoot  i saw you i gasped and my throat had turned so dry that i spoke like a man with a quinsy  did you so said he and gave a little whistle  well on my life jock im not sorry  i was thinking of coming up to west inch this very day and having it out with you  maybe its better as it is  youve been a fine friend said i  well now be reasonable jock said he sticking his hands into his pockets and rocking to and fro as he stood  let me show you how it stands  look me in the eye and youll see that i dont lie  its this way  i had met edimiss calder that isbefore i came that morning and there were things which made me look upon her as free and thinking that i let my mind dwell on her  then you said she wasnt free but was promised to you and that was the worst knock ive had for a time it clean put me off and i made a fool of myself for some days and its a mercy im not in berwick gaol  then by chance i met her againon my soul jock it was chance for meand when i spoke of you she laughed at the thought  it was cousin and cousin she said but as for her not being free or you being more to her than a friend it was fools talk so you see jock i was not so much to blame after all the more so as she promised that she would let you see by her conduct that you were mistaken in thinking that you had any claim upon her  you must have noticed that she has hardly had a word for you for these last two weeks  i laughed bitterly  it was only last night said i that she told me that i was the only man in all this earth that she could ever bring herself to love  jim horscroft put out a shaking hand and laid it on my shoulder while he pushed his face forward to look into my eyes  jock calder said he i never knew you tell a lie  you are not trying to score trick against trick are you  honest now between man and man  its gods truth said i  he stood looking at me and his face had set like that of a man who is having a hard fight with himself  it was a long two minutes before he spoke  see here jock said he  this woman is fooling us both  dyou hear man shes fooling us both  she loves you at west inch and she loves me on the braeside and in her devils heart she cares a whinblossom for neither of us  lets join hands man and send the hellfire hussy to the rightabout  but this was too much  i could not curse her in my own heart and still less could i stand by and hear another man do it not though it was my oldest friend  dont you call names i cried  ach you sicken me with your soft talk  ill call her what she should be called  will you though said i lugging off my coat  look you here jim horscroft if you say another word against her ill lick it down your throat if you were as big as berwick castle  try me and see  he peeled off his coat down to the elbows and then he slowly put it on again  dont be such a fool jock said he  four stone and five inches is more than mortal man can give  two old friends mustnt fall out over such awell there i wont say it  well by the lord if she hasnt nerve for ten  i looked round and there she was not twenty yards from us looking as cool and easy and placid as we were hot and fevered  i was nearly home said she when i saw you two boys very busy talking so i came all the way back to know what it was about  horscroft took a run forward and caught her by the wrist  she gave a little squeal at the sight of his face but he pulled her towards where i was standing  now jock weve had tomfoolery enough said he  here she is  shall we take her word as to which she likes  she cant trick us now that were both together  i am willing said i  and so am i  if she goes for you i swear ill never so much as turn an eye on her again  will you do as much for me  yes i will  well then look here you  were both honest men and friends and we tell each other no lies and so we know your double ways  i know what you said last night  jock knows what you said today  dyou see now then fair and square  here we are before you once and have done which is it to be jock or me  you would have thought that the woman would have been overwhelmed with shame but instead of that her eyes were shining with delight and i dare wager that it was the proudest moment of her life  as she looked from one to the other of us with the cold morning sun glittering on her face i had never seen her look so lovely  jim felt it also i am sure for he dropped her wrist and the harsh lines were softened upon his face  come edie which is it to be he asked  naughty boys to fall out like this she cried  cousin jack you know how fond i am of you  oh then go to him said horscroft  but i love nobody but jim  there is nobody that i love like jim  she snuggled up to him and laid her cheek against his breast  you see jock said he looking over her shoulder  i did see and away i went for west inch another man from the time that i left it    chapter v   the man from the sea  well i was never one to sit groaning over a cracked pot  if it could not be mended then it is the part of a man to say no more of it for weeks i had an aching heart indeed it is a little sore now after all these years and a happy marriage when i think of it  but i kept a brave face on me and above all i did as i had promised that day on the hillside  i was as a brother to her and no more though there were times when i had to put a hard curb upon myself for even now she would come to me with her coaxing ways and with tales about how rough jim was and how happy she had been when i was kind to her for it was in her blood to speak like that and she could not help it  but for the most part jim and she were happy enough  it was all over the countryside that they were to be married when he had passed his degree and he would come up to west inch four nights a week to sit with us  my folk were pleased about it and i tried to be pleased too  maybe at first there was a little coolness between him and me there was not quite the old schoolboy trust between us  but then when the first smart was passed it seemed to me that he had acted openly and that i had no just cause for complaint against him  so we were friendly in a way and as for her he had forgotten all his anger and would have kissed the print of her shoe in the mud  we used to take long rambles together he and i and it is about one of these that i now want to tell you  we had passed over bramston heath and round the clump of firs which screens the house of major elliott from the sea wind  it was spring now and the year was a forward one so that the trees were well leaved by the end of april  it was as warm as a summer day and we were the more surprised when we saw a huge fire roaring upon the grassplot before the majors door  there was half a firtree in it and the flames were spouting up as high as the bedroom windows  jim and i stood staring but we stared the more when out came the major with a great quart pot in his hand and at his heels his old sister who kept house for him and two of the maids and all four began capering about round the fire  he was a douce quiet man as all the country knew and here he was like old nick at the carlins dance hobbling around and waving his drink above his head  we both set off running and he waved the more when he saw us coming  peace he roared  huzza boys peace  and at that we both fell to dancing and shouting too for it had been such a weary war as far back as we could remember and the shadow had lain so long over us that it was wondrous to feel that it was lifted indeed it was too much to believe but the major laughed our doubts to scorn  aye aye it is true he cried stopping with his hand to his side the allies have got paris boney has thrown up the sponge and his people are all swearing allegiance to louis xviii  and the emperor  i asked  will they spare him  theres talk of sending him to elba where hell be out of mischiefs way  but his officers there are some of them who will not get off so lightly  deeds have been done during these last twenty years that have not been forgotten  there are a few old scores to be settled  but its peace peace  and away he went once more with his great tankard hopping round his bonfire  well we stayed some time with the major and then away we went down to the beach jim and i talking about this great news and all that would come of it  he knew a little and i knew less but we pieced it all together and talked about how the prices would come down how our brave fellows would return home how the ships could go where they would in peace and how we could pull all the coast beacons down for there was no enemy now to fear  so we chatted as we walked along the clean hard sand and looked out at the old north sea  how little did jim know at that moment as he strode along by my side so full of health and of spirits that he had reached the extreme summit of his life and that from that hour all would in truth be upon the downward slope  there was a little haze out to sea  for it had been very misty in the early morning though the sun had thinned it  as we looked seawards we suddenly saw the sail of a small boat break out through the fog and come bobbing along towards the land  a single man was seated in the sheets and she yawed about as she ran as though he were of two minds whether to beach her or no  at last determined it may be by our presence he made straight for us and her keel grated upon the shingle at our very feet  he dropped his sail sprang out and pulled her bows up on the beach  great britain i believe said he turning briskly round and facing us  he was a man somewhat above middle height but exceedingly thin his eyes were piercing and set close together a long sharp nose jutted out from between them and beneath them was a bristle of brown moustache as wiry and stiff as a cats whiskers  he was well dressed in a suit of brown with brass buttons and he wore high boots which were all roughened and dulled by the sea water  his face and hands were so dark that he might have been a spaniard but as he raised his hat to us we saw that the upper part of his brow was quite white and that it was from without that he had his swarthiness  he looked from one to the other of us and his grey eyes had something in them which i had never seen before  you could read the question but there seemed to be a menace at the back of it as if the answer were a right and not a favour  great britain he asked again with a quick tap of his foot on the shingle  yes said i while jim burst out laughing  england  scotland  scotland  but its england past yonder trees  bon i know where i am now  ive been in a fog without a compass for nearly three days and i didnt thought i was ever to see land again  he spoke english glibly enough but with some strange turn of speech from time to time  where did you come from then asked jim  i was in a ship that was wrecked said he shortly  what is the town down yonder  it is berwick  ah well i must get stronger before i can go further  he turned towards the boat and as he did so he gave a lurch and would have fallen had he not caught the prow  on this he seated himself and looked round with a face that was flushed and two eyes that blazed like a wild beasts  voltigeurs de la garde he roared in a voice like a trumpet call and then again voltigeurs de la garde  he waved his hat above is head and suddenly pitching forwards upon his face on the sand he lay all huddled into a little brown heap  jim horscroft and i stood and stared at each other  the coming of the man had been so strange and his questions and now this sudden turn we took him by a shoulder each and turned him upon his back  there he lay with his jutting nose and his cats whiskers but his lips were bloodless and his breath would scarce shake a feather  hes dying jim i cried  aye for want of food and water  theres not a drop or crumb in the boat  maybe theres something in the bag  he sprang and brought out a black leather bag which with a large blue coat was the only thing in the boat  it was locked but jim had it open in an instant  it was half full of gold pieces  neither of us had ever seen so much beforeno nor a tenth part of it there must have been hundreds of them all bright new british sovereigns  indeed so taken up were we that we had forgotten all about their owner until a groan took our thoughts back to him  his lips were bluer than ever and his jaw had dropped  i can see his open mouth now with its row of white wolfish teeth  my god hes off cried jim here run to the burn  jock for a hatful of water  quick man or hes gone  ill loosen his things the while  away i tore and was back in a minute with as much water as would stay in my glengarry  jim had pulled open the mans coat and shirt and we doused the water over him and forced some between his lips  it had a good effect for after a gasp or two he sat up and rubbed his eyes slowly like a man who is waking from a deep sleep but neither jim nor i were looking at his face now for our eyes were fixed upon his uncovered chest  there were two deep red puckers in it one just below the collar bone and the other about halfway down on the right side  the skin of his body was extremely white up to the brown line of his neck and the angry crinkled spots looked the more vivid against it  from above i could see that there was a corresponding pucker in the back at one place but not at the other  inexperienced as i was i could tell what that meant two bullets had pierced his chest one had passed through it and the other had remained inside  but suddenly he staggered up to his feet and pulled his shirt to with a quick suspicious glance at us  what have i been doing he asked  ive been off my head  take no notice of anything i may have said  have i been shouting  you shouted just before you fell  what did i shout  i told him though it bore little meaning to my mind   he looked sharply at us and then he shrugged his shoulders  its the words of a song said he  well the question is what am i to do now  i didnt thought i was so weak   where did you get the water  i pointed towards the burn and he staggered off to the bank  there he lay down upon his face and he drank until i thought he would never have done  his long skinny neck was outstretched like a horses and he made a loud supping noise with his lips  at last he got up with a long sigh and wiped his moustache with his sleeve  thats better said he  have you any food  i had crammed two bits of oatcake into my pocket when i left home and these he crushed into his mouth and swallowed  then he squared his shoulders puffed out his chest and patted his ribs with the flat of his hands  i am sure that i owe you exceedingly well said he  you have been very kind to a stranger  but i see that you have had occasion to open my bag  we hoped that we might find wine or brandy there when you fainted  ah i have nothing there but just a littlehow do you say itmy savings  they are not much but i must live quietly upon them until i find something to do  now one could live quietly here i should say i could not have come upon a more peaceful place without perhaps so much as a gendarme nearer than that town  you havent told us yet who you are where you come from nor what you have been said jim bluntly  the stranger looked him up and down with a critical eye  my word but you would make a grenadier for a flank company said he as to what you ask i might take offence at it from other lips but you have a right to know since you have received me with so great courtesy my name is bonaventure de lapp  i am a soldier and a wanderer by trade and i have come from dunkirk as you may see printed upon the boat  i thought that you had been shipwrecked said i  but he looked at me with the straight gaze of an honest man  that is right said he but the ship went from dunkirk and this is one of her boats  the crew got away in the long boat and she went down so quickly that i had no time to put anything into her  that was on monday  and todays thursday  you have been three days without bite or sup  it is too long said he  twice before i have been for two days but never quite so long as this  well i shall leave my boat here and see whether i can get lodgings in any of these little grey houses upon the hillsides  why is that great fire burning over yonder  it is one of our neighbours who has served against the french   he is rejoicing because peace has been declared  oh you have a neighbour who has served then  i am glad for i too have seen a little soldiering here and there  he did not look glad but he drew his brows down over his keen eyes  you are french are you not i asked as we all walked up the hill together he with his black bag in his hand and his long blue cloak slung over his shoulder  well i am of alsace said he and you know they are more german than french  for myself i have been in so many lands that i feel at home in all  i have been a great traveller and where do you think that i might find a lodging  i can scarcely tell now on looking back with the great gap of fiveandthirty years between what impression this singular man had made upon me  i distrusted him i think and yet i was fascinated by him also for there was something in his bearing in his look and his whole fashion of speech which was entirely unlike anything that i had ever seen  jim horscroft was a fine man and major elliott was a brave one but they both lacked something that this wanderer had  it was the quick alert look the flash of the eye the nameless distinction which is so hard to fix  and then we had saved him when he lay gasping upon the shingle and ones heart always softens towards what one has once helped  if you will come with me said i i have little doubt that i can find you a bed for a night or two and by that time you will be better able to make your own arrangements  he pulled off his hat and bowed with all the grace imaginable but jim horscroft pulled me by the sleeve and led me aside  youre mad jock he whispered  the fellows a common adventurer what do you want to get mixed up with him for  but i was as obstinate a man as ever laced his boots and if you jerked me back it was the finest way of sending me to the front  hes a stranger and its our part to look after him said i  youll be sorry for it said he  maybe so  if you dont think of yourself you might think of your cousin  edie can take very good care of herself  well then the devil take you and you may do what you like he cried in one of his sudden flushes of anger  without a word of farewell to either of us he turned off upon the track that led up towards his fathers house  bonaventure de lapp smiled at me as we walked on together  i didnt thought he liked me very much said he  i can see very well that he has made a quarrel with you because you are taking me to your home  what does he think of me then  does he think perhaps that i have stole the gold in my bag or what is it that he fears  tut i neither know nor care said i  no stranger shall pass our door without a crust and a bed  with my head cocked and feeling as if i was doing something very fine instead of being the most egregious fool south of edinburgh i marched on down the path with my new acquaintance at my elbow    chapter vi   a wandering eagle  my father seemed to be much of jim horscrofts opinion for he was not over warm to this new guest and looked him up and down with a very questioning eye  he set a dish of vinegared herrings before him however and i noticed that he looked more askance than ever when my companion ate nine of them for two were always our portion  when at last he had finished bonaventure de lapps lids were drooping over his eyes for i doubt that he had been sleepless as well as foodless for these three days  it was but a poor room to which i had led him but he threw himself down upon the couch wrapped his big blue cloak around him and was asleep in an instant  he was a very high and strong snorer and as my room was next to his i had reason to remember that we had a stranger within our gates  when i came down in the morning i found that he had been beforehand with me for he was seated opposite my father at the windowtable in the kitchen their heads almost touching and a little roll of gold pieces between them  as i came in my father looked up at me and i saw a light of greed in his eyes such as i had never seen before  he caught up the money with an eager clutch and swept it into his pocket  very good mister said he the rooms yours and you pay always on the third of the month  ah and here is my first friend cried de lapp holding out his hand to me with a smile which was kindly enough and yet had that touch of patronage which a man uses when he smiles to his dog  i am myself again now thanks to my excellent supper and good nights rest  ah it is hunger that takes the courage from a man  that most and cold next  aye thats right said my father ive been out on the moors in a snowdrift for sixandthirty hours and ken what its like  i once saw three thousand men starve to death remarked de lapp putting out his hands to the fire  day by day they got thinner and more like apes and they did come down to the edge of the pontoons where we did keep them and they howled with rage and pain   the first few days their howls went over the whole city but after a week our sentries on the bank could not hear them so weak they had fallen  and they died i exclaimed  they held out a very long time  austrian grenadiers they were of the corps of starowitz fine stout men as big as your friend of yesterday but when the town fell there were but four hundred alive and a man could lift them three at a time as if they were little monkeys  it was a pity  ah my friend you will do me the honours with madame and with mademoiselle  it was my mother and edie who had come into the kitchen  he had not seen them the night before but now it was all i could do to keep my face as i watched him for instead of our homely scottish nod he bent up his back like a louping trout and slid his foot and clapped his hand over his heart in the queerest way  my mother stared for she thought he was making fun of her but cousin edie fell into it in an instant as though it had been a game and away she went in a great curtsy until i thought she would have had to give it up and sit down right there in the middle of the kitchen floor  but no she up again as light as a piece of fluff and we all drew up our stools and started on the scones and milk and  porridge  he had a wonderful way with women that man   now if i were to do it or jim horscroft it would look as if we were playing the fool and the girls would have laughed at us but with him it seemed to go with his style of face and fashion of speech so that one came at last to look for it for when he spoke to my mother or cousin edieand he was never backward in speakingit would always be with a bow and a look as if it would hardly be worth their while to listen to what he had to say and when they answered he would put on a face as though every word they said was to be treasured up and remembered for ever  and yet even while he humbled himself to a woman there was always a proud sort of look at the back of his eye as if he meant to say that it was only to them that he was so meek and that he could be stiff enough upon occasion  as to my mother it was wonderful the way she softened to him and in halfanhour she had told him all about her uncle who was a surgeon in carlisle and the highest of any upon her side of the house  she spoke to him about my brother robs death which i had never heard her mention to a soul before and he looked as if the tears were in his eyes over ithe who had just told us how he had seen three thousand men starved to death  as to edie she did not say much but she kept shooting little glances at our visitor and once or twice he looked  very hard at her  when he had gone to his room after  breakfast my father pulled out eight golden pounds and laid them on the  table  what think ye of that martha  said he  youve sold the twa black tups after all  no but its a months pay for board and lodging from jocks friend and as much to come every four weeks  but my mother shook her head when  she heard it  two pounds a week is over much said she and it is not when the poor gentleman is in distress that we should put such a price on his bit food  tut cried my father he can very well afford it and he with a bag full of gold  besides its his own proposing  no blessing will come from that money said she  why woman hes turned your head wi his foreign ways of speech cried my father  aye and it would be a good thing if scottish men had a little more of that kindly way she said and that was the first time in all my life that i had heard her answer him back  he came down soon and asked me whether i would come out with him when we were in the sunshine he held out a little cross made of red stones one of the bonniest things that ever i had set eyes upon  these are rubies said he and i got it at tudela in spain there were two of them but i gave the other to a lithuanian girl i pray that you will take this as a memory of your exceedingly kindness to me yesterday  it will fashion into a pin for your cravat  i could but thank him for the present which was of more value than anything i had ever owned in my life  i am off to the upper muir to count the lambs said i maybe you would care to come up with me and see something of the country  he hesitated for a moment and then he shook his head  i have some letters he said  which i ought to write as soon as possible  i think that i will stay at quiet this morning and get them written  all forenoon i was wandering over the links and you may imagine that my mind was turning all the time upon this strange man whom chance had drifted to our doors  where did he gain that style of his that manner of command that haughty menacing glint of the eye  and his experiences to which he referred so lightly how wonderful the life must have been which had put him in the way of them  he had been kind to us and gracious of speech but still i could not quite shake myself clear of the distrust with which i had regarded him  perhaps after all jim horscroft had been right and i had been wrong about taking him to west inch  when i got back he looked as though he had been born and bred in the steading  he sat in the big woodenarmed inglechair with the black cat on his knee  his arms were out and he held a skein of worsted from hand to hand which my mother was busily rolling into a ball  cousin edie was sitting near and i could see  by her eyes that she had been crying  hullo edie said i whats the trouble  ah mademoiselle like all good and true women has a soft heart said he  i didnt thought it would have moved her or i should have been silent  i have been talking of the suffering of some troops of which i knew something when they were crossing the guadarama mountains in the winter of 1808  ah yes it was very bad for they were fine men and fine horses  it is strange to see men blown by the wind over the precipices but the ground was so slippery and there was nothing to which they could hold  so companies all linked arms and they did better in that fashion but one artillerymans hand came off as i held it for he had had the frostbite for three days  i stood staring with my mouth open  and the old grenadiers too who were not so active as they used to be they could not keep up and yet if they lingered the peasants would catch them and crucify them to the barn doors with their feet up and a fire under their heads which was a pity for these fine old soldiers so when they could go no further it was interesting to see what they would do for they would sit down and say their prayers sitting on an old saddle or their knapsacks maybe and then take off their boots and their stockings and lean their chin on the barrel of their musket then they would put their toe on the trigger and pouf it was all over and there was no more marching for those fine old grenadiers  oh it was very rough work up there on these guadarama mountains  and what army was this i asked  oh i have served in so many armies that i mix them up sometimes yes i have seen much of war  apropos i have seen your scotchmen fight and very stout fantassins they make but i thought from them that the folk over here all worehow do you say itpetticoats  those are the kilts and they wear them only in the highlands  ah on the mountains  but there is a man out yonder  maybe he is the one who your father said would carry my letters to the post  yes he is farmer whiteheads man  shall i give them to him  well he would be more careful of them if he had them from your hand  he took them from his pocket and gave them over to me  i hurried out with them and as i did so my eyes fell upon the address of the topmost one  it was written very large and clear     a son majeste      le roi de suede        stockholm  i did not know very much french but i had enough to make that out what sort of eagle was this which had flown into our humble little nest    chapter vii   the corriemuir peel tower  well it would weary me and i am very sure that it would weary you also if i were to attempt to tell you how life went with us after this man came under our roof or the way in which he gradually came to win the affections of every one of us  with the women it was quick work enough but soon he had thawed my father too which was no such easy matter and had gained jim horscrofts goodwill as well as my own indeed we were but two great boys beside him for he had been everywhere and seen everything and of an evening he would chatter away in his limping english until he took us clean from the plain kitchen and the little farm steading to plunge us into courts and camps and battlefields and all the wonders of the world  horscroft had been sulky enough with him at first  but de lapp with his tact and his easy ways soon drew him round until he had quite won his heart and jim would sit with cousin edies hand in his and the two be quite lost in listening to all that he had to tell us  i will not tell you all this but even now after so long an interval i can trace how week by week and month by month by this word and that deed he moulded us all as he wished  one of his first acts was to give my father the boat in which he had come reserving only the right to have it back in case he should have need of it  the herring were down on the coast that autumn and my uncle before he died had given us a fine set of nets so the gift was worth many a pound to us  sometimes de lapp would go out in the boat alone and i have seen him for a whole summer day rowing slowly along and stopping every halfdozen strokes to throw over a stone at the end of a string  i could not think what he was doing until he told me of his own freewill  i am fond of studying all that has to do with the military said he and i never lose a chance  i was wondering if it would be a difficult matter for the commander of an army corps to throw his men ashore here  if the wind were not from the east said i  ah quite so if the wind were not from the east  have you taken soundings here  no  your line of battleships would have to lie outside but there is water enough for a fortygun frigate right up within musket range  cram your boats with tirailleurs deploy them behind these sandhills then back with the launches for more and a stream of grape over their heads from the frigates  it could be done it could be done  his moustaches bristled out more like a cats than ever and i could see by the flash of his eyes that he was carried away by his dream  you forget that our soldiers would be upon the beach said i indignantly  ta ta ta he cried  of course it takes two sides to make a battle let us see now let us work it out  what could you get together shall we say twenty thirty thousand  a few regiments of good troops the rest poufconscripts bourgeois with arms  how do you call themvolunteers  brave men i shouted  oh yes very brave men but imbecile  ah mon dieu it is incredible how imbecile they would be  not they alone i mean but all young troops  they are so afraid of being afraid that they would take no precaution   ah i have seen it  in spain i have seen a battalion of conscripts attack a battery of ten pieces  up they went ah so gallantly and presently the hillside looked from where i stood like how do you say it in englisha raspberry tart  and where was our fine battalion of conscripts  then another battalion of young troops tried it all together in a rush shouting and yelling but what will shouting do against a mitraille of grape  and there was our second battalion laid out on the hillside  and then the foot chasseurs of the guard old soldiers were told to take the battery and there was nothing fine about their advanceno column no shouting nobody killedjust a few scattered lines of tirailleurs and pelotons of support but in ten minutes the guns were silenced and the spanish gunners cut to pieces war must be learned my young friend just the same as the farming of sheep  pooh said i not to be outcrowed by a foreigner  if we had thirty thousand men on the line of the hill yonder you would come to be very glad that you had your boats behind you  on the line of the hill said he with a flash of his eyes along the ridge  yes if your man knew his business he would have his left about your house his centre on corriemuir and his right over near the doctors house with his tirailleurs pushed out thickly in front his horse of course would try to cut us up as we deployed on the beach  but once let us form and we should soon know what to do theres the weak point there at the gap  i would sweep it with my guns then roll in my cavalry push the infantry on in grand columns and that wing would find itself up in the air  eh jack where would your volunteers be  close at the heels of your hindmost man said i and we both burst out into the hearty laugh with which such discussions usually ended  sometimes when he talked i thought he was joking and at other times it was not quite so easy to say  i well remember one evening that summer when he was sitting in the kitchen with my father jim and me after the women had gone to bed he began about scotland and its relation to england  you used to have your own king and your own laws made at edinburgh said he  does it not fill you with rage and despair when you think that it all comes to you from london now  jim took his pipe out of his mouth  it was we who put our king over the english so if theres any rage it should have been over yonder said he  this was clearly news to the stranger and it silenced him for the moment  well but your laws are made down there and surely that is not good he said at last  no it would be well to have a parliament back in edinburgh said my father but i am kept so busy with the sheep that i have little enough time to think of such things  it is for fine young men like you two to think of it said de lapp when a country is injured it is to its young men that it looks to avenge it  aye the english take too much upon themselves sometimes said jim  well if there are many of that way of thinking about why should we not form them into battalions and march them upon london cried de lapp  that would be a rare little picnic said i laughing  and who would lead us  he jumped up bowing with his hand on his heart in his queer fashion  if you will allow me to have the honour he cried and then seeing that we were all laughing he began to laugh also but i am sure that there was really no thought of a joke in his  mind  i could never make out what his age could be nor could jim horscroft either  sometimes we thought that he was an oldish man that looked young and at others that he was a youngish man who looked old  his brown stiff closecropped hair needed no cropping at the top where it thinned away to a shining curve  his skin too was intersected by a thousand fine wrinkles lacing and interlacing and was all burned as i have already said by the sun  yet he was as lithe as a boy and he was as tough as whalebone walking all day over the hills or rowing on the sea without turning a hair  on the whole we thought that he might be about forty or fortyfive though it was hard to see how he could have seen so much of life in the time  but one day we got talking of ages and then he surprised us  i had been saying that i was just twenty and jim said that he was twentyseven  then i am the most old of the three said de lapp  we laughed at this for by our reckoning he might almost have been our father  but not by so much said he arching his brows  i was nineandtwenty in december  and it was this even more than his talk which made us understand what an extraordinary life it must have been  that he had led  he saw our astonishment and laughed at it  i have lived  i have lived he  cried  i have spent my days and my nights  i led a company in a battle where five nations were engaged when i was but fourteen  i made a king turn pale at the words i whispered in his ear when i was twenty  i had a hand in remaking a kingdom and putting a fresh king upon a great throne the very year that i came of age  mon dieu i have lived my life  that was the most that i ever heard him confess of his past life and he only shook his head and laughed when we tried to get something more out of him  there were times when we thought that he was but a clever impostor for what could a man of such influence and talents be loitering here in berwickshire for  but one day there came an incident which showed us that he had indeed a history in the past  you will remember that there was an old officer of the peninsula who lived no great way from us the same who danced round the bonfire with his sister and the two maids  he had gone up to london on some business about his pension and his wound money and the chance of having some work given him so that he did not come back until late in the autumn one of the first days after his return he came down to see us and there for the first time he clapped eyes upon de lapp  never in my life did i look upon so astonished a face and he stared at our friend for a long minute without so much as a word  de lapp looked back at him equally hard but there was no recognition in his eyes  i do not know who you are sir he said at last but you look at me as if you had seen me before  so i have answered the major  never to my knowledge  but ill swear it  where then  at the village of astorga in the year 8  de lapp started and stared again at our neighbour  mon dieu what a chance he cried  and you were the english parlementaire  i remember you very well indeed sir  let me have a whisper in your ear  he took him aside and talked very earnestly with him in french for a quarter of an hour gesticulating with his hands and explaining something while the major nodded his old grizzled head from time to time  at last they seemed to come to some agreement and i heard the major say parole ahonneur several times and afterwards fortune de la guerre which i could very well understand for they gave you a fine upbringing at birtwhistles  but after that i always noticed that the major never used the same free fashion of speech that we did towards our lodger but bowed when he addressed him and treated him with a wonderful deal of respect  i asked the major more than once what he knew about him but he always put it off and i could get no answer out of him  jim horscroft was at home all that summer but late in the autumn he went back to edinburgh again for the winter session and as he intended to work very hard and get his degree next spring if he could he said that he would bide up there for the christmas  so there was a great leavetaking between him and cousin edie and he was to put up his plate and to marry her as soon as he had the right to practise  i never knew a man love a woman more fondly than he did her and she liked him well enough in a wayfor indeed in the whole of scotland she would not find a finer looking manbut when it came to marriage i think she winced a little at the thought that all her wonderful dreams should end in nothing more than in being the wife of a country surgeon  still there was only me and jim to choose out of and she took the best of us  of course there was de lapp also but we always felt that he was of an altogether different class to us and so he didnt count  i was never very sure at that time whether edie cared for him or not  when jim was at home they took little notice of each other  after he was gone they were thrown more together which was natural enough as he had taken up so much of her time before  once or twice she spoke to me about de lapp as though she did not like him and yet she was uneasy if he were not in in the evening and there was no one so fond of his talk or with so many questions to ask him as she  she made him describe what queens wore and what sort of carpets they walked on and whether they had hairpins in their hair and how many feathers they had in their hats until it was a wonder to me how he could find an answer to it all and yet an answer he always had and was so ready and quick with his tongue and so anxious to amuse her that i wondered how it was that she did not like him better  well the summer and the autumn and the best part of the winter passed away and we were still all very happy together  we got well into the year 1815 and the great emperor was still eating his heart out at elba and all the ambassadors were wrangling together at vienna as to what they should do with the lions skin now that they had so fairly hunted him down  and we in our little corner of europe went on with our petty peaceful business looking after the sheep attending the berwick cattle fairs and chatting at night round the blazing peat fire  we never thought that what all these high and mighty people were doing could have any bearing upon us and as to war why everybody was agreed that the great shadow was lifted from us for ever and that unless the allies quarrelled among themselves there would not be a shot fired in europe for another fifty years  there was one incident however that stands out very clearly in my memory  i think that it must have happened about the february of this year and i will tell it to you before i go any further  you know what the border peel castles are like i have no doubt they were just square heaps built every here and there along the line so that the folk might have some place of protection against raiders and mosstroopers  when percy and his men were over the marches then the people would drive some of their cattle into the yard of the tower shut up the big gate and light a fire in the brazier at the top which would be answered by all the other peel towers until the lights would go twinkling up to the lammermuir hills and so carry the news on to the pentlands and to edinburgh  but now of course all these old keeps were warped and crumbling and made fine nesting places for the wild birds  many a good egg have i had for my collection out of the corriemuir peel tower  one day i had been a very long walk away over to leave a message at the laidlaw armstrongs who live two miles on this side of ayton about five oclock just before the sun set i found myself on the brae path with the gable end of west inch peeping up in front of me and the old peel tower lying on my left  i turned my eyes on the keep for it looked so fine with the flush of the level sun beating full upon it and the blue sea stretching out behind and as i stared i suddenly saw the face of a man twinkle for a moment in one of the holes in the wall  well i stood and wondered over this for what could anybody be doing in such a place now that it was too early for the nesting season  it was so queer that i was determined to come to the bottom of it so tired as i was i turned my shoulder on home and walked swiftly towards the tower  the grass stretches right up to the very base of the wall and my feet made little noise until i reached the crumbling arch where the old gate used to be  i peeped through and there was bonaventure de lapp standing inside the keep and peeping out through the very hole at which i had seen his face  he was turned half away from me and it was clear that he had not seen me at all for he was staring with all his eyes over in the direction of west inch  as i advanced my foot rattled the rubble that lay in the gateway and he turned round with a start and faced me  he was not a man whom you could put out of countenance and his face changed no more than if he had been expecting me there for a twelvemonth but there was something in his eyes which let me know that he would have paid a good price to have me back on the brae path again  hullo said i what are you doing here  i may ask you that said he  i came up because i saw your face at the window  and i because as you may well have observed i have very much interest for all that has to do with the military and of course castles are among them  you will excuse me for one moment my dear jack  and he stepped out suddenly through the hole in the wall so as to be out of my sight  but i was very much too curious to excuse him so easily  i shifted my ground swiftly to see what it was that he was after  he was standing outside and waving his hand frantically as in a signal  what are you doing i cried and then running out to his side i looked across the moors to see whom he was beckoning to  you go too far sir said he angrily i didnt thought you would have gone so far  a gentleman has the freedom to act as he choose without your being the spy upon him  if we are to be friends you must not interfere in my affairs  i dont like these secret doings said i and my father would not like them either  your father can speak for himself and there is no secret said he curtly  it is you with your imaginings that make a secret  ta ta ta i have no patience with such foolishness  and without as much as a nod he turned his back upon me and started walking swiftly to west inch  well i followed him and in the worst of tempers for i had a feeling that there was some mischief in the wind and yet i could not for the life of me think what it all meant  again i found myself puzzling over the whole mystery of this mans coming and of his long residence among us  and whom could he have expected to meet at the peel tower  was the fellow a spy and was it some brother spy who came to speak with him there  but that was absurd  what could there be to spy about in berwickshire  and besides major elliott knew all about him and he would not show him such respect if there were anything amiss  i had just got as far as this in my thoughts when i heard a cheery hail and there was the major himself coming down the hill from his house with his big bulldog bounder held in leash  this dog was a savage creature and had caused more than one accident on the countryside but the major was very fond of it and would never go out without it though he kept it tied with a good thick thong of leather  well just as i was looking at the major waiting for him to come up he stumbled with his lame leg over a branch of gorse and in recovering himself he let go his hold of the leash and in an instant there was the beast of a dog flying down the hillside in my direction  i did not like it i can tell you for there was neither stick nor stone about and i knew that the brute was dangerous  the major was shrieking to it from behind and i think that the creature thought that he was hallooing it on so furiously did it rush  but i knew its name and i thought that maybe that might give me the privileges of acquaintanceship so as it came at me with bristling hair and its nose screwed back between its two red eyes i cried out bounder bounder at the pitch of my lungs  it had its effect for the beast passed me with a snarl and flew along the path on the traces of bonaventure de lapp  he turned at the shouting and seemed to take in the whole thing at a glance but he strolled along as slowly as ever  my heart was in my mouth for him for the dog had never seen him before and i ran as fast as my feet would carry me to drag it away from him  but somehow as it bounded up and saw the twittering finger and thumb which de lapp held out behind him its fury died suddenly away and we saw it wagging its thumb of a tail and clawing at his knee  your dog then major said he as its owner came hobbling up  ah it is a fine beasta fine pretty thing  the major was blowing hard for he had covered the ground nearly as fast as i  i was afraid lest he might have hurt you he panted  ta ta ta cried de lapp  he is a pretty gentle thing i always love the dogs  but i am glad that i have met you major for here is this young gentleman to whom i owe very much who has begun to think that i am a spy  is it not so jack  i was so taken aback by his words that i could not lay my tongue to an answer but coloured up and looked askance like the awkward country lad that i was  you know me major said de lapp and i am sure that you will tell him that this could not be  no no jack  certainly not certainly not cried the major  thank you said de lapp  you know me and you do me justice  and yourself i hope that your knee is better and that you will soon have your regiment given you  i am well enough answered the major but they will never give me a place unless there is war and there will be no more war in my time  oh you think that said de lapp with a smile   well nous verrons  we shall see my friend  he whisked off his hat and turning briskly he walked off in the direction of west inch  the major stood looking after him with thoughtful eyes and then asked me what it was that had made me think that he was a spy  when i told him he said nothing but he shook his head and looked like a man who was ill at ease in his mind    chapter viii  the coming of the cutter  i never felt quite the same to our lodger after that little business at the peel castle  it was always in my mind that he was holding a secret from meindeed that he was all a secret together seeing that he always hung a veil over his past  and when by chance that veil was for an instant whisked away we always caught just a glimpse of something bloody and violent and dreadful upon the other side  the very  look of his body was terrible  i bathed with him once in the summer and i saw then that he was haggled with wounds all over  besides seven or eight scars and slashes his ribs on one side were all twisted out of shape and a part of one of his calves had been torn away  he laughed in his merry way when he saw my face of wonder  cossacks cossacks said he running his hand over his scars and the ribs were broke by an artillery tumbril  it is very bad to have the guns pass over one  now with cavalry it is nothing  a horse will pick its steps however fast it may go  i have been ridden over by fifteen hundred cuirassiers a and by the russian hussars of grodno and i had no harm from that  but guns are very bad  and the calf i asked  pouf it is only a wolf bite said he  you would not think how i came by it  you will understand that my horse and i had been struck the horse killed and i with my ribs broken by the tumbril  well it was coldoh bitter bitterthe ground like iron and no one to help the wounded so that they froze into such shapes as would make you smile  i too felt that i was freezing so what did i do  i took my sword and i opened my dead horse so well as i could and i made space in him for me to lie with one little hole for my mouth  sapristi it was warm enough there  but there was not room for the entire of me so my feet and part of my legs stuck out  then in the night when i slept there came the wolves to eat the horse and they had a little pinch of me also as you can see but after that i was on guard with my pistols and they had no more of me  there i lived very warm and nice for ten days  ten days i cried  what did you eat  why i ate the horse  it was what you call board and lodging to me but of course i have sense to eat the legs and live in the body  there were many dead about who had all their water bottles so i had all i could wish  and on the eleventh day there came a patrol of light cavalry and all was well  it was by such chance chats as thesehardly worth repeating in themselvesthat there came light upon himself and his past  but the day was coming when we should know all and how it came i shall try now to tell you  the winter had been a dreary one but with march came the first signs of spring and for a week on end we had sunshine and winds from the south on the 7th jim horscroft was to come back from edinburgh for though the session ended with the 1st his examination would take him a week edie and i were out walking on the sea beach on the 6th and i could talk of nothing but my old friendfor indeed he was the only friend of my own age that i had at that time  edie was very silent which was a rare thing with her but she listened smiling to all that i had to say  poor old jim said she once or twice under her breath  poor old jim  and if he has passed said i why then of course he will put up his plate and have his own house and we shall be losing our edie  i tried to make a jest of it and to speak lightly but the words still stuck in my throat  poor old jim said she again and there were tears in her eyes as she said it  and poor old jock she added slipping her hand into mine as we walked  you cared for me a little bit once also didnt you jock oh is not that a sweet little ship out yonder  it was a dainty cutter of about thirty tons very swift by the rake of her masts and the lines of her bow  she was coming up from the south under jib foresail and mainsail but even as we watched her all her white canvas shut suddenly in like a kittiwake closing her wings and we saw the splash of her anchor just under her bowsprit  she may have been rather less than a quarter of a mile from the shoreso near that i could see a tall man with a peaked cap who stood at the quarter with a telescope to his eye sweeping it backwards and forwards along the coast  what can they want here asked edie  they are rich english from london said i for that was how we explained everything that was above our comprehension in the border counties  we stood for the best part of an hour watching the bonny craft and then as the sun was lying low on a cloudbank and there was a nip in the evening air we turned back to west inch  as you come to the farmhouse from the front you pass up a garden with little enough in it which leads out by a wicketgate to the road the same gate at which we stood on the night when the beacons were lit the night that we saw walter scott ride past on his way to edinburgh on the right of this gate on the garden side was a bit of a rockery which was said to have been made by my fathers mother many years before  she had fashioned it out of waterworn stones and sea shells with mosses and ferns in the chinks  well as we came in through the gates my eyes fell upon this stone heap and there was a letter stuck in a cleft stick upon the top of it  i took a step forward to see what it was but edie sprang in front of me and plucking it off she thrust it into her pocket  thats for me said she laughing  but i stood looking at her with a face which drove the laugh from her lips  who is it from edie i asked  she pouted but made no answer  who is it from woman i cried  is it possible that you have been as false to jim as you were to me  how rude you are jock she cried  i do wish that you would mind your own business  there is only one person that it could be from i cried  it is from this man de lapp  and suppose that you are right jock  the coolness of the woman amazed and enraged me  you confess it i cried  have you then no shame left  why should i not receive letters from this gentleman  because it is infamous  and why  because he is a stranger  on the contrary said she he is my husband    chapter ix   the doings at west inch  i can remember that moment so well  i have heard from others that a great sudden blow has dulled their senses  it was not so with me on the contrary i saw and heard and thought more clearly than i had ever done before  i can remember that my eyes caught a little knob of marble as broad as my palm which was imbedded in one of the grey stones of the rockery and i found time to admire its delicate mottling and yet the look upon my face must have been strange for cousin edie screamed and leaving me she ran off to the house  i followed her and tapped at the window of her room for i could see that she was there  go away jock go away she cried  you are going to scold me i wont be scolded  i wont open the window  go away  but i continued to tap  i must have a word with you  what is it then she cried raising the sash about three inches the moment you begin to scold i shall close it  are you really married edie  yes i am married  who married you  father brennan at the roman catholic chapel at berwick  and you a presbyterian  he wished it to be in a catholic church  when was it  on wednesday week  i remembered then that on that day she had driven over to berwick while de lapp had been away on a long walk as he said among the hills  what about jim i asked  oh jim will forgive me  you will break his heart and ruin his life  no no he will forgive me  he will murder de lapp  oh edie how could you bring such disgrace and misery upon us  ah now you are scolding she cried and down came the window  i waited some little time and tapped for i had much still to ask her but she would return no answer and i thought that i could hear her sobbing  at last i gave it up and i was about to go into the house for it was nearly dark now when i heard the click of the garden gate it was de lapp himself  but as he came up the path he seemed to me to be either mad or drunk he danced as he walked cracked his fingers in the air and his eyes blazed like two willothewisps  voltigeurs he shouted voltigeurs de la garde just as he had done when he was off his head and then suddenly en avant en avant and up he came waving his walkingcane over his head  he stopped short when he saw me looking at him and i daresay he felt a bit ashamed of himself  hola jock he cried  i didnt thought anybody was there  i am in what you call the high spirits tonight  so it seems said i in my blunt fashion  you may not feel so merry when my friend jim horscroft comes back tomorrow  ah he comes back tomorrow does he  and why should i not feel merry  because if i know the man he will kill you  ta ta ta cried de lapp  i see that you know of our marriage edie has told you  jim may do what he likes  you have given us a nice return for having taken you in  my good fellow said he i have as you say given you a very nice return  i have taken edie from a life which is unworthy of her and i have connected you by marriage with a noble family  however i have some letters which i must write tonight and the rest we can talk over tomorrow when your friend jim is here to help us  he stepped towards the door  and this was whom you were awaiting at the peel tower i cried seeing light suddenly  why jock you are becoming quite sharp said he in a mocking tone and an instant later i heard the door of his room close and the key turn in the lock  i thought that i should see him no more that night but a few minutes later he came into the kitchen where i was sitting with the old folk  madame said he bowing down with his hand over his heart in his own queer fashion i have met with much kindness in your hands and it shall always be in my heart  i didnt thought i could have been so happy in the quiet country as you have made me  you will accept this small souvenir and you also sir you will take this little gift which i have the honour to make to you  he put two little paper packets down upon the table at their elbows and then with three more bows to my mother he walked from the room  her present was a brooch with a green stone set in the middle and a dozen little shining white ones all round it  we had never seen such things before and did not know how to set a name to them but they told us afterwards at berwick that the big one was an emerald and the others were diamonds and that they were worth much more than all the lambs we had that spring  my dear old mother has been gone now this many a year but that bonny brooch sparkles at the neck of my eldest daughter when she goes out into company and i never look at it that i do not see the keen eyes and the long thin nose and the cats whiskers of our lodger at west inch  as to my father he had a fine gold watch with a double case and a proud man was he as he sat with it in the palm of his hand his ear stooping to hearken to the tick  i do not know which was best pleased and they would talk of nothing but what de lapp had given them  hes given you something more said i at last  what then jock asked father  a husband for cousin edie said i  they thought i was daffing when i said that but when they came to understand that it was the real truth they were as proud and as pleased as if i had told them that she had married the laird  indeed poor jim with his hard drinking and his fighting had not a very bright name on the countryside and my mother had often said that no good could come of such a match  now de lapp was for all we knew steady and quiet and welltodo  and as to the secrecy of it secret marriages were very common in scotland at that time when only a few words were needed to make man and wife so nobody thought much of that  the old folk were as pleased then as if their rent had been lowered but i was still sore at heart for it seemed to me that my friend had been cruelly dealt with and i knew well that he was not a man who would easily put up with it    chapter x   the return of the shadow  i woke with a heavy heart the next morning for i knew that jim would be home before long and that it would be a day of trouble  but how much trouble that day was to bring or how far it would alter the lives of us was more than i had ever thought in my darkest moments  but let me tell you it all just in the order that it happened  i had to get up early that morning for it was just the first flush of the lambing and my father and i were out on the moors as soon as it was fairly light  as i came out into the passage a wind struck upon my face and there was the house door wide open and the grey light drawing another door upon the inner wall  and when i looked again there was edies room open also and de lapps too and i saw in a flash what that giving of presents meant upon the evening before  it was a leavetaking and they were gone  my heart was bitter against cousin edie as i stood looking into her room  to think that for the sake of a newcomer she could leave us all without one kindly word or as much as a handshake  and he too i had been afraid of what would happen when jim met him but now there seemed to be something cowardly in this avoidance of him  i was angry and hurt and sore and i went out into the open without a word to my father and climbed up on to the moors to cool my flushed face  when i got up to corriemuir i caught my last glimpse of cousin edie the little cutter still lay where she had anchored but a rowboat was pulling out to her from the shore  in the stern i saw a flutter of red and i knew that it came from her shawl  i watched the boat reach the yacht and the folk climb on to her deck  then the anchor came up the white wings spread once more and away she dipped right out to sea i still saw that little red spot on the deck and de lapp standing beside her  they could see me also for i was outlined against the sky and they both waved their hands for a long time but gave it up at last when they found that i would give them no answer  i stood with my arms folded feeling as glum as ever i did in my life until their cutter was only a square hickering patch of white among the mists of the morning  it was breakfast time and the porridge upon the table before i got back but i had no heart for the food  the old folk had taken the matter coolly enough though my mother had no word too hard for edie for the two had never had much love for each other and less of late than ever  theres a letter here from him said my father pointing to a note folded up on the table it was in his room  maybe you would read it to us  they had not even opened it for truth to tell neither of the good folk were very clever at reading ink though they could do well with a fine large print  it was addressed in big letters to the good people of west inch and this was the note which lies before me all stained and faded as i write     my friends     i didnt thought to have left you so suddenly but the matter was     in other hands than mine  duty and honour have called me back to my     old comrades  this you will doubtless understand before many days     are past  i take your edie with me as my wife and it may be that     in some more peaceful time you will see us again at west inch     meanwhile accept the assurance of my affection and believe me that     i shall never forget the quiet months which i spent with you at the     time when my life would have been worth a week at the utmost had i     been taken by the allies  but the reason of this you may also learn     some day         yours        bonaventure de lissac        colonel des voltigeurs de la garde et        aidedecamp de smi  lempereur napoleon  i whistled when i came to those words written under his name for though i had long made up my mind that our lodger could be none other than one of those wonderful soldiers of whom we had heard so much who had forced their way into every capital of europe save only our own still i had little thought that our roof covered napoleons own aidedecamp and a colonel of his guard  so said i de lissac is his name and not de lapp  well colonel or no it is as well for him that he got away from here before jim laid hands upon him  and time enough too i added peeping out at the kitchen window for here is the man himself coming through the garden  i ran to the door to meet him feeling that i would have given a deal to have him back in edinburgh again  he came running waving a paper over his head and i thought that maybe he had a note from edie and that it was all known to him  but as he came up i saw that it was a big stiff yellow paper which crackled as he waved it and that his eyes were dancing with happiness  hurrah jock he shouted  where is edie  where is edie  what is it man i asked  where is edie  what have you there  its my diploma jock  i can practise when i like  its all right i want to show it to edie  the best you can do is to forget all about edie said i  never have i seen a mans face change as his did when i said those words  what  what dye mean jock calder he stammered  he let go his hold of the precious diploma as he spoke and away it went over the hedge and across the moor where it stuck flapping on a whinbush but he never so much as glanced at it  his eyes were bent upon me and i saw the devils spark glimmer up in the depths of them  she is not worthy of you said i  he gripped me by the shoulder  what have you done he whispered  this is some of your hankypanky  where is she  shes off with that frenchman who lodged here  i had been casting about in my mind how i could break it gently to him but i was always backward in speech and i could think of nothing better than this  oh said he and stood nodding his head and looking at me though i knew very well that he could neither see me nor the steading nor anything else  so he stood for a minute or more with his hands clenched and his head still nodding  then he gave a gulp in his throat and spoke in a queer dry rasping voice  when was this said he  this morning  were they married  yes  he put his hand against the doorpost to steady himself  any message for me  she said that you would forgive her  may god blast my soul on the day i do  where have they gone to  to france i should judge  his name was de lapp i think  his real name is de lissac and he is no less than a colonel in boneys guards  ah he would be in paris likely  that is well  that is well  hold up i shouted  father  father  bring the brandy  his knees had given way for an instant but he was himself again before the old man came running with the bottle  take it away said he  have a soop mister horscroft cried my father pressing it upon him it will give you fresh heart  he caught hold of the bottle and sent it flying over the garden hedge  its very good for those who wish to forget said he i am going to remember  may god forgive you for sinfu waste cried my father aloud  and for wellnigh braining an officer of his majestys infantry said old major elliott putting his head over the hedge  i could have done with a nip after a mornings walk but it is something new to have a whole bottle whizz past my ear  but what is amiss that you all stand round like mutes at a burying  in a few words i told him our trouble while jim with a grey face and his brows drawn down stood leaning against the doorpost  the major was as glum as we by the time i had finished for he was fond both of jim and of edie  tut tut said he  i feared something of the kind ever since that business of the peel tower  its the way with the french  they cant leave the women alone  but at least de lissac has married her and thats a comfort  but its no time now to think of our own little troubles with all europe in a roar again and another twenty years war before us as like as not  what dye mean i asked  why man napoleons back from elba his troops have flocked to him and louis has run for his life  the news was in berwick this morning  great lord cried my father  then the weary business is all to do over again  aye we thought we were out from the shadow but its still there wellington is ordered from vienna to the low countries and it is thought that the emperor will break out first on that side  well its a bad wind that blows nobody any good  ive just had news that i am to join the 71st as senior major  i shook hands with our good neighbour on this for i knew how it had lain upon his mind that he should be a cripple with no part to play in the world  i am to join my regiment as soon as i can and we shall be over yonder in a month and in paris maybe before another one is over  by the lord then im with you major cried jim horscroft  im not too proud to carry a musket if you will put me in front of this frenchman  my lad id be proud to have you serve under me said the major  and as to de lissac where the emperor is he will be  you know the man said i  what can you tell us of him  there is no better officer in the french army and that is a big word to say  they say that he would have been a marshal but he preferred to stay at the emperors elbow  i met him two days before corunna when i was sent with a flag to speak about our wounded  he was with soult then  i knew him again when i saw him  and i will know him again when i see him said horscroft with the old dour look on his face  and then at that instant as i stood there it was suddenly driven home to me how poor and purposeless a life i should lead while this crippled friend of ours and the companion of my boyhood were away in the forefront of the storm  quick as a flash my resolution was taken  ill come with you too major i cried  jock jock said my father wringing his hands  jim said nothing but put his arm half round me and hugged me the majors eyes shone and he flourished his cane in the air  my word but i shall have two good recruits at my heels said he well theres no time to be lost so you must both be ready for the evening coach  and this was what a single day brought about and yet years pass away so often without a change  just think of the alteration in that fourandtwenty hours  de lissac was gone  edie was gone  napoleon had escaped  war had broken out  jim horscroft had lost everything and he and i were setting out to fight against the french  it was all like a dream until i tramped off to the coach that evening and looked back at the grey farm steading and at the two little dark figures my mother with her face sunk in her shetland shawl and my father waving his drovers stick to hearten me upon my way    chapter xi   the gathering of the nations  and now i come to a bit of my story that clean takes my breath away as i think of it and makes me wish that i had never taken the job of telling it in hand  for when i write i like things to come slow and orderly and in their turn like sheep coming out of a paddock  so it was at west inch  but now that we were drawn into a larger life like wee bits of straw that float slowly down some lazy ditch until they suddenly find themselves in the dash and swirl of a great river then it is very hard for me with my simple words to keep pace with it all  but you can find the cause and reason of everything in the books about history and so i shall just leave that alone and talk about what i saw with my own eyes and heard with my own ears  the regiment to which our friend had been appointed was the 71st highland light infantry which wore the red coat and the trews and had its depot in glasgow town  there we went all three by coach the major in great spirits and full of stories about the duke and the peninsula while jim sat in the corner with his lips set and his arms folded and i knew that he killed de lissac three times an hour in his heart  i could tell it by the sudden glint of his eyes and grip of his hand  as to me i did not know whether to be glad or sorry for home is home and it is a weary thing however you may brazen it out to feel that half scotland is between you and your mother  we were in glasgow next day and the major took us down to the depot where a soldier with three stripes on his arm and a fistful of ribbons from his cap showed every tooth he had in his head at the sight of jim and walked three times round him to have the view of him as if he had been carlisle castle  then he came over to me and punched me in the ribs and felt my muscle and was nigh as pleased as with jim  these are the sort major these are the sort he kept saying with a thousand of these we could stand up to boneys best  how do they run asked the major  a poor show said he but they may lick into shape  the best men have been drafted to america and we are full of militiamen and recruities  tut tut said the major  well have old soldiers and good ones against us  come to me if you need any help you two  and so with a nod he left us and we began to understand that a major who is your officer is a very different person from a major who happens to be your neighbour in the country  well well why should i trouble you with these things  i could wear out a good quillpen just writing about what we did jim and i at the depot in glasgow and how we came to know our officers and our comrades and how they came to know us  soon came the news that the folk of vienna who had been cutting up europe as if it had been a jigget of mutton had flown back each to his own country and that every man and horse in their armies had their faces towards france  we heard of great reviews and musterings in paris too and then that wellington was in the low countries and that on us and on the prussians would fall the first blow  the government was shipping men over to him as fast as they could and every port along the east coast was choked with guns and horses and stores  on the third of june we had our marching orders also and on the same night we took ship from leith reaching ostend the night after  it was my first sight of a foreign land and indeed most of my comrades were the same for we were very young in the ranks  i can see the blue waters now and the curling surf line and the long yellow beach and queer windmills twisting and turninga thing that a man would not see from one end of scotland to the other  it was a clean wellkept town but the folk were undersized and there was neither ale nor oatmeal cakes to be bought amongst them  from there we went on to a place called bruges and from there to ghent where we picked up with the 52nd and the 95th which were the two regiments that we were brigaded with  its a wonderful place for churches and stonework is ghent and indeed of all the towns we were in there was scarce one but had a finer kirk than any in glasgow from there we pushed on to ath which is a little village on a river or a burn rather called the dender  there we were quarteredin tents mostly for it was fine sunny weatherand the whole brigade set to work at its drill from morning till evening  general adams was our chief and reynell was our colonel and they were both fine old soldiers but what put heart into us most was to think that we were under the duke for his name was like a bugle call  he was at brussels with the bulk of the army but we knew that we should see him quick enough if he were needed  i had never seen so many english together and indeed i had a kind of contempt for them as folk always have if they live near a border but the two regiments that were with us now were as good comrades as could be wished  the 52nd had a thousand men in the ranks and there were many old soldiers of the peninsula among them  they came from oxfordshire for the most part  the 95th were a rifle regiment and had dark green coats instead of red  it was strange to see them loading for they would put the ball into a greasy rag and then hammer it down with a mallet but they could fire both further and straighter than we all that part of belgium was covered with british troops at that time for the guards were over near enghien and there were cavalry regiments on the further side of us  you see it was very necessary that wellington should spread out all his force for boney was behind the screen of his fortresses and of course we had no means of saying on what side he might pop out except that he was pretty sure to come the way that we least expected him  on the one side he might get between us and the sea and so cut us off from england and on the other he might shove in between the prussians and ourselves  but the duke was as clever as he for he had his horse and his light troops all round him like a great spiders web so that the moment a french foot stepped across the border he could close up all his men at the right place  for myself i was very happy at ath and i found the folk very kindly and homely  there was a farmer of the name of bois in whose fields we were quartered and who was a real good friend to many of us  we built him a wooden barn among us in our spare time and many a time i and jeb seaton my rearrank man have hung out his washing for the smell of the wet linen seemed to take us both straight home as nothing else could do  i have often wondered whether that good man and his wife are still living though i think it hardly likely for they were of a hale middleage at the time  jim would come with us too sometimes and would sit with us smoking in the big flemish kitchen but he was a different jim now to the old one  he had always had a hard touch in him but now his trouble seemed to have turned him to flint and i never saw a smile upon his face and seldom heard a word from his lips his whole mind was set on revenging himself upon de lissac for having taken edie from him and he would sit for hours with his chin upon his hands glaring and frowning all wrapped in the one idea  this made him a bit of a butt among the men at first and they laughed at him for it but when they came to know him better they found that he was not a good man to laugh at and then they dropped it  we were early risers at that time and the whole brigade was usually under arms at the flush of dawn  one morningit was the sixteenth of junewe had just formed up and general adams had ridden up to give some order to colonel reynell within a musketlength of where i stood when suddenly they both stood staring along the brussels road  none of us dared move our heads but every eye in the regiment whisked round and there we saw an officer with the cockade of a generals aidedecamp thundering down the road as hard as a great dapplegrey horse could carry him  he bent his face over its mane and flogged at its neck with the slack of the bridle as though he rode for very life  hullo reynell says the general  this begins to look like business what do you make of it  they both cantered their horses forward and adams tore open the dispatch which the messenger handed to him  the wrapper had not touched the ground before he turned waving the letter over his head as if it had been a sabre  dismiss he cried  general parade and march in halfanhour  then in an instant all was buzz and bustle and the news on every lip napoleon had crossed the frontier the day before had pushed the prussians before him and was already deep in the country to the east of us with a hundred and fifty thousand men  away we scuttled to gather our things together and have our breakfast and in an hour we had marched off and left ath and the dender behind us for ever  there was good need for haste for the prussians had sent no news to wellington of what was doing and though he had rushed from brussels at the first whisper of it like a good old mastiff from its kennel it was hard to see how he could come up in time to help the prussians  it was a bright warm morning and  as the brigade tramped down the broad belgian road the dust rolled up from it like the smoke of a battery i tell you that we blessed the man that planted the poplars along the sides for their shadow was better than drink to us  over across the fields both to the right and the left were other roads one quite close and the other a mile or more from us  a column of infantry was marching down the near one and it was a fair race between us for we were each walking for all we were worth  there was such a wreath of dust round them that we could only see the gunbarrels and the bearskins breaking out here and there with the head and shoulders of a mounted officer coming out above the cloud and the flutter of the colours it was a brigade of the guards but we could not tell which for we had two of them with us in the campaign  on the far road there was also dust and to spare but through it there flashed every now and then a long twinkle of brightness like a hundred silver beads threaded in a line and the breeze brought down such a snarling clanging clashing kind of music as i had never listened to  if i had been left to myself it would have been long before i knew what it was but our corporals and sergeants were all old soldiers and i had one trudging along with his halbert at my elbow who was full of precept and advice  thats heavy horse said he  you see that double twinkle that means they have helmet as well as cuirass  its the royals or the enniskillens or the household  you can hear their cymbals and kettles the french heavies are too good for us  they have ten to our one and good men too  youve got to shoot at their faces or else at their horses  mind you that when you see them coming or else youll find a fourfoot sword stuck through your liver to teach you better  hark hark  hark theres the  old music again  and as he spoke there came the low grumbling of a cannonade away somewhere to the east of us deep and hoarse like the roar of some blooddaubed beast that thrives on the lives of men  at the same instant there was a shouting of heh  heh  heh from behind and somebody roared let the guns get through looking back i saw the rear companies split suddenly in two and hurl themselves down on either side into the ditch while six creamcoloured horses galloping two and two with their bellies to the ground came thundering through the gap with a fine twelvepound gun whirling and creaking behind them behind were another and another fourandtwenty in all flying past us with such a din and clatter the bluecoated men clinging on to the gun and the tumbrils the drivers cursing and cracking their whips the manes flying the mops and buckets clanking and the whole air filled with the heavy rumble and the jingling of chains  there was a roar from the ditches and a shout from the gunners and we saw a rolling grey cloud before us with a score of busbies breaking through the shadow then we closed up again while the growling ahead of us grew louder and deeper than ever  theres three batteries there said the sergeant  theres bulls and webber smiths but the other is new  theres some more on ahead of us for here is the track of a ninepounder and the others were all twelves  choose a twelve if you want to get hit for a nine mashes you up but a twelve snaps you like a carrot  and then he went on to tell about the dreadful wounds that he had seen until my blood ran like iced water in my veins and you might have rubbed all our faces in pipeclay and we should have been no whiter  aye youll look sicklier yet when you get a hatful of grape into your tripes said he  and then as i saw some of the old soldiers laughing i began to understand that this man was trying to frighten us so i began to laugh also and the others as well but it was not a very hearty laugh either  the sun was almost above us when we stopped at a little place called hal where there is an old pump from which i drew and drank a shako full of waterand never did a mug of scotch ale taste as sweet more guns passed us  here and vivians hussars three regiments of them smart men with bonny brown horses a treat to the eye  the noise of the cannons was louder than ever now and it tingled through my nerves just as it had done years before when with edie by my side i had seen the merchantship fight with the privateers  it was so loud now that it seemed to me that the battle must be going on just beyond the nearest wood but my friend the sergeant knew better  its twelve to fifteen mile off said he  you may be sure the general knows we are not wanted or we should  not be resting here at hal  what he said proved to be true for a minute later down came the colonel with orders that we should pile arms and bivouac where we were and there we stayed all day while horse and foot and guns english dutch and hanoverians were streaming through  the devils music went on till evening sometimes rising into a roar sometimes sinking into a grumble until about eight oclock in the evening it stopped altogether  we were eating our hearts out as you may think to know what it all meant but we knew that what the duke did would be for the best so we just waited in patience  next day the brigade remained at hal in the morning but about midday came an orderly from the duke and we pushed on once more until we came to a little village called braine something and there we stopped and time too for a sudden thunderstorm broke over us and a plump of rain that turned all the roads and the fields into bog and mire  we got into the barns at this village for shelter and there we found two stragglersone from a kilted regiment and the other a man of the german legion who had a tale to tell that was as dreary as the weather  boney had thrashed the prussians the day before and our fellows had been sore put to it to hold their own against ney but had beaten him off at last  it seems an old stale story to you now but you cannot think how we scrambled round those two men in the barn and pushed and fought just to catch a word of what they said and how those who had heard were in turn mobbed by those who had not  we laughed and cheered and groaned all in turn as we heard how the 44th had received cavalry in line how the dutchbelgians had fled and how the black watch had taken the lancers into their square and then had killed them at their leisure  but the lancers had had the laugh on their side when they crumpled up the 69th and carried off one of the colours  to wind it all up the duke was in retreat in order to keep in touch with the prussians and it was rumoured that he would take up his ground and fight a big battle just at the very place where we had been halted  and soon we saw that this rumour was true for the weather cleared towards evening and we were all out on the ridge to see what we could see  it was such a bonny stretch of corn and grazing land with the crops just half green and half yellow and fine rye as high as a mans shoulder  a scene more full of peace you could not think of and look where you would over the low curving corncovered hills you could see the little village steeples pricking up their spires among the poplars but slashed right across this pretty picture was a long trail of marching mensome red some green some blue some blackzigzagging over the plain and choking the roads one end so close that we could shout to them as they stacked their muskets on the ridge at our left and the other end lost among the woods as far as we could see  and then on other roads we saw the teams of horses toiling and the dull gleam of the guns and the men straining and swaying as they helped to turn the spokes in the deep deep mud  as we stood there regiment after regiment and brigade after brigade took position on the ridge and ere the sun had set we lay in a line of over sixty thousand men blocking napoleons way to brussels  but the rain had come swishing down again and we of the 71st rushed off to our barn once more where we had better quarters than the greater part of our comrades who lay stretched in the mud with the storm beating upon them until the first peep of day    chapter xii   the shadow on the land  it was still drizzling in the morning with brown drifting clouds and a damp chilly wind  it was a queer thing for me as i opened my eyes to think that i should be in a battle that day though none of us ever thought it would be such a one as it proved to be  we were up and ready however with the first light and as we threw open the doors of our barn we heard the most lovely music that i had ever listened to playing somewhere in the distance  we all stood in clusters hearkening to it it was so sweet and innocent and sadlike  but our sergeant laughed when he saw how it pleased us all  them are the french bands said he and if you come out here youll see what some of you may not live to see again  out we went the beautiful music  still sounding in our ears and stood on a rise just outside the barn  down below at the bottom of the slope about half a musketshot from us was a snug tiled farm with a hedge and a bit of an apple orchard  all round it a line of men in red coats and high fur hats were working like bees knocking holes in the wall and barring up the doors  thems the light companies of the guards said the sergeant  theyll hold that farm while one of them can wag a finger  but look over yonder and youll see the camp fires of the  french  we looked across the valley at the low ridge upon the further side and saw a thousand little yellow points of flame with the dark smoke wreathing up in the heavy air  there was another farmhouse on the further side of the valley and as we looked we suddenly saw a little group of horsemen appear on a knoll beside it and stare across at us there were a dozen hussars behind and in front five men three with helmets one with a long straight red feather in his hat and the last with a low cap  by god cried the sergeant thats him  thats boney the one with the grey horse  aye ill lay a months pay on it  i strained my eyes to see him this man who had cast that great shadow over europe which darkened the nations for fiveandtwenty years and which had even fallen across our outoftheworld little sheepfarm and had dragged us allmyself edie and jimout of the lives that our folk had lived before us  as far as i could see he was a dumpy squareshouldered kind of man and he held his double glasses to his eyes with his elbows spread very wide out on each side  i was still staring when i heard the catch of a mans breath by my side and there was jim with his eyes glowing like two coals and his face thrust over my shoulder  thats he jock he whispered  yes thats boney said i  no no its he  this de lapp or de lissac or whatever his devils name is  it is he  then i saw him at once  it was the horseman with the high red feather in his hat  even at that distance i could have sworn to the slope of his shoulders and the way he carried his head  i clapped my hands upon jims sleeve for i could see that his blood was boiling at the sight of the man and that he was ready for any madness  but at that moment bonaparte seemed to lean over and say something to de lissac and the party wheeled and dashed away while there came the bang of a gun and a white spray of smoke from a battery along the ridge  at the same instant the assembly was blown in our village and we rushed for our arms and fell in  there was a burst of firing all along the line and we thought that the battle had begun  but it came really from our fellows cleaning their pieces for their priming was in some danger of being wet from the damp night  from where we stood it was a sight now that was worth coming over the seas to see  on our own ridge was the chequer of red and blue stretching right away to a village over two miles from us  it was whispered from man to man in the ranks however that there was too much of the blue and too little of the red for the belgians had shown on the day before that their hearts were too soft for the work and we had twenty thousand of them for comrades  then even our british troops were half made up of militiamen and recruits for the pick of the old peninsular regiments were on the ocean in transports coming back from some fools quarrel with our kinsfolk of america  but for all that we could see the bearskins of the guards two strong brigades of them and the bonnets of the highlanders and the blue of the old german legion and the red lines of packs brigade and kempts brigade and the green dotted riflemen in front and we knew that come what might these were men who would bide where they were placed and that they had a man to lead them who would place them where they should bide  of the french we had seen little save the twinkle of their fires and a few horsemen here and there upon the curves of the ridge but as we stood and waited there came suddenly a grand blare from their bands and their whole army came flooding over the low hill which had hid them brigade after brigade and division after division until the broad slope in its whole length and depth was blue with their uniforms and bright with the glint of their weapons  it seemed that they would never have done still pouring over and pouring over while our men leaned on their muskets and smoked their pipes looking down at this grand gathering and listening to what the old soldiers who had fought the french before had to say about them  then when the infantry had formed in long deep masses their guns came whirling and bounding down the slope and it was pretty to see how smartly they unlimbered and were ready for action and then at a stately trot down came the cavalry thirty regiments at the least with plume and breastplate twinkling sword and fluttering lance forming up at the flanks and rear in long shifting glimmering lines  thems the chaps cried our old sergeant  theyre gluttons to fight they are  and you see them regiments with the great high hats in the middle a bit behind the farm  thats the guard twenty thousand of them my sons and all picked mengreyheaded devils that have done nothing but fight since they were as high as my gaiters  theyve three men to our two and two guns to our one and by god theyll make you recruities wish you were back in argyle street before they have finished with you  he was not a cheering man our sergeant but then he had been in every fight since corunna and had a medal with seven clasps upon his breast so that he had a right to talk in his own fashion  when the frenchmen had all arranged themselves just out of cannonshot we saw a small group of horsemen all in a blaze with silver and scarlet and gold ride swiftly between the divisions and as they went a roar of cheering burst out from either side of them and we could see arms outstretched to them and hands waving  an instant later the noise had died away and the two armies stood facing each other in absolute deadly silencea sight which often comes back to me in my dreams  then of a sudden there was a lurch among the men just in front of us a thin column wheeled off from the dense blue clump and came swinging up towards the farmhouse which lay below us  it had not taken fifty paces before a gun banged out from an english battery on our left and the battle of waterloo had begun  it is not for me to try to tell you the story of that battle and indeed i should have kept far enough away from such a thing had it not happened that our own fates those of the three simple folk who came from the border country were all just as much mixed up in it as those of any king or emperor of them all  to tell the honest truth i have learned more about that battle from what i have read than from what i saw for how much could i see with a comrade on either side and a great white cloudbank at the very end of my firelock  it was from books and the talk of others that i learned how the heavy cavalry charged how they rode over the famous cuirassiers and how they were cut to pieces before they could get back  from them too i learned all about the successive assaults and how the belgians fled and how pack and kempt stood firm  but of my own knowledge i can only speak of what we saw during that long day in the rifts of the smoke and the lulls of the firing and it is just of that that i will tell you  we were on the right of the line and in reserve for the duke was afraid that boney might work round on that side and get at him from behind so our three regiments with another british brigade and the hanoverians were placed there to be ready for anything  there were two brigades of light cavalry too but the french attack was all from the front so it was late in the day before we were really wanted  the english battery which fired the first gun was still banging away on our left and a german one was hard at work upon our right so that we were wrapped round with the smoke but we were not so hidden as to screen us from a line of french guns opposite for a score of round shot came piping through the air and plumped right into the heart of us as i heard the scream of them past my ear my head went down like a diver but our sergeant gave me a prod in the back with the handle of his halbert  dont be so blasted polite said he when youre hit you can bow once and for all  there was one of those balls that knocked five men into a bloody mash and i saw it lying on the ground afterwards like a crimson football another went through the adjutants horse with a plop like a stone in the mud broke its back and left it lying like a burst gooseberry three more fell further to the right and by the stir and cries we could tell that they had all told  ah james youve lost a good mount says major reed just in front of me looking down at the adjutant whose boots and breeches were all running with blood  i gave a cool fifty for him in glasgow said the other  dont you think major that the men had better lie down now that the guns have got our range  tut said the other they are young james and it will do them good  theyll get enough of it before the days done grumbled the other but at that moment colonel reynell saw that the rifles and the 52nd were down on either side of us so we had the order to stretch ourselves out too  precious glad we were when we could hear the shot whining like hungry dogs within a few feet of our backs  even now a thud and a splash every minute or so with a yelp of pain and a drumming of boots upon the ground told us that we were still losing heavily  a thin rain was falling and the damp air held the smoke low so that we could only catch glimpses of what was doing just in front of us though the roar of the guns told us that the battle was general all along the lines  four hundred of them were all crashing at once now and the noise was enough to split the drum of your ear  indeed there was not one of us but had a singing in his head for many a long day afterwards just opposite us on the slope of the hill was a french gun and we could see the men serving her quite plainly  they were small active men with very tight breeches and high hats with great straight plumes sticking up from them but they worked like sheepshearers ramming and sponging and training  there were fourteen when i saw them first and only four left standing at the last but they were working away just as hard as ever  the farm that they called hougoumont was down in front of us and all the morning we could see that a terrible fight was going on there for the walls and the windows and the orchard hedges were all flame and smoke and there rose such shrieking and crying from it as i never heard before  it was half burned down and shattered with balls and ten thousand men were hammering at the gates but four hundred guardsmen held it in the morning and two hundred held it in the evening and no french foot was ever set within its threshold  but how they fought those frenchmen  their lives were no more to them than the mud under their feet  there was onei can see him nowa stoutish ruddy man on a crutch  he hobbled up alone in a lull of the firing to the side gate of hougoumont and he beat upon it screaming to his men to come after him for five minutes he stood there strolling about in front of the gunbarrels which spared him but at last a brunswick skirmisher in the orchard flicked out his brains with a rifle shot  and he was only one of many for all day when they did not come in masses they came in twos and threes with as brave a face as if the whole army were at their heels  so we lay all morning looking down at the fight at hougoumont but soon the duke saw that there was nothing to fear upon his right and so he began to use us in another way  the french had pushed their skirmishers past the farm and they lay among the young corn in front of us popping at the gunners so that three pieces out of six on our left were lying with their men strewed in the mud all round them  but the duke had his eyes everywhere and up he galloped at that momenta thin dark wiry man with very bright eyes a hooked nose and big cockade on his cap  there were a dozen officers at his heels all as merry as if it were a foxhunt but of the dozen there was not one left in the evening  warm work adams said he as he rode up  very warm your grace said our general  but we can outstay them at it i think  tut tut we cannot let skirmishers silence a battery  just drive those fellows out of that adams  then first i knew what a devils thrill runs through a man when he is given a bit of fighting to do  up to now we had just lain and been killed which is the weariest kind of work  now it was our turn and my word we were ready for it  up we jumped the whole brigade in a fourdeep line and rushed at the cornfield as hard as we could tear the skirmishers snapped at us as we came and then away they bolted like corncrakes their heads down their backs rounded and their muskets at the trail  half of them got away but we caught up the others the officer first for he was a very fat man who could not run fast it gave me quite a turn when i saw rob stewart on my right stick his bayonet into the mans broad back and heard him howl like a damned soul there was no quarter in that field and it was butt or point for all of them  the mens blood was aflame and little wonder for these wasps had been stinging all morning without our being able so much as to see them  and now as we broke through the further edge of the cornfield we got in front of the smoke and there was the whole french army in position before us with only two meadows and a narrow lane between us  we set up a yell as we saw them and away we should have gone slap at them if we had been left to ourselves for silly young soldiers never think that harm can come to them until it is there in their midst  but the duke had cantered his horse beside us as we advanced and now he roared something to the general and the officers all rode in front of our line holding out their arms for us to stop  there was a blowing of bugles a pushing and a shoving with the sergeants cursing and digging us with their halberts and in less time than it takes me to write it there was the brigade in three neat little squares all bristling with bayonets and in echelon as they call it so that each could fire across the face of the other  it was the saving of us as even so young a soldier as i was could very easily see and we had none too much time either  there was a low rolling hill on our right flank and from behind this there came a sound like nothing on this earth so much as the beat of the waves on the berwick coast when the wind blows from the east  the earth was all shaking with that dull roaring sound and the air was full of it  steady 71st for gods sake steady shrieked the voice of our colonel behind  us but in front was nothing but the green gentle slope of the grassland all mottled with daisies and dandelions  and then suddenly over the curve we saw eight hundred brass helmets rise up all in a moment each with a long tag of horsehair flying from its crest and then eight hundred fierce brown faces all pushed forward and glaring out from between the ears of as many horses  there was an instant of gleaming breastplates waving swords tossing manes fierce red nostrils opening and shutting and hoofs pawing the air before us and then down came the line of muskets and our bullets smacked up against their armour like the clatter of a hailstorm upon a window  i fired with the rest and then rammed down another charge as fast as i could staring out through the smoke in front of me where i could see some long thin thing which napped slowly backwards and forwards  a bugle sounded for us to cease firing and a whiff of wind came to clear the curtain from in front of us and then we could see what had happened  i had expected to see half that regiment of horse lying on the ground but whether it was that their breastplates had shielded them or whether being young and a little shaken at their coming we had fired high our volley had done no very great harm  about thirty horses lay about three of them together within ten yards of me the middle one right on its back with its four legs in the air and it was one of these that i had seen flapping through the smoke  then there were eight or ten dead men and about as many wounded sitting dazed on the grass for the most part though one was shouting vive lempereur at the top of his voice  another fellow who had been shot in the thigha great blackmoustached chap he was tooleaned his back against his dead horse and picking up his carbine fired as coolly as if he had been shooting for a prize and hit angus myres who was only two from me right through the forehead  then he out with his hand to get another carbine that lay near but before he could reach it big hodgson who was the pivot man of the grenadier company ran out and passed his bayonet through his throat which was a pity for he seemed to be a very fine man  at first i thought that the cuirassiers had run away in the smoke but they were not men who did that very easily  their horses had swerved at our volley and they had raced past our square and taken the fire of the two other ones beyond  then they broke through a hedge and coming on a regiment of hanoverians who were in line they treated them as they would have treated us if we had not been so quick and cut them to pieces in an instant  it was dreadful to see the big germans running and screaming while the cuirassiers stood up in their stirrups to have a better sweep for their long heavy swords and cut and stabbed without mercy  i do not believe that a hundred men of that regiment were left alive  and the frenchmen came back across our front shouting at us and waving their weapons which were crimson down to the hilts  this they did to draw our fire but the colonel was too old a soldier for we could have done little harm at the distance and they would have been among us before we could reload  these horsemen got behind the ridge on our right again and we knew very well that if we opened up from the squares they would be down upon us in a twinkle  on the other hand it was hard to bide as we were for they had passed the word to a battery of twelve guns which formed up a few hundred yards away from us but out of our sight sending their balls just over the brow and down into the midst of us which is called a plunging fire  and one of their gunners ran up on to the top of the slope and stuck a handspike into the wet earth to give them a guide under the very muzzles of the whole brigade none of whom fired a shot at him each leaving him to the other  ensign samson who was the youngest subaltern in the regiment ran out from the square and pulled down the handspike but quick as a jack after a minnow a lancer came flying over the ridge and he made such a thrust from behind that not only his point but his pennon too came out between the second and third buttons of the lads tunic  helen helen he shouted and fell dead on his face while the lancer blown half to pieces with musket balls toppled over beside him still holding on to his weapon so that they lay together with that dreadful bond still connecting them  but when the battery opened there was no time for us to think of anything else  a square is a very good way of meeting a horseman but there is no worse one of taking a cannon ball as we soon learned when they began to cut red seams through us until our ears were weary of the slosh and splash when hard iron met living flesh and blood  after ten minutes of it we moved our square a hundred paces to the right but we left another square behind us for a hundred and twenty men and seven officers showed where we had been standing  then the guns found us out again and we tried to open out into line but in an instant the horsemenlancers they were this timewere upon us from over the brae  i tell you we were glad to hear the thud of their hoofs for we knew that that must stop the cannon for a minute and give us a chance of hitting back  and we hit back pretty hard too that time for we were cold and vicious and savage and i for one felt that i cared no more for the horsemen than if they had been so many sheep on corriemuir  one gets past being afraid or thinking of ones own skin after a while and you just feel that you want to make some one pay for all you have gone through  we took our change out of the lancers that time for they had no breastplates to shield them and we cleared seventy of them out of their saddles at a volley  maybe if we could have seen seventy mothers weeping for their lads we should not have felt so pleased over it but then men are just brutes when they are fighting and have as much thought as two bull pups when theyve got one another by the throttle  then the colonel did a wise stroke for he reckoned that this would stave off the cavalry for five minutes so he wheeled us into line and got us back into a deeper hollow out of reach of the guns before they could open again  this gave us time to breathe and we wanted it too for the regiment had been melting away like an icicle in the sun but bad as it was for us it was a deal worse for some of the others the whole of the dutch belgians were off by this time helterskelter fifteen thousand of them and there were great gaps left in our line through which the french cavalry rode as pleased them best  then the french guns had been too many and too good for ours and our heavy horse had been cut to bits so that things were none too merry with us on the other hand hougoumont a bloodsoaked ruin was still ours and every british regiment was firm though to tell the honest truth as a man is bound to do there were a sprinkling of red coats among the blue ones who made for the rear  but these were lads and stragglers the faint hearts that are found everywhere and i say again that no regiment flinched  it was little we could see of the battle but a man would be blind not to know that all the fields behind us were covered with flying men  but then though we on the right wing knew nothing of it the prussians had begun to show and napoleon had set 20000 of his men to face them which made up for ours that had bolted and left us much as we began  that was all dark to us however and there was a time when the french horsemen had flooded in between us and the rest of the army that we thought we were the only brigade left standing and had set our teeth with the intention of selling our lives as dearly as we could  at that time it was between four and five in the afternoon and we had had nothing to eat the most of us since the night before and were soaked with rain into the bargain  it had drizzled off and on all day but for the last few hours we had not had a thought to spare either upon the weather or our hunger  now we began to look round and tighten our waistbelts and ask who was hit and who was spared  i was glad to see jim with his face all blackened with powder standing on my right rear leaning on his firelock  he saw me looking at him and shouted out to know if i were hurt  all right jim i answered  i fear im here on a wildgoose chase said he gloomily but its not over yet  by god ill have him or hell have me  he had brooded so much on his wrong had poor jim that i really believe that it had turned his head for he had a glare in his eyes as he spoke that was hardly human  he was always a man that took even a little thing to heart and since edie had left him i am sure that he was no longer his own master  it was at this time of the fight that we saw two single fights which they tell me were common enough in the battles of old before men were trained in masses  as we lay in the hollow two horsemen came spurring along the ridge right in front of us riding as hard as hoof could rattle  the first was an english dragoon his face right down on his horses mane with a french cuirassier an old greyheaded fellow thundering behind him on a big black mare  our chaps set up a hooting as they came flying on for it seemed shame to see an englishman run like that but as they swept across our front we saw where the trouble lay  the dragoon had dropped his sword and was unarmed while the other was pressing him so close that he could not get a weapon at last stung maybe by our hooting he made up his mind to chance it his eye fell on a lance beside a dead frenchman so he swerved his horse to let the other pass and hopping off cleverly enough he gripped hold of it  but the other was too tricky for him and was on him like a shot  the dragoon thrust up with the lance but the other turned it and sliced him through the shoulderblade   it was all done in an instant and the frenchman cantering his horse up the brae showing his teeth at us over his shoulder like a snarling dog  that was one to them but we scored one for us presently  they had pushed forward a skirmish line whose fire was towards the batteries on our right and left rather than on us but we sent out two companies of the 95th to keep them in check  it was strange to hear the crackling kind of noise that they made for both sides were using the rifle an officer stood among the french skirmishersa tall lean man with a mantle over his shouldersand as our fellows came forward he ran out midway between the two parties and stood as a fencer would with his sword up and his head back  i can see him now with his lowered eyelids and the kind of sneer that he had upon his face  on this the subaltern of the rifles who was a fine wellgrown lad ran forward and drove full tilt at him with one of the queer crooked swords that the riflemen carry  they came together like two ramsfor each ran for the other and down they tumbled at the shock but the frenchman was below our man broke his sword short off and took the others blade through his left arm  but he was the stronger man and he managed to let the life out of his enemy with the jagged stump of his blade  i thought that the french skirmishers would have shot him down but not a trigger was drawn and he got back to his company with one sword through his arm and half of another in his hand    chapter xiii   the end of the storm  of all the things that seem strange in that battle now that i look back upon it there is nothing that was queerer than the way in which it acted on my comrades for some took it as though it had been their daily meat without question or change and others pattered out prayers from the first gunfire to the last and others again cursed and swore in a way that was creepy to listen to  there was one my own lefthand man mike threadingham who kept telling about his maiden aunt sarah and how she had left the money which had been promised to him to a home for the children of drowned sailors  again and again he told me this story and yet when the battle was over he took his oath that he had never opened his lips all day  as to me i cannot say whether i spoke or not but i know that my mind and my memory were clearer than i can ever remember them and i was thinking all the time about the old folk at home and about cousin edie with her saucy dancing eyes and de lissac with his cats whiskers and all the doings at west inch which had ended by bringing us here on the plains of belgium as a cockshot for two hundred and fifty cannons  during all this time the roaring of those guns had been something dreadful to listen to but now they suddenly died away though it was like the lull in a thunderstorm when one feels that a worse crash is coming hard at the fringe of it  there was still a mighty noise on the distant wing where the prussians were pushing their way onwards but that was two miles away  the other batteries both french and english were silent and the smoke cleared so that the armies could see a little of each other  it was a dreary sight along our ridge for there seemed to be just a few scattered knots of red and the lines of green where the german legion stood while the masses of the french appeared to be as thick as ever though of course we knew that they must have lost many thousands in these attacks  we heard a great cheering and shouting from among them and then suddenly all their batteries opened together with a roar which made the din of the earlier part seem nothing in comparison it might well be twice as loud for every battery was twice as near being moved right up to point blank range with huge masses of horse between and behind them to guard them from attack  when that devils roar burst upon our ears there was not a man down to the drummer boys who did not understand what it meant  it was napoleons last great effort to crush us  there were but two more hours of light and if we could hold our own for those all would be well starved and weary and spent we prayed that we might have strength to load and stab and fire while one of us stood upon his feet  his cannon could do us no great hurt now for we were on our faces and in an instant we could turn into a huddle of bayonets if his horse came down again  but behind the thunder of the guns there rose a sharper shriller noise whirring and rattling the wildest jauntiest most stirring kind of sound  its the pasdecharge cried an officer  they mean business this time  and as he spoke we saw a strange thing  a frenchman dressed as an officer of hussars came galloping towards us on a little bay horse he was screeching vive le roi  vive le roi at the pitch of his lungs which was as much as to say that he was a deserter since we were for the king and they for the emperor  as he passed us he roared out in english the guard is coming  the guard is coming and so vanished away to the rear like a leaf blown before a storm  at the same instant up there rode an aidedecamp with the reddest face that ever i saw upon mortal man  you must stop em or we are done he cried to general adams so that all our company could hear him  how is it going asked the general  two weak squadrons left out of six regiments of heavies said he and began to laugh like a man whose nerves are overstrung  perhaps you would care to join in our advance  pray consider yourself quite one of us said the general bowing and smiling as if he were asking him to a dish of tea  i shall have much pleasure said the other taking off his hat and a moment afterwards our three regiments closed up and the brigade advanced in four lines over the hollow where we had lain in square and out beyond to the point whence we had seen the french army  there was little of it to be seen now only the red belching of the guns flashing quickly out of the cloudbank and the black figuresstooping straining mopping spongingworking like devils and at devilish work but through the cloud that rattle and whirr rose ever louder and louder with a deepmouthed shouting and the stamping of thousands of feet then there came a broad black blurr through the haze which darkened and hardened until we could see that it was a hundred men abreast marching swiftly towards us with high fur hats upon their heads and a gleam of brasswork over their brows and behind that hundred came another hundred and behind that another and on and on coiling and writhing out of the cannonsmoke like a monstrous snake until there seemed to be no end to the mighty column in front ran a spray of skirmishers and behind them the drummers and up they all came together at a kind of tripping step with the officers clustering thickly at the sides and waving their swords and cheering there were a dozen mounted men too at their front all shouting together and one with his hat held aloft upon his swordpoint  i say again that no men upon this earth could have fought more manfully than the french did upon that day  it was wonderful to see them for as they came onwards they got ahead of their own guns so that they had no longer any help from them while they got in front of the two batteries which had been on either side of us all day  every gun had their range to a foot and we saw long red lines scored right down the dark column as it advanced  so near were they and so closely did they march that every shot ploughed through ten files of them and yet they closed up and came on with a swing and dash that was fine to see  their head was turned straight for ourselves while the 95th overlapped them on one side and the 52nd on the other  i shall always think that if we had waited so the guard would have broken us for how could a fourdeep line stand against such a column but at that moment colburne the colonel of the 52nd swung his right flank round so as to bring it on the side of the column which brought the frenchmen to a halt  their front line was forty paces from us at the moment and we had a good look at them  it was funny to me to remember that i had always thought of frenchmen as small men for there was not one of that first company who could not have picked me up as if i had been a child and their great hats made them look taller yet they were hard wizened wiry fellows too with fierce puckered eyes and bristling moustaches old soldiers who had fought and fought week in week out for many a year  and then as i stood with my finger upon the trigger waiting for the word to fire my eye fell full upon the mounted officer with his hat upon his sword and i saw that it was de lissac  i saw it and jim did too  i heard a shout and saw him rush forward madly at the french column and as quick as thought the whole brigade took their cue from him officers and all and flung themselves upon the guard in front while our comrades charged them on the flanks  we had been waiting for the order and they all thought now that it had been given  but you may take my word for it that jim horscroft was the real leader of the brigade when we charged the old guard  god knows what happened during that mad five minutes  i remember putting my musket against a blue coat and pulling the trigger and that the man could not fall because he was so wedged in the crowd but i saw a horrid blotch upon the cloth and a thin curl of smoke from it as if it had taken fire  then i found myself thrown up against two big frenchmen and so squeezed together the three of us that we could not raise a weapon  one of them a fellow with a very large nose got his hand up to my throat and i felt that i was a chicken in his grasp rendezvous coqin rendezvous said he and then suddenly doubled up with a scream for someone had stabbed him in the bowels with a bayonet  there was very little firing after the first sputter but there was the crash of butt against barrel the short cries of stricken men and the roaring of the officers  and then suddenly they began to give groundslowly sullenly step by step but still to give ground ah it was worth all that we had gone through the thrill of that moment when we felt that they were going to break  there was one frenchman before me a sharpfaced darkeyed man who was loading and firing as quietly as if he were at practice dwelling upon his aim and looking round first to try and pick off an officer  i remember that it struck me that to kill so cool a man as that would be a good service and i rushed at him and drove my bayonet into him  he turned as i struck him and fired full into my face and the bullet left a weal across my cheek which will mark me to my dying day  i tripped over him as he fell and two others tumbling over me i was half smothered in the heap  when at last i struggled out and cleared my eyes which were half full of powder i saw that the column had fairly broken and was shredding into groups of men who were either running for their lives or were fighting back to back in a vain attempt to check the brigade which was still sweeping onwards  my face felt as if a redhot iron had been laid across it but i had the use of my limbs so jumping over the litter of dead and mangled men i scampered after my regiment and fell in upon the right flank  old major elliott was there limping along for his horse had been shot but none the worse in himself  he saw me come up and nodded but it was too busy a time for words  the brigade was still advancing but the general rode in front of me with his chin upon his shoulder looking back at the british position  there is no general advance said he but im not going back  the duke of wellington has won a great victory cried the aidedecamp in a solemn voice and then his feelings getting the better of him he added if the damned fool would only push onwhich set us all laughing in the flank company  but now anyone could see that the french army was breaking up the columns and squadrons which had stood so squarely all day were now all ragged at the edges and where there had been thick fringes of skirmishers in front there were now a spray of stragglers in the rear the guard thinned out in front of us as we pushed on and we found twelve guns looking us in the face but we were over them in a moment and i saw our youngest subaltern next to him who had been killed by the lancer scribbling great 71s with a lump of chalk upon them like the schoolboy that he was  it was at that moment that we heard a roar of cheering behind us and saw the whole british army flood over the crest of the ridge and come pouring down upon the remains of their enemies the guns too came bounding and rattling forward and our light cavalryas much as was left of itkept pace with our brigade upon the right  there was no battle after that  the advance went on without a check until our army stood lined upon the very ground which the french had held in the morning  their guns were ours their foot were a rabble spread over the face of the country and their gallant cavalry alone was able to preserve some sort of order and to draw off unbroken from the field  then at last just as the night began to gather our weary and starving men were able to let the prussians take the job over and to pile their arms upon the ground that they had won  that was as much as i saw or can tell you about the battle of waterloo except that i ate a twopound rye loaf for my supper that night with as much salt meat as they would let me have and a good pitcher of red wine until i had to bore a new hole at the end of my belt and then it fitted me as tight as a hoop to a barrel  after that i lay down in the straw where the rest of the company were sprawling and in less than a minute i was in a dead sleep    chapter xiv   the tally of death  day was breaking and the first grey light had just begun to steal through the long thin slits in the walls of our barn when someone shook me hard by the shoulder and up i jumped  i had the thought in my stupid sleepy brain that the cuirassiers were upon us and i gripped hold of a halbert that was leaning against the wall but then as i saw the long lines of sleepers i remembered where i was  but i can tell you that i stared when i saw that it was none other than major elliott that had roused me up  his face was very grave and behind him stood two sergeants with long slips of paper and pencils in their hands  wake up laddie said the major quite in his old easy fashion as if we were back on corriemuir again  yes major i stammered  i want you to come with me  i feel that i owe something to you two lads for it was i that took you from your homes  jim horscroft is missing  i gave a start at that for what with the rush and the hunger and the weariness i had never given a thought to my friend since the time that he had rushed at the french guards with the whole regiment at his heels  i am going out now to take a tally of our losses said the major and if you cared to come with me i should be very glad to have you  so off we set the major the two sergeants and i and oh but it was a dreadful dreadful sightso much so that even now after so many years i had rather say as little of it as possible  it was bad to see in the heat of fight but now in the cold morning with no cheer or drumtap or bugle blare all the glory had gone out of it and it was just one huge butchers shop where poor devils had been ripped and burst and smashed as though we had tried to make a mock of gods image there on the ground one could read every stage of yesterdays fightthe dead footmen that lay in squares and the fringe of dead horsemen that had charged them and above on the slope the dead gunners who lay round their broken piece  the guards column had left a streak right up the field like the trail of a snail and at the head of it the blue coats were lying heaped upon the red ones where that fierce tug had been before they took their backward step  and the very first thing that i saw when i got there was jim himself he was lying on the broad of his back his face turned up towards the sky and all the passion and the trouble seemed to have passed clean away from him so that he looked just like the old jim as i had seen him in his cot a hundred times when we were schoolmates together  i had given a cry of grief at the sight of him but when i came to look upon his face and to see how much happier he looked in death than i could ever have hoped to see him in life it was hard to mourn for him two french bayonets had passed through his chest and he had died in an instant and without pain if one could believe the smile upon his lips  the major and i were raising his head in the hope that some flutter of life might remain when i heard a wellremembered voice at my side and there was de lissac leaning upon his elbow among a litter of dead guardsmen  he had a great blue coat muffled round him and the hat with the high red plume was lying on the ground beside him  he was very pale and had dark blotches under his eyes but otherwise he was as he had ever been with the keen hungry nose the wiry moustache and the closecropped head thinning away to baldness upon the top  his eyelids had always drooped but now one could hardly see the glint of his eyes from beneath them  hola jock he cried  i didnt thought to have seen you here and yet i might have known it too when i saw friend jim  it is you that has brought all this trouble said i  ta ta ta he cried in his old impatient fashion  it is all arranged for us  when i was in spain i learned to believe in fate it is fate which has sent you here this morning  this mans blood lies at your door said i with my hand on poor jims shoulder  and mine on his so we have paid our debts  he flung open his mantle as he spoke and i saw with horror that a great black lump of clotted blood was hanging out of his side  this is my thirteenth and last said he with a smile  they say that thirteen is an unlucky number  could you spare me a drink from your flask  the major had some brandy and water  de lissac supped it up eagerly his eyes brightened and a little fleck of colour came back in each of his haggard cheeks  it was jim did this said he  i heard someone calling my name and there he was with his gun against my tunic  two of my men cut him down just as he fired  well well edie was worth it all  you will be in paris in less than a month jock and you will see her  you will find her at no 11 of the rue miromesnil which is near to the madeleine break it very gently to her jock for you cannot think how she loved me  tell her that all i have are in the two black trunks and that antoine has the keys  you will not forget  i will remember  and madame your mother  i trust that you have left her very well and monsieur too your father  bear them my distinguished regards  even now as death closed in upon him he gave the old bow and wave as he sent his greetings to my mother  surely said i your wound may not be so serious as you think i could bring the surgeon of our regiment to you  my dear jock i have not been giving and taking wounds this fifteen years without knowing when one has come home  but it is as well for i know that all is ended for my little man and i had rather go with my voltigeurs than remain to be an exile and a beggar  besides it is quite certain that the allies would have shot me so i have saved myself from that humiliation  the allies sir said the major with some heat would be guilty of no such barbarous action  but de lissac shook his head with the same sad smile  you do not know major said he  do you suppose that i should have fled to scotland and changed my name if i had not more to fear than my comrades who remained in paris  i was anxious to live for i was sure that my little man would come back  now i had rather die for he will never lead an army again  but i have done things that could not be forgiven  it was i that led the party which took and shot the duc denghien  it was iah mon dieu edie edie ma cherie  he threw out both his hands with all the fingers feeling and quivering in the air  then he let them drop heavily in front of him and his chin fell forward upon his chest  one of our sergeants laid him gently down and the other stretched the big blue mantle over him and so we left those two whom fate had so strangely brought together the scotchman and the frenchman lying silently and peacefully within hands touch of each other upon the bloodsoaked hillside near hougoumont    chapter xv   the end of it  and now i have very nearly come to the end of it all and precious glad i shall be to find myself there for i began this old memory with a light heart thinking that it would give me some work for the long summer evenings but as i went on i wakened a thousand sleeping sorrows and halfforgotten griefs and now my soul is all as raw as the hide of an illsheared sheep  if i come safely out of it i will swear never to set pen to paper again for it is so easy at first like walking into a shelving stream and then before you can look round you are off your feet and down in a hole and can struggle out as best you may  we buried jim and de lissac with four hundred and thirtyone others of the french guards and our own light infantry in a single trench  ah if you could sow a brave man as you sow a seed there should be a fine crop of heroes coming up there some day  then we left that bloody battlefield behind us for ever and with our brigade we marched on over the french border on our way to paris  i had always been brought up during all these years to look upon the french as very evil folk and as we only heard of them in connection with fightings and slaughterings by land and by sea it was natural enough to think that they were vicious by nature and ill to meet with but then after all they had only heard of us in the same fashion and so no doubt they had just the same idea of us  but when we came to go through their country and to see their bonny little steadings and the douce quiet folk at work in the fields and the women knitting by the roadside and the old granny with a big white mutch smacking the baby to teach it manners it was all so homelike that i could not think why it was that we had been hating and fearing these good people for so long but i suppose that in truth it was really the man who was over them that we hated and now that he was gone and his great shadow cleared from the land all was brightness once more  we jogged along happily enough through the loveliest country that ever i set my eyes on until we came to the great city where we thought that maybe there would be a battle for there are so many folk in it that if only one in twenty comes out it would make a fine army  but by that time they had seen that it was a pity to spoil the whole country just for the sake of one man and so they had told him that he must shift for himself in the future  the next we heard was that he had surrendered to the british and that the gates of paris were opened to us which was very good news to me for i could get along very well just on the one battle that i had had  but there were plenty of folk in paris now who loved boney and that was natural when you think of the glory that he had brought them and how he had never asked his army to go where he would not go himself  they had stern enough faces for us i can tell you when we marched in and we of adams brigade were the very first who set foot in the city  we passed over a bridge which they call neuilly which is easier to write than to say and through a fine parkthe bois de boulogne and so into the champs delysees  there we bivouacked and pretty soon the streets were so full of prussians and english that it became more like a camp than a city  the very first time that i could get away i went with rob stewart of my companyfor we were only allowed to go about in couplesto the rue miromesnil  rob waited in the hall and i was shown upstairs and as i put my foot over the mat there was cousin edie just the same as ever staring at me with those wild eyes of hers  for a moment she did not recognise me but when she did she just took three steps forward and sprang at me with her two arms round my neck  oh my dear old jock she cried how fine you look in a red coat  yes i am a soldier now edie said i very stiffly for as i looked at her pretty face i seemed to see behind it that other face which had looked up to the morning sky on the belgium battlefield  fancy that she cried  what are you then jock  a general a captain  no i am a private  what  not one of the common people who carry guns  yes i carry a gun  oh that is not nearly so interesting said she  and she went back to the sofa from which she had risen  it was a wonderful room all silk and velvet and shiny things and i felt inclined to go back to give my boots another rub  as edie sat down again i saw that she was all in black and so i knew that she had heard of de lissacs death  i am glad to see that you know all said i for i am a clumsy hand at breaking things  he said that you were to keep whatever was in the boxes and that antoine had the keys  thank you jock thank you said she  it was like your kindness to bring the message  i heard of it nearly a week ago  i was mad for the timequite mad  i shall wear mourning all my days although you can see what a fright it makes me look  ah i shall never get over it i shall take the veil and die in a convent  if you please madame said a maid looking in the count de beton wishes to see you  my dear jock said edie jumping up this is very important  i am sorry to cut our chat short but i am sure that you will come to see me again will you not when i am less desolate  and would you mind going out by the side door instead of the main one  thank you you dear old jock you were always such a good boy and did exactly what you were told  and that was the last that i was ever to see of cousin edie  she stood in the sunlight with the old challenge in her eyes and flash of her teeth and so i shall always remember her shining and unstable like a drop of quicksilver  as i joined my comrade in the street below i saw a grand carriage and pair at the door and i knew that she had asked me to slip out so that her grand new friends might never know what common people she had been associated with in her childhood  she had never asked for jim nor for my father and mother who had been so kind to her well it was just her way and she could no more help it than a rabbit can help wagging its scut and yet it made me heavyhearted to think of it  two months later i heard that she had married this same count de beton and she died in childbed a year or two later  and as for us our work was done for the great shadow had been cleared away from europe and should no longer be thrown across the breadth of the lands over peaceful farms and little villages darkening the lives which should have been so happy  i came back to corriemuir after i had bought my discharge and there when my father died i took over the sheepfarm and married lucy deane of berwick and have brought up seven children who are all taller than their father and take mighty good care that he shall not forget it  but in the quiet peaceful days that pass now each as like the other as so many scotch tups i can hardly get the young folks to believe that even here we have had our romance when jim and i went awooing and the man with the cats whiskers came up from the sea     the crime of the brigadier   in all the great hosts of france there was only one officer towards whom the english of wellingtons army retained a deep steady and unchangeable hatred  there were plunderers among the french and men of violence gamblers duellists and roues  all these could be forgiven for others of their kidney were to be found among the ranks of the english  but one officer of massenas force had committed a crime which was unspeakable unheard of abominable only to be alluded to with curses late in the evening when a second bottle had loosened the tongues of men  the news of it was carried back to england and country gentlemen who knew little of the details of the war grew crimson with passion when they heard of it and yeomen of the shires raised freckled fists to heaven and swore  and yet who should be the doer of this dreadful deed but our friend the brigadier etienne gerard of the hussars of conflans gayriding plumetossing debonnaire the darling of the ladies and of the six brigades of light cavalry  but the strange part of it is that this gallant gentleman did this hateful thing and made himself the most unpopular man in the peninsula without ever knowing that he had done a crime for which there is hardly a name amid all the resources of our language  he died of old age and never once in that imperturbable selfconfidence which adorned or disfigured his character knew that so many thousand englishmen would gladly have hanged him with their own hands  on the contrary he numbered this adventure among those other exploits which he has given to the world and many a time he chuckled and hugged himself as he narrated it to the eager circle who gathered round him in that humble cafe where between his dinner and his dominoes he would tell amid tears and laughter of that inconceivable napoleonic past when france like an angel of wrath rose up splendid and terrible before a cowering continent  let us listen to him as he tells the story in his own way and from his own point of view  you must know my friends said he that it was towards the end of the year eighteen hundred and ten that i and massena and the others pushed wellington backwards until we had hoped to drive him and his army into the tagus  but when we were still twentyfive miles from lisbon we found that we were betrayed for what had this englishman done but build an enormous line of works and forts at a place called torres vedras so that even we were unable to get through them  they lay across the whole peninsula and our army was so far from home that we did not dare to risk a reverse and we had already learned at busaco that it was no childs play to fight against these people  what could we do then but sit down in front of these lines and blockade them to the best of our power  there we remained for six months amid such anxieties that massena said afterwards that he had not one hair which was not white upon his body  for my own part i did not worry much about our situation but i looked after our horses who were in great need of rest and green fodder  for the rest we drank the wine of the country and passed the time as best we might  there was a lady at santarembut my lips are sealed  it is the part of a gallant man to say nothing though he may indicate that he could say a great deal  one day massena sent for me and i found him in his tent with a great plan pinned upon the table  he looked at me in silence with that single piercing eye of his and i felt by his expression that the matter was serious  he was nervous and ill at ease but my bearing seemed to reassure him  it is good to be in contact with brave men  colonel etienne gerard said he i have always heard that you are a very gallant and enterprising officer  it was not for me to confirm such a report and yet it would be folly to deny it so i clinked my spurs together and saluted  you are also an excellent rider  i admitted it  and the best swordsman in the six brigades of light cavalry  massena was famous for the accuracy of his information  now said he if you will look at this plan you will have no difficulty in understanding what it is that i wish you to do these are the lines of torres vedras  you will perceive that they cover a vast space and you will realize that the english can only hold a position here and there  once through the lines you have twentyfive miles of open country which lie between them and lisbon  it is very important to me to learn how wellingtons troops are distributed throughout that space and it is my wish that you should go and ascertain  his words turned me cold  sir said i it is impossible that a colonel of light cavalry should condescend to act as a spy  he laughed and clapped me on the shoulder  you would not be a hussar if you were not a hothead said he  if you will listen you will understand that i have not asked you to act as a spy  what do you think of that horse  he had conducted me to the opening of his tent and there was a chasseur who led up and down a most admirable creature  he was a dapple grey not very talla little over fifteen hands perhapsbut with the short head and splendid arch of the neck which comes with the arab blood his shoulders and haunches were so muscular and yet his legs so fine that it thrilled me with joy just to gaze upon him  a fine horse or a beautiful woman i cannot look at them unmoved even now when seventy winters have chilled my blood  you can think how it was in the year 10  this said massena is voltigeur the swiftest horse in our army what i desire is that you should start tonight ride round the lines upon the flank make your way across the enemys rear and return upon the other flank bringing me news of his dispositions  you will wear a uniform and will therefore if captured be safe from the death of a spy  it is probable that you will get through the lines unchallenged for the posts are very scattered  once through in daylight you can outride anything which you meet and if you keep off the roads you may escape entirely unnoticed  if you have not reported yourself by tomorrow night i will understand that you are taken and i will offer them colonel petrie in exchange  ah how my heart swelled with pride and joy as i sprang into the saddle and galloped this grand horse up and down to show the marshal the mastery which i had of him  he was magnificentwe were both magnificent for massena clapped his hands and cried out in his delight it was not i but he who said that a gallant beast deserves a gallant rider  then when for the third time with my panache flying and my dolman streaming behind me i thundered past him i saw upon his hard old face that he had no longer any doubt that he had chosen the man for his purpose  i drew my sabre raised the hilt to my lips in salute and galloped on to my own quarters  already the news had spread that i had been chosen for a mission and my little rascals came swarming out of their tents to cheer me  ah it brings the tears to my old eyes when i think how proud they were of their colonel  and i was proud of them also  they deserved a dashing leader  the night promised to be a stormy one which was very much to my liking it was my desire to keep my departure most secret for it was evident that if the english heard that i had been detached from the army they would naturally conclude that something important was about to happen my horse was taken therefore beyond the picket line as if for watering and i followed and mounted him there  i had a map a compass and a paper of instructions from the marshal and with these in the bosom of my tunic and my sabre at my side i set out upon my adventure  a thin rain was falling and there was no moon so you may imagine that it was not very cheerful  but my heart was light at the thought of the honour which had been done me and the glory which awaited me this exploit should be one more in that brilliant series which was to change my sabre into a baton  ah how we dreamed we foolish fellows young and drunk with success  could i have foreseen that night as i rode the chosen man of sixty thousand that i should spend my life planting cabbages on a hundred francs a month  oh my youth my hopes my comrades  but the wheel turns and never stops  forgive me my friends for an old man has his weakness  my route then lay across the face of the high ground of torres vedras then over a streamlet past a farmhouse which had been burned down and was now only a landmark then through a forest of young cork oaks and so to the monastery of san antonio which marked the left of the english position  here i turned south and rode quietly over the downs for it was at this point that massena thought that it would be most easy for me to find my way unobserved through the position  i went very slowly for it was so dark that i could not see my hand in front of me  in such cases i leave my bridle loose and let my horse pick its own way voltigeur went confidently forward and i was very content to sit upon his back and to peer about me avoiding every light  for three hours we advanced in this cautious way until it seemed to me that i must have left all danger behind me  i then pushed on more briskly for i wished to be in the rear of the whole army by daybreak  there are many vineyards in these parts which in winter become open plains and a horseman finds few difficulties in his way  but massena had underrated the cunning of these english for it appears that there was not one line of defence but three and it was the third which was the most formidable through which i was at that instant passing  as i rode elated at my own success a lantern flashed suddenly before me and i saw the glint of polished gunbarrels and the gleam of a red coat  who goes there cried a voicesuch a voice  i swerved to the right and rode like a madman but a dozen squirts of fire came out of the darkness and the bullets whizzed all round my ears  that was no new sound to me my friends though i will not talk like a foolish conscript and say that i have ever liked it  but at least it had never kept me from thinking clearly and so i knew that there was nothing for it but to gallop hard and try my luck elsewhere  i rode round the english picket and then as i heard nothing more of them i concluded rightly that i had at last come through their defences  for five miles i rode south striking a tinder from time to time to look at my pocket compass and then in an instanti feel the pang once more as my memory brings back the momentmy horse without a sob or stagger fell stone dead beneath me  i had not known it but one of the bullets from that infernal picket had passed through his body  the gallant creature had never winced nor weakened but had gone while life was in him  one instant i was secure on the swiftest most graceful horse in massenas army  the next he lay upon his side worth only the price of his hide and i stood there that most helpless most ungainly of creatures a dismounted hussar what could i do with my boots my spurs my trailing sabre  i was far inside the enemys lines  how could i hope to get back again  i am not ashamed to say that i etienne gerard sat upon my dead horse and sank my face in my hands in my despair  already the first streaks were whitening the east  in half an hour it would be light  that i should have won my way past every obstacle and then at this last instant be left at the mercy of my enemies my mission ruined and myself a prisonerwas it not enough to break a soldiers heart  but courage my friends we have these moments of weakness the bravest of us but i have a spirit like a slip of steel for the more you bend it the higher it springs  one spasm of despair and then a brain of ice and a heart of fire  all was not yet lost  i who had come through so many hazards would come through this one also  i rose from my horse and considered what had best be done  and first of all it was certain that i could not get back  long before i could pass the lines it would be broad daylight  i must hide myself for the day and then devote the next night to my escape  i took the saddle holsters and bridle from poor voltigeur and i concealed them among some bushes so that no one finding him could know that he was a french horse  then leaving him lying there i wandered on in search of some place where i might be safe for the day  in every direction i could see camp fires upon the sides of the hills and already figures had begun to move around them  i must hide quickly or i was lost  but where was i to hide  it was a vineyard in which i found myself the poles of the vines still standing but the plants gone  there was no cover there  besides i should want some food and water before another night had come  i hurried wildly onwards through the waning darkness trusting that chance would be my friend  and i was not disappointed chance is a woman my friends and she has her eye always upon a gallant hussar  well then as i stumbled through the vineyard something loomed in front of me and i came upon a great square house with another long low building upon one side of it  three roads met there and it was easy to see that this was the posada or wineshop  there was no light in the windows and everything was dark and silent but of course i knew that such comfortable quarters were certainly occupied and probably by some one of importance  i have learned however that the nearer the danger may really be the safer the place and so i was by no means inclined to trust myself away from this shelter  the low building was evidently the stable and into this i crept for the door was unlatched  the place was full of bullocks and sheep gathered there no doubt to be out of the clutches of marauders  a ladder led to a loft and up this i climbed and concealed myself very snugly among some bales of hay upon the top  this loft had a small open window and i was able to look down upon the front of the inn and also upon the road  there i crouched and waited to see what would happen  it was soon evident that i had not been mistaken when i had thought that this might be the quarters of some person of importance  shortly after daybreak an english light dragoon arrived with a despatch and from then onwards the place was in a turmoil officers continually riding up and away  always the same name was upon their lips sir stapletonsir stapleton it was hard for me to lie there with a dry moustache and watch the great flagons which were brought out by the landlord to these english officers  but it amused me to look at their freshcoloured cleanshaven careless faces and to wonder what they would think if they knew that so celebrated a person was lying so near to them  and then as i lay and watched i saw a sight which filled me with surprise  it is incredible the insolence of these english  what do you suppose milord wellington had done when he found that massena had blockaded him and that he could not move his army  i might give you many guesses you might say that he had raged that he had despaired that he had brought his troops together and spoken to them about glory and the fatherland before leading them to one last battle  no milord did none of these things  but he sent a fleet ship to england to bring him a number of foxdogs and he with his officers settled himself down to chase the fox  it is true what i tell you  behind the lines of torres vedras these mad englishmen made the foxchase three days in the week we had heard of it in the camp and now i was myself to see that it was true  for along the road which i have described there came these very dogs thirty or forty of them white and brown each with its tail at the same angle like the bayonets of the old guard  my faith but it was a pretty sight  and behind and amidst them there rode three men with peaked caps and red coats whom i understood to be the hunters  after them came many horsemen with uniforms of various kinds stringing along the roads in twos and threes talking together and laughing  they did not seem to be going above a trot and it appeared to me that it must indeed be a slow fox which they hoped to catch  however it was their affair not mine and soon they had all passed my window and were out of sight  i waited and i watched ready for any chance which might offer  presently an officer in a blue uniform not unlike that of our flying artillery came cantering down the roadan elderly stout man he was with grey sidewhiskers  he stopped and began to talk with an orderly officer of dragoons who waited outside the inn and it was then that i learned the advantage of the english which had been taught me  i could hear and understand all that was said  where is the meet said the officer and i thought that he was hungering for his bifstek  but the other answered him that it was near altara so i saw that it was a place of which he spoke  you are late sir george said the orderly  yes i had a courtmartial  has sir stapleton cotton gone  at this moment a window opened and a handsome young man in a very splendid uniform looked out of it  halloa murray said he  these cursed papers keep me but i will be at your heels  very good cotton  i am late already so i will ride on  you might order my groom to bring round my horse said the young general at the window to the orderly below while the other went on down the road  the orderly rode away to some outlying stable and then in a few minutes there came a smart english groom with a cockade in his hat leading by the bridle a horseand oh my friends you have never known the perfection to which a horse can attain until you have seen a firstclass english hunter  he was superb tall broad strong and yet as graceful and agile as a deer  coal black he was in colour and his neck and his shoulder and his quarters and his fetlockshow can i describe him all to you  the sun shone upon him as on polished ebony and he raised his hoofs in a little playful dance so lightly and prettily while he tossed his mane and whinnied with impatience  never have i seen such a mixture of strength and beauty and grace  i had often wondered how the english hussars had managed to ride over the chasseurs of the guards in the affair at astorga but i wondered no longer when i saw the english horses  there was a ring for fastening bridles at the door of the inn and the groom tied the horse there while he entered the house  in an instant i had seen the chance which fate had brought to me  were i in that saddle i should be better off than when i started  even voltigeur could not compare with this magnificent creature  to think is to act with me in one instant i was down the ladder and at the door of the stable the next i was out and the bridle was in my hand  i bounded into the saddle  somebody the master or the man shouted wildly behind me what cared i for his shouts  i touched the horse with my spurs and he bounded forward with such a spring that only a rider like myself could have sat him  i gave him his head and let him goit did not matter to me where so long as we left this inn far behind us  he thundered away across the vineyards and in a very few minutes i had placed miles between myself and my pursuers  they could no longer tell in that wild country in which direction i had gone  i knew that i was safe and so riding to the top of a small hill i drew my pencil and notebook from my pocket and proceeded to make plans of those camps which i could see and to draw the outline of the country  he was a dear creature upon whom i sat but it was not easy to draw upon his back for every now and then his two ears would cock and he would start and quiver with impatience  at first i could not understand this trick of his but soon i observed that he only did it when a peculiar noiseyoy yoy yoycame from somewhere among the oak woods beneath us  and then suddenly this strange cry changed into a most terrible screaming with the frantic blowing of a horn  instantly he went mad this horse  his eyes blazed  his mane bristled  he bounded from the earth and bounded again twisting and turning in a frenzy  my pencil flew one way and my notebook another  and then as i looked down into the valley an extraordinary sight met my eyes  the hunt was streaming down it  the fox i could not see but the dogs were in full cry their noses down their tails up so close together that they might have been one great yellow and white moving carpet  and behind them rode the horsemenmy faith what a sight consider every type which a great army could show some in hunting dress but the most in uniforms blue dragoons red dragoons redtrousered hussars green riflemen artillerymen goldslashed lancers and most of all red red red for the infantry officers ride as hard as the cavalry  such a crowd some well mounted some ill but all flying along as best they might the subaltern as good as the general jostling and pushing spurring and driving with every thought thrown to the winds save that they should have the blood of this absurd fox  truly they are an extraordinary people the english  but i had little time to watch the hunt or to marvel at these islanders for of all these mad creatures the very horse upon which i sat was the maddest  you understand that he was himself a hunter and that the crying of these dogs was to him what the call of a cavalry trumpet in the street yonder would be to me  it thrilled him  it drove him wild again and again he bounded into the air and then seizing the bit between his teeth he plunged down the slope and galloped after the dogs  i swore and tugged and pulled but i was powerless this english general rode his horse with a snaffle only and the beast had a mouth of iron  it was useless to pull him back  one might as well try to keep a grenadier from a wine bottle  i gave it up in despair and settling down in the saddle i prepared for the worst which could befall  what a creature he was  never have i felt such a horse between my knees  his great haunches gathered under him with every stride and he shot forward ever faster and faster stretched like a greyhound while the wind beat in my face and whistled past my ears  i was wearing our undress jacket a uniform simple and dark in itselfthough some figures give distinction to any uniformand i had taken the precaution to remove the long panache from my busby  the result was that amidst the mixture of costumes in the hunt there was no reason why mine should attract attention or why these men whose thoughts were all with the chase should give any heed to me  the idea that a french officer might be riding with them was too absurd to enter their minds  i laughed as i rode for indeed amid all the danger there was something of comic in the situation  i have said that the hunters were very unequally mounted and so at the end of a few miles instead of being one body of men like a charging regiment they were scattered over a considerable space the better riders well up to the dogs and the others trailing away behind  now i was as good a rider as any and my horse was the best of them all and so you can imagine that it was not long before he carried me to the front  and when i saw the dogs streaming over the open and the redcoated huntsman behind them and only seven or eight horsemen between us then it was that the strangest thing of all happened for i too went madi etienne gerard  in a moment it came upon me this spirit of sport this desire to excel this hatred of the fox accursed animal should he then defy us  vile robber his hour was come  ah it is a great feeling this feeling of sport my friends this desire to trample the fox under the hoofs of your horse  i have made the foxchase with the english  i have also as i may tell you some day fought the boxfight with the bustler of bristol  and i say to you that this sport is a wonderful thingfull of interest as well as madness  the farther we went the faster galloped my horse and soon there were but three men as near the dogs as i was  all thought of fear of discovery had vanished  my brain throbbed my blood ran hotonly one thing upon earth seemed worth living for and that was to overtake this infernal fox  i passed one of the horsemena hussar like myself there were only two in front of me now the one in a black coat the other the blue artilleryman whom i had seen at the inn  his grey whiskers streamed in the wind but he rode magnificently  for a mile or more we kept in this order and then as we galloped up a steep slope my lighter weight brought me to the front  i passed them both and when i reached the crown i was riding level with the little hardfaced english huntsman  in front of us were the dogs and then a hundred paces beyond them was a brown wisp of a thing the fox itself stretched to the uttermost  the sight of him fired my blood  aha we have you then assassin i cried and shouted my encouragement to the huntsman  i waved my hand to show him that there was one upon whom he could rely  and now there were only the dogs between me and my prey  these dogs whose duty it is to point out the game were now rather a hindrance than a help to us for it was hard to know how to pass them  the huntsman felt the difficulty as much as i for he rode behind them and could make no progress towards the fox  he was a swift rider but wanting in enterprise  for my part i felt that it would be unworthy of the hussars of conflans if i could not overcome such a difficulty as this was etienne gerard to be stopped by a herd of foxdogs  it was absurd i gave a shout and spurred my horse  hold hard sir  hold hard cried the huntsman  he was uneasy for me this good old man but i reassured him by a wave and a smile  the dogs opened in front of me  one or two may have been hurt but what would you have  the egg must be broken for the omelette i could hear the huntsman shouting his congratulations behind me one more effort and the dogs were all behind me  only the fox was in front  ah the joy and pride of that moment  to know that i had beaten the english at their own sport  here were three hundred all thirsting for the life of this animal and yet it was i who was about to take it i thought of my comrades of the light cavalry brigade of my mother of the emperor of france  i had brought honour to each and all every instant brought me nearer to the fox  the moment for action had arrived so i unsheathed my sabre  i waved it in the air and the brave english all shouted behind me  only then did i understand how difficult is this foxchase for one may cut again and again at the creature and never strike him once  he is small and turns quickly from a blow  at every cut i heard those shouts of encouragement from behind me and they spurred me to yet another effort  and then at last the supreme moment of my triumph arrived in the very act of turning i caught him fair with such another backhanded cut as that with which i killed the aidedecamp of the emperor of russia  he flew into two pieces his head one way and his tail another  i looked back and waved the bloodstained sabre in the air  for the moment i was exaltedsuperb  ah how i should have loved to have waited to have received the congratulations of these generous enemies  there were fifty of them in sight and not one who was not waving his hand and shouting  they are not really such a phlegmatic race the english  a gallant deed in war or in sport will always warm their hearts  as to the old huntsman he was the nearest to me and i could see with my own eyes how overcome he was by what he had seen  he was like a man paralyzedhis mouth open his hand with outspread fingers raised in the air  for a moment my inclination was to return and to embrace him  but already the call of duty was sounding in my ears and these english in spite of all the fraternity which exists among sportsmen would certainly have made me prisoner  there was no hope for my mission now and i had done all that i could do  i could see the lines of massenas camp no very great distance off for by a lucky chance the chase had taken us in that direction  i turned from the dead fox saluted with my sabre and galloped away  but they would not leave me so easily these gallant huntsmen  i was the fox now and the chase swept bravely over the plain  it was only at the moment when i started for the camp that they could have known that i was a frenchman and now the whole swarm of them were at my heels we were within gunshot of our pickets before they would halt and then they stood in knots and would not go away but shouted and waved their hands at me  no i will not think that it was in enmity  rather would i fancy that a glow of admiration filled their breasts and that their one desire was to embrace the stranger who had carried himself so gallantly and well   the slapping sal   it was in the days when frances power was already broken upon the seas and when more of her threedeckers lay rotting in the medway than were to be found in brest harbour  but her frigates and corvettes still scoured the ocean closely followed ever by those of her rival  at the uttermost ends of the earth these dainty vessels with sweet names of girls or of flowers mangled and shattered each other for the honour of the four yards of bunting which flapped from the end of their gaffs  it had blown hard in the night but the wind had dropped with the dawning and now the rising sun tinted the fringe of the stormwrack as it dwindled into the west and glinted on the endless crests of the long green waves   to north and south and west lay a skyline which was unbroken save by the spout of foam when two of the great atlantic seas dashed each other into spray  to the east was a rocky island jutting out into craggy points with a few scattered clumps of palm trees and a pennant of mist streaming out from the bare conical hill which capped it  a heavy surf beat upon the shore and at a safe distance from it the british 32gun frigate leda captain a p johnson raised her black glistening side upon the crest of a wave or swooped down into an emerald valley dipping away to the norard under easy sail  on her snowwhite quarterdeck stood a stiff little brownfaced man who swept the horizon with his glass  mr wharton he cried with a voice like a rusty hinge  a thin knockkneed officer shambled across the poop to him  yes sir  ive opened the sealed orders mr wharton  a glimmer of curiosity shone upon the meagre features of the first lieutenant  the leda had sailed with her consort the dido from antigua the week before and the admirals orders had been contained in a sealed envelope  we were to open them on reaching the deserted island of sombriero lying in north latitude eighteen thirtysix west longitude sixtythree twentyeight  sombriero bore four miles to the northeast from our portbow when the gale cleared mr wharton  the lieutenant bowed stiffly  he and the captain had been bosom friends from childhood  they had gone to school together joined the navy together fought again and again together and married into each others families but so long as their feet were on the poop the iron discipline of the service struck all that was human out of them and left only the superior and the subordinate  captain johnson took from his pocket a blue paper which crackled as he unfolded it     the 32gun frigates leda and dido captains a p johnson    and  james munro are to cruise from the point at which these    instructions are read to the mouth of the caribbean sea in    the hope of encountering the french frigate la gloire 48    which has recently harassed our merchant ships in that quarter    hm frigates are also directed to hunt down the piratical craft    known sometimes as the slapping sal and sometimes as the hairy    hudson which has plundered the british ships as per margin    inflicting barbarities upon their crews  she is a small brig    carrying ten light guns with one twentyfour pound carronade    forward  she was last seen upon the 23rd ult to the northeast    of the island of sombriero     signed james montgomery     rearadmiral    hms colossus antigua  we appear to have lost our consort said captain johnson folding up his instructions and again sweeping the horizon with his glass she drew away after we reefed down  it would be a pity if we met this heavy frenchman without the dido mr wharton  eh  the lieutenant twinkled and smiled  she has eighteenpounders on the main and twelves on the poop sir said the captain  she carries four hundred to our two hundred and thirtyone  captain de milon is the smartest man in the french service oh bobby boy id give my hopes of my flag to rub my side up against her  he turned on his heel ashamed of his momentary lapse mr wharton said he looking back sternly over his shoulder get those square sails shaken out and bear away a point more to the west  a brig on the portbow came a voice from the forecastle  a brig on the portbow said the lieutenant  the captain sprang upon the bulwarks and held on by the mizzenshrouds a strange little figure with flying skirts and puckered eyes  the lean lieutenant craned his neck and whispered to smeaton the second while officers and men came popping up from below and clustered along the weatherrail shading their eyes with their handsfor the tropical sun was already clear of the palm trees  the strange brig lay at anchor in the throat of a curving estuary and it was already obvious that she could not get out without passing under the guns of the frigate a long rocky point to the north of her held her in  keep her as she goes mr wharton said the captain  hardly worth while our clearing for action mr smeaton but the men can stand by the guns in case she tries to pass us  cast loose the bowchasers and send the smallarm men to the forecastle  a british crew went to its quarters in those days with the quiet serenity of men on their daily routine  in a few minutes without fuss or sound the sailors were knotted round their guns the marines were drawn up and leaning on their muskets and the frigates bowsprit pointed straight for her little victim  is it the slapping sal sir  i have no doubt of it mr wharton  they dont seem to like the look of us sir  theyve cut their cable and are clapping on sail  it was evident that the brig meant struggling for her freedom one little patch of canvas fluttered out above another and her people could be seen working like madmen in the rigging  she made no attempt to pass her antagonist but headed up the estuary  the captain rubbed his hands  shes making for shoal water mr wharton and we shall have to cut her out sir  shes a footy little brig but i should have thought a foreandafter would have been more handy  it was a mutiny sir  ah indeed  yes sir i heard of it at manilla  a bad business sir  captain and two mates murdered   this hudson or hairy hudson as they call him led the mutiny  hes a londoner sir and a cruel villain as ever walked  his next walk will be to execution dock mr wharton   she seems heavily manned  i wish i could take twenty topmen out of her but they would be enough to corrupt the crew of the ark mr wharton  both officers were looking through their glasses at the brig  suddenly the lieutenant showed his teeth in a grin while the captain flushed a deeper red  thats hairy hudson on the afterrail sir  the low impertinent blackguard  hell play some other antics before we are done with him  could you reach him with the long eighteen mr smeaton  another cable length will do it sir  the brig yawed as they spoke and as she came round a spurt of smoke whiffed out from her quarter  it was a pure piece of bravado for the gun could scarce carry halfway  then with a jaunty swing the little ship came into the wind again and shot round a fresh curve in the winding channel  the waters shoaling rapidly sir repeated the second lieutenant  theres six fathoms by the chart  four by the lead sir  when we clear this point we shall see how we lie  ha  i thought as much  lay her to mr wharton  now we have got her at our mercy  the frigate was quite out of sight of the sea now at the head of this riverlike estuary  as she came round the curve the two shores were seen to converge at a point about a mile distant  in the angle as near shore as she could get the brig was lying with her broadside towards her pursuer and a wisp of black cloth streaming from her mizzen the lean lieutenant who had reappeared upon deck with a cutlass strapped to his side and two pistols rammed into his belt peered curiously at the ensign  is it the jolly rodger sir he asked  but the captain was furious  he may hang where his breeches are hanging before i have done with him said he  what boats will you want mr wharton  we should do it with the launch and the jollyboat  take four and make a clean job of it  pipe away the crews at once and ill work her in and help you with the long eighteens  with a rattle of ropes and a creaking of blocks the four boats splashed into the water   their crews clustered thickly into them barefooted sailors stolid marines laughing middies and in the sheets of each the senior officers with their stern schoolmaster faces  the captain his elbows on the binnacle still watched the distant brig   her crew were tricing up the boardingnetting dragging round the starboard guns knocking new portholes for them and making every preparation for a desperate resistance  in the thick of it all a huge man bearded to the eyes with a red nightcap upon his head was straining and stooping and hauling  the captain watched him with a sour smile and then snapping up his glass he turned upon his heel  for an instant he stood staring  call back the boats he cried in his thin creaking voice clear away for action there  cast loose those maindeck guns brace back the yards mr smeaton and stand by to go about when she has weigh enough  round the curve of the estuary was coming a huge vessel  her great yellow bowsprit and whitewinged figurehead were jutting out from the cluster of palm trees while high above them towered three immense masts with the tricolour flag floating superbly from the mizzen  round she came the deepblue water creaming under her fore foot until her long curving black side her line of shining copper beneath and of snowwhite hammocks above and the thick clusters of men who peered over her bulwarks were all in full view  her lower yards were slung her ports triced up and her guns run out all ready for action lying behind one of the promontories of the island the lookout men of the gloire upon the shore had seen the cul de sac into which the british frigate was headed so that captain de milon had served the leda as captain johnson had the slapping sal  but the splendid discipline of the british service was at its best in such a crisis  the boats flew back their crews clustered aboard they were swung up at the davits and the fallropes made fast  hammocks were brought up and stowed bulkheads sent down ports and magazines opened the fires put out in the galley and the drums beat to quarters swarms of men set the headsails and brought the frigate round while the guncrews threw off their jackets and shirts tightened their belts and ran out their eighteenpounders peering through the open portholes at the stately french man  the wind was very light  hardly a ripple showed itself upon the clear blue water but the sails blew gently out as the breeze came over the wooded banks  the frenchman had gone about also and both ships were now heading slowly for the sea under foreandaft canvas the gloire a hundred yards in advance she luffed up to cross the ledas bows but the british ship came round also and the two rippled slowly on in such a silence that the ringing of the ramrods as the french marines drove home their charges clanged quite loudly upon the ear  not much searoom mr wharton remarked the captain  i have fought actions in less sir  we must keep our distance and trust to our gunnery   she is very heavily manned and if she got alongside we might find ourselves in trouble  i see the shakoes of soldiers aboard other  two companies of light infantry from martinique  now we have her hardaport and let her have it as we cross her stern  the keen eye of the little commander had seen the surface ripple which told of a passing breeze  he had used it to dart across the big frenchman and to rake her with every gun as he passed  but once past her the leda had to come back into the wind to keep out of shoal water  the manoeuvre brought her on to the starboard side of the frenchman and the trim little frigate seemed to heel right over under the crashing broadside which burst from the gaping ports  a moment later her topmen were swarming aloft to set her topsails and royals and she strove to cross the gloires bows and rake her again  the french captain however brought his frigates head round and the two rode side by side within easy pistolshot pouring broadsides into each other in one of those murderous duels which could they all be recorded would mottle our charts with blood  in that heavy tropical air with so faint a breeze the smoke formed a thick bank round the two vessels from which the topmasts only protruded  neither could see anything of its enemy save the throbs of fire in the darkness and the guns were sponged and trained and fired into a dense wall of vapour  on the poop and the forecastle the marines in two little red lines were pouring in their volleys but neither they nor the seamengunners could see what effect their fire was having   nor indeed could they tell how far they were suffering themselves for standing at a gun one could but hazily see that upon the right and the left  but above the roar of the cannon came the sharper sound of the piping shot the crashing of riven planks and the occasional heavy thud as spar or block came hurtling on to the deck the lieutenants paced up and down the line of guns while captain johnson fanned the smoke away with his cockedhat and peered eagerly out  this is rare bobby said he as the lieutenant joined him then suddenly restraining himself what have we lost mr wharton  our maintopsail yard and our gaff sir  wheres the flag  gone overboard sir  theyll think weve struck  lash a boats ensign on the starboard arm of the mizzen crossjackyard  yes sir  a roundshot dashed the binnacle to pieces between them  a second knocked two marines into a bloody palpitating mash  for a moment the smoke rose and the english captain saw that his adversarys heavier metal was producing a horrible effect  the leda was a shattered wreck   her deck was strewed with corpses  several of her portholes were knocked into one and one of her eighteenpounder guns had been thrown right back on to her breech and pointed straight up to the sky the thin line of marines still loaded and fired but half the guns were silent and their crews were piled thickly round them  stand by to repel boarders yelled the captain  cutlasses lads cutlasses roared wharton  hold your volley till they touch cried the captain of marines  the huge loom of the frenchman was seen bursting through the smoke thick clusters of boarders hung upon her sides and shrouds  a final broadside leapt from her ports and the mainmast of the leda snapping short off a few feet above the deck spun into the air and crashed down upon the port guns killing ten men and putting the whole battery out of action  an instant later the two ships scraped together and the starboard bower anchor of the gloire caught the mizzenchains of the leda upon the port side  with a yell the black swarm of boarders steadied themselves for a spring  but their feet were never to reach that bloodstained deck  from some where there came a wellaimed whiff of grape and another and another the english marines and seamen waiting with cutlass and musket behind the silent guns saw with amazement the dark masses thinning and shredding away  at the same time the port broadside of the frenchman burst into a roar  clear away the wreck roared the captain   what the devil are they firing at  get the guns clear panted the lieutenant  well do them yet boys  the wreckage was torn and hacked and splintered until first one gun and then another roared into action again  the frenchmans anchor had been cut away and the leda had worked herself free from that fatal hug but now suddenly there was a scurry up the shrouds of the gloire and a hundred englishmen were shouting themselves hoarse theyre running  theyre running  theyre running  and it was true  the frenchman had ceased to fire and was intent only upon clapping on every sail that he could carry  but that shouting hundred could not claim it all as their own  as the smoke cleared it was not difficult to see the reason  the ships had gained the mouth of the estuary during the fight and there about four miles out to sea was the ledas consort bearing down under full sail to the sound of the guns  captain de milon had done his part for one day and presently the gloire was drawing off swiftly to the north while the dido was bowling along at her skirts rattling away with her bowchasers until a headland hid them both from view  but the leda lay sorely stricken with her mainmast gone her bulwarks shattered her mizzentopmast and gaff shot away her sails like a beggars rags and a hundred of her crew dead and wounded  close beside her a mass of wreckage floated upon the waves  it was the sternpost of a mangled vessel and across it in white letters on a black ground was printed the slapping sal  by the lord it was the brig that saved us cried mr wharton hudson brought her into action with the frenchman and was blown out of the water by a broadside  the little captain turned on his heel and paced up and down the deck  already his crew were plugging the shotholes knotting and splicing and mending  when he came back the lieutenant saw a softening of the stern lines about his eyes and mouth  are they all gone  every man  they must have sunk with the wreck  the two officers looked down at the sinister name and at the stump of wreckage which floated in the discoloured water  something black washed to and fro beside a splintered gaff and a tangle of halliards  it was the outrageous ensign and near it a scarlet cap was floating  he was a villain but he was a briton said the captain at last he lived like a dog but by god he died like a man   the end
